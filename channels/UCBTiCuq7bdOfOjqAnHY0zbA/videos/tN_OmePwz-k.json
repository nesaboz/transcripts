you have it in front of you well thank you i'll give it to you just thank you uh maybe it's an introduction i'd like to be a part of your group in the fort we i met tommy when we were doing the beach cleanup where they were doing a beach cleanup back in december and i just said you know gosh i got to get more involved in this so we live over um in bel air beach and um we welcome new members we would love for you yes well i will be there from here on out as much as i can okay would you want to be an official member of the board where you get voted on with by city council or do you just want to pop into meetings as a citizen and help whatever you suggest i'll defer to whatever you want to do so we would love more members yeah we'll take all the help we can get that'd be awesome yeah i'll give you a little bit of background and then we'll get into some of this stuff um my great grandparents actually i had a house here um in indian rocks and then my father grew up out here in the summers here and loved the beaches area so much and so um he was in the normandy invasion and he got some extra money to for surviving and leading combat troops in that and he sent the money home to his father to buy two lots on ballet beach oh my goodness that's outstanding his father said you're crazy i don't think you're going to make it home and you've all went and the lot is the only bacon lot now still on valley beach has never been developed and it's right over there 8.50 so block of another so he sold it many times over and um or sold it and paid for all of our education but it ended up that the residue of that ended up buying a place down here on the 2300 gulf boulevard condominium that mary smith had developed in there and probably know the whole thing was a development for people in tampa and that's why it's a really livable places they're just weekend getaway places so it's just the way it was designed back in those days it was nothing out there so um so i've been living around here since 1970 i was living here some 72 but my my primary job was in washington dc so i'm just over here but when my father died and my brothers didn't want to play so we bought it outright and i don't know a few years back so we're spending a little bit more time doing here that's why i want to get involved in this anyway what brings me here today are about three items that i would like to help you all on and help the council on um it's something i've been deeply involved with for many years and that is the federal beach for nourishment projects um when we first moved into this place down here in velar beach um uh and it started with u.s steel and and how they built down at sand key and then let me say i was co-counsel on safe sand key litigation and so i know a lot about beaches and beach preservation and we went through uh years of litigation with u.s steel to try to save that property down there under a theory of prescriptive easements and i could tell you a lot more about it but we just got outgunned and outspent by the time we went to the florida supreme court but you know they built all those places out they put the sea wall in the in the in the gulf of mexico and they built it as if they were going to build it on the bay and so it just it's called enormous erosion uh up and down the bel air beach because of what they did there and it's been well documented and so by the time the place that we own now in 72 it took a 12-foot lemons gap ladder to get from the beach to the sea wall um and which is hard to picture that yeah i have pictures of it i can show you yeah a big extension ladder we had pictures are huge impacts and so it's taken five federal beach renourishment programs to to bring it to where it is today the last one was 200 2018 and i had worked a lot on that just from the washington side developing the funding for it uh and i've worked on the one and they go in about six year increments and three of them prior to that and then i know full well about the battles over here bellerin shores and i can go into that in far more detail it's a very interesting story and how that issue and that has developed over the years with uh even the current litigation but it was it goes back there's a long history on that and it has to do with why they've never gotten peach renourishment there and so what we're faced with here is an opportunity to be a part of the next beach renourishment program so far the army corps of engineers has dumped about 140 million dollars into this renourishment from sand key from that means from clear water pass to pass a grill um the split on the money is 60 federal 20 state and then 20 counting and then there's a little tiny bit of local municipality money in this thing as i say the next project is due and slated for 2024. to be honest with you we're missing a lot of the deadlines of for getting in the queue again we're so far behind now that we're in significant jeopardy of missing this cycle altogether and if that happens the next shot of it is not until uh 20 30. we won't have any beach by that time i can guarantee you we're having an erosion according to the university of south florida 11 feet a year uh on the beach that is the where the high tide's coming up and now even without hurricanes we have water coming to the sand dunes so it is a critical issue in terms of of the beach preservation out here um there is a number of things that can be done to get us in the queue what is what has happened here i want to dominate this but it's really important is that the army corps of engineers has required easements because it's a public process clearwater and belair have met all of the requirements and they have deeded the easements in perpetuity now when i say perpetuity if you need it in perpetuity you get army corps of engineer sand for perpetuity they'll they'll just keep doing it because once they invest in something they will keep doing it but if you don't do the easements you lose and you won't get any sand and so where we are right now in sand key is we're way behind the curve we're really behind the curve in indian rocks they need they have 106 out of 180 easements that have been granted indian shores is way uh what happened is though yeah i think they just don't you need everyone's approval on it that you don't know you do you do and if they don't prove it then well it's the easements that they're lacking you know that once they get the easements and then it's automatic after that but they need these public access easements which they've done pretty well on but uh they've only done 106 out of 180. so if they get the easements and they're allowed to do it up and down yes but now what is going on i'll just give you some other examples reading from shore they've got 54 out of 75 reddington beaches they've gotten all of theirs done um and so you have to be 100 in each section that's the new ruling that's the interpretation by the army corps of engineers they want to say hey listen if we're going to bring all this heavy equipment in here and do this nine miles of beach on sand key we want to do the whole beach not just do segments of it like we've been doing before leaving our belair shores and things of that sort that's just really hard on the equipment i mean once you get the momentum going on if you're seeing this happen is huge operation we were here for 2018 and the hurricane came through and wiped all the sand down or moved it anyway well there's these huge earth moving machines the the the mother lode dredge which they put about two miles off shore is like a city which is enormous and so it is a big big operation and they just don't want to have to you know figure well let's see we gotta put our surveyor sticks out here and we can't put any sand here and we're gonna do that they don't want to do that anymore so what they've done a requirement for a hundred percent easements for the whole for all of these nine miles from clearwater pass to john's pass yes and uh there are a lot of people who are just digging in their heels and saying no this is an overreach of government and all that listen if you want to live on the beach you it you know it's just an easement i mean you know it's no big deal i mean it's other shores will never agree to it no of course they won't and uh that that they'll they will continue to stay out there but what i'm suggesting here and i won't spend much more time on we can come back to this there's ways to fix this and you can do it soon um i have cobbled this together in a lot of different ways this is my with my craft and work that's what i don't know obviously in washington so i do this stuff all the time and essentially what we need to do what is pinellasen used to do with tommy ellis county environmental protection group which is very very good um what's his name the doctor uh you know you probably work with him dr uh uh bishop john bishop yeah you're a really great guy um is to get with the there's there's 13 baskets of appropriations built in federal government each year this one ends up in the energy and water of appropriations bill that's where the army corps is and so i have done the past three ones with things that a lot of people find reprehensible their earmarks that's the only way we got the money is i had to do an earmark for it now um this this interpretation that the core has right now can be fixed with something a little less than an earmark but it's what they call report language that that goes along with the appropriations bill report language has the what it does is interprets the line items in the budget and you if you get some language in there in the report the committee report usually the bill is maybe 1500 pages and the committee reports about 3 000 pages and so all we need is a sentence in there a sentence a sentence in there to say that is the the conferees agree to the fact that the encore's interpretation of a hundred percent is unreasonable and uh and and we we need to go waive that for the 2024 uh re-nourishment project until we can continue to study the impact of something i can write the language of my heart but the key is you've got a titan in congress right now to pull this off and that's um [Music] congressman chris he's on the appropriations committee he's extraordinary well respected and he's he's absolutely one of the closest friends to nancy pelosi if he wants this you can get it but what it's going to take is some mobilization here of the big c and deep coordination on this so it's uniform we i think we get bishop on board and all of the pinellas county people on board but we've got to do this fairly soon because the markup is well where you got to get this language in is april may if you miss it you miss it for a whole year and then you've lost christ and i don't i don't know if it's running for the seat again but getting nobody gets on the appropriations as a freshman i mean chris did because he was a wonder boy and former governor and they just had this relationship with pelosi but this is very doable can i ask you a question um have you met with the big c recently i've never met one would you be willing to meet with the church okay because i think like it's um now that i have the understanding that it's the whole nine mile from sand key all the way down to john's pass it's not just like the park and record i will do anything to help you but it sounds like we need to maybe see if we can set up a meeting so we can have the same conversation with them to get this sentence in there before april or may yeah and it's going to get some leg work on the marble you're going to have to get to washington and work this and i'll show you how to do it i can you know i've done it many times before and i've done it for um a lot of universities and so but there's a lot of different ways to do this that's not the hard part the hard part is just getting people organized and agreeing that we're going to go for a waiver for the 2024 beach renourishment project okay well kyle can you kind of like step in here because it's a little yeah um over my head i mean i don't know when the next big sea meeting is but how often does it sound like you needed that you know all the beach stays together yes i mean if we had a letter from all of the mayors yeah from clearwater pass to john's past to say yes we support a waiver in the army corps fiscal year 2024 so we're going into 20 they're always at your head so this 22. so we're actually in the 2023 so this would be the 20 foot 24 budget so um but we we really gonna need the all of the mayors to agree just sign a letter what you've done before on all these be reach renourishments i've gotten these letters but i haven't handled the local part before i've just handled the i've worked for congressman young and previous senators and everything like that so i never really got into this level of what it takes on the grassroots level to get this done but it that's essential to get all that letter signed off on and it could be a one-pager and then you gotta go hit the marble and and start working that within the committee find some people that and that can help with all that um but chris has got to be your leader on this i don't think we're gonna the two senators will just give it lip service and we'll they'll they'll handle this once it gets over the sense but it's gonna be a house start um so anyway i don't wanna get all the weeds of all that stuff but we gotta get if we're gonna get renourishment out here we've got to do something soon fast and aggressively and you in a united way are you spoiled vice power i've never spoke to anyone this first time i've spoken to anyone because the vice-american is the representative for the big c for our city so if you could get i'll speak with him to have it requested to be on the agenda yeah actually i did meet with him about this day about just for christmas and he says i don't know anything about this you know let me get this campaign behind me and then we'll get into it i feel well it's coming faster than that um i mean you really got to get this this coordination done i think you really got to shoot for this appropriations bill this year for which is for next year uh to make sure that you're in the queue because they're going to start awarding contracts the army does way in advance matter of fact they could be even in the process of awarding it now their offices are up in jacksonville so it's not easy to get to them and work with them but bishop bishop's really good he knows how to do this we ought to actually get him over here and do a briefing for the for the council on this and a couple of other items anyway i don't want to dwell on that i'll be really going to take up all your time i i want to help you all on this i would like to do it i have a personal interest in it too um and i just it's it's it's essential for the integrity and the maintenance of this very fragile beach out here um the other the number two item on here is something i've been involved with for four or five years with the pinellas county department of environmental protection and the state the florida department of environmental detection and that is to again do what the army corps of engineers want you to do in terms of building dunes and so the they have a very really exciting program the county has of the planning of the seals west of the dunes and it's a laborious process by getting the permit and it though the permitting stage starts in april or so and then you have to get a permit from the florida department of of environmental services or protection they it's very specific but the problem is for whatever reason well i know what the reason but the condominiums out there are so disorganized and what i'm hoping is that maybe we could work with bishop and just say we get a power of attorney from the condos which i'm sure they would do i'll go out and get them to let you all or let the city say okay we're going to do this in mass here and that we're going to get oh then then we've got to put some volunteers together to plant them i i planted last year about 600 and they all been wiped out and subsequently they're not little fronts and storms and everything like that the police have done their job of ruining a lot of them by driving all over them and that's a whole other subject but and i've got a lot of photographs where they've destroyed most of what i've planted because they drive recklessly all over the beaches whenever they want to um and it's really some really they don't care either um they just want to get these big suvs up and down the beach for whatever reason i'm not sure but that that's where a lot of them and then we really need to work with the the county to maybe change the time of the season they want you to plant in august because that's when the rains come but you're in complete conflict all the time with the turtle people the turtle the the turtle you know the turtle the the people that take care of the turtleness you can't come anywhere near those things they you know you're trying to drag a hose over the water and oh you can't do that what would be a better month well that now would be great because there's no turtle nesting right now it is not too cold like no no no no that's not too cold at all but i mean it's just something to be talking about in terms of changing the timing of this and then getting a power of attorney for the city to make the a full application rather than all the property owners they all have to do it individually and that's not efficient at all i mean what's the purpose of this program what are you trying to do to to preserve them the co2 in place [Music] introduce [Music] heard of all the various sea oats and other coastal plants for over 30 years and that's why i have these questions like oh well you're an expert then you know exactly what this is all about no i don't because i hear a lot of layman say things that aren't true and i kind of sit back and listen to it but um there is a lot of information that needs to be it's not just a matter of saying sea oats are good it's a matter of what what you're trying to accomplish you can put a lot of springs out there to try to get enrolled see how it's growing but if you put in the wrong place as you know it's not going to last you can put them in a certain place and the history of their development may be the rolling spot but you want to get them out of the beach so you put them out there and say i've accomplished this well the all of this is done by the florida department of environmental protection they decide where you put them they decide how many you put them they decide exactly the footage the distance between each plant they decide everything all you have to do is say i want to help plant them and you follow their guidelines is that the education program that you have listed on here they teach you like when and where and how they what's in the application it is all laid out page after page of what you have to do by the time you finish the application i mean it's it is an extraordinary detail i mean again all we are citizens do is execute what they ask to do now the great thing about it is they give you the seals for free oh that's great yeah did john bishop tell you why um why they do it during a certain period of the year or is there like an exclamation mark and now well because it rains more in in the summer rains in august which i mean the conflict with the turtles and the turtle folks is profound and uh and then they they will call florida department of uh environmental services and report you and find you and i mean i left a shovel on the beach and they they wanted to find me for leaving this shovel somewhere when the kids left the shovel on the beach the sea turtle the clearwater marine aquarium um sea turtle nest counters and all that have corals with the oak planting because you would imagine they would be yeah i would think they would to be also but they're not complex they just don't want you to get anywhere near those ropes those taped off bearings you don't well that's where they're they tell them where to plant them but you you for example students in the morning you can't do it before they have an inspection of all of the nest up and down the beaches so if you decide if you want to wake up at seven o'clock in the morning and work until nine o'clock you can't do that because they haven't cleared the beach yet so you're you know you're working out there and then 95 years fairly consistent schedule they go out there a little bit yeah but you never know when that happens it's very random in terms of when they do it and it depends on weather and a lot of different things so i mean having done this for four years i i i want to work with them i give them contributions and i'm very supportive of what they're doing but it is just you know they don't want to see any hoses out there they don't want to see any tools out there they don't want to see any people out there they really are antagonistic about people that come anywhere near those nesting sites and i can see why i can see what's going on but i mean it's just just anyway i don't want to dominate this meeting on this but it is a great program in terms of i tell people who worry about their view i said well okay you have a choice you can look at the sand dune or the sand dune can be in your living room uh and it can be i have lived here long enough where i've seen a lot of sand dunes in people's living rooms and it is very true and accurate what these storms will do and if you want to go down that right right then you know maybe your insurance carrier you get a tremendous reduction in your insurance coverage if you've got those dunes out there if you don't have the dunes out there the sky's the limit there you probably can't even get it i don't even know how anybody in bel air shorts gets insurance now because they they they don't have any dunes or anything like that but anyway it's something on there also and then another third thing and then i'll let you all get on with your business um i live in washington d.c and um interesting enough of the early 2000s a lady died and gave about a half a billion dollars to set up a 501 c3 to plant trees all over the city and they had a goal of a 60 canopy by 2032. well that half a billion dollars with all the investments have gone on is over a billion dollars now it's called the casey trust and it's just an idea of idea of setting up a 501 c 3 here maybe you've got it i don't know i'm the first time i've ever been here but where you could take care of these parks and you would have a growing fund so you don't have to go for appropriations to do what you may want to do with and you can really make these special and then if you wanted to do something like the casey foundation has done and put you know plant oak trees up and down the streets and things of that sort where you get big canopies around here you have the means to do it and and then it's just a question of you know the local governance bodies did that anyways it's a thought i'll be happy to and undertake this responsibility because there's some interest in doing it um and i can walk you through all the steps of doing it no that would be great because it was on our agenda for eight months i could show you all of our meeting notes and we did research we talked to other like the garden club used to have one and they dissolved it because it was so much trouble it has to be a separate entity from us and um there was a lot of tracking and legalities that no one here really felt that they could undertake except to maintain it every single year yeah yeah tax returns and you know it's no big deal once you've done it and anybody can do it i mean the point is we can't do it from this no no but you can you can are you personally you're willing to promote it and and suggest it and it's got to work you know it's going to be working hand in glove i think our proposal for 501 c3 was put in front of the city council we wanted our city lawyer to spearhead it but they would not handle it i didn't want to be responsible for every year making that tax deadline doing it correctly understanding it because i'm never going to be 30 minutes and you can do it it's not a big deal for something like this you can actually what they have is a 990 easy form that you just fill out like a postcard and send it in uh these are not big deal 501c3s the the irs just doesn't deal but what you can do is you start you know when people die they'll say okay well i'll leave so much to this i'll leave so much you know it's not going to happen in my lifetime but you know in the next generations like them you're going to have a big pot of money there to do some really cool stuff here um and a lot of beach preservation work a lot of you know canopy work around here a lot of things that you probably dream about doing but you just don't have the funding to do it yeah and we talked about this for months because we would love to you can hire somebody to do it if you don't want to do it just pay them out of the the fund you know they got you know you that i can go through all that you just hire somebody you basically hire an accounting firm um to start off with we have nothing in the fund and if our own city attorney isn't willing to get involved for us to hire an outside attorney that's just not no no i'm not suggesting is a public entity this is what totally private but somewhere there's a grown will swell of support for this notion of doing it in other words we understand that this is important for the long-term beautification and environmental protection of this precious piece of sand out here and uh you know write all that stuff up and um you know you just get some citizens to do it i mean i'll be happy to just undertake it i mean i'm not going to live for 100 years but you know this is not that difficult okay yeah but it's like you're in turning though so it's like you're not and it's a little so a little nervous yeah your understanding of it because you've done it is more than like say just mine you know i'm not going to speak for anybody else but so thousands of precedents for this i mean it's just yeah we researched it for i mean we talked to all the local people that have done it like the garden club or the city of bel air who else did we talk to i can't remember off the top of my head but like we did research and we thought it would be a great idea and we have like we were going to do like different levels of support and put like names on bricks like if you wanted to dedicate it to your loved one that passes yeah i mean we had lots of things that we kind of like tossed around the table but it was just getting like the the paperwork and the like the down and dirty of it done or started listen it boils down to if you want to do it you can do it i mean just don't let all this would you be willing to start that oh absolutely i'll be happy to do it i mean and then the problem is you got to get started on it kind of soon because i want to get into politics but the previous president had so many problems with 501c3s that he abolished the officer that reviews it by moving them to lubbock texas and nobody in the irs wanted to move to lubbock texas so you have nobody in that office right now that can review these applications i'm going through another one right now where they just don't have anybody in the irs that can do it because nobody moved to lubbock texas and so it's been gutted so it it'll take a you know nine months to a year just to get approval on something like this if if you follow the documents it's not hard to do and you just turn it over to the citizens and you've got to have a president you've got to have a it's a two-step process you get the corporation established by the state of florida a lot of it in florida and then you apply for your 501c3 through the irs so it's a two-step process the filing fee for the state of florida is ten dollars uh but you gotta write a pretty good proposal but and it's gotta be public use oriented uh just there's some buzzwords you have to put in there but you know i i can help you sit down where you don't have to hire anybody you do it you just you know write it up because of the sunshine laws we we can't be part of that well i understand get approval from the city council or disapproval but we can't i understand that could be part of the city yeah it's not this would not be really private i know that's what i'm saying it has to be one of our discussing things here just now we were saying well you can do this and you can do that it's no big deal but it is a big deal because of sunshine laws we can't do this we can't do it not a part of the city so the sunshine mall wouldn't apply i can go have lunch with tammy and go hang out and talk to her about other things and open up the business with her in the sunshine mode and apply only anything that business was selling things and goods from here or some business underneath this roof or any that you can't have any discussion with tammy about but the only thing i'm suggesting is that maybe the the the council or someone could say we've looked at this idea we think it's a good idea and we hope somebody in the in the community will take the ball and run with it i mean i mean that's all we have to do yeah exactly i mean i'm just but it has to kind of start somewhere i don't i don't know anybody around here well you know what's great when we were talking about this initially we had no way to find those people who might be interested as a private citizen of valor beach but now that we have the sign we would be able to maybe say you know put something on there like if you're interested no one really i you know like they always have on the beller beach website if you're interested in volunteering for any of the boards please contact city hall but like you know the sign would get people that don't necessarily always go to that website and it might help like promote some interest in people who don't want to get involved in the city politics but as a private entity and a like a non-for-profit that might be in their wheelhouse and they might be more interested and inclined to join something like that so i mean we have that now where we didn't have that when we first started talking about this like last october i mean meaning of 2020. we didn't have any way to contact people yeah to say hey so now we do so it's like you know it's a possibility here's the intersection you're going to be raising private money to put it on public property and so you know kyle's going to have to go and water the trees when you plant them or somebody's gonna have to or you'll allow you're gonna have to get water there somehow another kid you can't go plant stuff without water and so there's got to be some kind of a relationship that you know everybody's on the same page here that but legally you're not this is two entities one on the outside one on the inside but it it's the city's property yeah the group would form yeah and then once it was established would then create an agreement with the city exactly to say hey listen maybe you can't go do it but somebody else has the opportunity to go turn the garden hose on and do it or they want to do other plants they can plant it but it's ultimately up to the city to decide who goes on that property when they go on that property and what they do on that property so some people may say i like to plant you know whatever whatever i'd like to do this or but so it has to be some kind of coordination yeah it would be donated and then we would assume the responsibility exactly and you can have citizens groups that that actually undertake some of these responsibilities but it's the the money is going to the public property right so the cohesion has to be there right yeah yeah you know you can keep the firewalls in it all you want i mean that's a totally private venture but it has to do you get to the point where you know are these trespassers or these people trying to help and you have to get a definition of what that is because if you do it here and you can also do it on the beaches itself for beach preservation and so forth out there so there's a lot of opportunities to do this and there's a tremendous amount of potential money that you can raise doing this uh and you just have to look around the country and see how this is and as you get more and more into sort of green public policy i mean this is a pretty odd thing to be doing right now anyway that's i mean all these are great and we appreciate you coming and bringing them up thank you like to help you in every way i can yeah we appreciate that okay does anybody have any other questions for cliff are we all good [Music] yeah just let me know i've done this so many times like i'd love to have somebody working with me to you know sort of there's some some way of communicating but i think if you make a recommendation to the the council i've got to understand this but he doesn't know he admitted he didn't know anything about it um and he wants to do something but the the urgency is right on top of the selection well we'll focus on your item number one first because it's most time sensitive and see if we can get you on the big c meeting or at least like make some phone calls and then i'll follow up with you i have your phone number yeah is that cool okay perfect okay okay yeah sure [Music] [Applause] yeah okay all right so item number four um discussion of the health and wellness fair final details so in front of you you have three different pieces of paper there's like a one pager with um just basically like what we can hand out or i'm going to put them in the park like board um we're going to hang them on the doors this is an updated one from the what's on the door and what's in the stack out there so if you take a look at it it literally just has our we have 25 people that are committed to it yeah that's the one george i'm talking about we have 25 people committed to it and if you want to take a look at who we have we have bay care we have a dietitian and personal trainer we have our in-house stand-up paddleboard yoga fell our coffee's going to be in the lobby with the welcome table i could go on and read the whole thing but like we have anything from a chiropractor to a dentist to a med spa mental health therapist palms of largo is going to be here the vein institute um physical therapists [Music] this is this is going to be at our welcome table this is going to be what we're going to be handing out so if you look on the map this whole big section where the stage is going to be off so we're going to blow it up so if you look at it it's got each of the people each of the providers that are going to be here and it's like their table assignment so i've talked to all of them obviously numerous times i know the size of the table they need if they need electricity if they need to be against a wall because they have a massage table or they have a big screen that they're going to be projecting you know whatever their services on a screen behind them um so if you walk in the door it's you know table one and then we're gonna have at least three entrances one in case someone comes in the back door and then the two you know right out here where we would normally go in for meetings so surfside produce acupuncture the stretch therapist the massage oh that massage and wellness needs to change sorry um telehealth um gold's gym bellar dental living young bay care on and on and on so when they walk in the door um i've told everybody that we're gonna be here at nine o'clock so they have between nine and 9 45 for setup and depending on if they just need to throw on a tablecloth and you know some business cards or if they have a big elaborate setup they need to be here at night so they're ready for the 10 o'clock start um so i just wanted to get your input if you had any questions or any suggestions on the layout this is first kyle it you know i put this together yesterday morning and kyle threw it on here right before the meeting so we were kind of talking about traffic patterns and the doors where people are going to get in and out like i said where people need extra space and where they don't like bay care requests five chairs so like if you look at that second aisle that's why that second aisle is kind of like skewed from the other ones because they literally are going to be doing um like so if you look at bake hair is number nine oh these are off now kyle the numbers are off on this you gotta because you moved the tables oh okay yeah that's true so again this is like first go around so like all this stuff will be cleaned up but if you look at bay care you know they're doing wellness screenings glucose tests diabetes bmi and blood pressure so initially they wanted two chairs now they need five so they need a lot more space and then gold's gym they're going to be doing like the in-body scanner so like they needed some space and electricity so it's just kind of like you know their specialty in what they're doing and what they need and we're just you know i would say this is probably 85 and we might need to make a few more changes um yeah so the little lightning bolts are where there's power in the facility um and the idea is we're gonna once we get this thing finalized we're gonna do a front and back and now the people come to the event so that they have all the information that they need to get around and i'm gonna clean it up so obviously it's easier to read we'll take out this whole dance thing and make it bigger oh looks great what are your thoughts suggestions i think it's great however have you thought about spacing related to covet stuff i mean does that play a role in anything well we're gonna at the welcome table we're gonna give them this handout and we're gonna hand out we're gonna have hand sanitizer we're gonna have a mask so i mean the room is pretty big kyle said we could fit more tables in here so there's gonna be spacing as far as like letting so many people in the room at one time or no i'm just thinking is there a kind of a six was that in your plan at all say let's try to keep these six feet away from each other so we're going to grab people shoulder to shoulder well i mean we'd have to do that with regulating how many people we let in at one time if we want to go that direction i mean i'm just you know it's a wellness and a health fair i don't think we should we don't want it to be a contagion here right i understand that i think it looks great but i was wondering if do you know what the spacing is between these tables um you're looking at it's between you're like like five feet about between the tables and the tables are eight feet long mostly yeah so that's yeah 12 feet i mean we can't we're not going to regulate mass um or we're going to have them available so like if they you know if you want to wear a mask hand sanitizer yeah we're going to pass them out at the welcome table okay i'm sure that the vendor people you know they're going to wear a mask or not depending on how they feel yeah yeah that's the only thing i had we had that thought too like between kyle and i and i literally i had one person ask about covet on this whole sheet and i'm like okay if we have 10 people cancelled because they're feeling a little uncomfortable with it then obviously we would reschedule or do something different with it but like no one was showing any type of hesitancy as long as we do the precautions meaning like you know we will tell people like right now because we can count as we hand out these pamphlets so right now we have x amount of people in the room like you know and they're literally going to go through and out the back so however they want to to circle around that and and the reason why we did this kind of map is like some people may not want to go in and go to 24 tables they might want to go to three um like and then you know they just go do their thing and then go out so we don't know what kind of turnout we're gonna have yeah it's it's just because this is our first one but this is our only event so far that applies to everyone in the city because something on this page would apply to most every household i would think where our other events have been you know pretty you know the halloween parade i mean i guess christmas whatever you know what i'm saying um but we don't know what to expect like so we may not it may not be an issue at all or we may have to like say okay we're limited to x amount of people going in the room and when so many people like exit then we can let the next group in or whatever how do we advertise or promote this okay so uh this sheet is on the website and it literally says on the sign out there health and wellness fair january 22nd 10 to 12 see city website and then they can print this off and see and then the signs that we've done for all of our other events they are already out like so when you're driving i've seen at least two of them like for where i live and then um like we we're putting these in the parks and we'll post too yeah we're posting on best of bellar beach um so we're posting on um next door is clint jones did a post is clint jones going to post yeah and and actually like people on this page are also putting it on their sites but like we need to be a little careful with that because we're not telling people from outside of bella beach that they they can't come but like we obviously as it's been discussed many many times don't have the parking or the ability capacity to like promote this in every city around here so i think it's it's kind of what we've done in the past and then a little bit more one because we have the sign and two because we have vendors that are also posting and i don't know if you have another idea of how we can get this out there but like i think we pretty much checked all the boxes of everything that's in our capability without spending like twelve hundred dollars on a mailer which we're not going to do because what what metric would you think we should have for deciding whether this is successively what metric um i would say okay our average say again just a head count head count i would say and you know what was brought to my attention today which i didn't really think about it because we're not charging these people to you know come and set stand at a table here because i think it is a service to our community like i i'm grateful and thankful that these people are taking their saturday to do that but what didn't come to my mind was like say if someone paid a hundred dollar don't call it an entry fee they're more liable to like not be a no-show like i don't think anybody on here is going to be a no-show but you have it happen at almost every single thing like this someone gets sick someone gets whatever their their babysitter canceled you're always going to have someone that doesn't show now whether charging a fee and saying if you show up you get it back or we're going to charge a fee and we're going to donate it to charity that might be something that we look at if this or you know we whatever metric we use for success we deem it a success and we have one again next year and you know if we have five people that don't show up maybe we do say you know it's for a charity or you get it back whatever but like this year we just decided that like in oldsmar they never charge to have people come in because again it's a bit it's a whole it's they want to be there they want to be there they're promoting their businesses they want to and no one has been able to do anything like this for two years almost every single person on here said we have not been able to um because of covid and that now they're finally opening it up and some of the people coming this is their marketing department this is all they do so it's you know it's um their job like they're not gonna not do their job so i think the metric for success i absolutely is head count because that's my number one thing like if we only get the same 100 people that have come to our last three events be it they're different because you know they may have a dog or they may like jazz or they may you know they may have just been at our christmas thing because they wanted to come to the council meeting for whatever reason i'm hoping this event brings more of the 1250 residents out oh 1600 1600 sorry yeah well we mailed to 12.50 so for whatever reason that number always sticks into my head if you get 100 that's over five percent i mean so yeah so i i don't know i mean i i would think we can try to pick a metric beforehand but i just feel like um being this our first one there's a lot of different levels on whether or not it's successful but head count i definitely think is one of them and the snowbirds are here that means more people can show up [Music] a lot of the tables are doing wrathful they are given raffles raffles there's people that are doing spin games there are people that are like handouts free stuff yeah bella coffee's giving free coffee i don't know i mean there's nothing we're going to do with the email list huh you really want to go raffle i mean honestly like that's so easy to throw together we if we could get permission we could throw together a bellar beach basket with gift or you know beach towels a t-shirt and get raffle tickets that's easy you can we can have it on our welcome to you know certificates and people can raffle for that you know it's just like most the people at the tables doing it like they're collecting probably emails so that's like something that they'll like generate but like people don't like really we don't really do anything with the emails in the city because i'd send the newsletter but like i don't even get the thing like why don't you get it i don't know you got to give laurie your email check with you yeah i mean it's a good idea like maybe we just start small this year and if we get approval from lynn and kyle to like maybe donate two towels and some t-shirts we can put one together and just it's a it's a raffle and kind of like a you know thank you for coming and then there's other raffles that they can also participate in and i'm not gonna ask anyone in that room to donate because they're already donating to their own raffle does that make sense like so if like they're putting together a hundred dollar gift card for something i'm not gonna ask them for another hundred dollar gift card for our raffle basket if that makes sense yeah so i thought if we just you know we could put cute stuff in it that's more beachy oriented if you really feel strongly about a raffle but there are raffles being done and like spinny games like kind of feel like since this is our first time maybe we should hold off on the raffle yeah i i'm you know i'm indifferent either way i know you're a psychopath so we can just for next year we can talk about a raffle if you want to do one at the table um but the other thing we could do is maybe we can get ask people ahead of time to donate to the raffle as to get them here like or not like more is a guarantee to keep them here does that make sense so that's a good idea without charging money it would be more like a contribution from your business whether it be a free visit or whatever and then if they don't show up then we take it out of the wrap i'm kidding but i don't know nicole what's your thoughts on the raffle yeah no i mean it's good as long as we have more time to like okay so scrap it no bell or beach basket for this year just to recapture with our luck well 300 people running in here to get a ticket okay i mean i'm cool with whatever i just need to know so i can add it to the post or not yeah just put um potential like suggested raffle for next year if we have next year whatever what else anything else we use an outsider i make one recommendation if you see all the national headlines in today's papers around the country it is the fact that the federal government is now going to provide 500 million code tests for free in the next few weeks and so as if you had a one pager you know maybe on the belair beach table or something like that to say go on the internet and here is the eight vendors this is how you do it this is how it's all free you know even if you're on health care all this insurance companies can be reimbursed for this if you don't have insurance there there is a way that it will be paid for but most of it's going to be done off the internet and you just order you're going to order as many as you want as often as you want according to the press releases that came out in the newspapers today and they'll come to you in the u.s mail um no that's a good idea that's something else we could have on our welcome table yeah so people can pick that up and you know take it home and pop it in and it's supposed to be just you know a matter of 30 seconds and you get all the supply of tests you need i hope that works like that i don't know there's a big splash in all the newspapers today the president gave a speech in atlanta yesterday okay no that's good and they rolled it out yesterday i'll see that's a that's a very ambitious project it's a very ambitious project okay anything else any other suggestions this was like a because of the sun's shine laws kyle and i were talking about it this morning like i felt it was like so many moving parts and so many phone calls and to have a meeting for every single one of these things would have been difficult so it's just like let's throw the preliminary together and then get suggestions at the meeting because all of this can be you know i mean like if you format wise or but as far as like people that are actually participating in the health and wellness fair you know we have pretty good variety and we have some pretty big names so i was happy with the people that said yes the only person that wouldn't do it is walgreens because they're still not doing them nationally like they have a whole like department that that's all they do so they were the only ones that said next year definitely call us next year and so i was pretty happy about that but you know did you say you're not gonna be here um she could never be at anything on a saturday are you gonna be here george on the 22nd yeah yes okay okay so everybody else yeah which i mean we we need that so it's okay yeah it's just what it is so all right so you guys i mean if you like we're gonna finalize these in the next couple of days if you like maybe have a few more minutes like after the meeting and you want to like if you have any suggestions or anything like that just email kyle because it's you can email him all day long but you can't email me unless you know we have to have yeah yeah because it's gotta be like a documented because this is for a city event so yeah even anything like if you think of another way to advertise um but without spending a boatload of money which we don't want to do we didn't want to spend any money on this event like they're donating their time other than just like basically the use of the building we didn't really need to spend anything so um we weren't going to spend anything on mailers we were hoping between the sign and the website and the postings that we would get the word out and like the other thing i'm gonna do if you guys could do this too is like this one pager like you know text it make some copies give them to your neighbors like if you live in a condo post it like in your little board um just you know tell your friends and family who live around you who may not go on the bellar beach website or you know obviously sometimes when you're driving down the street it took me 10 passes before i saw it because you know what i mean the sign flips over so you know if i think we all do that we can reach more people that way but between posting it and the signs i don't know because i feel like our signs now are kind of they stuck out more before they're kind of getting swallowed up and all the elections the election signs yeah um so i there was a house that went for sale on our block and i i literally just glanced i thought it was an election sign and i did a double take and i was like oh my gosh that house is for sale but i thought it was you know what yeah um it's right behind you that yellow one like kitty crown okay yeah perfect so yeah if you think of anything um or anything that you want to add to our welcome table like we're gonna obviously do it we'll use the banner that we already had made that says community table we'll have our suggestion box out we'll have the map of the room um and then we'll have the cove free kova test from the federal government we know we can have that one pager out and then we're also going to have you know the big the blood donation the blood mobile will be in the parking lot and her paperwork will be on our welcome table because she couldn't stay for the whole time and um so we're just going to have her stuff on the table and then you call them off at the moment or bring a screening truck out of it will bring this screening truck if you wanted to what's my food the comprehensive cancer center here for this area of the the only comprehensive cancer center in the state and they have a mobile unit oh yeah for skinny cancer big one um what do you think about that no i think it's a great idea the only thing it's like we're talking about taking up parking spaces because the big red bus already takes up like six spots and then to have another mobile unit it's you know it would almost be like for next year i would switch out the blood mobile and get that because i tried so hard to get a dermatologist and they have a department that does this and they're still just leaving well this is a roving travia they could declare what a beach all the time it's called mold patrol can they be on the circle where we where we put the ice what we're trying to do is we're when the vendors move their stuff in after they get all set up we're trying to move them around to the bayside park area to keep parking available here and one of the yoga instructors wanted to go out and do like little mini instruction on the sundial i shouldn't be on sunday i'll wear that ice cream oh we had the ice cream shop oh yeah unless they can just come in here and get a table it's worth the phone call anyway muffin has the little staff of the doctors the oncologist the mall patrol i like that yeah i really wanted a dermatologist that just didn't have any luck okay well definitely cancer research center part of the country awesome um and then yeah hand sanitary mask we already talked about oh and then so laura came in here right before the meeting i was going to do inventory nicole brings it up almost every meeting about how like if you know you're a resident and you work nine to five monday through friday city hall isn't open so what do you guys think about having a you know the beller beachwear table out selling stuff that day i mean it's not health and wellness but it's an opportunity because people may be able to get in here on a saturday that couldn't do it during the week so i didn't know what do you think about that nicole yeah because you're always you're always our merchandise girl and do we have do we get anything after the last the christmas thing um no okay so we're just things we need to sell though if we can yeah so can we just do like do we need to do a whole table or can we we can put it on the eight-foot welcome table well yeah or six foot or we're gonna do a six foot walk because like we don't have any volunteers like we can consolidate so like when they come in at least like i can manage it or whatever yeah well we could take turns okay and then um kyle you know we just we need one person to be kind of on the floor to make sure that everything's good there and then like one person or two people at the table um and there's four of us so i think we should be able to do it so yeah you shouldn't be stuck behind that table the whole entire time and we all should have the opportunity to walk through the health fair i mean i need to get a dentist here i mean there's i've got my little list of people that i like want to go and check out like you know what they offer and meet with them because i you know in the four years i've lived here i still don't have those so just down here or what did he say i said i don't have a dentist here i still go to indiana to get my team cleaned so i need a new dentist yes how'd you get doctor quick he is one of jody shirley's tenants right and so is um well i don't think she owns a house in bellaire oh oh maybe she owns this building for his business business yeah she just said tenant so i didn't know i didn't ask he also lives here in bella beach oh yeah i don't know she just said you don't happen to need a dentist and a physical therapist do you i go absolutely i've been calling these people endlessly i'm trying to find that with them he's backed up as far as i know you should be here asking for an appointment will you bring your book with you it was right after coza though they're like we're six months out i'm like that's cool so is my vet it's just the way it is around here dr todd in animal hospital of dunedin so anyway all right so are we again if there's anything else that anybody has i'm more than welcome to talk about it any suggestions it's thursday like if maybe you could get them to kyle by tuesday of next week and then we have time and then we're gonna meet the friday before i have two o'clock on the meeting but kyle leaves like at what 2 30 ah 3 30 3 30. um can anybody meet earlier than two or is two pretty much the i personally again i can george can you meet earlier than two on the 21st yeah i think so nicole one one it's probably the earlier an hour out yeah okay so we'll go home okay thank you we'll make it one o'clock and i'll have patty change it on the notes and that's just to finalize that's fine the tables and all that and the spacing that you're asking about until we get those tables set up like you know obviously we're looking at this diagram so we can work a few things out like on friday so the next one one o'clock here for patty sanderson okay okay is there anything else that anybody wants to talk about right now for the health and wellness fair so tuesday is the cut off if we happen to get one more person well we actually don't have room for anybody okay the only thing that we would have is maybe some pendings if we have no like if someone cancels but if someone calls me the morning of and says i'm sick my kid's sick i don't have i mean i don't know then we get more spacing between tables okay that's fine were you gonna do that last that last minute call through everybody or the list or the follow-up reminder yeah so i did it um i've been doing it the last week and then i'll do it um so like when i talk to them originally and then i called two weeks out and then i'm gonna like call text or email like two days before and literally if they're not returning my calls i'm going to their businesses because i'm like i can't i can't have you not show up you know what i mean not in the mean way i'm just saying because it's like i know people get busy and then they forget or whatever um but honestly i think there's only like three people that hasn't reconfirmed with me and so um good do you have um cleanse eat cell phone yeah i do clint jones yeah awesome perfect i have to like look thorough i'm terrible at saving numbers he's better living yeah i have a number for him on this sheet i just don't know if it's eight one three eight one three four six three four six three six four one two oh so you have the red one do i have the right one yep oh good okay perfect yeah and then he's and he you know he's much better okay perfect it was just like a lot of like exposure and stuff on things i got an old car and he showcased it in this january he used to work out right after me so i saw him a couple times a week and now he's not doing it because he had eye surgery or something so i haven't seen him at all so i'll text him but he's one of the guys hate i still need to touch base with he's a really good guy yeah they're texting and that's the best way to reach you okay perfect um so yeah tuesday if there's any new ideas or if you um about our welcome table or about the layout or about or just any questions that you have lynn suggested the fire department like the day before yesterday and i call them and they're coming so i don't know exactly what they're doing it might be like cpr kind of demonstrations or but they've done things like this before and so that's how lynda women so they were it was good that they came on so they were our last they were number 25. so i count um the bloodmobile even though they're sharing a table with us they are in that number so anyway um [Applause] tuesday i would say what by noon does that give you enough time kyle if there's any new ideas or things that you guys want to do or change or if you have questions okay so um item number five so we back in it was a while ago we did the um number these the pictures okay so you know we we haven't done it in a while and so i would like to maybe schedule another round of surveys of the parks i have our minutes like our recap so i know what everybody did last time so just a couple things like nora these were great that you took pictures but like you know what i mean like i don't remember what that is so i think it would be awesome if we could figure out next time we can maybe change up who does what everybody takes pictures we we figure out a way to get them printed out we don't have to have copies just one copy i think would be okay um to pass around the table and then we we logo or label what it is because like say for example on south park which is by my house i didn't do that one last time but like right on the very corner right before you hit indian rocks which according to when the property may be indian rocks the sea wall is literally crumbled in half and they just put in a new seawall at the house right next to it so a resident came up to me and said you know why can't we fix the sea wall in the park while they're already there doing it and they literally can go like this and fix it because that's where it touches and so like i came in and i went through and like patty has everything so greatly filed and she pulled it right out and blah blah but like she had these pictures but i don't think any of these were south park you know what i mean just like in retrospect exactly where yeah you need to yeah but for next time it was great that you did this yeah but we all need to do it you don't need to take out your own expense and print photos i mean if you can send them and i can put them together and print them on yeah so we can email them and you can print them yeah so like yeah i don't expect anyone to go to walgreens and spend the money and then maybe put like a little you know blurb underneath like where it is like 2nd street um northeast corner or whatever and then we kind of know what we're looking at um you would know but like when i was in here with patty i wasn't sure like what it was um and then just kind of thinking back just anything we can we don't even have to set it up for this meeting but like just think about it and like for our february meeting we can do the assignments of the park and maybe if anybody thinks of anything else that would make it a more productive and you know a way to like follow up so then we can look back and say okay we surveyed on this date these were our pictures these are the things that were corrected by this date or these are the things that are on the schedule so we show progress and we show like what our survey did like or you know why we did it and what got accomplished because we spent the time doing it we need to you know make sure because like we did it once and it was great it was eye-opening i went to a lot of parks that i hadn't been to we took lots of pictures i know a lot of the stuff got done like the morgan park got painted and yeah you know like they definitely did a great job of following up i guess like next time we do this i think as a project maybe we have just a one-pager saying these are our findings these are this is what got done and then we presented to city council so it's like i mean it clearly says like in our ordinances our codes or whatever this is called what our duties are as park and rec um and to say okay well okay well what have you done to fill like number section 3851 you know this is what we did not that i feel like we need to justify our time or our i just think even for our own knowledge and like looking back you know our recap what did we do in 2021 um you know what can we improve upon in 2022 i think you know it's just i never want to create another tracker because in my previous life i was the queen of trackers i was the queen of filling out boxes and like documenting tons of things like this so my sales reps could get their incentives or you know we could prove that we did our assigned jobs or whatever so i just think that like maybe bringing just a little bit more of that into this because we always do a you know how did we do what could we do better if we did the same thing what would we do different we always have that discussion and i know you know nicole does a good job in the minutes of like doing the recaps but like if we just had like a little recap of the year i don't know i'm just making a suggestion we could do whatever but i think it would be good um so for the surveys if we assign them in february and then we take like you know the whole time when we review them in march's meeting like maybe in february maybe kyle can come up with uh like what would be easy for you as a tracker or whatever when we email you the pictures well if you just email me i can label them and so we can present them at the meeting but i i use a corrective action like excel sheet for our safety program so i could just make one for our park corrections and uh and then what it does is you just you know fill in what it is and then who's assigned to it and how it gets done and then it keeps a percentage of how complete you are okay yeah that's great because i know that stuff got done but i don't know exactly what got done and how much and percentage i definitely right and i didn't do that for the last one but some of it might have actually transferred into the safety you know just because it was safety related so i could just do one for our group and okay yeah i just i was trying to think of ways to make more effective use of our time and to make sure that like one we were you know everybody did a good job of like looking and finding different things but again maybe give some thought to this and no it's always good because then you get different sets of eyes what kind of stuff you see yeah and we can change up parks because i still haven't been to all the parks like i've been to i would say 80 of them but i want to say there's probably three that i haven't been to yet so like and maybe take a look look at the list if there's ones like maybe at the far end of where you live that you haven't been to either we try to maybe divvy them out so we all get to see different things than what we you know have done do you have the list of like what part people someone did last i do okay it doesn't say we just write it down and switch the papers and like okay and then we'll divvy up whatever i'm sorry i'm blanking the guy that was here in the beginning like for a shot yeah we can divvy up what he's surveyed oh yeah yeah absolutely different perspective and keys too oh yeah that's right yeah so like we're gonna there's not as many of us so we'll have more parks you know i think i had three last time we'll have more parks each because there's fewer of us but that's okay i mean yeah but anything else that you think of like um that would have helped you or if you had a form i think for me if i had a form to write on i know we had something but it wasn't very helpful and i think i did it so it needs to be better like you know like more detailed or something to make the process easier to lay out or to you know record your findings i guess if your house group is doing such a great job you didn't need to remember it what right right right and they are they are but see i don't remember if second street sea wall or the south park sea wall was completely falling apart like that i think it's way worse than the one wall that we had um that was brought to our attention was the 16th street and the hibiscus right i think he took pictures of high first place and that is um um you know we're looking at that for the engineer to draw the plan and do that with 16th hibiscus and the seawall they're proposing out here at base head park yeah and i had pictures and i had them on my laptop but it was very difficult to show you i mean what nora did was great because she made everybody a set and everybody i mean it was like you know much more effective my pictures on my laptop did no good you know i saw him but like so it's like but you know if we can send them to kyle and he can print them out just on paper and with a recap that would be much better for our meeting actually correction it was 7th street baseball park and 16th is getting done now and then hibiscus is on our radar because we did have the engineer look at hibiscus and thought we had more life left in it but yeah that's how it was yeah and even like in the the candidate forum on monday i don't know if you like stayed till this part but it was brought up about the um you know of course the beach umbrella thing kept getting brought up but the the kayak launch and all that kept coming up which we've talked about that a million times in our meetings and you know again it's like finding the funding and getting it on the rotation and all that good stuff so it's like it'd be kind of good to say you know this is when you know it was brought up and then this is this one it was taken care of kind of thing or this is when it's scheduled to be taken care of because a lot of people if you just say this is where it is on the rotation they're like oh okay yeah because you know you can't do everything at once everybody knows what we do especially with those big cattle projects you can't yeah exactly so just to know it's coming but like he didn't know that it's already been discussed as you know it's as underway as it could be at this time so i guess a way to make sure people know that like we're working on something like that well yeah it might you might see something that is something that needs to be budgeted and it gets us scheduling that in the future for a problem so april's like when we have to do first quarter right like you get up there and say whatever april because that doesn't say if we if we have everything i can take the initiative and like put a board together with like what we have our findings and then you can just let us know like what's already in the works and then we could just present to them be like this is what we worked on so now like what are you guys doing yeah here you go i mean even if we just pick three things like you know this is like our signed duties as the park and rec board even if we just pick three and then it's not all about yeah these events are great you know we only have like one a quarter or whatever but like this is what we're doing with the rest of our time we're doing what's assigned to us as a you know a board and we also cover those things like at the at the meetings which is good so yeah speaking of the events what this is the next proposed event well we talked about the fly me to the moon and doing the um like frank sinatra pizza truck italian ice kind of thing again and like if we do it in the spring i don't know if we can say a month for that i can't remember april or may i think april okay yeah now then you'll take that when's the next time you go in front of council it would be april so we got to do something in between to get an approval well i mean we we kind of touched base on it and like you know if is everybody good with doing that do you guys want to talk about a month or a date um because it's one of those things where like if we're not tied to the date when we have city council vote because it's like okay we book all the moving parts and then we go to city council and they say no you know what i mean and then i have to call them back and try to reschedule or do we try to get a you know it's like who do i book first and not you know um so city council put that in person city council book them first yeah okay just like ballpark i guess if we're gonna do april we'll just say we'll some we'll host it sometime in the month of april and then once we get it nailed down but because that was what held us last time so i feel like if we let them go first then it's open to just booking and then we can all work together because and then we'll just propose the budget whatever that would be okay so and all of that has been done so they've already agreed to our parking our safety like the police the um you know so obviously and kyle has a nice format for the budget it's going to be way easier to just pop in numbers so what i can do is call and get price estimates and then we'll try to do like the band's gonna be similar in pricing um the italian ice people just they showed up and they just sold stuff and hopefully that's what the pizza truck does too they just show up and they sell stuff and then it'll be a bring your own beverage like so people want to bring pop or water or whatever they can bring their own coolers like they did last time that worked out um and so i really could just get some tentative dates of availability and then see and then we could check the wedding and you know yes the whole schedule as far as the room um and so maybe february's meeting should i at like ask patty to book me to get the approval yeah with the numbers the numbers yeah so so we can just say an april event and then we'll do fly me to the moon and then the budget what i can do is i can call and get an estimate for i know we did that last time too estimated cost estimated cost and then we have the um the recaps of what we actually spent so some of this up we might have gone over a little but then something else we went under so we we were pretty right on with our budgets and um [Music] and then we can go from there can you check with laura and see like what the um availability is in april oh yeah i will yeah we won't we'll get that squared away well no i just meant so then i can call it yeah i can call the band and see their availability because actually it is kind of good if like we booked january for april i mean that's enough leeway to hopefully get the pizza truck but the pizza truck that i was looking at they are booked out like so far in advance it's crazy um it's called engine 51 i think and they are all over the place because it's all they do i called uh what is it slice i and they don't even do them anymore because they don't have enough employees they don't have enough people to man the restaurant and the truck so this engine 51 they do fire like burn pizza or coal whatever fire like the wood brick oven yes they do brick oven and this is all they do so they're just booked and booked and booked and booked and so maybe you know we can go find them somewhere and get some pizza and bring it into the next meeting because they were at the largo um fire department um not that long ago so anyway and then another like for this event if there's anything else that you want kyle to put on the budget that you're thinking of like if you know we could maybe do a fun like italian based raffle thing because like a lot of people suggest that we do 50 50 raffles and it would be a fundraiser and i know they're always pushing for us to do a fundraiser um so i mean i don't know now that we have some experience and i see what the crowds are like i i don't think it would be a horrible thing to walk around i know i was suggesting not just a raffle for like a raffle to get emails and names it was more important to create that fund yeah yeah um and 50 50s are always fun people go into that and a lot of these places that are all coming here love to donate something okay again not this time around but next time you don't need businesses really do that okay she doesn't need phone calls all day long she should have gift certificates to like local schools and things like that because they're just raffling them off as a fundraiser or doing a silent auction on them depending on where it's going you know if okay looking for an idea for a raffle you could put one in to buy a tree yeah you could do it if we have the 501 by that point you can dump it in there or went by wilcox today because i knew it was coming over here you know and they have these beautiful the royal ponce and you can get one for 275 dollars and they'll plant it for 150. so exactly these are tropical trees that grow around this area they're rolled upon ceramics and this is a a a jackaronda tree i mean they're very beautiful trees how big are the ones that they plant and how long does it take for them to grow into that in my lifetime i just was over there this morning right here but they've got one that's a 15 footer and it's 275. oh that's awesome okay that's it so you could have a raffle and then shoot the profits or the proceeds to whatever you want to do but you know once you get to you know you're taxing the city's taxes so it's 450 bucks and you get a huge tree and put it in the park i mean i think people would i i'd give you a hundred bucks for it and you can do a silent auction on the plaque underneath it yeah yeah but there's a lot of ways these are these are beautiful trades and they have it over at wilcox okay awesome and then i've got and just i just happen to be getting the pricing on it actually if you do you know the more you do the cheaper the price that orange tree though that dumps a lot of its well after it blooms it they it blooms in march it's only once a year yeah all right what's the name of it it's a royal punch banana yeah and then the purple one there is the jack but you know the floral parts that fall off you know fertilize the the grounds and so it's not that big a deal you just let them fall and decay and stop there did you did you get the card for that one here um the um trailer that was the pizza guy he goes to like the brewery no where would i go i'm not sure oh yeah no i don't have anybody i just did online stuff and um i would think he'd be listed but if not i can try to find out okay yeah we have a couple yeah a couple options um but is there anything else because obviously the the february meeting other than just set up for this we won't meet again until before that request from city council so what i can do is put the budget together and then have kyle or patty like email you guys out a copy and then if you have any suggestions or changes or whatever but if we just follow the same format as the last three things that we've done we'll just fill in what we need it might be a little different but won't be too far off and then we didn't have any issues in any of the other events with any of the things on there so you know was there a couple things that we would do differently with timing or you know all the different things that we talked about yes and so we can correct those things but i don't think any of those things were things that would go on the budget they were just more things for us to either make it run smoother or um whatever and this time around what day of the week we we're going for saturday and we're going for a touch earlier well we'll just have to we just have to see what the sunset is right because we got to get yes and last time we like we started at four and we said later but we couldn't because the sun set but it was so hot at four o'clock but we won't have that problem in april in april yes but we went daylight cause i think the band had a little ish you know we had lights on but still they were it was kind of dark out there for them yeah so it should be bright like lighter longer yeah this year well two we'll also have like the pizza so that would be like kind of like a dinner thing so i yeah i mean i guess it depends on sunset but just saying yeah because i do remember like groups of people leaving to go out for dinner but if there's pizza there if they want pizza then they have an option to eat not just like a drink um but okay so i will call the pizza people first get their dates and availability yeah exactly okay so like april 20th it's 7 57 the sunset 7 57 so basically 8 o'clock it's set you got a little bit of that so we can do it after 4 30 to 7 30. oh yeah four to seven four or 4 30 7 30. do you guys have a preference four to seven or four to four thirty seven thirty or four to seven well yeah if they get there at 4 30 and they don't get their pizza until like five so yeah most people eat between like five and seven normally so that would be like ideal if it ends at 7 30 we don't have to summon actually setting till about eight i think it's enough because they've already took the band but 40 minutes at max like 30. people always come late too so you can count that as well it's half hour we're talking about but if we're [Music] about four to seven no i'm just wrong yeah i don't care you guys will have more in life i'm an early guy with everything so that's also my schedule okay four to seven time four to seven it is and then um yeah so i'll have uh i'll give you guys like two weeks before i have to get up in front of council to like get your you know if you have anything else you want to add on there for you know to kyle and kyle can disseminate out to the rest of us so we don't have to have another meeting in between for 15 minutes i mean if you want to we can but we probably don't need to it turns out that we need to between now and when we have to decide on a meeting i would say between um we're going to meet obviously on the 21st which is next friday so i would say if we had to meet it again it would be on the 26th of january because the city council meeting in february is probably going to be on the 7th so actually it could even be on wednesday the 2nd of february or the 3rd you know somewhere in that first week because the first monday is on the 7th it doesn't fall really in the first week it falls in the second week so yeah that gives us a little more time um the first week of february yeah will you guys be here for the meeting for the beginning of february um this is the only like month that we would need confirmation because i won't be here right um no that's that's the day of the city council meeting so we need to have no if we need to have another meeting to go over details of fly me to the moon yeah before i present it to city council you know if the emails doesn't if that doesn't work with us sharing information if we could meet like maybe the second or the third for you know half an hour are you gone that whole week yeah i'm going to the show what about the week before the 26th or 27th yeah i'll be here for that nora how are you for that week that's only four days after the i know i would suggest we four days after our meeting on the 21st i know but all we're doing that day is setting up tables we're not even meeting we're not i mean we're not doing anything with flying to the moon on that day all we're doing is health and wellness yeah either way i'm good okay well why don't we see if we even need the meeting and then i'll have patty throw out some dates how about that that's good because i have a feeling we won't need it because it's like i said this isn't much different than the things i know last year these events took us so much time and yeah because we didn't know we didn't know we were working out every detail like i don't think it's going to be that time consuming this year okay um but yeah we'll just if we need it then we can kind of figure it out then and nicole is great about like you know she could email her stuff to kyle and if she happens to be out of town we absolutely have to get together to figure something out and and we can always text you and say nicole what's your vote okay all right are we good with that okay so then we'll do that and then um there's a couple like there's probably like four reminders that need to go back out before our next meeting so i'm gonna have to type something up for patty and have her send it out to you guys like with dates like for this please have it by this day for this please have a big mistake if you have something bless you if you don't have anything just if you could please send her an email and say i don't have anything that way she's not waiting for you and then the meeting and then the updates on ideas for the park surveys and then if you have anything for the april event like suggestion and then obviously if you have anything for the health and wellness you can send that to kyle too before that so i'll put everything on the paperwork and then as we um item number six as we already discussed next meeting date and time will be friday january 21st and we moved it from two to one pm and that will also be on the update from patty so there'll be like four or five things just bullet points with dates and times and um reminders i make emotions i second that am i allowed to second it yes okay i second it all in favor aye okay we're adjourned thank you"
