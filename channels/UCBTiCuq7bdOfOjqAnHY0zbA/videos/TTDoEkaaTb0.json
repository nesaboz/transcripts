    "transcript": "good evening everyone it is now 6 p.m the june 23rd special council meeting will now come to a please prize join me in the pledge today hey would you please call the roll council member frank banker council member leslie noterow here councilmember lloyd roberts sierra councilmember jody shirley councilmember mike zabel vice mayor glenn gunn mayor dave gattis and city attorney randy mora president thank you we have two items on the agenda tonight both are related to employing a new city manager let's get started with item number one that is uh the council to review and arrange from the highest to lowest each of the cac top five candidates and any additional candidates selected by council members to begin with do i have a motion motion by frank banker do i have a second second judy shirley all right thank you um i originally wanted to uh have this discussion in a work session that was advised by our city attorney that because of the subject matter it was best called special meeting i will however treat this item as a work session until we have successfully reviewed and ranked the candidates after we have finished we will go to the citizens for comments and then return for final comments from the council afterwards we will vote to finalize the ranking and now let's begin [Music] and before we actually go any deeper into this discussion i'd like to bring up a letter that was sent to us by the chair of the citizen advisory committee okay so uh ron had sent us this letter today it went out to all the council members that was basically asking us to slow down we felt like that we were rushing it and uh and then also made a suggestion that we explored the possibility of hiring a recruiting firm to go through the applications and possibly find other candidates i'm not sure if that's the best direction for the council but because it was brought up by the chair of the citizens advisory committee i uh i wanted to throw it out to the council and if anyone would like to make a motion to table this and then move to do to go this direction i'm open to that otherwise i would say let's continue moving forward i'd like to know that we table this in your response okay well we have we have a promotion for taylor anyone like the second one second seconded by leslie right i guess we need to take a roller coaster on this one randy i want to be clear i heard it's a motion to your list we are tabling uh i think that well we're voting to whether we table or not i just want to make sure this clear this is only rankings because if it fails we cannot move to items i'm not clear go ahead [Music] okay there was a motion to rank basically just look at the seven candidates that we have and might say we made a motion to the table where we stop we hold the entire process so penny because it's a motion to table we can't go any farther until we came a vote council member banker no councilmember notara no council member roberts no [Music] councilmember shirley councilmember sable yes yes yes vice mayor gunn aye today mayor goddess aye the motion to table passes forward at three and um that's all right that's all right okay so we continue all right so uh that being said now we go to a discussion where we we begin going through the seven candidates that were submitted by the cac and the two that were also added by myself and by glenn gunn so the motion was opened by frank banker so sir you have the floor well i believe uh the vice mayor sent us all um a list they'd be categorized by the highest or lowest um i appreciate that i think the first five we should really look at i don't know about another two candidates i didn't hear about that until just now so i wouldn't know who they were but that's where i'm at right now i have a question did you receive the agenda yesterday i did not receive egypt yesterday it was sent electronically also [Applause] anyone else i didn't get no letter today i'm sorry what i didn't get a letter either from the committee that the mayor [Music] my distribution group is the same i use the same group for all emails so i'm not sure why you wouldn't have gotten it did anyone else not receive today's agenda how did you know to be here i know [Music] website that said that means gonna start at 11 p.m okay but you did not receive the agenda no i received it locally and everything like that that was last week okay this went out yesterday and generally with a special meeting it goes out the day before so i'm really not sure everybody else didn't yes and that goes to the same distribution group today i'll tell you what let's take a a five minute recess so you can go to the mailbox and get the agenda what's that i don't have my human okay well okay um since mr banker is not quite prepared yet do we have anyone else that would like to start this conversation vice mayor gunn i'm kind of stymied by this process we cast the citizens advisory data powering down the campaigns but then we gave them a score sheet [Applause] so my point is is that rather than allow these guys to develop a waiting system of their own basically get the directional money and kind of narrow down hours to be done and when i go through and i look at the rankings what i see is a couple things first of all upon the conclusion of the citizens advisory committee with doing their work they checked the tabulation of data for their individual reviews and tabulated those numbers and write working and somebody to get into the city club that was it there was no sandy check of the results what i mean by that is if you compare the numbers on some days between the individual ranking members there you see inconsistencies you see one person rank a 10 and then you see another person ranked as zero and yet there's no follow-on discussion in those areas to find out well what were you thinking or what were you considering to try to resolve the difference and come to a consensus of why they're ranking certain person with certain weights so that's that's one inconsistency here the other inconsistency and shame on us because when the straw man breaking she was flashed before the council there was really no follow-on discussion it goes to my premise that we need to have discussion debate before we come up with things rather than just have something thrown down in front of us because the typical impression is let's move on here it is i'm giving you something let's move forward so when i go back and i look at those score sheets down and i try to attempt to [Music] do what i'm supposed to tonight to record these people there are redundancies in this worksheet there are inconsistencies because you give way to florida experience and then right at the bottom you give the same credits for beach experience or something like that so in other words i i see certainly dominance in here and things are certainly twice double killed i have problems with that there is no consideration in some areas for additional certifications additional licenses additional degrees or different training that is municipal government focused it's just strictly have you ever worked in a assistant manager administrator job or have you been a city administrator or city manager justice there's nothing there's credit for hey you've got a bachelor's degree but there's no consideration of follow-on professional or leadership development so there are inconsistencies there and shortcomings there that i think makes our job very very difficult and i think we need to maybe back up and address some of those issues one of the things that need to be noted here and we've said it before is this hiring process has not reached epic crisis proportion there the last hiring process of lynn reeves took nine months nine months and in some ways there was a benefit because the person who's acting as hero gave us an opportunity to observe that person i had some problems dealing with this thing and i also have problems because when we go through these things we don't have an opportunity to back up and look at all these people in context we're not looking at we just focus strictly on the grade sheet and just like i went through and passed out a spreadsheet rank organizing to help make it easy i've also done another spreadsheet and again i'm not giving any direction on anything all i'm doing is filling in some of the blanks with data to make it easy for people to look at all the candidates at one time and we'll get professional certifications look at the years of experience in city manager jobs look at what state they're in and that sort of thing so i'm going to pass these around and i just like people to kind of look at it and as we deal with some of these things we can uh hopefully make our tasks easier i don't know if i i think that kind of sums up my opinion and based on that opinion i would like to motion once again it would table this process until we have a chance to reconsider how we're going to evaluate a motion to table this grading process until we have the opportunity to consider how we're ranking the individuals and grading them okay we have a motion on the table again is that about is that that one under robert's rules after it fails motions to table emotion can be renewed if it's seconded my advice to you would be from a procedural standpoint that that motion that motion in apologies that motion can be made as new information has been presented conceivably typically a motion to table comes in after there's been a bit more evolution of the discussion so it may be appropriate to if the body is inclined to reconsider that position to do so once each member has had an opportunity to at least preliminarily vocalize where they are and see if that discourse involves the conversation enough to move that needle one member speaking typically you don't renew it at that point and unless there's more exhaustive discussion ultimately it is the call of the providing officers uh since there's no discussion we have to take another quote motioning to table again once what's an emotional table no discussion this time council member banker no councilmember notaro no councilmember roberts no council member shirley yes councilmember zabo yes vice mayor gunn i entertain mayor goddess yes so the motion passes four to three and uh because the first original motion died for his table we can all move forward with a second so do i have a motion to adjourn the question randy the class we just attended i thought i was under the impression that in order for somebody to try to renew promotion that could only be done by somebody who was going to change their vote that was on so we're referencing now we're pulling out of these rules and towards robert's rules more generally what you're talking about is more about emotion for reconsideration of the decision so and this isn't necessarily styled as a motion for reconsideration it's like we have denied your ability to get a variance and now we want to revisit the decision to make a variance the emotional reconsideration is different than just a renewed independent motion to table it's procedural versus a substance in motion i i will admit i am learning uh the technical aspects of this body this elementary procedure is paramount here and has factored in largely um into just the first few meetings i'm having here so i i'm doing my level best to make sure that parliamentary procedure is abided by the spirit of parliamentary procedure which is that the will of the majority is heard and divided by it seems the majority is occurring and that's really the core concern procedure but uh i got a question under while i mentioned procedure your first road is supposed to be cleaned and untamed uh there's not there's not an element of tainted vote in parliamentary procedure what i'm just saying i understand that people it's sort of i understand the point you're making is sort of like you're playing moker playing texas holder and now people have shown you what they've got on the river i understand the notion but uh it wasn't emotion zero discussion and the motion again it fails try again it was a motion a member discussed one person may have been persuaded by it it seems one person was persuaded by the comments made and and the motion succeeded those who comment should be made during the original emotion emotional table doesn't simply have discussion i'm talking about emotions with the agenda i understand so um before we uh and we now we have to have a work session to get back on this and determine what's next we can't discuss that in this session because it's a special council meeting and it has a fixed agenda i had reserved tuesday to be the backup plan in the event that we were not able to wrap this up tonight so i think what's going to happen is we're going to have to have a work session on tuesday my question is is everyone available on tuesday to come back and work on this just because that's the 20th i will be available for that 28th council meeting yes because it's a work session we cannot vote on anything so we can have that discussion but that's all we'll be doing [Music] i understand i would prefer wednesday the 29th through thursday we could do five or six whatever whatever more expensive the council i like to okay at times okay so i'm good with tuesday i'm good with wednesday i'm good with thursday what's the uh how does the council [Music] this is i'm glad we're not cardinals and trying to elect them well it's not easy to get everyone on the same schedule but we need it for them so let's just do a show at hand who can show on tuesday all right we can show on wednesday okay thursday mayor i have an appointment on thursday would of course kyle can't do it would you be okay if we got victor there won't be a vote since it's a work session we can just do it okay great thank you who okay well we will uh we will meet on thursday at six o'clock and we will [Music] continue this conversation and see uh what's next on the plan uh i will remind the council that we did i know that this was it seemed like a hasting process but we all did vote to approve this uh process of elimination of the free survey we gave it to the citizens advisory committee and we voted to allow them to do that and we also said that we would vote to approve the list that they submitted so here's here's where we are and we will talk about it more on thursday so yes sir just two and four ones one is this is a critical decision and i want to go right because the implications of this could last decades no we could this is an ad will position hang on a second please let me speak all right so i think this is this is a critical management decision for this council because the impact of this could last predicted second of all if you want to talk about robert's rules of order my understanding is that a point of order can be made at any point in in the proceedings so if you have a concern the point to make in the timeline to make your point made is by raising and of voice not trying to do a discussion after an outcome comes out that you don't like so that's all my mind maker ryan is exactly mr gun okay you should arrange the point of order of the first legendary item when you brought this to the council's attention for the vote okay this cannot last for decades this is an at-will employment i would advise you to go home and read what admiral means this can be terminating this position to be terminated at any time all right so we're not electing the pope we're not putting the supreme court justice law we're putting the city manager on which we have a qualified guy right now doing i think this is ridiculous this is a waste of time you have all these resumes i hope you read them all right i read a lot of them okay one guy out ran for connor all right the labor board would call him a job jump all right because he jumps from one job to another he only stays in the business sir i'd like to stop this discussion for safety i won't be here the point of order is uh i would like to split some positive information here because the committee i think did a really good job with the one through five business the committee did a good job with the one through five candidates as vice mayor brought out as some of the lower ranked candidates it was a significant delta between the scores but very quickly if you look at the number one candidate that person received all ones and twos that's pretty tight they're number two ranked ones twos and threes the number three ranked uh one threes and fours the number four ranked two three six and seven and the number five ranked three four five and six that's how they were ranked so that's very tight i think vice mayor with respect to the delta between the rankings and the different categories so i think that was that was done well again once it got down further where some of the applications and resumes were a little loose then the scores started to vary a little bit more but the top five candidates were pretty dogged on time sir i've reviewed all of these and i don't want to get into this discussion because i can give you specifics for your redundancies or things overlooked and [Music] and bear in mind that all right we've got we've called this a tentative schedule and i thoroughly expected to get a snack somewhere along the process that does not mean that we can't pick up later a later date and continue moving forward but because there's uh four people here and at least one the chair of the citizens advisory committee uh i think that it's uh that was a wise decision to table this and we need to take this to a work session dig a little deeper and uh get some bullet points and be ready to uh to at least discuss and have this conversation the only question that i have before we take this to the work session uh city manager maura you uh i i'm not seeing it right now you actually suggested that we take this to a special counsel meeting and so since we're not voting on anything we're just trying to discuss our game plan does it still require a special and i wish to clarify that that advice advice as much as it was given your code though i don't have in front of me in this moment my re-election is the distinction between the special meeting and the work session being the ability to take official acts as you were talking about ranking people potentially have wanting some citizen input more citizens here to inform that decision that was going to narrow your field of candidates that could be construed as an official act as i suggested rather than have some later in time debate on the technical aspects of whether that was an official act better to just call it a special meeting and you take away that concern if you are truly talking about brainstorming your process your options in a way in a manner that would be ratified at a later meeting the work session is perfectly work sessions happen all the time my concern for you was if you're moving in the direction of this is officially what we're going to do and we're going to call these two people tomorrow and say they're interviewing better to call that a special meeting and remove any higher concern about the procedural variety that's procedural priority seeks paramount here in my alteration as well thank you very much do we have any other comments yes yes we might say um i definitely appreciate uh councilman gunn's uh chart here uh it does clear up some issues for me i would like to possibly see two things one since we put this in the ad and there's a requirement that we have salary in there i'm sorry that we it was a requirement in the ad that each of the members had to submit a salary number and i would like to see that uh address for them and two i understand councilman gunn may not send it would be possible councilman gunn sent it to patti and then she sent that out council members i just like him electronically i initially wanted to put the celery range in there the problem is everything you see in that matrix comes from the resonance so if there's something that's blank or missing it's because it's not in your resume i wanted to put in those salary requests i think i only saw one with a salary the top five had salaries the two additionals did not but didn't we list the salary range in the ad [Applause] and i don't want to overstep myself i'm brand new here but i was told the mayor said no to that that i couldn't ask the city manager staff to contact those two people and ask for their salary ranges i bring that up because i did a quick web search and one of them was up around 160 000 again it's unofficial you know backing behind it but i i don't want to overstep myself again i'm wearing so um that and my uh my purpose for uh relaying that information was i did not want any potential candidate to be labeled as council member outside of the information that's presented to all of us thank you very much and that's why i did that i had a request if this is a special meeting for the next one is there any reason we can't do it in a more collegial format with the horseshoe it seems a little more collegial like fostering discussion rather than trying to have shutter matches and i think that that'll be fine we had a special council meeting the other night and we were in that forum and it worked so i don't see any reason why not patti you've made a note of that thank you all right do we have any other comments okay well um has to be one of the shortest meetings we've ever had i uh i i'm sorry that it uh we've wasted our time tonight but maybe it's for a good reason and uh with that being said do i have a motion to adjourn sure question made by blaine gunn do i have a second second jody shirley all in favor aye opposed bye frank baker all right this meeting is adjourned"
