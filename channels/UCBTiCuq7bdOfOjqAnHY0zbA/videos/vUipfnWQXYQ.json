Sergeant I appreciate it thank you right now we're on to the code enforcement monthly good evening Steve cloudko for the record um as far as the code enforcement for the month of March we did some different things this time around I did spend one day out on the water with Marine deputy and we actually went throughout the whole city check it out we've had some issues with some docs we did find four violations that we were working on now the other issue we've had is a short-term rental we're having on 13th Street since December up until today we've had tour violations and three of those violations were actually done in the last week those reports are have been filed and will be sent to a city manager to set up for a hearing on that particular home other than that we have done a lot of cleanup with a lot of the residents and one of them particularly on 21st Street we finally got the house cleaned up we're working on a couple more one on 17th and one on on Sixth but the slow process but we're getting them other than that we had a few more complaints as far as construction licensing and no permits which have been addressed and taken care of through the building department and Licensing work Council sure two questions uh they're both on the second page why is the burglary to residents code violation well excitement will follow on after that solicitor yes what had happened was if if there's a call for service I was right down the street from that so I responded to it so I actually handled it it actually turned out to be that solicitor handy now materials out on the street so unfortunately because the wave the call is classified we had been reclassified and then I I met with the individual because we caught them up on Howard and issued him a warrant in as far as no solicitation went in the city limits whatsoever okay thank you other questions or comments he has some students there's an error on your monthly code enforcement report you're showing unpermitted remodel at 112 6th Street I believe you mean 113. please uh okay I didn't catch that which which page is that it's on the first page the bottom uh uh okay we will correct that thank you thank you any other questions or comments have a good evening thank you all right we are up to item four which is the presentation from header on our little league CDA of Andrew test CBA LLC of the fiscal year 2022 Financial overview thank you Mr Mayor thank you all for inviting me to speak to this evening I know you have a lot going on so I'll go quickly I'm going to provide a quick overview of the budget actual for 22. I'm going to discuss some items I'd like you to consider as we start developing the budget for the upcoming year so these are my numbers these are my numbers people um these spreadsheets on here are Pages out of the audit that you received the draft last month um so the first one is the general fund it's the main operating fund of the city and you'll see here that all areas of Revenue were over budget so they were favorable variances and then below that you'll see that all areas of the expenditures were under budget so you had positive results in votes um so the very first line is the ad Forum taxes that's the largest single item of revenue for the city so when you start to consider the budget for 24. I just wanted to point out that historically we've budgeted 96 of the ad alarm taxes that could be collected and the reason for that is that we were expecting that all residents are going to take advantage of the early payment discount so if you can picture on your tax bill like the November payment amount is less and then as you get closer to March it gets up to the full amount so it's a very conservative way to budget um you know we'll you see on here that we were over the budgeted amount and that's because not everybody did take advantage of that early um so on June 1st we'll get the first estimate of the taxable values of your city and then we'll start the process of establishing the military from there um the podium that you've got tonight is the full budget calendar and then my last slide is just a couple of highlighted dates that I'd like you to put on your calendar so we keep on going down the list you'll see the franchise fees and utility taxes that's from Duke Energy sales County Utilities below that is intergovernmental Revenue that's state-derived Revenue that gets passed on to us we've got charges for services that's a big number that's the garbage and refuse from Pinellas County Utilities that that particular number is shown as Revenue at the top and then it gets offset by the amount that we paid to waste management down in the expenditures we've also gotten that charges for services or the community center rentals site plan reviews The Marina payment that gets transferred to the general fund and then code violation fees and as you know the auditor commented during his presentation and then also actually in the note disclosures in the financial statements this year we've got a resident that has a substantial amount in code violations that are owed to the city um just as part of the disability requirements that was a big increase from prior year so we had to include that in the audit report um we don't have an allowance against that amount so there's not a reduction um shown and the amount that we're anticipating being received at the time the audit report was done and even you know through date there's no indication that any amount is going to be forgiven so that whole amount is shown in the accounting records at this point in time and just so you know when that case is settled if the full amount is not received we'll show that that expense at that point in time so I know that's going to have to be on your radar coming up it is a substantial amount if you keep on going down the line below that is fine those are parking tickets licenses and permits are the beach parking passes parking meters registrations we've got interest on investment which was um well over budget that's because of higher interest rates than we have projected and the SBA even this year every month is increasing the interest rate so that's very good um and then lastly miscellaneous they both have bad amount for this year 22 was the insurance payment that we got for the sign that fell down out front so that's a higher number than normal we keep on moving down the list you've got the expenditures and each line item here is a summarization of a lot of accounts within you know a lot of all the Departments think about General government and that number is made out of the city council expenses the clerk finance non-departmental and I.T it all gets summarized into that number there about Public Safety so that's police protection and code enforcement physical environment is Public Works in the trash culture and recreation is the park maintenance and library card reimbursement and then you get down to Capital Appling and so you'll see that we were under budget for that and that's because all the projects that were budgeted weren't started during the year so when this happens we monitor that amount it's kind of like a savings income we're earmarking the money that's left in this fund we're saving it up and then when the expense comes we know that we have accounted for that money in past years um or we abandoned the project that doesn't happen a lot here you guys pretty good at sticking to the clinic um so the largest impact on this one was not making the anticipated transfers to the other funds um so you'll see here that the general fund had this change from the draft to the actual on your paper it says deficiency of revenues under expenditures but it was actually revenues exceeded the expenditure so this as you can see was the draft and that has been fixed but so it was a big year for the general fund um but by the time that fiscal year 23 budget was prepared we had a lot closer estimate of the timing of the big project so we know that although they didn't start in 22 the money will be needed you know in this year 23. so at the very bottom you'll see the end of the year fund balance is over 5.4 million so it's a it's a very healthy amount left in that club do you want to ask questions right now uh Mr Banker um a lot of it is yep um I want to say in excess of thirty thousand dollars for them I thought we were received a children's okay could have been 35. no I mean exactly wouldn't that be a plus that's the money that we got back on it oh what no it wasn't that much in excess as a cost of the new sign no we got reimbursed and then we spent the money on on the other side so we got 35 to get new news well so I can't we can't show the revenue and then cancel out that Revenue because then it doesn't really show the full picture um so we have to show those revenue and then a separate expenditure so it'll be in two different places yeah that's my question I just you know consider where you book is so when we're going forward into the budget process we're going to understand that this is not really a windfall that it's already offset uh second one and this is more personal can you double the font sizes on these things we're trying to make decisions up here most of us really can't read oh okay thanks any questions or comments please okay next we have the capital project fund so the revenue here is intergovernmental revenue and you'll see that there's a big budget amount here that includes our Penny money and then the amount that would have gone to Bel Air Shores for the Gulf Boulevard underground project and that gets diverted to us because we're overseeing the project I say we but it's not me I don't want to begin um misunderstanding there so we had about 930 000 budgeted as reimbursement revenue from that and then that offsets the same amount and expenditures down below um when you see the line item for Capital outlay that's also a big number so there's 930 000 in revenue and then 930 000 in the expenditure again the same concept as what we were discussing um got to show it separately so that project is well underway this year as you know over a million dollars has been spent so far we've gotten back about 966 000 and reimbursements from Pinellas County and then we'll submit for the next reimbursement when phase one is finished so for this year 23 we'll have much higher revenue and much higher expenditures um than you're seeing here in these numbers um the capital outlay on this one it had the audio video upgrades here some boat ramps sea walls um and then in the budgeted amount it's another you know Savings Program we're saving for the roof on this building and the carpet and um some sea walls and street lights and things like that so um things to consider as you're moving forward the projects that you're you want to move forward with um The Debt Service here is The Debt Service on this building the city hall and then the special assessment bonds and then moving further down the page no transfers were needed from the general fund it was a big project where it started we have budgeted for Street we're surfacing street lights brick Bridge work but it didn't need that influx of money yet so the bottom line of this fund is that we actually use about sixty one thousand dollars but there's still over six hundred thousand dollars left in this one any questions before I move on next up is the marina fund so the revenue here is charges for services so it's the slip rentals parking fees um we were under budget a little bit because of um the parking fees were a little bit less than we had expected if you recall after the beach is open when we were in the middle of covid we had a huge amount of parking Revenue city-wide so that's been dropping off a little bit people have to go back to work um and so the new rates the new rentals are in effect this month all the renters have been notified most of the costs in this fund like the very first line says materials and supplies and a lot of what makes up that number is that we budget whatever amount we're projecting as profit in this fund we transfer that to the general fund and that's what makes that the most expensive year um and so we've as long as I've been here we've made that pull the marina fund has been able to make that whole transfer to the general fund so even with that full budgeted transfer being made the marina fund made another ten thousand dollars in profit and then there's still as you can see about 365 000 in this fund any question okay and then here we have the stormwater fund um the storm water assessment Revenue comes to us from Pinellas County Utilities you'll see that we have Personnel Services here um it was the actual expenses were thirty two thousand eighty dollars and fifty cents the Auditors rounded up and that drives my OCD crazy you'll see that it's one dollar under or over um that won't happen again so that's 15 of the Public Works salaries we move over to the storm water fund um and as you move forward with the budgeting process I you know I feel comfortable with that amount again you can discuss it as you get to that point we have contractual services that one was significantly under budget because we had planned on spending over a hundred over 105 000 on the npdes compliant and then the city ended up doing that analysis in-house that was a big project Kyle did a great job um I'm not sure how I was going to be able to say that he's doing a great job in my presentation tonight but here it is um I'm Patty two and Laura and everybody here really I mean honestly it's a great place to work and um I know you don't ever get to hear that from my perspective but it's we're saying I feel very fortunate to work here so next is depreciation um this fund was new in 21 it was the first year so we didn't when we were developing the budget for this year we didn't really have a great idea of what that number should have been but for the budget in 23 we did include depreciation and we have a much better idea of going forward um but when you look at this on the whole you know that number was over budget but then the contractual Services was under so they offset so we're still within the rules um so you've had a lot of discussions about the storm water improvements and that will continue um so I won't go into it but we do have good numbers to develop the budget for the upcoming year and this fund it did come close to sustaining itself it only had a loss of two thousand seven hundred and forty dollars but then it did need 25 000 transferred from the general fund um and then the remaining fine volunteer is 1.7 million but that's not cash that's the infrastructure of that storm water system so you'll be talking about taking on debt for the upcoming improvements to accelerate that plan um again not trying to kill Chris Rose Hunter um any questions no I do have a question what are we negotiating is it is the storm water improvements so we have um like for all of the capital items we have a very detailed listing you know with each item is depreciated by itself and then it rolls up into one big number yeah it could be the the curves the the pipe and the check valves all the components of the system and a lot of the boxes you know it's okay okay well that comes from actual expenses so however much we put into service in any year that gets added to the list and then that total cost gets depreciated over the life of whatever is theoretically whenever we do with all of these projects going forward this next year we all had a large yes yeah you'll see a substantial increase so tonight we just I'm showing revenue and expenditures we're not showing the balance sheet but those the costs of all the big items that are capitalized are on the balance sheet so you'll see a large amount of infrastructure for the sewer and the equipment and the different properties and things and then yes so we'll appreciate that value over time questions or comments now my last slide is what I'd like you to put in your calendars these are the key dates for you guys I did print out a detailed budget schedule um a budget calendar a lot of that is um external parties deadlines that we've set for ourselves but these are the the meetings that we'd like you to be around for the budget Workshop is on June 19th July 17th is when you're gonna need to adopt the military and then the September meetings are the important ones you know to have those public hearings so if you have any questions this is the full schedule and the full schedule talks more about like um like that June 1st deadline the first time the property appraiser sends us the estimated the taxable values and then um you know the the property appraiser certifications those are forms that we fill out and um you know sign online it's an automated process now so I just wanted you to have a full understanding of the whole budget process um and that's it for me tonight if you have any other questions [Music] I just want to say thanks for coming I think this is the first time you guys have appearance since we contracted with you on I really appreciate your time I think it's going to be helpful will you attend any of these budget meetings at all and the reason I'm asking is because you know I see we've got 625 000 plus you know what just maybe some guidance it is a lot of money um and so what I did want to definitely point out tonight like you like for the general fund especially like you did have a big big year um but we need that money now like um so yes I'll be I'll be involved as you'd like me to be um Kyle and I would meet a lot when we discuss things and get down into the details and then you all I appreciate it all right now we are up to item five this is a presentation the Pinellas Suncoast fire and Restaurant Rescue District uh welcome Chief Jeff Pitts thank you mayor and good evening everyone I'm Jeffrey Davidson your fire safe but now Suncoast fire rescue I wanted to give you an update on the fire department and how we are trying to improve the Emergency Services on the beaches specifically to Bel Air Beach um there has been response time compliance challenges to this area for a very long time I was identified by the county in 2009 and to date the same problem exists the county has a response time of seven and a half minute standard and as we meant 90 percent of the time and it's not being met these areas up here are 77 and 87 coverage nobody can meet their response times not put it on some codes not our partners in Clearwater and on our partners in Largo why is that well one of the reasons for response times is the geographical coverage that's needed on the beaches right we are at Barrier Island we have multiple Bridges with limited access we have narrow roads with low speed limits we have severe pedestrian vehicle traffic and every year 10 increase in call volume I say nobody can make those response times last month in March we get 17 responses to this area 16 emergency Clearwater and Largo and 31 of those involved did not meet the response times and that's not acceptable it's not acceptable to me and it should not be acceptable to you another reason for the lacking coverage to this area is the fire station on the beaches average about 2.4 miles apart from each other and Pinellas don't cross Basin and Clearwater stations 5.6 miles apart and with the call volume and the amount of resources that are needed on calls that's simply too far apart so this year every year around February March there's a process where we put in for our ALS first responder needs for the next fiscal year similar to what you're you're starting to do here and I've asked the county to fund us two additional paramedics firefighters per day as well as an ALS Advanced life support transport capable unit for the beaches and then we'll improve those response lines we're looking at a piece of property on the Northern end of Indian Rocks Beach where we're planning to build a fire station and more than likely we would move the fire truck there and that would have three firefighter paramedics on there now this is already paid for it's already paid for by the citizens you already pay into the EMS fund for the county and there's a need for this service and you're just not getting it fighting for that to improve the services I've been doing this for 35 years I know how this goes and what should be provided and it's not being provided so I submitted a letter to the county asking for the enhancement I've left a copy on the back table there along with some contact numbers email addresses of the County Commission because the next step in the process is I'm meeting one-on-one with all the County Commissioners to explain why we need this and they similar to what you do is you decide on what are the priorities for your budget and this is a priority for this budget okay these residents deserve this service they need the service and they pay for this service and they're not getting it from the accounting so I asked for your support if you could could take a copy of my letter read through it my phone number is on there you can contact me with any questions and let our support to the County Commission would really help perhaps some dialogue there and anything any questions that I could answer for you I'm happy to do so achieve are you still leaving business cards back here yes sir thank you yes sir um Chief uh because you weren't after the last U.S advisory meeting I did speak on your behalf and I believe your assistant Chiefs yes sir and the response was not exactly what I expected or um you know I I felt that there would be more sympathetic to uh to what you were asking for and it just seemed like they were trying to put a Band-Aid on on this problem that we have here so I would advise everyone to please reach out to the County Commissioners and uh and give them a little nudge please unfortunately if you're waiting on the EMS advisory of or two to push it Forward I don't think that's going to happen right and uh sometimes just like with Beach nourishment sometimes you kind of have to jump ahead and jump time whenever the lower levels don't respond so keep fighting the good fight and adjust to confirm uh what the plan is is even if you get the extra Personnel they will be stationed in Indian Rocks Beach until you are able to until you're able to build a new station is that correct sort of so we have that lined up the property is three miles from your city borders and once I know that this funding is going to come through uh we'll finalize the property acquisition there but I'll pay temporary housing the very next day on there so we'll be running out of service the minute this gets approved great deal and that's going to bridge the gap right now you said it's about six miles yes sir depending on which map you look 5.6 miles uh between you know Suncoast any rock station and the Clearwater station 44. um and many times these responses require multiple units there's many times that the beaches are empty you know there's that many emergency calls going on at one time and we don't have that many units on the beaches because each fire station only has one unit in the fire station there's only one fire truck or a specialty unit or a rescue truck and that rescue truck would definitely enhance the response signs but also it enhances the service because right now we rely on a private Ambulance Company to do the transports and they said at their last meeting they're down 40 paramedics which means we're waiting for them and waiting for them there's times that we're waiting a very long time where with a transport cable unit our own ambulance right staff with two paramedic firefighters and in situations like that we would be able to take you to the emergency right away we built on scene to a traumatic injury we're not waiting for the ambulance we're going to treat you and get you to the surgeon the emergency room as soon as possible sorry and so what they're saying right now is that the way they're accommodating us is they're providing us with I call it volume service anticipated by themselves well you can't predict what an emergency is going to happen so posting somebody nearby whenever they think an emergency is going to happen is not that's not a acceptable answer and so again I appreciate everything you're doing and I appreciate all right thank you very much thank you okay you may or may not know the next leg Begins the start of uh sea turtle nesting season and last year we had a presentation on Miss Lindsay and uh everyone was uh so happy with the presentation and entertained by it that I invited her to come back again I tried to get her at the first in May but she said for some reason she's too busy so uh welcome back Lindsey and uh so let's let's hear your presentation good evening everybody thank you so much for having me on this evening again my name is Lindsay Flynn I'm the sea turtle and conservation program manager at Clearwater breeding aquarium just up the road here and I am going to be speaking to you tonight about sea turtle nesting here in Pinellas County um and I'm going to start my presentation by asking you some trivia questions and I hope you'll participate with me so how many species of sea turtles are there in the world throughout a number thirty thousand any other guesses 20 20. any other guesses 47 47 thank you for your participation there are seven species of sea turtles in the world yeah all right next question how of these seven species how many of them nest in the state of Florida all of them none of them seven of them three three of them one of them I get up to five of them which is amazing almost all species of sea turtles Nest here in the State of Florida but three of them are more common so the one to your left here that's the largest species of sea turtle it's called a leatherback the middle one is our important species here called the loggerhead sea turtle to talk more about that in a second and the one all the way to your right the right there is called the green sea turtle okay now uh you may or may not know we do have the internal nesting even here in the city of color heat and the official sea turtle nesting season is May 1st through October 31st we primarily get the loggerhead sea turtle testing here so I'm going to talk about a little bit about their nesting process so that process starts with the adult female emerging from the surf zone at night and she's going to crawl up the beach somewhere between typically uh between the high tide line and the primary Doom trying to select unappropriate in essay we actually don't know the criteria that they use to select that Nest site we think it might have something to do with temperature maybe the proximity to the Doom line but we still don't know that that's a more verbal research purposes he once she selects that message she's going to prepare the nestlight by creating something called a body with the shallow depression in the sand and she does that by pushing the surface Band Away with her front floors next she's going to create something called a big chamber or the Egg cavity and she's going to do that by curling her rear flippers like a shovel and she's going to dig a hole in the sand that kind of looks like side on Michael and what's cool about this part of the process is she does that by feeling she can't look behind her and see how she's doing so she feels how that feels and once she can't bring up any more sand she knows it's time to lay her eggs loggerhead sea turtles will deposit somewhere between 80 and 120 eggs per nest and she will lay anywhere from one to eight mess in a season although it's more typical for her to lay four to five nests in a season every two weeks that is a lot of work for her so she does not like a mess every year she typically laziness every two to four years once she's done with that she's simply going to work backwards so she's going to use her rear flippers to cover the eggs with sand is then going to camouflage the sight and the scent of that Nest by sort of casting sand about with her front flippers and it sort of brings a very fluffy mess I once she's done with that she's simply going to turn around and return to the Sea she does not provide any maternal care for her nest she'll come back in about two weeks but only to lay another mess she's not going to check on her otherness while she's up there so that Nest is going to incubate for about two months underneath the sand and then those hatchlings are going to emerge together at night and hopefully make their way directly towards the water we're going to talk about why that may not happen but now that we know that sea turtle nests here in Bel Air Beach why should we care well there's legal reasons to care they are protected under those state and federal law they're protected at the federal level Through The Endangered Species Act and at the state level through the marine turtle protection act there is also ecological reasons so Florida hosts more than 90 percent of all loggerhead nesting activities in North America more importantly oh I should stay here that that black line around the State of Florida is where see loggerhead sea turtle nesting occurs so it occurs nearly around the entire Cocina State and the only reason it doesn't occur in the Big Bend area is because the Big Ben is a Marshland and sea turtles need sandy beaches in order to nest now more interestingly internationally Florida is one of two primary nesting sites for the loggerhead sea turtle in the entire world Oman the country of Oman is the other location if you don't remember where Oman is from your geography class is in the Arabian Peninsula right next to Yemen and Saudi Arabia I think it's really cool that little Florida is a really important nesting site for this sea turtle um but what is sort of scary about that is the country of Oman is seeing decline in loggerhead sea turtle nesting by as much as 79 percent that means arguably Florida is the number one nesting site for the loggerhead sea turtle in the entire planet so that has implications so as the nesting population goes here in the State of Florida so goes the global population so we have a responsibility to protect our loggerhead see her unless to the best of our ability because it can affect their global population other ecological reasons I think this is kind of timely right now because we're talking about Bee Tree Management sea turtles help stabilize the beach so when they lay their nests not all their eggs are going to produce hatchlings some of them just simply aren't fertilized so they're going to end up breaking down eventually and when they do that those eggs are going to release things like nitrogen and phosphorus that can be used by the Dune vegetation to grow in and by doing that that then stabilizes the sand and builds up the dunes so stabilizing the beach of course maintains important messing habitat for sea turtles introverts and seabirds they are an important part of the process there we go there's also economic reasons so visit Saint Pete Clearwater recently released a report that said um tourism brings 10.8 billion dollars to the county um so we want our tourists to come here to spend their money and sea turtles can help you do that so um there was a marketing analysis done recently and during that working analysis American Travelers were asked if they were they want to be more proactive in reducing the impact of their travel on the environment and nearly 40 percent of individuals said yes that is important to me so that means that Travelers want to be conscious of what they're doing and the impact they have in the environment why not let them know that they can have an impact on sea turtle nesting and I'll tell you how they can do it in just a little bit also they found that that Travelers want more authentic less commercial travel experiences uh so they want to go somewhere they feel good about going to so what is the destination doing to set their destination apart from Temple typical commercial experiences what's more authentic than a destination caring for its precious Marine Resources like their sea turtles we can fit all of these criteria um if we just do more to care about our messenger finally one of the so they were asked please think deeply about what motivates you to travel what really fuels your desire to travel right now and one of the tier one motivators was creating memories and experiencing new places and what cooler way to create a memory or experience a new area than to know that where you're staying at will see Turtle investing and to be a part of that experience by you know maybe taking a morning walk and seeing a new crawl or maybe taking a look at those marked sites and calling to see you know when they have a concern maybe they see a hatchling sea turtle and they can be a part of that by reporting it they also found that a tier 2 motivator is going somewhere where interesting things happen and learning something and expanding their perspective we have an opportunity to do that with Ernest and sea turtles I think nesting sea turtles are pretty interesting and I think your tourists would find the same thing have an opportunity to teach them something expand their perspective and go and show them what interesting things happen right here so things that we can talk to them about while they're here is reducing their obstructions and reducing light pollution and sea turtle disorientations so one of the things that they don't tend to think about is that leaving their tents and their toys and things on the beach can negatively impact sea turtles remember they come on the beach at night to lay their mess if they encounter something they're not expecting like that pile of toys you see there they're going to be adverse to that they're probably going to return to the water without my Nest it's called a false crawl now it's possible that our sea turtles can come ashore that same night but within a few nights to lay a successful Nest but if they keep coming ashore they keep encountering these items they will eventually turn to the water and they will release those eggs into the water and those eggs are now no longer viable so we've now reduce the potential number of hatchlings we could have produced had those items not been on the beach and there's plenty of instances unfortunately where sea turtles that come short you can see their crawl track right near those poles there where she came ashore and simply could not locate a proper roast nest because these items were in the wing um sand castles and holes can do the same thing sometimes they can crawl over it like you see here or sometimes they crawl right on and it and if they experience that they can leave without nesting as well something else that can negatively impact sea turtles is artificial lighting so you can hear see here the nighttime image of the State of Florida you can see areas where there's lots of lighting the Miami area Orlando Jacksonville and here in Pinellas County interestingly Pinellas County is the most densely populated county for humans in the state of Florida we like we like to use a lot of light at night for safety security and providing a well-lit place for our tours to go how does that affect our Turtles Turtles well under natural conditions both adults and actually sea turtles use brightness as the guide to find your water and money so normally Moonlight and starlight is called Celestial light is balancing off of the water creating a Bright Horizon and that's contrasting with the darkness of the land so they're able to follow that bright light going towards the water now here in Pinellas County we're well developed we have lots of white artificial light on at night which competes with the celestial light sea turtles will go to whatever light is brightest so that artificial light is brighter they will go towards that and they will find themselves in areas where they should not be pools hot tubs parking lots storm drains in the middle of Gulf Boulevard where they can and they have been run over by cars so the rule of thumb for artificial lighting is if you're standing normally on the beach and you can see the light so too can the turtle so we need to do something about it okay so here's an example of an adult Sea Turtle Crawl track so that crawl track is coming towards you weighing back there is our nesting truck but that is where the nest was late so she spent a lot of time crawling along the beach when she should not have remember we talked about as soon as she's done laying her nest she returns right back towards the water so the fact that she spent all this time falling along the beach tells us that there was some sort of artificial light source that was impeding her ability to get back towards the water and that's a problem because she only has so much energy to lay these nests so she may not come ashore to lay another Nest later because she just runs out of energy and again that's going to impact our overall population over time um I'm going to warn you that the next couple of photos are graphic and I only show you this because this is a consequence of the prevalence of artificial light here in Pinellas County so remember we talked about that sea turtles could find their way to areas where they should not be and that doesn't include the roadway that includes adults and hatchlings we have had adult sea turtles cross Gulf Boulevard after they are done nesting and very nearly get hit by cars this is an instance here where if this email was struck by a vehicle down south you can see that she was carrying eggs and those will no longer be viable so those that have now been removed from the population that can happen very prevalently for hatchlings as well and even if they don't manage to find a roadway they can use precious energy sort of wandering about the beach just trying to find the water they only have so much energy on energy because their goal once they reach the water is to swim to this offshore weak line it's called the sargass and wind line where they rest and feed for their first few years of life they're wandering the beach they no longer have the energy to get out there so they're very likely to predict be predated by birds and fish along the way um while they're wandering the beach they're also susceptible to predation by Coyotes we've seen them out on the beach coyotes raccoons bird species they can be predated by all of them this is just another example unfortunately [Music] of our hatchlings [Music] this is an example of a hatchling disorientation event so if you're having trouble seeing the hatchling tracks I'm going to highlight them for you so you can see this is an instance where a um a nest was in the middle of the beach the hatchlings did not go anywhere near the water they instead traveled towards the land where we found them long crawling along the sea wall crawling in the Dune line wasting precious energy but there's something we can do to help there's something called sea turtle friendly lighting that sea turtles are less uh affected by and our governing agency is called floor official Wildlife Conservation Commission has a motto for that sea turtle friendly lighting it's called keep it long keep it low and keep it shielded and quickly keep it long means use a long wavelength length that's wavelength above 560 nanometers that's LED light that is emitting light in the orange Amber or Red Spectrum they are less likely to be attracted to that light and are more likely to be able to orient correctly towards water next we want to keep it low we want to keep the wattage and the lumens of the Light low for the necessary purpose and we also want to keep it low to the ground so the turtles are less likely to see the light source itself finally we want to keep the light source shielded so they're less likely to see that point source of light it's important to mention here that all three of those guidelines must be met in order to be considered sea turtle friendly so I want to provide an example of sea turtle friendly light so you really understand what we're asking for so you can see under the before image this is an example of a property up in the panhandle of Florida prior to a retrofit that was completed by the Sea Turtle Conservancy it's another non-profit organization based out of Gainesville Florida and you can see in this property that there's a lot of white artificial light up on the top you can see some ceiling mounted lines a lot of interior white light that allows the property owner to see about their property but it's also very attractive to our sea turtles so it was very likely that we would find hatchlings on this property the after image shows what the property looks like as a sea turtle friendly property so we're certainly not asking people to turn their lights off understand that Safety and Security and insurance liabilities are an important consideration we are simply asking people to change the type of bold and fixtures they are using so this after image is a sea turtle friendly property they are using light in the Amber spectrum and they're using fixtures that are downward directed and they are shielded so even at these properties these sea turtles are less confused by this light they're able to correctly Orient towards the water as they normally would uh but can sea turtles really see a difference I mean that just looks like a different colored light to us right so what's the big deal I quickly I want to do a lighting demonstration with you and I hope you will participate I'm going to show you a couple different lights and I want you to look at them with your naked eye and then I want you to look at them with your handy dandy light card that I provided to you so first is a white artificial lamp so don't look directly at the light but use your uh naked eye first so this could be an example of a typical white light that might be installed on somebody's property on the outside so they can see maybe their walkway at night and you can very clearly see that people use that all the time this is an example of a sea turtle friendly light so you can see it's in a shielded fixture and the bulb itself is an LED light that's emitting in the Amber Spectrum I just want you to show that it's on before we do the next part all right now I want you to look at that same light with your sea turtle filter and that will allow you to see what a sea turtle sees so look at that light where your special die can you see the light yeah you can so sea turtles see that very clearly they are going to be very attracted to that light they're probably going to go towards that light instead of the water next I want you to look at this light can you see it how about now you cannot so that is less attractive to them and they are more likely to orient towards the water so it does make a difference the type of lights and fixtures we are just you can hold on our peaches and that goes for city-owned property too things like street lights a public parking lot lights public restroom lights those affect sea turtles just as much as any property other types of artificial lights can affect Turtles as well things like flashlights and cell phone lights everyone's probably seen the flashlight parade on the beach at night with guests or tourists looking for ghost crabs that can affect our hatchling sea turtles in particular so you can find that they will be crawling towards that flashlight on that cell phone light um just like they would any other artificial light source so we ask that people try and to let their eyes adjust to the night and try not to use the cell phone lights and the flashlights but if they feel like they need it for safety or security they do sell red LED headlamps at hardware stores and we encourage people to use battling um people can report a sea turtle sightings during this nesting season they can use the FWC Wildlife alert hotline anywhere in the State of Florida that will route to the correct organization they they can also call Clearwater Marine Emporium we monitor from the city of Clearwater through the city of Treasure Island it's about 21 miles beaches and then you can call our rescue hotline and that number that is monitored 24 [Music] um the city of Delaware Beach also has these lovely signs and all of their public beach accesses that tell our tourists and our residents about the do's and don'ts of sea turtle nesting season and it provides the same phone numbers that they'd like to call in a concerned and these signs are also located at our Miss site specifically so they do provide the basic do's and don'ts at that last night and to please call those numbers in case they want to report something and again I think it's important to mention here that when we're we're talking about lighting to please consider reviewing your city-owned properties things like Morgan Park your street lights goes all in effect uh sea turtle hatchlings in our adults from orienting correctly so I I highly recommend that you review that when we're talking about a retrofitting or street lights we're happy to talk to you about what we can do to improve the lighting at sitting on properties um and with that I say thank you very much for listening to me and I'll be happy to take any questions that you have thank you Miss go ahead tell you what let's go to the citizens is anyone have any questions hi um Tammy lavender Ballard Beach Community Foundation I'll just say I've spoken to Lindsay and if you want to go to our community website we do have um part of the adopted turtleness program this is out there so you want to take a look at how some of her Council yes bike sale yeah um add some email specifically about Golf Boulevard I mean that's really the lights aren't owned by us I mean what should we do we can't just say hey replace all the bubbles can there's an ability to do that now a Duke Energy has a wonderful feature relaying specialist his name's Michael Smith he's specifically working in this area to help retrofit street lights so yes it's true that you don't own the lights you probably least them from duke they have the ability to retrofit all of those street lights with citro friendly bulbs and shields of course are they providing the funding as well no however I believe they he did mention that he is talking about potentially doing some sort of and this I may be misspeaking here so please bear that in mind but he was talking about some sort of payment system too so Duke has been really good about working with municipalities about this they want to help with this sort of situation so they may be able to help in some sort of city manager just gets in contact as long as we have a you know there's a there's a number out there so we understand that we work with you to go along that realm absolutely I'd be happy to do that other questions yes Mr Baker um where the blue lady that's being replaced I said blue lighting is not sea turtle friendly in fact it's one of the colored lights besides white lights that is the most attractive to turtles so blue light green light purple light very attractive to our turtles so they are going to be drawn towards that instead of crawling away because I had some residents ask me what is before it might be yeah that's a that's a problem actually in the wind and Duke's been replacing those as they find them they're just it's a technical issue the other thing is our beach is it better year after year and I see especially the first the 19th Street it's very little beach left you guys come out and put up a nice little barricade wild storm comes takes that barricade right now what happens to that Nestle that's a great question so what happens when our barricades are lost we have a couple of methods that we use to refine The Nest so we're very fortunate that a bank gave us a grant to purchase a special GPS units that are called triple tec150s their sub meter GPS's so instead of knowing our GPS location of our Nest down to 10 feet we can now know them four to six inches so if we were to lose all of those Nest markers we can use those GPS units now to just like a compass to refine our Nest so we're very thankful for those funds but we also Place secondary markers in the back beach to use as a backup as well desktop washed out uh no well sometimes yes sometimes no so Nest can take some wash over so long as that water is drained out fairly quickly you can think about it like if we were in a pool we have to be able to service debris every now and again in order to be okay but if we go sit under the water for too long we run out of air eventually it's very similar with our our eggs they have they exchange gases with the environment down in the bottom and if they sit under the water too long they can no longer do that just has clear water or internal protection acting right we're trying to get Beach regards and since we have no fees say that one more time for me it has a Clearwater Marine or you could see Turtle protection Society sweet Turtle Conservatory number they involve trying to get each renourishment because well everything reached out to the FED because we're not going to get anything for at least two more years that's a great question we do our best to make sure that our federal agencies are well educated on how our sea turtles use the environment as well as our nesting Siege seabirds and Shorebirds because our sea turtles are not the only marine animal that are usually utilizing our beaches to miss so I think it's very important that we don't do our due diligence to educate our our stakeholders about how the beach is utilized I have a question of were you having any interaction with the Army Corps of Engineers yes yes and uh and how did that go um well our main interaction comes from working with them during the 2018 remourishment project we worked what we had Communications with them during that project and um what is their take in yours on the value of nourishment for the sea turtle population good question so sea turtles need sandy beaches ultimately to Nest successfully um I think our Pinellas County Environmental Management would agree that typically our beaches are erosional beaches so we can expect that our beaches will lose sand over time now how full disclosure sea turtle nesting can be negatively impacted in the short term with featuring nourishment because typically here in Pinellas County we're nourishment projects happen during the sea Eternal lasting season so it's sometime between May and October and that typically happens because other areas like the east coast of Florida for example gets much higher nesting density than we do here we can expect two to three hundred nests in our area in the season they can expect tens of thousands of nests in their area so typically they are given priority for the nourishment projects in the off-season of sea-term resting season so we are then asked to do those projects during the season that negatively impacts our nest because we are required to relocate them so we don't want a bunch of sand dumped onto the sea turtle nest because they would not the hatchlings would not be successfully so we have to when they're laid we have to dig them up and transfer them to an area that will not receive sand anytime you do that it can affect the hatching and emerging success of those eggs which can affect the number of hatchlings that you're going to produce so while we do we certainly do our utmost to make sure the business are well protected it can impact them however for nourishment projects typically offer wider beaches for our sea turtles to Nest so there are negatives and positives to them okay thank you very much any other questions so the um I'm assuming and so the actual nesting always takes place at night typically some species can lay their nests during the day that's the critically endangered chemistry sea turtle and we have gotten a cancer Ridley Mists in our survey area we we got them to your North but we do get those very rare nesting species here and they nest during the day but majority happening how about the hatchet hygiene happens at night you get the very rare mixed signals that the hatchlings think it's night time and it is not and you get a day hatch out but 99 of it [Music] when you guys ran across those particular actions that were disoriented so what do you guys do at that point do you pick them up and take them to the water certainly it depends on the condition of the hatchling and what's going on so we do have a 24-hour hotline that we ask the public to call we will respond to those calls 24 hours a day we assess the situation try and locate those hatchlings and we will either release them with approval from our veterinarian or we will bring them to the aquarium for veterinarian evaluation um sometimes they look very tired and very weak sometimes injury maybe from a predator or something like that if they need to be seen so the best thing for us to do if we were to see that is not pick them up and take them to the water call you guys correct absolutely something you didn't discuss is when you hit the water it's no guarantee that you're going to survive they are food so just I mean talk talk about that so we can expect among the hatchlings that reach the water that one in one thousand hatchlings Will Survive that's 0.1 percent um so they could be predated we truly don't know the extent to what happens to them out in the water it's hard for us to research that but they can be predated by fish and bird species sometimes they're too weak from you know being disoriented on the beach if they just so happen to make it to the water and they may no longer have the energy reserves to make it out there so it's politically important that we make sure we do our best to protect all of the hatchlings and try and get them to the water because only 0.1 of them will survive all right thank you Miss Glenn we're running a little short on time but uh I greatly appreciate you coming it's a very educational and liking a conversation about sea turtles thank you you are welcome to come back next year and into presentation again I will be here again thank you very much all right we are on to item seven which is the quarterly board reports you know the board of adjustments report from Mr Mike Kelly good evening Mr mayor council members unlike Kelly board chairman um since we're talking about the quarter January February and March the board of adjustments started off with bang having a various meeting in January for an issue 122nd Street on a new house is under construction in March we were supposed to have another hearing on an appeal of an Administration appeal by our city manager it was deemed to be postponed by our City attorney for further work with with the resident so March was canceled but coming up in April next week we have a variance for a pool and in Mark and in may we also have another variance for a pool on the same issue that I harp on all the time about Crown roads so that's to be discussed whenever the council facilities it so we're moving along having a good quarter any questions thank you very much thank you all right next up is the citizens advisory committee thank you mayor council uh this is advisory committee uh about two times this quarter February 22nd we met to review and recommended financing options to accelerate multi-year Capital Improvements for the city related to Street resurfacing the storm water projects which will be presented later this evening in the agenda secondly we met as the audit committee on March 22nd uh that was to review the annual comprehensive financial report that was prepared by the city Auditor's Soul Marsh the committee recommended delayed that approval until the uh full reports in the financial statistics are added to the uh to the audit questions thank you we'll see you shortly all right next up is uh the Park and Recreation report [Music] um quick update for park and ride for January through March we welcome two new members which we're happy to have um we had three successful Beach cleanups we welcome everyone that comes every month we're thankful for them and to everyone that comes on a regular basis and to our guests always happy to have people there um January we've had our second annual health and wellness Fair which went very well we had some tried and true returning from the first one that we had and we had some new people out which was great we've already started booking people for 2024 if anybody has a connection with the Mobile Patrol please call me because I'm really trying to get them here for next year a new program that we started um this quarter was the new Resident welcome bags because it became apparent when everyone was trying to get off the island there were people that didn't know that they needed a hurricane pass to get off or you know they move here and there's so many things that you're doing to try to move so we put together like a nice little welcome bag and then it has all pertinent information that they need for City information and then Aaron made door hangers and then we hang them on the door for them to come to the city hall and pick them up so something new that we started um we are right in the middle of a park survey for this quarter so our board goes out we look we spend significant time in every single looking for the good the bad safety issues and then we do a recap with the city majority and we um we work on that list diligently throughout the quarter Beller Beach merchandise we have the things we have right now we're looking for something new if anyone has any suggestions or if they're looking for something or I think I might have mentioned it before but we're looking into like the yeti like cups with the Beller Beach logo on them I think for something new and then fall events we have our third annual Halloween on October 28th we have our holiday social on December 4th we have our second annual mayor's chili cook-off on December 10th which is a Sunday this year and then we'll have our third annual health and wellness Fair on January 13th so is there any questions Council [Music] so it's like a traveling like dermatologist so they check like moles and skin mold the mold control I'm glad you found out moles and I thought it was a cool band it probably is somewhere right I do too thank you would any dermatologist worker that you want the mobile no any dermatologist we've had a hard time getting a dermatologist here but they're kind of like they have a trap kind of like the blood donated mobile there they would be in the parking lot and then you could actually go in and get a checkup as opposed to just talking to a dermatologist in Milton but yeah we would love any Dermatology thank you thank you uh now we're up to the Planning and Zoning report do we have a Planning and Zoning report all right moving right on to item number eight the City attorney report Mr Roy you had the Forum thank you Mr Mayor since our last meeting our office has been tracking legislative session very closely recently as last week I made a presentation before the Big C concerning one bill of particular interest to many of each communities filled with less impact here which is Senate Bill 714 in its house corollary House Bill 833 concerning short-term rental regulations The Cliff Notes version of it is you folks have grandfathered protective Provisions from putting short-term rentals in certain zoning districts not every Beach Community and not every community in Florida has so fortunate and the landscape for those outside of that protective bubble is ever changing and often unsatisfying and at present there's a bill proposed that would change that landscape further it's being sponsored in the Senate by senator sigley from locally bill seems to presently be stalled in its committee hearings on Amazon session is still only halfway through so it may gain traction maybe we continue to monitor those one that affects you folks particularly is House Bill 37 and cscs Senate Bill 774 which concerns Financial disclosure forms for elected officials at the local level until now um perhaps in this living still may be the only reason I'm familiar with this to this point you've built out form One Financial disclosures there are different forms for the financial disclosures and the current legislation which is um gained a lot of traction I believe it has already moved through one of the two Chambers and is likely to move through the other would have you fill out a form six form six gets much more granular in its attention to your finances and Assets in excess of a thousand dollars liabilities your interest Holdings and businesses and the like so that is understanding The Narrative behind it is increased transparency of interest in local government of the the counter narrative that's been offered too is the children effect that may have on on those willing to go to the only service knowing how open their Affairs may be um another one another set of bills that we're tracking closely is uh the what was Senate Bill 1372 and House Bill 1321 it's not moving in the house so this is what I consider to be good news but it was a bill that would render local elections open to partisan advertisement and partisan elections um in the event you felt local elections weren't contentious enough there was a potential to add another layer to that that seems to be stalling but again things can move in session rather quickly or become Riders on other bills so we will keep tracking that the other bill that we're looking at very closely is Senate Bill 170 and it's House Bill 1515 to me this is of the greatest consequence to the business we do here together Senate Bill 170 and it's which is already past the senate in House Bill 1515 which is headed to the floor of the house would require any adopted ordinance to have a business impact statement that does not State what expertise or detail would be required to give some values or factors how those will be determined and substantiated and remain to be seen with added concern that is not just hey there's one more step to get ordinances adopted but most tellingly until now there's been a statutory element on the books concerning ordinances that are preempted and when somebody challenges an ordinance and says hey it's been preempted that was a in addition in the last three years and if you sustain if you kept an ordinance on the book after being told it was preempted and what challenged you faced exposure to attorney's fees as a community plaintiff's opportunities that language has been enhanced to save this arbitrary or or what was the other word frivolous I believe is the word archery frivolous were preempted and a and then some litigate brings suit against the city to challenge its what means you face exposure to fees and not only that well during the tendency of that suit you have to stay the enforcement of the ordinance so if somebody said if you pass something tomorrow somebody challenges it you cannot enforce it while that challenge is being resolved by the courts I imagine the courts will have to give these priority however our courts are already taxed in the tour perform if you've not seen the news coverage on that wallet while I'm spending on where you sell that has been seen as a positive it has resulted in a massive influx of litigation to markets at least in the short term and the courts are trying to figure out how to handle that because this is a separate bill that the torque fundament through a change the period for negligence institution four years four years two years so plaintiff's attorneys who are sitting on things watching this legislative sessions on the Senate well I've got like two 2 000 cases in the backlog I'm just going to get more file right now and so there's been an influx application and we've seen that in some of our cities as well cities that haven't seen soup in a decade not two or three minutes but getting back to the Senate Bill 170 has both at 2 15. the business impact and mandatory stay elements are peculiar and may start to further  the home rule elements of what you do here especially as a smaller Community having to forecast business and vaccines who knows how those findings end up being leveraged later either for against you so that is the same way again we continue to track this is I have substantive updates I will continue to provide them either in writing or otherwise to make sure you have timely updates on session the the most notable news though not necessarily specific to municipalities though of course with impact on our deputies and otherwise because they can see the carry changes which could go into effect in July just and so outside of that we um because I I have a feeling if I don't say anything I will get asked on the last meeting there was some lengthy exchange concerning the property with the antenna structure his attorney is presently on vacation this week and expecting to get us a statement on or before April 14th of with a substantive submission again the incentive Tower is not being erected during that time it's not being addressed or resolved that is the current status of that I did communicate to the except I remember random at our last meeting had um some some fields of inquiry I communicated those and more to his attorney and he's since been in touch with Kyle they are exchanging emails and have exchanged emails it's not radio silence but that that matter continues to to move forward otherwise answer any questions thank you Mr Moore any questions or comments uh actually this is random so let me unplug that late before it burns through the board please actually I was I was going to suggest just a brief pause in the meeting so uh if you if you needed to remove your equipment you know I'm not going to make you wait to the whole meeting if you have something to do [Music] mayor I believe that the banker had a question or concerned um are you saying that he applied for a permit or you still had he has not his his complete permit submission is forthcoming one of the one of the delays if you will or on top of his just personal lead was one of the questions that we asked very specifically um that goes to this inquiry is not only what is the capacity in terms of height um and signal for this intense structure but what is his actual need um if he only needs to for example you know the analogy I gave on speaking with some of you is when I was in Middle School I had a basketball hoop I didn't it could have gone to 10 feet I didn't need it to go higher than seven for what I was doing right and so similarly he may not need to get the full capacity and there's a study that he needs to do and I can't remember the term crop in study or something forget the term thank you propagation study that needed that needed to be done and so that allowing some time for that based on reason because any other questions or comments see the attorney I have a question regarding that possible 37. yes House Bill 37 and let me let me just pull up I have all these that's the financial disclosure one you only just I have several times here I want to make sure that I'm speaking to the right one so the Senate bill is 774. it uh that bill has um gone through at least two of its committees and it's heading to its um it's gone through ethics and elections and it's gone through the rules committee a 16-4 votes pending reference review so it's going to that senate floor um is for the Senate version and then it's the related bill of house bill 37. uh household 37 has favorable by all by it's in its last committee I believe state affairs committee and so likely to um at least see its way to the house for whether it passes I can't say but the other element to all of this is good bad or indifferent you have a party that has a super majority in the legislature and the same party is empowering the governor's seat which is to say if they if leadership wants something done it's almost certainly getting done there's not going to be a lot of surprises with split votes or Hey There Was You Know came close but one person came across the aisle so should want something done is likely going to be done but the rate that this has moved through the Committees and the discussion that's been happening on these they generally can pass them along party lines and it is it is moving and there's still roughly a month left in session so very likely to get to the House and Senate floor and if the if they've both thus far in committee or any indication likely to pass I hope that the voters pay attention and speak to our Representatives because in our small town you'll get no one running from office with this type of Financial Security and I think that's that's the goal I really do think that that is to drive out a big smaller municipalities had several conversations with people around the county and just like the the lawsuit the maximum panel that they could be awarded the lawsuit you're talking about 200 000 okay yeah that has been proposed that one has not moved quite as much to sovereign immunity um cap extension but yes that is on the table of that that's a that's a store closer for us it has the potential to be in any number of these things and you know I know um mayor Gaddis was President for my presentation um have the Big C at the risk of you know getting too much within a soapbox or a platform I'd just say um the current trajectory of our of this legislative session and the more recent ones presents at least if not an existential threat certainly an existential concern for smaller communities and you you see that in the public comment we're seeing not just here but in other communities the people lamenting the loss of their neighborhoods and just having streets whether that's short-term rentals home-based businesses property rights protections and everybody's saying what about my property rights they always seem to be in in competition and you're starting to lose the ability to cultivate and sustain the unique character of each of these small communities that we've developed that has made this community and communities like it across Florida so attractive and so you know I I to the extent I I can make a statement to the to the to you as a council to your public is recognizing that your remedy isn't always here we've been taught in acidics that the government that governs local governments best or you know government's closest governance fast and that's your local government so much of that is being recaptured if you vote by Tallahassee and the remedies that people come to you and say why don't you guys fix this and then you know you folks run and then you meet some or stop like me who tells you yeah all the things you wanted to do you can't do because that's how she says so when they get to say so I'm not suggesting otherwise in our system of government they have the ability to take those things back and they whereas that was done as the exception it seems to be the rule beginning to make the State of Florida loses their character away and Unfortunately they don't listen to us they don't listen to the length of the patients on the munition 11. I think that the only only people they will ever listen to are the voters sorry about the negative uh just briefly this morning I'm going to address briefly the situation the letters and the emails that we received this week about the signs and the I guess protesters uh because that's been added as an agenda item I'll withhold until we get to that Gentile thank you um last year when the um the inspection requirement was passed for the condos three stories enough there was talk that it might be read dressed this year is there anything that looks like that's happening excellent question thank you I don't remember and have not really down the the bill number and I can follow up with you on that it is being Revisited which is one of the reasons why um to the extent local jurisdictions we're trying to advise or or be advised about the issue there's everybody's kind of being told hold on let me let's see because some the bill or statute um that member Gutierrez was referencing was the bill done post-service side on mandatory inspections and condos over in x height or floors and and the entire regime around that every 20 years 10 years into this and all that stuff that came out some of the it was it was well intentioned and it has with many as much legislation that's done in a reactive and accelerated Pace people after the fact realize like hey it says this but it doesn't really put that onus on any money whose responsibility is it to do this and it says a municipality must but then there's no timeline there's no how do I know what to do and so yes there is some legislation being proposed and discussed this session no I don't have a specific recollection of his terms so I'll make sure you get that update to you after me thank you any other questions or comments for the City attorney now we're up to item number nine city manager report Mr weepler thank you mayor um so I'm going to start off with the Gulf Boulevard undergrounding we just have a progress meeting in March 29th unfortunately we're still kind of waiting on the materials to get here Duke Energy has contracted those materials they just complement Ed date but the ironic contractor is very confident that enthusiasm materials so when I have a date of the actual progress breaking ground uh the budget breaking ground they didn't know so you guys are aware the Gulf Boulevard buoy replacement for the new Zone that we created for the ordinance those installed being sold into 16 nearly labeled buoys we had to bring them in based on the beach erosion to get that 300 foot distance of the line was actually a little closer than it was the city staff is planning to remove the remaining old Idol weight buoys in the meantime those are actually outside of our new creative Services they're not actually causing confusion within that zone the stormwater Improvement project as we have on the agenda tonight we're going to be a banknote resolution the city hall generator I told you I would get some side-by-side quotes of the portable unit we discussed in the original you know which was on the generator stand I did see both of them coming out on an email today while we did this meeting so the prices are holding pretty much where they were again it's a 15-day price period that they're getting I want to follow up with one of the members on some of the specific questions we had concerning the fuel tank and the circle warranty but I will get that email out to week children's play playground replacement then we up on back to April 21st so I'm very hopeful that's gonna be fine I started working on the Personnel policy we currently have a personal policy the procedure manual as well as an employee handbook what I've noticed over the years of working here is there is a lot of the same material covered in both documents in another section and there is some areas that it isn't congruent so what I'm having done that occurrence group is to update and combine those documents so that we have more ready resource to promote that personal matters and make sure that we're where we need to be as far as how important laws change after they have provided arguments that will happen the I'm working on a grant policy which would be an administrative policy of life will outline when we have a project coming before us and we're looking at finding how will you approach it and a formal process of how we look for other funding methods [Music] so and also cover some of the ongoing grants that we have throughout the year that data we don't plan on getting every year and how we go about that I'm hoping that it'll be a future work session for the next work session I wanted to start presenting an example of what I see other the score card initiative should be to summarize where we're at in in our projects it's a strategic plan how our finance ties into it and it also had a code enforcement element so that I will be presenting to you with the next work session to get some feedback and I just wanted to follow up on the icma fccm mini development um in this report about the April 13th or 11th to 13th I will be at the time conference the Florida county commissioner City Managers Association conference on May 30th through June 2nd and I've been in touch with the icma the uh the there is a level of experienced credits you have to reach they told me that they would provide a report based on where I am at so I have a realistic timeline timeline and also I'm waiting for the leadership development program that they offer to be reimagined they've told me it was supposed to be this year early January then it was last 12 in week in April that they will have that program you know where we even start to register for it what that will do is you know provide education for me and also at the same time reduce the amount of years experience that it will be able to come towards and experienced credit to getting towards credentialing um it was mentioned the traffic study that assists its Commons I've been in touch with Jones County and Tyler Washburn and some of his employees and engineers and they we did a uh doodle poll to find a meeting date to meet on site at the intersection the lab the dates I selected because I have the conference was uh April 18th and April 19th uh I did ask uh if councilmember Roberts could attend that meeting since he was involved on a town before that so I will follow up on that um Park Mobile we have everything turned in necessary to get started they have a proof for a signs that we're going to install um the last thing I just I saw the email coming I was getting a bank letter for the ACH depositor so once I send that to him they told me a good time when I would be about three or three week timeline to make that convert that's all I got Council might tell you when we um select to be a city manager we also touched on the responsibility to make sure that you're reading Mentor giving you advice suggestions Etc I mean we talk daily but I just wanted to point out you found a problem here with a Personnel policy you basically were extremely proactive you found a need matched the parties that would contribute most to this effort and I just wanted to point out that that's a really it's an outstanding effort it shows insight and basically it levels well above you so I just wanted to compliment you on that and I hope that you're collecting these city manager reports because we'll talk later about evaluations and these really are a key part of your evaluations and just a brief timeline what I've seen here at performance so far has been thoroughly outstanding professional at a rained well above your age very well done just wanted to publicly acknowledge your efforts and the outstanding efforts on behalf of the city thank you thank you [Music] any other questions or comments following up for Mr Sables I've heard nothing but good things from the residents of value too I agree your evaluations we'll be looking at but since you're doing such a fine job I don't think we should be holding you to that two-year wage free time Council gives you a reasonship any other questions Roberts yeah thank you guys that you had mentioned that you had contacted which is wonderful and so if you get back to say he was good I'm going to follow up on that because I filled out the survey immediately um but I haven't heard so I'm going to be getting a call okay that would be great and one other quick question has the city um finalize who we're going to use nearing firm for the Civil War Improvement projects no we're not there yet I'm planning on getting uh design proposals from all six firms that I want to really look at them okay great thank you mentioned reefer we have a brief conversation a few days ago concerning the fines and hearing and while we're able to subjecting to the public parking lots are you in a position where you can discuss that um so we did have a meeting and um all all said and done the Army Corps is going to be able to provide some administrative guidance for further contracts and agreements for Featured nourishment um having presented where we stood as a city and what you know what we were doing what our rates and all that they did not I'll front see any major issues and they were able to justify what we were doing you know right because it wasn't violating the policies that they feel are necessary to keep it according to the public so the meeting went well I'm looking forward to the guidance that they go by because it's going to clear up some confusion but among all the new families are involved I can find it interesting that they only want to discuss speech nourishment whenever we're trying to increase the volumes that's half the point they're interesting all right any other questions or comments for the city manager thank you very much Mr reefer all right now we are on to 10 which is the city clerk report I just want to do a follow-up on the quarterly reports the audit committee and the Planning and Zoning Board that we will be getting meetings with them so that we can get those two things to city council so that's we'll be setting up those meetings and the City attorney is going to be doing the government in the sunshine presentation on Wednesday at 5 30 for all the boards and committees but the public is welcome too and that's all I have any questions or comments for these City Clerks so Betty is that Sunshine presentation is that required yearly by anybody or is that okay but it is required annually uh for our elected members um and I believe it says the boards now as well but regard a definitely to our elected members this training that we're doing on Wednesday is not towards that credit because this is sort of a cliff notes version the four hour course that you took at email last night in years past or is offered online through the FLC or through various other vehicles is always available but you do have to complete that annually for you folks this one is intended more to make sure that top to bottom of our teams know about their obligations duties responsibilities as public or semi-public officials as it relates to public records Sunshine Law in my tenure here I've not had the opportunity to meet with all those Awards and we've already in this one year had new members come on and you know hopefully establishing the pattern as we get new members always giving New People's sort of a brief orientation of sorts thank you any more questions or comments we're talking about financial reforms sorry one is the form one view for us September I think kind of reflection is that they've been given us to distribute those in the summer months mine is typically submitted by early July and I only know that because I always said it is the last thing I do before I go on my fourth of July right so I'm like oh so you usually see that in June they did change the policy and then without respect Patty if I said when you chose in the last two years they did change the policy administratively that they tend to send your specific form to your city registered email account when I say they I mean the commission on ethics and state agency not Bay petting Kyle and so you should be on the lookout for that as we get into June for that appointment if you haven't submitted by a certain date Patty or somebody from the city usually start saying hey guys this is coming up get it in you know before July so you don't have late fees or start getting nasty grants about you know why aren't you buy them when you receive performance thank you all right all right so now we're moving on to the consent agenda this is items 11 through 15. for approval of the February 23rd 2023 city council work session minutes approval of March 6 2023 city council meeting minutes approval of March 20th 2023 city council work session minutes acceptance of the 2023 Pinellas County multi-jurisdictional Community rating system annual

of the consent agenda [Music] all right the consent agenda passes now we are on to the regular agenda of the item number 16. this is for consideration of resolution 202302 Mr Morgan Mr Mayor sir sorry Mr Mayor hitting that page of the materials Okay resolution 2023-02 a resolution in the city of Bella Beach Florida authorizing the issuance of the city's Capital Improvement Revenue note series 2023 and the principal amount of 2 million one hundred twenty thousand dollars and approve um to finance acquisition construction Capital Improvements including Street researching and storm water

purities and remedies for the owner of the known authorizing service officials and employees of the city all actions required a condition with sale issuance and delivery of such note making such determinations as a required to afford the no Bank qualified status and concern covenants and agreements in connection with there with and providing for effective date this has been a reading of resolution 2023-02 by title loan with Mr Mayor thank you Mr Mora before we get a citizen comments uh the city manager lying to summarize Hawaii sorry so this is a resolution for a banknote um and we uh in the last work session presented uh with the five Stone water phases or projects that were part of our Master Plan update of 2017 um the citizens advisory committee did a lot of work and Heather who's here tonight contributing into the projections of where the city was at financially and you know there's been uh there's been a lot from residents to want to move these projects along because it's a very important Initiative for the city so the citizens Advisory Group took that on and uh and found a way that we uh we can house lead Finance all these projects and you know get them taken care of and uh you know move forward and at the same time with a plan to pay back this loan and an accelerated race thank you let's go to the citizens for uh comments you would like to speak I guess [Applause] good evening everyone my name is Kim Shaw Elliott I live at 121 9th Street very pleased to be with you tonight I'm here to very strongly support the proposal I want to commend the city manager and the committee that did this work that they were able to deal with a very complex issue and deal with confidence to be able to present to you a proposal that is critical what's more important or fundamental to a city purpose than to be able to provide the safe streets and things that so things don't flood away which is kind of critical here it's timely we're facing many environmental issues right now and it's time that we act now and it's creative because it's brought a resolution to many issues that we have to deal with and it's doing it in a way that will actually bring some positive numbers at the end of it I won't spend a lot of time talking about what the benefits of this proposal are but in a quick summary what these proceeds will do is we'll give the city the opportunity to have better pricing so bidding one big job versus a bunch of smaller jobs is clearly an advantage you'll have more attention to be more qualified providers and you'll be able to get the better pricing with that big bigger job you'll be able to provide for supplies we needed to do this in bulk rather than again a bunch of series a series of smaller jobs and it'll be able to accelerate completion of these critical repairs for just two years to finish all of our Steve streets get it over with we don't know when the next big event will occur I think it's it's it's frightening in terms of what is impending and having our streets taken care of now is really really important and at the end of the day it's going to give additional savings to the city in that we've had the opportunity to take advantage of some very favorable interest rates for the funds that will be sitting there so there are two things that I'd like to address about this proposal one is to make certain certain that it does adequately address the problem when we plan we need to plan for the future we're not going to recreate what has been done in the past or do what we think is needed now because we know the future will be different than what it is now and I would like to make sure that we take the opportunity to adequately address the needs of these flood control measures my understanding is that the proposal as it sits right now does not have any arrangement for any kind of retaining pool or or any kind of tanks that will hold excess water when it comes and if that's needed we need to address that now and not rebuild in a way that will already be proven inadequate so I would like to ask that you take the moment to at least re-reassess and confirm what the needs for this project are and that they're taken care of now um the other thing is that I would ask that you prioritize Ninth Street so Ninth Street somehow was skipped over in the uh in the work that has been done to date 9th Street is the entryway to our beautiful Park here it's the part that's it includes City parking it includes the back entrance to this lovely facility um Ninth Street regularly floods uh 9th Street I know has had property sales even rescinded because of the flooding that occurred right in the middle of a of a proposed sale so this is an important issue it's an important streak and I'd like to ask that you consider Ninth Street in this proposal thank you Michelle thank you with any other citizens like to comment on this topic yes hello my name is Fritz will 905 Harbor Drive and I can just say the same thing that Kim just said it's really necessary I tried for two years to find an answer of why 9th Street or skipped in the first place and then what are what happened to eights and seven streets what are what have you found out is it still flooding and I still don't know what you are really going to do to prevent the flooding um that those are questions that are still open otherwise I think we all agree that we have to do something especially the Ninth Street I live at the end of Ninth Street and every time there is a flood and people are trying to collect the bags the sandbags you know all all the trucks coming down the road they flood my front yard and that is not acceptable so I thank you for these guys for real any other questions John Hanson 22nd Street I happen to sit on the citizens advisory committee and I speak very highly of this uh proposal one of the things that we also took into consideration when we contract or do two streets at a time you have the logistics of bringing in the equipment and then removing it it costs money has factored in it if we one of the things we looked at to do this successively was that would save a significant amount of money I think it was somewhere around 250 350 000. just a moving equipment in and out of the city if we did it the way we're doing it now it says to issue of flooding it's like some other folks who said before we're not going to solve it it's not going to go away we live on a Barrier Island the one thing that is a plus is the fact that these drains that go out into the Intracoastal at the check valves so when you have a high tide it closes the valve and prevents the water from backing up and flooding it's just one of those things we're not ever going to solve the problem completely 100 percent of flooding it's not going to happen but this will take care of it in a long thank you thank you Mr Hansen any more comments or questions from the citizens nope all right citizens comments are closed before we continue I'm going to need a motion to approve this resolution motion made by Frank Baker do I have a second second uh your hand went up anyway [Music] I'm supporting this funding although replacing 70-year-old players really never worked you're going to produce the same effects you're going to get the same effects unless we do this right we need to catch Basin and need pumps a lot of homes in Harbor Drive when this place we put in we're not there that means the elevation of that discharge fight really needs to be raised up because those check valves that you talk about they're nothing more than sunny day chat about when high tide comes up on a sunny day the water does not come in the street you're getting three inches of rain an hour or more that check out closes it will not open until that tide comes down I live on 8th Street George Pike is put in way before that house houses were built would never elevated that pipe that means we have to wait about an hour and a half to two hours when high tide comes down for that valve to open up to work actually accumulating more and more water because that wood will not leave the street and where does that water go in your yards hopefully not your homes so yes we need to solve the problem we don't need to solve a problem that is creating we didn't create 70 years ago we need to do it smart we need to spend the money smartly we also need like manset mobilization of equipment working in this field it'll cost you anywhere from 50 to 100 000 of moving equipment so you need to coordinate one street to be done in another stream to start right away if that equipment is moved out permitting costs distilling the removal will cost us anywhere from fifty thousand to a hundred thousand dollars per Street or per project so one Street's done we need to attack that next street we're going to have to find a contractor an award the same contractor to do all these projects because we have contractor a and we have to bring in contract with me we're already in the hole for mobilization thank you Mr Baker other comments let's just take this to a roll call both now this is to approve resolution 2023-0 to miss Gentry would you please call for us all right oh I'm sorry let me make one comment I've heard that the equipment that we're proposing to put it at the end of Ninth Street in Clinton oh I apologize I said I'll come back you know what we're about to uh we're about to vote on this uh Council would you like to entertainment okay please I apologize uh Cheryl gray 118 9th Street Ballard beach one concern I do have and I've parallels what Kim and Francis said earlier 9th Street is crumbling I've heard that the equipment we're talking about putting it in the parking lot at the end of Ninth Street to do that I'm concerned that we're going to see more probably I would really love to see the parking go over here and not take it down private streets that's my request thank you and the city manager heard you loud and clear and sure he will take that into consideration okay now let's go back to the role called Patty council member Banker yes council member Livingstone yes council member Notaro yes council member Roberts I council member Sable I vice mayor Shirley aye mayor goddess aye so the resolution passes unanimously right we item number 17 this is for consideration of ordinance 23-02 Mr Moore Mr Mayor this is Oregon's 23-02 on the first reading an ordinance of the city council the city of Bellaire Beach Florida amending section 58-38 lines and procedures to increase the fines associated with parking violations providing for qualification severability and for an effective date this has been a reading award that's 23-02 by title only on first readers thank you Mr Moore let's go to the states for comments on this importance I see there are new citizens requesting to make comments when you close citizen comments and before we move forward I'm going to need a motion to approve this 23 to actually made made by Frank Baker do I have a second by Lloyd Roberts Mr Banker do you happen to him right now we're looking to charge ten dollars per hour for part three hour match or flying right now is 35 hours not be a rock inside this show would you rather spend 30 white hours in park all day spent ten dollars per hour for three hours so so well needed to be increasing I think it should be because just it just makes common sense you Mr Speaker what other comments from the council and I I agree with you call service record all right so let's go ahead and take this to a roll call Luke has to approve ordinance 23-02 council member Banker yes council member Livingstone yes council member Notaro yes council member Roberts aye council members Abel aye vice mayor Shirley mayor Gaddis ly first reading Mr Mayor will come back in a second that's right all right so now we are on to item number 18. this is for authorization of the city manager who advertised for Marina doctors improvements this is placed on the agenda line city manager is your report take it away America so over the over the years you know we have our filings and our docs facilities out at the marina and um it's been wearing out through the wave action solar and actually um we've over probably about the last 10 years I've been accumulating money for repair I was a little bit has been spent the last time was after damage from Hurricane Irma but prior to that it was probably pre-2015 I believe dolphin Marine actually did an overhaul to the Pinelands of the marina so we're getting to the point where to do it we did a comprehensive inspection it was 140 Marina pilings not all of them are City maintained 64 of them are the slip renters have actually installed for their Wilderness so that is their responsibility to maintain them the Manning 76 piles are the things responsibilities these these function as typos lowering poles in the sports to the catalogs we the inspection shows where some of the pilings are fine just need to be cleaned and wrapped so others that need to be completely replaced and then there was a recommendation and see if blue squares which is to do a concrete jacket I think that decision was recommended basically because the uh the pilings are located under the catalog so I'm requesting that authorization for city council to go out to be for the renovation needs to take place at the marina like I said we've had accumulation of funding of 52 500 I'm expecting this project to go somewhere between thirty thousand thirty five thousand uh two ways one way uh is to do the 38 reroute re-wraps that were recommended and then 38 complete Replacements so far in doing research and typing to brandiers I think to replace certain options the better option but I also want to there's more recommendation of a concrete jackets just to lay out the two options so that would be doing the 38 re-wraps 19 Cotton Creek jackets in the 19 replacements so I included the marina inspection report uh hopefully that time to look over it and then the other the other thing is that once uh once we get this banded out we want to share this report get each slip Runner to make sure that they're aware of the condition of Their Own thank you Mr riefler before we continue I would like to go to the citizens for comments now we're back to the council Council professions Roberts thanks for asking questions they they form around in I guess pop out of water from concrete or around the piling um so as we know concrete doesn't absorb the water so it provides some protection for that pile input I feel the brand new pressure treated Replacements probably the better option I just wanted the explorable is for ours so what what's the anticipated life expectancy of a replacement versus a rewrap that's the information that I want to yeah okay and do we know that the cost difference between a replacement versus a clean and wrap um so clean and wrap I believe that a quote I got from the company that provided the inspection I think was around two to three thousand per piling and then a complete replacement lens it was closer to 7 000 and the concrete Jack that was somewhere in between okay but you know doing the re-wraps the cleaning the re-wraps it just provides a green another form of protection around it so that it is [Music] the life expectancy is significant for replacement as compared to a wrap and we have the funding then maybe I would recommend that we go ahead and replace them all so we can have that done completed now and not have to worry about them for a while that's obviously and then you know if you do a replacement for the ones that are recommending is concrete jacket which are underneath the the deck boards you know require a little extra labor on pulse and backboards of detaching the hardware of supports with them but it would be worth it if we expended okay thanks any other questions or comments for the city managers okay uh yes [Music] what I don't think that I actually did feel emotion on this on this island so okay okay obvious that Kyle has done his homework on this and knows what we're looking for and what to do and I think we need go ahead any other comments nope all right so this is for authorization of the city manager to advertise for Marina dock improvements all in favor any opposed all right Mr Speaker you are authorized and received thank you ma'am all right yeah I'll take a good stuff this is for uh item number 19 consideration of Merit pay increase for city clerk based on annual evaluation criteria city manager realtor okay so um this you guys overall given the uh the evaluations complete for City Clerk uh Patricia Gentry and um we've gotten all those in for the recommendations um can you have the summary of the actuals sorry no summary no we don't have them this was the first time that I've seen where we did not receive a summary score of the overall wasn't in the agenda pack he said data available no I don't have that I can get that if you want to take this off I'm still waiting for one evaluation um so do you want to take it off and and I think I think it's it's fair that we are able to see all the schools that's fine too I will do that if a branches were paid for tonight I think that's fair enough I'll get all the evaluations together and put together a calculation okay well the entertainment table is someone will make one motion to table to rent your repay if your evaluations here do I have a second second all in favor to table this way any of those okay we'll we'll get this uh resolved next month and uh hopefully we can have these maybe for the next work session just so that we've got them and have time ample time to review yes just one quick question now so is there a fixed date that that this is supposed to be an annual married increase day forecasting she has an anniversary name that that Merit applies to sometimes we need to employ evaluations they don't have their evaluation exactly on that date somewhere in that time period nearby and hit retro days okay so have we approved this and I should 've gotten dead when as a Believer it's the beginning of April the April 1st for your anniversary news March 7th I think okay so it's March okay so it's based on your anniversary okay perfect okay thanks okay let's not let that happen again I feel terrible but we have to we have to see everything thank you thank you mayor but that's not on you or them it that's mine it was my that I don't have that ready so please don't take any responsibility for that it's all me I'm sorry oh well no apology is necessary all right so now we are on to item number 20 which is consideration nomination of Reddington Beach mayor David will as a representative to Ford Pinellas with a 10 carrier Island communities what is Ford Pinellas or Pinellas is a land use and transportation plan out agency a guide integrated transportation and land use solutions to sustain economic value by connecting with communities of Pinellas County in the Tampa Bay Region effectively they they do a lot with traffic and how it may or may not affect us there are other things that they are into but that's my big is the traffic and where they route tracking so before I go any further I would like to ask the citizens for comments anyone like to comment on this topic comments and we'll bring it back to the council to continue this discussion I need a motion from the council motion made by vice mayor Shirley do I have a second by Lloyd Roberts nice to meet you sir well clearly the beaches need representation um the order of forward Pinellas but I think the beaches get the ride and the deal when it comes to for Pinellas I would love to see someone from our community be you know you know representation for the beaches but I don't know the mayor of Reddington Beach so I may be speaking at a turn by saying he's a good candidate but certainly someone on the beach and part of The Big C would be a good boys yes other comments I mean how did David will become the nominee okay so so let me give you a little back story I normally allow everyone to do their comments first but I'll kind of tell you what's going on um four Pinellas have so many seats they pick the four largest communities in the county and each one of those communities automatically get a seat the Barrier Islands all 10 of them only get one representative because of the timing okay so I was on the nominating committee for The Big C and David will his name is now his uh Community is much like ours they don't have businesses they have some private areas they they are overran with traffic like we are from time to time also I've got you know David will pretty well and uh and I trust that I can have influence on David will and believe that believe that he would look for into our best interest as he would his own because they're confident and this is really good for us because that's not always been the case normally our representative that's placed by the big sea is always a tourism Community well this is the first time that we've had a representative who's not degrees Community needs were going to be more fairly represented there's an even deeper back story behind this also on the nominating committee it was not advertised but the the representative from the tourist Development Council who is not reporting back to the Big C so we also decided to to replace that that representative or delegate with a new one and I was selected to to attend antique or to be on the TDC so what does that have to do with us because we don't attract tourists well it's all about where the money goes that comes in from tourism and as you know we are all impacted by all this tourism so we might as well have some impact on where the money goes and my number one goal will always be spend the money on renourishing our beaches so for the first time we have two people that are pretty much private communities that don't they're not Commerce communities representing the big city and I think it's going to be a great benefit for all the Barrier Islands so that's why I recommend that we move forward and approved any questions so how does the mechanism work from this point so once once we say okay so so what it is is that every Barrier island has or The Big C has delegates from each community of each municipality I'm one vote however the way that I cash the boat is if in this case they're asking they're going to call a vote at the next big c meeting and I will be asking official public reference in Keller Beach okay in support of David Bowie mayor David any other questions or comments no okay well in that case it's Google and they're going to have very very plainly just by saying all in favor I am any opposed all right so I will confirm our vote at the United States all right uh now we're on the item 21 there's a lot of these available tonight so just bear with me as we get through them all the next one is consideration of selecting council members as voting delegate ultimate voting delegate number one and Alternate voting

on to which we authorize the City attorney to direct the coordinates to address section 38-87 of our state to be presented and reviewed at our next work session for any citizens like the Mickey Mouse they're shaking their heads and squiggly Council I need a motion to proceed on this so now motion made by Leslie matero do I have a second second by Jerry Shirley council member nataria you had before I think it's pretty clear because we need to address this Sunday please thank you um the issue that it's the agenda this evening concerns specific specifically section 38-87 of the city's code this issue came up not because of some kind of enforcement action or controversial event that's a place in the city but rather in response to an advocacy group bringing this to the city's attention the which happens from time to time I reviewed the code section at issue what they've what they've asserted in the roughly four page correspondence sent a week ago today I believe is when we received your week ago is that the ordinance suffers various constitutional defects being void for vadeness and having content-based free speech limitations and unnecessary limitation around justifiable under strict scrutiny analysis restriction on the freedom of Association and freedom of assembly they've asked that we respond to them by April 10th um I will not suggest to you that they are going to either buy and Lead until April 10th to hear from us as evidenced by their advocacy in the last few days before we press releases in other lives that said having reviewed it I agree that the ordinance suffers defects and needs revision what those revisions look like I'd like a moment to to look at what is what the language presently says and where this community wishes to go reviewing the history of this looks like the language or at issue the language that is most at issue is 30 80 38-87 cell b which reads that no permits shall be granted by the city manager for the conduct of any commercial political or organized event by any person group or organizer that's not the only defective language if you will but the language that is most notable what's interesting to me about that is that this language came in in 2018 through ordinance for 1802 which saw at least ostensibly based on the minutes of the meeting at the time and agenda materials to address what at the time was various parties asking for to have weddings in city parks and bring chairs and other attendance elements that were perhaps congesting the public gathering areas I'm not sure how that issue morphed into that language but that was what the ordinance said before that the language came in of subpartier came in and ordinance zero five zero one as part of an amendment to the city's code that was comprehensive in nature following the city's adoption of the city manager form of government so all the references to the member or the council member overseeing this has changed City management for that language goes back to 81 basic geocodes Origins on getting permits and so it's not uncommon to have ordinances requiring permits for larger Gatherings or gatherings in certain places with some kind of rational relationship to ensuring that we don't have five people so you know for not five people but five groups all agreement the same infrastructure at the same moment agree congestion or controversy that way and so we can manage our resources but we have to do so in a manner that is content neutral certainly not one that specifically targets political speech I would shy away from that kind of language especially as we talked about maybe Gilbert and sign codes and this sort of analysis that goes with those Free Speech the point they've made in this advocacy group is made and I've made in the passes or streets and sidewalks are traditionally considered public fora which is that is where your free speech rights are at their highest this seems to move in some degree in contravention of that so yes I would like the opportunity to amend this ordinance I guess I can prepare something for your review at a subsequent Workshop or meeting my only request is if there's a specific issue that this community feels this language is addressing or resolving that I'm made aware of that so that I capture what you the legislators wish to do within the confines of the U.S Constitution Florida Constitution and statutes the one other thing I would add to this I'm not remembering the statutory site off my head there's a similar constitutional Challenge and being being lodged against a statute that was adopted in the last two years last legislative session as part and Parcels of the Scott woke act and that's not language I'm making up that's addressing protests and streets and in response to some of the public discourse that happened in 2020 and there was this nationally change on where people can gather and impede retards slow stop traffic um this that is to say to the extent that was a concern of this ordinance there's a statute on point whether or not that statute will support will sustain its own scrutiny as something else but I did wish to make sure you're aware of that context as well because that's not exist when this was not thank you Mr Moore you're on the deadlines or we are on a deadline of the spot yes by April 10th if I'm giving your authority to draft an ordinance um this evening what I would respond to them within you know the next couple days would be correspondence directing them you know thank you for bringing this to our attention I received direction to amend this from intend to amend this and into in so doing to address any apparent constitutional defects or or other you know legal issues which is to say that we're not at no point for what it's worth at no point do we have any record of citing somebody for violating this at no point do we have any record to my knowledge of any permits denied specifically because all this is the political thing some of you even mentioned to me in side conversations I'm pretty sure I did political speech of some sort on the city Side never had an issue um so um you know with that said I would respond to them and indicate that is to say that to the extent they reached out to us in the last week we have not once replied to them and said this is our ordinance you know get lost we're standing by it and it's fine all we ask for is the opportunity to review it and that's what we intend to do right thank you we have uh we have two council members who were actually with either of you like to just kind of explain why the importance was changed and it kind of kind of touched on it but you were there it may or may not remember you are not there so you were not on council at the time you don't remember a good answer okay well I just thought I'd give them the opportunity would anyone like to uh see what before we go any further let's see I need to make a motion on this one or did we already do it I am so lost there was a motion in the second gun that was open that's right that's right okay great I'm sorry I got completely caught up in there okay all right so uh anyone would like to make any other comments we all know why we're here and uh and and what what we're trying to do and at least they will know that we are responding to their requests and [Music] pushback so that being said all in favor over there is from where you're authorized to draft an ordinance to address section 38 in 1987 . thank you Mr Mayor do you think it's possible we will have that draft by a good work session remind me that is the next group session 17 this should be assigned today yeah thank you sorry to burden you with them thank you right now we are on to 25 unfinished business thank you uh most of the things that were we've been discussing for supporting coverage so if we're good there so now we're on to item number 26 which is City Council of Communists this one right headlines program has selected council member Livingstone thank you I know thank you all for being here this evening thank you Kyle for everything you do for the city in Patty as well we really appreciate you and we're sorry that we're able to pass that on this evening foreign [Music] yeah I just wanted to make a comment um based on John's comment earlier at the same answer so um if you heard from city manager and he's setting up a meeting with the county representative so I also just wanted to reiterate to you there was a comment made at the conclusion of our meeting last month we had somebody that recommended you know maybe it's best to just let this issue go and not change anything I want everybody to know that that's not why I was elected so if there's any ever an opportunity to improve something in the city I'm going to pursue that I'm going to tell you right now I I feel like you do that the current design of that system and not to throw stones at whomever made those decisions previously this is not a good good traffic pattern that's going on now so I know there's better ways to do it and I'm confident that working with Kyle I'm getting input from other City members um we're gonna make it better and working with the county so there's improvements to be made and any final recommendation that we make will clearly be a benefit to the entire city in the discussion so that's the plan thank you Mr Roberts Mr Becker grew up uh just briefly as we begin Holy Week yesterday wish you all a bless you please pray that old Bellar Beach residents appreciate this masterpiece of God it's called inspiration uh yeah uh this past month we had a loss of a friend of many of us in the community and a family member of Joanne McIntyre just want to go with condolences to you Mr Mayor Wendy Michael and Mr Bob McIntyre as well she's a wonderful lady and secondly um I know it started over time here but a lot of you out there are still here with us we really appreciate that more importantly I want to publicly thank each of the council members I mean council member Banker Livingstone Otero Roberts vice mayor Shirley miraganis for what you do I mean I was away last week but you take time out of your family's lives to be here not only to be here but to prepare to do the working sessions and everything else I just want to thank you also thanks thank you Mr Isaiah vice mayor Sherman so I'd just like to take a minute to thank a local non-profit called Shepherd's Village it's a single family parenting program just over the bridge in down their Bluffs they sent me convertible kids over here to City Hall from Indian Rocks School Indian Rocks Christian Schools their missions week and they did quite a bit of landscape around City Hall pilot and tell us a little more about it but there's quite a pile of debris that I got a photograph of that they did a really great job and helped you know Community a bit and then also I just want to thank all of our boards for giving us a quarterly report it's nice to hear from everyone I appreciate it I appreciate everything that everyone's doing a little disappointing we've been here from from zoning again I know they have a project they're working on so it would have been nice for them to show up to the meeting today and thanks for hanging in there guys appreciate it thank you Mr Shirley all right concerning Beach nourishment this month I was able to meet on different days with county commissioner Chris labala and the Pinellas Public Works director Kelly they're both on board with 100 funding if the Army Corps is commissioner County Commissioner Janet law Kelly Levy and any of our speech mayor cookie Kennedy met with representative aluminum who has confirmed that she will approach the Army Corps from an environmental impact perspective to see if she can gain any traction so far I've seen no evidence of any Beyond let's just keep our fingers crossed mayor Kennedy seemed hopeful at the last big c meeting but like that tells me that County funding and management are the only way that we will get sand anytime soon if that happens it will still take at least two years to complete the project for the most part I would say that I've received very little pushback however let's see what happens whenever the whenever whenever they finally give us a final no we're not going to do this and you must get all your easements and where it helps so we'll see how that goes but I have confidence with a little more influence on the TDC and forward Pinellas we may be able to turn up the pressure a little bit more and uh see what happens so let's just keep the faith and wait and see as always I'd like to thank everyone who came out tonight as well as for those who are watching Wherever You Are Tonight do I have a motion to adjourn who should your exactly by Frank Baker and second by Mike Sable all in favor aye any opposed all right good night everyone"
