providing for an effective date or dates of proposed charter amendment or amendments this is the second reading if it passes tonight it goes to the on the ballot do i have a motion surely makes the motion second and second by mark council debate starting with jones early i'm i don't have anything further we've reviewed this already a second reading and i think for my look at it we're ready to go page forward of the ordinance i'm looking at section 3.01 city manager and it looks like the only thing that has changed was that it changed from one year to two years and could you just refresh my memory i i don't remember honestly i don't know if somebody else does but i think we did all of these across equal at the time we started with one and um just to make it consistent well the consistency would be for just one year though because everything went from six months to one year in presidency so yeah that's done i couldn't recall why i don't remember how to change that and why it's so important as i recall i think we were just concerned about the expedience of someone coming off council and moving into a position you know um of management in the city we just didn't think that was appropriate i think that there was a lot of discussion back and forth on it i don't know how he settled on that time frame but i do recall that being a topic we discussed by liv i i mean i remember i'm not saying one way is that's coming back to me a little bit i think we were concerned that it was a quick turnaround maybe to get a little bit of distance maybe between the one council and the other it's it's probably not something that's likely to happen too often but um i think that's what it was i don't know how it went up with two years but well we doubled the other ones and just figured we'd double this one because that's the consistency that i remember yes there was a discussion about it details um hard to say i don't recall i think i think the reason why we did that was because they would have an existing relationship with a city council it's basically you could be on that same council and move right into the management division therefore you effectively never leave the council it gives you at least one election what it does is it breaks that cycle like you said every two years there's at least one election here so i think that might might have been the reason again this is all coming back as other people are giving me hints here but i think that was the idea because if not i mean not this year but next year there's an election and the next election isn't for more than two years right before the next one yeah so um so yeah you could turn potentially if you had a favorable council all right i'll call my dad senior manager you [Music] anybody else i'll open it up to the citizens there's no citizen comments i'll come back to council to clearly get to the last word for me i'm going to call the question i got to read the whole thing again
