in the Pledge of Allegiance Pledge Al to the United States of America to the rep it stands Nation IND Justice R would you please call the road council member Frank bangard present council member Lloyd Roberts here council member Kim Shaw Elliot present mayor Dave gtis here city manager Kyle reefer here City attorney Randy MOA presid thank you Renee all right we'll get right to it this is a code review chapter 94 uh city manager reefer would you like to take it away thank you mayor I'm G to pass it along to L Sera and this is the chapter 94 zoning chapter we uh it's a it's a rather large chapter that covers a lot of uh the rest of the code of ordinances so we figured that um addressing the different points of this chapter will help us down the road to uh to get things arranged as we go through the remainder so l yes uh good evening everyone uh chapter 94 zoning is a long chapter there's a lot to it I think we'll do this like we did the last one if that's the way you want to go through this we'll just go through the sections and uh I've been we've been taking a lot of notes and i' be glad to answer any any of your questions uh the first section first article is uh article one in general and this does include the uh the definitions and the sections that are on the screen before you um incl landscape requirements uh be glad to answer any of your questions on this or take any of your comments okay are you asking us to comment on the table of contents well if you've gone through the what's in the section I can I can uh I can walk you through what's through some of this and uh give you you know our our observations uh if you like I just wasn't sure if you had a chance to go through um um but yeah I can I can go through that the the No No it's it's fine I I wasn't sure what you were asking us what the question was um let me address the council right quick did everyone have the opportunity to go through all of chapter 94 okay and did you pull out some items that you thought were important that you would like to change all right um is that is that kind of what you're looking for I think so that's sort of what H the way it worked out at the the previous workshop and uh I think it it worked out well and you don't want to hear me read all of this I hope so no NOP it's not necessary okay so uh yes Mr Roberts I was just going to recommend like I talked about the previous time we met that I don't think anybody knows or understands what most of the issues are with our citizens more than our city manager so Kyle it might be appropriate if you could kind of go through and let us know what you get the most phone calls about or challenges about or complaints about that really come to the Forefront sure could take all night well hold on one second before you do that because your list is probably not going to be the same as ours I actually picked out four items that did everybody do that did you have some Hit List did you too yeah let's uh let's just go around and if if it's if we've already covered it he won't have to address it is that okay with you yeah that's fine thank okay uh so Lloyd let's let's hear what you've got I know we discussed this briefly I think the last time so did is this what you were referring to I did not um I this is not my editing I had I had Renee printed out okay okay I'm jumping on your bandwagon but I I've got more information about that since you brought this to okay well uh if if that's U the same issue you were gon to talk yeah I have some question about it and I know there was a brief discussion we had last time so it would help me a lot it seemed like there was some specific challenges from some of our citizens regarding this particular definition going back five years so help me understand a specific scenario where it would benefit our our citizen by only going back one year I think is what the discussion was okay versus five years and before we even do that um it looks to me like we've been handed out a complete strike through and and I I was a little worried about that I didn't know if a complete let's just throw it out the window I'm afraid that it it might come back to bite Us in the rear so what my input on I would definitely love to hear why you did that okay I sat down with a neighbor that um had substantial damage during the Del and there's other people that had substantial damage in a Di and then got some more damage in the storm of December 2023 so I really wasn't aware of all this until you raised the I mean I really confident bringing this up but from what I see I talk to Kyle the fiveyear look back in the 50% rule could be very compromising with somebody repairing their house right this person's has I think $15,000 worth of damage to their house but their estimate only and I might be wrong a couple dollars off but basically they were only like $12,000 from being within the 50% Rule and this is nothing with the city this is FEMA they cannot repair their house so now they're gonna have to tear their house down or build yes and then what I bought to Kyle attention was well with a fiveyear look back could this something happen that that I had $50,000 damage last year a storm season's coming up and I get another 75 $100,000 damage this year do I have to tear my house down and I think if we had zero look back then then doesn't it doesn't it reset every year then so you can have zero look back and it would be per event or per permit project yes effectively okay but now it's five years right you know what I'm saying really a cumulative of five years so I mean you might as well just tear down the house if you have three or four storms there's another scenario also people come in and they buy a house that was recently flipped or someone's getting ready to put their house on the market so they do all these renovations to to make it have great Street appeal um they come in they buy this home with expectations of they're actually going to do more with it well they can't do anything with it immediately they're stuck they can't do any permitted projects because the person before that dumped a bunch of money into it before they sold it to to uh you know to bring it up to where it's worth more and uh so the first owner did they actually ex they couldn't have exceeded the 50% right so they had to apply for a permit with pelis County but it still tags on to the new earn I get that right so they put a permit in to the county and the county does these calculations and says okay you're under 50% we're stops with the city man city of b beach does the blood plane calculations okay they assist they who assist the the county they'll assist um they have their own program that they're responsible for but they they do cross check ours which helps okay so is this 100% to do with flooding I mean why is FEMA so actively involved in it uh I I can I can just offer a little bit of perspective here what what's what's going on is there are federal flood plane regulations that state if you the the FED 50% rule as it's referred to is if you conduct improvements or repairs in excess of 50 meeting or exceeding 50% of the structures value then you have to bring your structure up to Modern flood plane regulations for compliance purposes the rationale behind that is you avoid and I'm forgetting the the uh philosophical Greek analogy of this of the person who replaces piece by piece of their ship and at some point there's no original piece of the ship left but it is the same ship right right and so you avoid that and say okay if you're going to rebuild this then we want to rebuild it in a way that is from and regardless of people's perspectives on this that is responsible and consistent with modern design standards you know so elevating it above X feet above base flood elevation and other similar requirements the look back period in communities whether it's none at all to five years and I've seen even longer in some jurisdictions is to prevent somebody from saying if you have no look back whatsoever as Kyle suggested it is done permit by permit well if if I just break my project into a series of smaller parts this let's say my home is worth $100,000 understanding that's not really many homes anymore in b beach but let's say your home is $100,000 and I I plan to do $75,000 worth of repairs but instead I do a series 75 $1,000 repairs and I work around that 50% rule so from Community standards for their firm rating their insurance rating and otherwise to remain compliant with fma's guidelines they say okay we want to capture this so that on mass our properties are compliant and up to Modern design standards because it can won't necessarily on a single property but can affect your insurance rating with the federal flood plane program if your properties are knowingly not compliant with its standards and so this is a I hate to use this term given other recent discussions a check valve of sorts on that uh compliance process so that that's what we're talking about and there are guidelines that FEMA provides on determining what is the property value which improvements do you count and that's what Kyle's saying he he reviews in with the assistance of County and that time State Personnel to say hey I'm you know I'm a little unclear because he doesn't administer this on a day-to-day at at the same level and so he relies on the resources But ultimately those determinations at first blush are made at the local level so that's what we're talking about sure and so when you try to understand why have a look back period at all that's the why at all whether it's none six months one year five years that's ultimately your decisions as policy makers I'm not aware and and Kyle in his previous research I believe has stated that he's not aware of any absolute requirement that you have a look back period but again it's it's generally to facilitate your transition towards compliance and modernity if you will so what would be a potential risk if we got rid of the fiveyear look back and had none and so all of a sudden we were spending a lot of money in these homes what's the potential risk to the city if you have none whatsoever you run the risk of people and I don't mean this derisively playing a little more fast and loose right and saying well I can never ion Milan will ever be reach the 50% threshold because they'll just phase their project in a way to ever avoid being there if you have that 50% willle you capture whether it's hey I just moved into a remodel I'm I'm now stuck with the fact that they've already done $95,000 worth of improvements on this $200,000 house so I'm limited to five and wait a year and then I can do it right um but those are the sorts of concerns and again I'm not opining on what you should have just that's how it works and coming from the building trade and working in different states that have Val wage minimum wage laws a lot of cities and states have a minimum of $100,000 anything over they have to have a prevailing wage Ta on to it so a lot of these municipalities will do a lot of these projects 75 95,000 rather than doing a 500,000 or five you know million dollar job so we're so what I'm saying is yes we are giving the residents the opportunity to spruce up their homes you know in the 50% Mark by peac mailing it but every time they submit a permit we get attack your taxes generally go up and we get we get a benefit out of it and and Dave I I commend you again like you're talking about Aesthetics like somebody sells a house I'm talking about somebody getting wiped out well yeah I get that I know that there are some Provisions in our code uh that deal specifically with emergencies uh can you kind of elaborate on that Kyle is this relating to the 50% rule or I'm I'm not sure I I I've focused on 94 but I thought that there was another section that that had a slightly different set of rules for castrop catastrophes yeah the flood plane management and the way that I read it is the fiveyear look back applies to the Improvement side of things but when you look at the definition I know which is chapter the other thing is Kyle's like the hall monitor here he gets he gets it dumped on because he's enforcing the law and people start hating him because they're saying oh you're you're you're screwing me over but he's not he's just well well it's terrible for the position that Kyle is in to have to be the the the no guy yeah and because chapter 74 is that's our flight plane management chapter and that's based on a Model that was provided by FEMA and if you go to our substantial damage well we're looking can I ask another question um just understanding um the framework this is working in so let's say following up in your question that if there's a violation so we somehow don't manage this appropriately that goes into our insurance ratings for blood plane management is is that correct uh it can I I've not seen that directly how that how that happens in a community but it is a factor in your um flood plane Insurance risk management rating your firm reading and I don't know that that's the right acument I was making it up and what happens with that I mean is that a is that some sort of Federal program for which there are penalties or does that go into commercial carriers ratings what what happens with that rating as I'm not an administrator I'm not in a position to intelligently speak to that beyond the you know the obvious statement that it if it affects your rating it can affect policies I don't know if that's at the at the consumer level or if that's in a you know they provide you know Dow grading you know Moody's has now downgraded you I don't know honestly um but I I just know that there's been discussion there's often a discussion in Barrier Island communities about trying to maintain their firm rating for the discounts that are provided and and the rates that are provided to end users and understanding member Banker's research and efforts on are we actually seeing these discounts and everything else I can't begin to app on that um but that's generally my understanding I I don't have a more informed answer to give you as it's not my my role do you have something to add to that well yeah generally yeah that's a pretty good explanation it's a point system and you you get point for doing certain things and once you get the different points that add up you get to different levels and the better the rating the better the insurance rates are for a community so the communities really fight to to keep those uh ratings to in order to get the better rates for the residents on flood insurance okay so FEMA comes up with these ratings in part to implement National policy regarding our flood planes but then that rate is used commercially for setting insurance rates is that correct correct yeah and not and that's just one factor like I said it's it's one one factor may not change your rating but because it is based on points but it all goes to the same thing and uh communities it is a valuable thing to have a better rating for the residents and just to note there is a national lawsuit against the nfip FEMA because they have proven that they haven't given these points and deductions and breaks to to cities communities and people what you're trying to yeah and that's still in the courts but they're they've not revealed their formula their magic formula for determining how uh what those rates are thank you the black box yeah it's not published anywhere and no one can answer the question you just get it and not in a good way uh so um I I do have a little bit of apprehension about going to no uh no lookback period and uh the reason why is because there's going to be there there's too much room for abuse uh we don't have the staff for continuous over and over projects from all these homes that have been waiting a long time um I think that moving to one year would be a good trial balloon to see if that's sufficient I understand that um in a storm situation uh a lot of things could happen but if it's one that's completely destroyed it's gonna take a year to fix it anyway oh no argument and but the other thing I wanted to point out is all these codes that we're reviewing we're probably not going to get to counsil till late summer early fall you know what I'm saying right and I really think this should be addressed in a separate ordinance before before the storm season oh well that's that's uh that's possible yeah we could probably do that um I I don't I would advise the council to ignore the second strike out completely we this is a FEA regulation it has to be in there whether it's zero one or five years or any time that we select uh you still have to rely on the the 50% of fair market value so um just keep that in mind and uh I'm in favor of one year um I'm in favor that that that'll get it moved and I think I agree and I think what you're implying there is if we do the one year and for some particular reason down the road we find out that didn't work the way we thought we could then revisit it and alter yes yeah um can I ask what our neighboring communities generally do and secondly do we need a legal opinion that this would not in any way impact our grandfathering I just always want to be we lost our grandfathering in 2.0 no no no no she's referring to the short-term rental grandfathering is that right well I mean does it mean did we touch anything regarding zoning or is it only regarding it's only regarding short-term rentals as long as we don't touch that and that's the Holy Grail of code all right we just need to enshrine it and and paint it on the walls um okay so it's that I can let that go it's just limited to short-term rentals city manager reer uh do you see any reason whatsoever that we that we should not switch to one year I mean just from a like a flood plane manager standpoint it's always better to have a longer look back because the the goal is to give people to to build up not invest as much money where it can flood but build up or knock down and build up well build up knock down change convert the bottom floor I mean there's there's different methods but they're expensive um but so I can't say there's definitely there's no benefit to having it um because there is a benefit for flood plane management but when it comes to just you know the big picture benefiting the residents and letting them upgrade I mean we'd still be participants in the National flood insurance program we wouldn't be violating anything there um like I said I I look back and we we were not scored for the credit the credit that we' earn for the fiveyear look back is not very significant it wouldn't affect us in any way and what do you think the impact will be on you and your staff with the additional permit it'll actually I mean I don't think you're going to see a large influx of permits just because of the look back rule um it it actually is a burden for us because we have to track everything so a shorter look back is going to be easier for us would be easier that makes sense okay does anybody have any OB objections to uh reducing it to one year no no okay any objections about getting this for this whole um what we can do is uh this is a work session um you know he's right it's probably not a bad idea just to go ahead and do an ordinance in the next work in the uh next council meeting and we just go ahead and get that one on the books because storm season is coming the the only um hesitation I have I gotta I'll double check with with uh Kyle on this is just making sure if anything in your code mandates that this kind of provision go before your Planning and Zoning Board before it go before you um that might be a limit to this getting to you quickly not as late as November um to be sure but um if you know if we have a meeting in like two or three weeks it may not be on that agenda only if if the process requires it go before your pnz before it get to you confirm we'll just confirm the appropriate process so just in case if we didn't do it uh in the April meeting then it would be May June June because we have to do it twice Soh everybody go over that okay good thank you thank you again for raising this issue you're very welcome okay uh what else did we have now that we've gotten that one out of the way I I had one you find it right quick I think these were some that we already discussed uh 94 six Landscaping uh mulch talked about Mulch and the Damage that it it creates whenever we uh have torrential downpours and flooding and things like that uh am I the only one with concerns I think we did we did discuss that and if I'm not mistaken I think Randy you brought up the part that if we attempt to start for lack of a better term dictating the type of mulch as an example people should be using that may cause some issues in as much as I've apped on it on the past my advice was simply that as you don't presently regulate the substrate that is used doing so now could be perceived as a more burdensome or restrictive Land Development regulation within Senate Bill 250 but more broadly as part of this discussion the general understanding of this process is most of what we're discussing here will not be brought to you for passage until after that period in Senate Bill 250 um lapses in October of 23 I mean of 24 um to my knowledge and I've been asking planning officials I was just on a call with some planning officials on Friday on another matter and asked if they were aware of anything in this current session that extended that um nobody's aware of it we're continuing to look to make sure there's you know these things get hidden in fun little places but absence some kind of extension of that moratorium will be able to do so come the fourth quarter of the year so nothing would prevent you generally speaking from moving forward with that of course you'll have to we we'll have to figure out how we want to administer that if you've got dozens of proper that already have that obviously we're not that would be a non-conforming something um so we would have to talk about that but um yeah it's not something you're just altogether prohibited from regulating it's a Time limitation on when you can begin the problem with it is um it gets into the storm sewers and um it goes into the bay it goes in you know everywhere and it's got that depending on what color it is a lot of it has that dye in it so it's an ecology issue it's a safety issue it I've seen it completely cover a neighbor's yard I've seen it completely cover the the boat ramp I've seen it completely clogged drains it's a mess it's useful I I get it it's useful and it's something that that many people rely on and it's cheap compared to just about everything else but um is this something that we should see seriously consider doing away with or putting a regulation on it and then you have to think about everyone already has it well are they allowed to replenish it as it deteriorates or is that it and and how do you police it punishing it would be tough to police it'd be kind of having to make a transition think it would be easier from code enforcement I think people would be getting more in there and it'd be hard to tell something that we might think about with issues such as this is is rather than having more laws maybe we can initiate more communication and education I think most people want to be good conservationists but they just don't know what to do like I never even thought about that the fact that there was dye in in mulch never thought about it so maybe we could use a committee somewhere or or start launching some better educational material and and publish it get it out to the community well in the words of the former city manager who was my neighbor when I was putting down the mulch in my yard he says you know that stuff floats and I said i' never thought that and it did and he says that's why we use shells in the and the uh as far as making more laws it's actually it would be less code than what we have now right now there's three paragraphs that cover this and you could sum it up with one sentence if you uh but you could also actually put in there why why it's you know it's the because of the flooding issues and the mess it makes and plogging and but I don't know I mean my only advice on this and this is not intended to sway the conversation but to inform it my only advice on this um and I'm going to rep repeat this in each of these discussion is is the reminder of concerns about enforceability from your your staff's side and also whether in fact you wish for this to be enforced um because understand at some point somebody's going to come up to you and say mayor can you believe I got cited $125 because I put mulch in my front yard what's this about I thought this was free Florida and da da d d da d d and you and as long as it's a value of this community and you can stand by that and say well it is but this is the reason and we think it's good policy whatever that's fine but just be prepared to stand by Stand By and behind whatever you enact so you're not putting your staff in the position of well I was in well we never thought you were going to sight anybody we just wanted to kind of send the message well if we want to send the message on on things and I'm not saying this is that but if it is then opportunities like education are are usually a better way than you know 110 or $125 fine because you know somebody was gardening on a Saturday if that's your concern well so just I'm just again I'm not I don't have an opinion on it I just want to make sure we're clear on that as we go through and change things Well here here's where I'm where I'm at right now it does create a problem and right here in our code we're giving them in instructions on what they're supposed to do with it which means we're inviting people in our code I would if if we're all about education and you don't want them to do it then I would recommend removing it completely if that's if that's the stance the council wants to take what section are we reviewing right now it's on page seven 946 yes sir along Kim's lines I I think possibly I me don't know until we do it this way but more of a recommendation as part of like a pamphlet would go out for the new homeowners or or everyone and we would have it on the website that this is what we recommend and here's why we're recommending this you know instead of it being an actual enforceable code which is going to cause problems um I think a large percentage of our of our citizens would probably get on board with that just like Kim was referencing a lot of people don't know that it's a problem but if we had some type of a of a document or information on our website that explained Landscaping requirements and part of that was the use of mulch and why we don't recommend that necessarily they do make nonfloating mulch I don't know how well it works I have seen that it's called another word yeah but they they do make a type of um bark and mul out there that theoretically is supposed to not float um I actually used it when I was in loots for a while because it was parts of my yard where it would puddle and Float off it stayed I don't know how big of a storm it would take to move it but again I think um the education approach and recommendation approach of saying hey here's what we recommend here are the products we recommend here's why we're recommending this and we would appreciate your help with that because here's the problem it causes I think a lot of the people would come on board and I think the mayor is uh bringing this to the council's attention and my problem is puddling is one thing it doesn't really even the stuff you buy at Home Depot doesn't really move but when you have two or three feet of water sure and waves in your street it's I don't care what it is it's going to move yeah and like I said I mean he he said it best I mean some people didn't have any of it in their yard and their whole yard is just covered with it well I think there's plenty of sites out there we can look through to determine what are the best U materials to use in landscaping that aren't going to be subjected to floating way whatever those are well here's my here's my recommendation obviously we're it seems pretty hardcore to um say you can't put mulch in your yard I understand that and the only reason why I bring it up is because I saw what happened especially in your neighborhood on your street in your neighborhood on your street um I didn't see it so much where mine was at but I didn't flood uh so I would like let's just bypass this one for now let's add this to another work session and continue this conversation and see if we can come up with some solutions I don't want to bog the whole meeting down on this one topic I had I had two more that are on page 34 and that was dealing with the number of stories I'm so sorry 34 yeah page 34 that was dealing with a number of stories uh with homes being built find it height code that's my page 3445 or is it say something you know what it says on there is not what it is unfortunately it says 34 on here in the actual page 9429 94 209 Heights OH I'm way 209 I'm at 220 be page 26 page 26 of 45 yeah thanks W it's funny Adobe marked it is Page 34 I don't know why anyway uh so what it was was under heights yeah um the first uh recommended change was changing two to three habitable stories alongside a garage or storage area so that would be making use of the space that you're not supposed to use if you have a three-story home uh then right behind that is or um you add insert two over a garage or storage area so you're still limited to three stories even if you don't make the bottom story habitable does that make sense yeah so two above the garage or three from the garage level up does it change anything with the overall height overall height Remains the Same okay you're you're you're making more taxable right square footage in the same box the one thing that did change the overall height is when we adopted the Florida building code with the one footer freeboard because our high code is based off of the base flood elevation okay but there's the base flood elevation and then there's the design flood elevation that's including the freeboard so given that um we could adjust our height code to be based on the design flood elevation as opposed to the base flood elevation because they're kind of getting shorted a foot because you're only going 35 feet above whatever your map says BFE is but then you got to design blood elevation so you have to go at least one foot higher for your liable floor so just that changed when we adopted that freeboard that we might want to go to so instead of 35 it would be 36 um well you could just say um just change what 35 above the DFE instead of the BF because the DF can change based on what the freeboard is okay that and that's the peak of the roof 3 yes yeah it doesn't include any Towers want to start did you get that I did yeah and and that's uh that's more how more communities knew it based on a design flood elevation okay the tower was an inside and so that was three stories or two stories the two stories are above the garage or three stories are beside the garage and so an example of the te two stories would be where you're in a lower elevation and you could go two stories above your garage that was all I had how about you lloy well the artificial turf synthetic grass because I just had run across that relatively recently we addressed that yes and we wrote it it was like in 22 Yeah so that that should be pretty good I believe have we had any issues come up with that no um I've had two new homes use artificial turf and I've been following you know the screening from the road and the you know if they use it in the front they have to have it between things like that yeah so we've been we've been following it um the one thing I'm have to pay close attention to is there was a there was a a section there talked about if you already had it and within so many years you had to replace it yeah get it to code our whatever that is yeah the only thought I had when I read it because I know we spent a decent amount of time making sure that this was best for the city and I think it is the way it was written it is written um but I thought of Mike because he was actually allergic to grass and that was that was the main reason that he had artificial grass so my thought is why do we actually have that part of the code in there discussing the front yard only that you can only have it in the front yard if it's used in 4 inch maximum spaces between blocks and things like that as opposed to if somebody was I mean that that to me sounds like a legitimate reason why you wouldn't want grass real grass anywhere around you if you're really allergic to it type of the deal but I was just curious why did we why wouldn't why would we allow the artificial Turf that meets our restrictions as the type of in the sides and the back obviously the back is probably not seen but in the front we allow it but only in a manner that we're going to have it between blocks that just seems like a lot of work why why wouldn't we allow it assures some of the houses there are totally artificial right I was just curious just the Aesthetics of yeah it's uniformity yeah trying to create a certain look and feel in the community and um cruising right along and all of a sudden this crazy looking green that stands right I'm guessing that's why okay why that happened all right just I was just when I was reading that through again I thought wow that's interesting but you're right on the other side of the street we see the artificial it's R there a lot of do that yeah yeah and then on the side it says it can be there but you can use mes uh you can screen it you know with Landscaping fences or whatever world over there I just wonder how the drainage is like because the old stadiums and that you had to rip that up every three or four years because it went drain and then you have the zambon sucking it up and everything like that yeah I so we have it we say it's considered perious and it is so any any rain everything goes right through it but then it gets clogged what I'm saying right through dirt different stuff did you have other items on the fences Kyle if you recall I was just here a little while and I was replacing a wooden fence that was that need to be replaced and at the time I spoke with someone that said well if you're replacing an existing fence that's beyond repair with a new fence and if it's not the same material it required a permit and is that have we already changed that because I didn't see that this go around because I was replacing a wooden fence with a vinyl fence and we had just a brief discussion and I think the decision was made well it did not require permit even though it was using a different material fence it was going in the exact same place yeah that same he I think with fences you have to be careful if if it's a repair as is kind of like a dock when they're just repairing the boards it it's fine if it's the same but if you're switching material then what if you're switching the height in different areas and you know you have a lot of things that stipulate exactly I have a good example as to um why that would be and I I may be wrong but this would be my guess whenever the county comes out and they inspect the fence it is the county right County does a wall because a wall okay okay who inspects the actual fence when it okay so you inspect it a certain way and you verify that the post is in the ground there's concrete blah blah blah but you also look at the way that it's attached well you take a borign type of say a hybrid plastic or something like that it's not going to attach the same way you're not going to nail it in so how how are you going to do that and I and I think what it is is is that if you're you can repair it but you need to put it back the way that it was inspected unless you change the whole thing would be my guess right and that's that's what I was doing at the time the only reason I brought it up I couldn't find that this time and you and you had showed me before uh when I was talking to you about replacing the fence that there was information that's stipulated if you're using a different M if you're replacing an entire fence and it was made of wood and you're tearing the wood down and putting up a different product that that would require a permit I think any V replacement uh I don't know about I thought you could repair a small section but I didn't think you could tear out your entire fence and put it back up without a permit and inspection how about neighbor a has a wooden fence he doesn't want to take it down so neighbor B put something right next to nylon fence you need a permit right y because my first question to my neighbor I didn't know who owned the fence I said is this my fence or your fence and because it was falling down he said well it's obviously your fence I said no problem he go in with your uh cost no I didn't it was all good good neighbor but um that again when I was reading it through this time so maybe it was in a different code where it address that um placing an entire F because I didn't see it this this go through it's not not a big deal I was just wondering I know it discusses exact materials you can use um one thing I always advise people when they're replacing a fence or changing things around you really should have it surveyed or at least have the the fence company locate The Monuments for the property because you're you'd be surprised what you think is yours is not yours at all right if you don't have a surve for the house you shouldn't be on someone else's property putting a new fence up yep anything else um we can move on to somebody else I've got something I may bring up okay all right I have quite a few questions just in terms of um questions mostly for what you're experiencing um so one is uh sheds have we had any issues with sheds and is that something we need to think about in terms of our ordinance that's uh 110 we haven't had any major issues with what we have on the books now there was a when they made the code for the shed that is our only additional um structure that you you're allowed on your property as far as like an accessory building is the shed and it's got very defined rules on size height um win rating and it also I think said something along the lines of if you already had a shed that didn't didn't get form the so when they when that got put in place uh the previous city manager he really went through and and eliminated a lot of the violations that were whether it was you could it was in the setback whether you could see it from the road whether you had multiple sheds so I I think after that first sweep it hasn't been an issue I think it's a good good section of code okay good uh 206 deals with wood frame construction and I thought this was interesting in that it can be constructed a a building can be constructed with basically what a third party says is okay and what has our experience been with that and is that too broad of a of a delegation to a third party I'd have to check this with somebody who knows the building code well because it might might get trumped by the building C okay because it says it's basically it says that you can use wood so long as it's of the type that a structural engineer or a licensed architect says is okay so I'm sure somebody that wants something questionable can do some shopping among Architects and Structural Engineers and find an opinion that suits them is that okay or have we had any problems or we haven't had any problems um usually especially with the engineers like the structural engineers if you know their license if they're willing to sign off it's on them right um uh Earth firms are prohibited I was just wondering why that was in a definition and it is on page 37 item 21 Earth perms are not permitted just wondering why some people use that as a landscaping technique that have a little hilic with we isn't is that what we're talking about some sort of little hilic with a tree on it and some plantings or what's meant here I don't know why for how long that's been there can you shed anything on that what's a section number um it is is 21 page 37 yeah it's under uh 251 sub 21 I think my page numbers are different but oh it's 37 page 37 I'm thinking it's related to drainage I was just wondering why it's there I mean I'm not a proponent of firms I just don't know why that's right it's probably to keep your neighbor from putting a big heel in his yard that would be my guess well okay well if it's not been a problem I guess doesn't come up um is there anything in our code which would address Landscaping of the type that we see occasionally where people kind of put in a desert landscape you know they basically get rid of yeah hero landscape yeah do we care about that and is that we have several of them around town do we like them do we do we not do do is that an issue it's a reduction in water usage sft mud light Swift mun likes it a lot yeah the only problem we have is at one point they were installing in the asphalt underneath the The Rock oh no of weed a maintenance issue too that the weed start coming up and you might I mean it looks like everybody's doing it well now but yeah because even if you do put a barrier for weeds eventually you're going to get enough organic material in there it's going to grow weeds and then you start putting more chemicals on which is not good anybody have any thoughts about that know it's hard to stick a flag in into them oh yeah yeah I brought my hammer and screwdriver yeah I I haven't I haven't heard any complaints um section 255 we have a a requirement that if a project exceeds $20,000 you have to get an appraisal um what's been our experience I personally would either be fine with getting rid of that um because we're tracking this anyways um and the way it's worded is it says you know you're required to get an appraisal of Nafi you have uh property that's the structure is worth a lot of money um and you are trying to do something minimal to like add like replace some windows or something and you just decide you want to use what the property appr appraiser has for the Fela 50% value I think that's very reasonable as opposed to you know you're trying to do you know all doing window replacement a lot most window jobs now are over $20,000 and um to have to like go get an appraisal on top of it exactly how old is this langage pretty old um early 90s oh just uh being The Devil's Advocate how how would you track what the value of the upgrade is we we track it because you have to write the value of the permit as it comes through so we have we we typically use 20,000 as a marker um to to look into the history some more um but when it comes to getting an appraisal just that that's a burden to the residents um if we are doing a uh we're going to be doing the substantial Improvement affidavit anyways um for you know where they're going to get a value right um it's just whether I mean requiring that they do an appraisal for some there's a lot of people that just want to do an improvement to their house and they're fine just using what the value is on the property appraiser so trying to figure out how the county is going to establish a taxable value for an upgrade uh and it sounds like this is that's what this is in here for is so that they can establish that but are are they not doing that now I don't I don't believe so because we're we're just using appraisals as an option because if you use what the property appraiser says for their value you're not going to get as much as you would from an independent appraisal so we we allow it because gives them a little bit more to work with so you're asking would they use that actual number as as a tool to add to the appraisal value for the county I don't think they they do that they're they're pulling those numbers from somewhere because you see there's a there's a value on every project that's done on the permits side of things whenever I look at at the I go to the property apprais they show everything shows all the things that have been done and there's a cash value out to the side they're using that's probably what this is talking about Randy can you add anything to this no ma'am I cannot I think that's the property praiser uh calculations for so like the work gets permitted and they're tracking the value of the permit at the very bottom and then as they re-evaluate the the structure in the property and whatever was done to it they're calculating that just wonder where they get the number that they're plugging into that the the value of the project when they get that from any permit oh I mean you can get a permit on a project but how many times are you over budget something doesn't something doesn't go right or I've noticed that typically those values are low as compared to what you actually spend of course of course I think everything um that they appraised through the property pra area tends to on the lower side yeah try to be fair about it I'm fine with taking it out everyone else yeah yeah okay it just seems like a burden people don't need to one more hoop they don't need to jump through and the last thing that I have is that I assume we're going to have some sort of discussion on um antennas and Towers I just I'll that one I don't think that's an issue for anybody here I'm joking that discussion we have had um some of that discussion I will tell you as as recently as the last few days I even exchanged correspondence with the um lawyer who had represented the gentleman through the last process first thanking him for facilitating his client coming into compliance with the existing code but also asking um if there were any samples he offered not because we would fully endorse necessarily their approach but again to give us the full complement of information as we consider what revisions we want to implement but uh that is an issue we are um certainly tuned into on what structural limitations we want to provide and making sure if we are going to reasonably accommodate amateur antenna radios as Federal Law requires that we have clear criteria rather than leaving it up to guesswork on how that'll be navigated well I brought up about hype and don't take this the wrong way like you couldn't give like a definition you know how high because yeah you now that I'm at 60 ft can I go to 120 for sure 240 so the Challen the challenge with this is much like when we discuss variances right in in in variance parlance when you're seeking a variance one of the things in our code and in most codes that you have to establish and I think Mr SEL speak to this as well is that it's the minimum variance necessary so in our code we can have a presumptive limitation of some reasonable height let's say we allow flag poles to be 25t or something like that we say okay fine 30t is generally allowed other than that we can't say absolutely nothing over 30t we could say 30 ft is the limit but you may be able to get a variance if you can establish a and C when you look at federal guidelines one of the things that says is you can have a height limit but if they can establish that 40 feet is the minimum height necessary to operate and receive signals for that amateur radio antenna a city is likely going to have to make that reasonable accommodation now if they can accomplish that at 40 ft but they're looking to go to 65 no no 40t is the number you might want 65 but you've proven that you know we've established that 40 is what you need so when when we talk about the amateur radio antenna Towers one I I I don't want to give this an outsized amount of attention in this process in in the 30 years there's been one that's proven a challenge and that doesn't I don't mean to diminish the concern for those that property owner who attempted to erect it and his neighbors and their respective concerns but it is not not as though this is a you know great issue in our community that's proliferated in a way the way some other communities are dealing with short-term rentals for example but if we're going to regulate it we should do it intelligently with an eye towards what the regulations are so at the risk of beating the dead horse yes we are aware of that we are trying to craft it in a way that is cognizant of and compliant with modern state and federal standards and the challenges with telecommunications especially is those preemptions keep growing sure well so my general questions were one was it seemed like the one problem that we did have stemed from the fact that that particular application ended up being an antenna right the whole thing was considered an antenna it has more to do and and and I can speak to you me Miss Elliott just because you do have a legal background there's a bit of a legal fiction that the Tower and the antenna once joined are functionally one and an antenna and our code treated those as differently and in fact before I received any meaningful guidance from or or information from opposing Council if you will in this process I looked at our code and said our code treats a tower and antenna separate things but once you start to look at how the case law actually treats them and how communities are often overturned the legal fiction is once the tower is mounted to the antenna they are it is all considered the antenna so anyway do we address that going forward would be one of my questions you know how do we get sensitive to that so somebody doesn't put up yet another one and the other observation I had is are there any prohibitions of leasing that space or that capability so let's say someone has erected a large antenna and is using it for their ham radio oper operation but they start putting microwaves on it and selling it to the you know a satellite C company or something is there anything that would prohibit a commercial use of it well I think at the point that you put a commercial use then you immediately remove it from the scope of being an amateur radio antenna um I can think of other situations that I'd rather not provide a road map to in this context that I'd be happy to discuss with you privately that we may not be able to necessarily prevent or limit um but generally speaking it would have to remain an amateur radio antenna tower within FCC guidelines and one of those is that it is not used for commercial purposes um so if you start um leasing the real estate that is the antenna itself to say oh now you can put a satellite dish on here and a you know and and Time Warner can do this and all that then I I think we would have an argument that it's no longer an amateur radio antenna tower or at least exclusively being used in a way that's consistent with those regulations um we can certainly if we're going to get into that that that level of um proactive regulation we can you know say that it shall be limited to the imager and not provide you know vertical access if we start once we start drafting language we can definitely be sensitive to that yeah that that would be my thought here's my problem 20 minutes ago we were talking about height of a house 35 fet yes sir Okay so why can't I build my house 60 feet if we're allowing antennas because there's not federal regulations preempting our regulation of the issue I mean it's it's it's as simple as we are in the hierarchy of of of government authorities we are baby brother and so if big brother is going to tell us otherwise then we just got to follow those rules I mean that's really the the simplest distillation of it is is the state and the federal guidelines have told us you cannot place an absolute limit I'm not saying we can't place a limit if we do place a limit we just have to recognize we may later have to have some reasonable accommodation there's no similar guidance for a residential structure at least not yet knock on whatever the closest thing to being wood is um but a mes so um to I guess to put an end to this portion of the conversation Le is gonna fix it and I'll just pass if anything our code is is more restrictive in this particular case than it should be is that right or is it that our code works just fine but he's going to sh it up a little bit so that we better understand what we're up against my honest assessment is your code can use Improvement there were a lot of ambiguities in this process that we the fact that we had to search code to determine is this a structure is it within a setback are there sight limit like we should be able to better Define that and it be presented one of the delays in the permitting process was trying to tell the applicant what this is and is not within our code I think we can improve our code and in improving our code bring it more into compliance with the modern parland and and regulations and we probably would have been able to do that sooner had a certain individual actually applied for a permit right I mean that that was part of the process there was you know and but I I think honestly if my personal reflection as a City attorney I'm glad that the gentleman is in compliance now but I think that this was also a testament to how well-run your city is because the gentleman came into the code enforcement process saying I'm not applying for a permit because they're just going to deny me and no one's going to take my permit seriously and instead that's exactly what this community did you did a very detailed review of your regulations applied the ones that you could voiced your concerns with the permitting officials about the things you couldn't regulate but wanted to make sure they were addressed they were addressed to all regulating authorities limits and they ultimately got the permit that they thought was impossible I think that's a testament to this community doing its job and serving its residents so yes to the to the extent he assumed it was futile that delayed the process um but similarly to the extent it was assumed that we could stop this and in a moment ago Miss Miss Elliot you suggested you know as long as we can we can stop this we can't stop this we can regulate it better um but I cannot promise you that if even after we amend our code if somebody comes with an application that they will not be able to regulate an amateur radio antenna because the law strongly favors the ability to do that no I understand that and I see that both for your benefit but also the record if you will anything else Miss Elliott no thank you okay Mr Banker two points you raised and I raised I'm satisfied and I thank you for it all right very welcome and Mr rer um some of the things I just brought up um with Louie was a non-structural fill maybe have some some guidelines on that um say that one more time please structural fill okay where you know people are bringing in or they're they're putting their seaw wall caps and then they're filling up their yards um and causing a big difference between their neighbor's yard and their yard and using the uh the um kind of wall That's not meant to be a retaining wall as a retaining wall in some situations so that's something I wanted to look into I wanted to look into flag poles because we don't anywhere in the code really Define where a flag pole can be flag pole yeah um we have some with it in the sign but I think this also crosses over into the zoning because it's the placement of where it is um then we have a height restriction we talked about that a year ago or some FL BS like 35 fet we were talking about in the sign area yeah right that and um the flag size um then we mentioned before and we'll we'll come up with something where the the hedges and the plants in the in the front setback um taking into consideration some of like the cacs and things that we could make exceptions for um but I think that was more you wanted us to craft what we thought the language should be I'm me bring it to you [Music] um I think it would be in this section but I maybe some basic guidelines of holiday decorations and not trying to create a whole bunch of rules but maybe having some rules they have to be down within three months of the holidays or maybe height because we did recently have a talking about the giant balloon the giant balloons yeah okay I mean I don't think it was a danger to anyone but people may not want something that big next to them were just during a certain time span whenever it really was I mean I don't know where you're talking I've seen some in multiple towns where I mean people drive for Miles just to see them I got a neighbor I take my hat off to him he decorates his whole yard up some inflatable I mean nothing it's big and right after Christmas they're down I mean right after Christmas that's a good thing there but I mean people go up and down the street just to look at it yes so that would be great C you're saying you guys would put something together yeah about that let us review it I I would say that my my opinion on I have two opinions one is that uh uh leaving Li up for a long long time maybe is that a free speech thing is are you speaking whenever you're throwing light colored lights all over your I mean there's definitely a free speech analysis that would have to be done I'm not I'm not saying that it would be absolutely protected by the First Amendment um you know when you start getting into design Aesthetics Free Speech comes up as a concern and again maybe you have lights on but then they put one up that says like stop the war and they use Christmas lights so now that analysis is different um but you know the the the caution again against the the line between an HOA and a community on regulating Aesthetics I really don't think it's a big problem in belir beach with year round Holiday Lights uh the the giant balloon in high winds does worry me a little bit it's I mean culturally it's just also you know they are marketing and selling things like this right like we're as we get into Halloween there's skeletons that are now the size of and home people just announce the skeleton's GNA have a dog that's roughly the same size that you can buy so you know um that's also these these things can sometimes be cyclical in terms of BS why put out 35 small decorations when you could put out one giant one anything else um there was a things I brought up with the Flor area ratio that we're going to look into just defining that um because when you're building when you're building like over a store garage storage area and you're building two stories above um the way it's defined right now and the code is saying that you'd have to count the garage storage area and your Flor area ratio can't be so because it would sever severely limit you and how big so we're kind we're looking into that Pi up with a better definition um just a little bit more mention of generators what's the uh what about generators really just getting them talked about I they've been interpreted as the same encroachment uh or feet like you can have your condenser but just to have it in there and fixed generator not a port yes your fixed generators um like I mentioned before I wanted to look into I don't know if this can be done um in any specific way but where we have side back s sorry side set backward um ex exemption um or exceptions in uh Belo State Island if there's something we can do with the making it possibly more reasonable for someone to be able put a dock in you know some kind of consideration for the lots that have the vared I uh obviously I'm going through this process right now and I've put a lot of thought into it um I think much as it pains me to say it I think the reason why they have the 12 foot setback is because you can get a big boat in there and what if your neighbor wants a big boat too and it's less than 24 feet well now you're you may be creating conflict now you want to reduce it I'm all for it because I'll never own a boat that size but I'm just saying that may be why it's 12 Fe right anyone have thoughts on that speaking of big boats we've had the largest I've seen since I've been here is a 65f footer um for Marina that um off of you know one of the water Lots okay um but there was no code violation there were some neighbors that were concerned because they couldn't see anything off the back um but there wasn't an actual code violation or any kind of navigable violation of the waterways so I don't know if that's something we would want to think about a maximum yeah length it you know it's uh it it's not too far out there where it's at uh but I can understand and concerns you know um what about the T rights on the inlet I mean like saying if you're living on the beach I have the right to view the water and everything like that but then he's saying well this guy put a 65 foot boat in there now it takes my whole view out is there Mr attorney s is there an answer to that loral rights on the bay or loral rights on the bay um my short answer would be to to defer back to the discussion we had when there was some concern about the number of boats in the Waterway which is to say the city does not regulate the Waterway so once the boats are in the water that's not really our prview what I'm saying is it's block I I this guy has a 65 foot boat I live here I can't see to the left you know yeah you're no right of view left and right of your property and that is a consistent issue that comes up in Co communities whether it's hey they they put up palm trees now or they put up a sculpture that I don't like to look of and now I can't see the sunset the way I used to you have no right to a view across your neighbor's property you you can you can look straight out and even as you're straight out only because in some of these Coastal communities we have what have alternatively been described as fingers or you know a series of of of cacs that view each other while you have a right straight out you don't have a your right straight out stops at that next property line so so you don't have a right straight out to then govern what you can see on the neighbor's property across the water um but you know of course somebody can't come and build a wall at the rear of your seaw wall to block you but you can't say I used to enjoy the sunset in the East and now they've put up a a slide for their kids and I can't that's not a thing right just no I appreciate the question it's a common question yeah and and and also a common assertion made and course I don't mean to to draw you into this too much but from a Corner's perspective does that come up for you often the arguments about regulating across the property yeah yeah that that's always a discussion with at permitting and things like that but yeah you're right as as long as it doesn't get into sight triangles closer to the roadway then it's not a thing but that's not where you're talking on the water side yeah inter Coastal as large as a 65 foot craft is it's actually not causing any problems as far as the Waterway goes sorry I misunderstood the question is I think you know if you were going to look into something like that maybe it would be curve Inlet as you're going into these these baby Harbors you know okay how much clearance do you have on each side and it looks to me like the way they design them they're about equal all the way around so uh maybe if you took another 65f footer and put it directly across the Harbor from it then how much room do you have left I don't know that's another that's another question um it's a unique circumstance for sure yeah um and then lastly uh I talked about this with Louie with the um the multif family homes we we currently have an our code that the if you put like a wall or a fence on the on the property it it's supposed to stop before the seaw wall cap um there probably 50% of them don't they go to over the seaw wall cap um Louie said that it's common that that's something we could change that other communities allow that um I guess you know it's obviously to kind of prevent people from walking over the seaw wall caps right across property lines um I'm not opposed to it and the reason why is because people have dogs true resal same deal that's the way you contain your dog yeah currently we Define the property line the rear property line is the Inside Edge of the seaw wall but i' like to look into making an exception because people have done it ex allowing the the fence or wall to extend um just to make it you know just to keep people from crossing over and yeah and and and make it you know allow in our code so it doesn't become an issue because right now it says you're supposed to stop at the inside if you were if you were to break it all down right You' be a violation anything else that is it for 94 well that was far less painful than I expected it to be that's pretty good sir do you have any questions for us no no I was going to say the same thing we had got some good comments good notes I think we got a lot to work with good good uh do we have anything else for Lewis not for me oh okay is there any I'm sorry is there any update on the uh potential appointees yeah that's other business BR up one more thing we talk about it and it comes up and the history I just recently uh spoke with Larry floody about um the observation to using a flat roof to have an observation or an access um Larry said in history they did not allow them um because if there was anything on that top of the roof like say an electrical outlet anything that like a utility that would consider it to be a habitable space they wouldn't allow it unless it was only the second habitable so if you just had a one-story habitable and then you had the observation a lot of people are proposing building the houses with access to the roof but you know not doing anything at on that top like putting water access or electricity or anything like that just sit to just just have access to so um that's something that I'd like to figure out if if it's something we allow or don't allow well now you've just made it 40 feet 50 feet because you're going to have humans standing up there so now it's even higher and you know they're going to put a table up there or a chairs or you know something is going to be up there so now we're going even higher um do do we address a even though we don't make roofs that are flat they still slant some way but do we address that anywhere in our in our code in our building code we we don't have anything against the flat roof okay yeah it's just there's nothing that says that really addresses having like that observation m point um but in the past they have said no because someone you could tell from the plan somebody was trying to run like I have a bar up there sure party but if they just have like paits and access I don't know if there something want to I I don't know it's not been a problem I don't know if we would be creating a problem by setting regulations um I know in a more modern type of architecture you'll see that more often you just see that I you know drive it around our city I don't know if I've seen too many houses that have a what people consider a flat roof yeah yeah there see what I'm the way that I'm leaning on all of this even even the the reluctance of changing the the uh blood elevation level um it makes sense what you proposed U but at the end of the day we're little by little we're taking away what makes b beach so special uh we're a small quiet sleepy little Beach Community and every time one of these little homes is knocked down and built up um it's it's great for somebody but is it great for everyone else and that's that's what worries me about us eventually becoming something that we don't recognize anymore so I will always uh lean towards anything that that puts a cap on how high we can go and what you can do with it once you build it that high uh so I would I would discourage um everyone from from being uh Pro Rooftop Bar well that's why at 94 to I think really needs to be addressed because if we don't do something we're going to lose that you know Golden Girls mentality that little homes the ranch homes that this community really is based on yeah yeah and like you said we won't end up with monstrosities and it'll benefit the homeowner at first but it's just going to ruin doar be is Right unique you know I'm having trouble even understanding this from a safety standpoint because if it's a flat roof and as you've mentioned it's going to be sloped in some fashion just because it has to drain so are you building something on top of it and then is there a railing and then once you get into a ra I mean people aren't just going to sit on a roof some sort of structure around where they're sitting we don't have a minimum like half to one half to 12 inch pitch or anything like that we don't have any met I've heard there's communities that don't allow flat roofs true and I think we probably what three or so a few yeah handful um are they flat flat or you got like just this small drain going into like the middle to get rid of the yeah this is what I think I I think that if you build the full three stories you can't you can't use your roof as a standing surface if you build two full stories the ground or from your garage level well then sure you can build a nice little Overlook hangout spot it's still three stories but I I say I I just firmly keep it under believe that if you open that Pandora's Box then you're really giving them four stories now and that and that's what it's going to look like they're going to have walls up there and you know handrails and everything else I I just I don't that's not what I want to see in Beller Beach yeah it would be almost like having trying to have like a non conversion for the roof right yeah so if you feel that you need to put something in the code that that protects us from that please go for it we'll look at it whenever we we do the review yeah I think you hit a point because that would be a great feature to build for the 90day rental seriously you know what I'm saying to rent something out and I think you you're dead on restrict that as much as possible okay anything else before we move on all right leis I appreciate it all right yeah thank you thank you all right now we're on to other business and um uh llo had brought it up I was going to bring it up too was uh currently we have two applicants uh for the uh for our uh council member council member positions we don't know how many council members we need until tomorrow was today the official last day that we are taking or is it does it end tomorrow I can't remember I believe it ends tomorrow tomorrow so if anyone knows anyone that would like to possibly serve on the council and would like to be considered a nominee they need to get in their application tomorrow last this is this is the end and we're cutting it off um after after all the applications are in would you make sure that everyone gets a copy of what we've got um currently we only have two I originally wanted to do do a miniature work session and and we just bring them in and and we hash all that out um in a work session and then vote for them in the meeting but I don't see any reason to bring them in twice uh I think we can we can contact them individually ask them questions and then uh at our next meeting we will we'll vote for whatever it is that was required of us which right now it's three but it could be one I'm hoping I have a I have faith that we're only going to need one person and uh and then we'll move forward from there well mayor I just want to make sure I'm clear on when when we're talking about the numbers um if the voters approve all of the proposed Charter amendments there is a phasing from seven seats to five seats and that does not happen immediately I just want to be clear about that obviously this Council can decide what it does with that information um if someone applies you're under no obligation to appoint that person whether you deem them qualified or if you think them not an appropriate fit um but I just want to make clear that and and again we will once we know the um results of the election I will later this week provide some guidance on what does all this mean now once I can make heads or Tales of it but the as written the ordinances and resolutions contemplate a um a date certain not immediate where we would transition from seven to 5 formally right so you you will still have seven seats on your Council come Friday regardless of what happens on the vote whether you choose to fill those seats it's a different question yeah that makes sense interesting so okay I'm I'm a little confused but but that's all right it's I think can even me succinctly uh address this because I'm also eager to adjourn if there's no other business but um the way that it was done was you're s you're switching to let's say everything is approved right you're going to have an election in your next election would be November I think of 2026 26 right and I think it was at the November 2026 election I'm not certain of this but I think it was at that election that you phase down to five correct um and so that's saying so you would still be seven people until that date whether or not you choose to fill seven vacancies is a different question the challenge you face again is you know having more for that time gives you the flexibility as it relates to quorums and other issues but as the ordinances were written we were phasing on that election cycle if memory serves and again um I I'm going from my memory it's been a while but I know it was not hey come April suddenly we're a council of five because we needed to appropriately phase that in relationship to the election Cycles so is it possible for the council to only nominate one and bring in one you could you could decide to appoint none either of them you could fill zero you could fill one you could fill all of them that's ultimately your purview as the charter tasks you with filling vacancies and I've been part of commissions where they've said no I don't want they've had 10 applicants and said I don't want any of them um that's ultimately your purview um and and whatever you know obviously different choices have different consequences in terms of how you operate but um ultimately it is your call on who is and is not appointed Mr Roberts so the way I understand it then so November 26 um had we been a full Council the seats that would have come up then would be the mayor's seat my seat um whoever is in Jody's seat because I've kind of lost track of kind of in and whoever's in Mike's seat wouldn't that have came up in 2025 well all of them did approve is can you do that um since since they ran on three years you actually yes the way the way it was all written and disclosed both to the electorate and in the ordinances and resolutions yes and yes the way it was contemplated was there whereas normally there would be I think it was four seats on that particular election cycle we would only be filling two or something like that whatever whatever the math was and again forgive me I've not looked at it in in its specifics but that was I and I think I've made a joke about this in the past I had a beautiful mind it on the Whiteboard and and Kyle's office to make it all make sense but yes that was how we faced it okay now her and I you're good no no when would that cycle come up would that would come up in 28 yes that's my recollection right because the way if if everything is approved by the voters you're going to be on federal election cycle so you'd be on the presidential and it would not quite kick in for this one didn't know be the next the midterms and then the next presidential election the midterms and the next presidential election you didn't know if it was lawful to if you ran on a three-year term was elected to a three-year term well and we we had an extensive discussion I understand saying I didn't know you could actually get a year well the voters are giving you whatever time you're getting you're getting from the voters you're not getting so that's what the voters specifically are approving your term of office and that was one of the concerns with this was you're running and you will not know until election day when your ter when your term is and that was one of the challenges and we you get like an additional six months by going to November of 28 as opposed to a year in six eight months instead of a three year it's a four year plus yeah and that's why at the risk of confusing everybody this week I will send you a summary once we know what is what from the voters because all of this is very academic until we know precisely what happens well this is my recommendation don't have to agree with it I'm open to everyone's opinion but having an even number of council members um is a mistake we don't have right now we have two candidates or two nominees um and we might get we might get a third I don't like just okay everyone showed up and because you're here let's vote you in I think the goal I believe everyone is in agreement with the five council members um as as a council we can just we can say let's pick one let's pick the very best and we just we run on five until everything changes over and then it's a natural cycle I think that that would uh it serve our city better and we would have um less potential for problems thoughts well we're eliminating if if Charter 2 gets passed we're eliminating the word form so we won't if only one person shows up you can have a council me is that correct uh if all of the charter measures pass this specifically contemplates that three members shall constitute a quorum and you need a majority vote of the seated Council to approve a measure I thought we were eliminating the word I don't remember the precise phrasing of it but it just it may be a majority but this whether or not we eliminate the word Quorum as a matter of pun of parliamentary procedure procedure Quorum is always an issue right um I've got I've got the ballot if that helps for is three five but if you eliminate the word and only one shows up or two show up I appreciate it it's just because the batt language is less than what the the battle language 75 words the resolution has all the actual has all the actual though I believe with regards to whose seat it is based on when that seat comes up for an election well I don't think that's that's a problem now that he just explained it well he just told you you're 277 um no six I'm Sor I'm sorry yeah and then there's got to be there would theoretically if we had the full seven there would be two other seats that would come up in 26 as well Jody and Mike's now jod and Mike's seats are tied to other people I'm lost track yeah my concern is as we continue this dialogue not only will we serve to confuse ourselves but the electorate um you know ultimately it's your discussion but I think it whe How we proceed to fill and do anything would probably be best served once once we know how it works okay well we'll we'll continue this conversation later then um any other General business well anyone like to go home motion do I have a second second all in favor I any opposed all right great job everyone excellent yes yeah that wasn't as no it wasn't as bad I like the way that we're uh that we're thank you I like the way that we're handling this"
