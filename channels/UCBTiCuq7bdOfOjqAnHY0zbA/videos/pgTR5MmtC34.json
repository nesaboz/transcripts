    "transcript": "good evening everyone welcome to the september 20 2021 final public hearing on the uh budget and currencies uh please join me in like allegiance i pledge allegiance to the united states of america and to the republic for which you stand one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice council member frank banker council member glenn gunn here council member leslie otero here council member rita swope vice mayor dave gathers mayor manzo city manager lynn reeves city attorney fred riley here okay thank you um so uh student manager has provided me with a script where this is slightly different than the way you normally do a regular meeting just a little bit different order so i'm just going to take it right as he has given it to me so first this is the public hearing um on item number one consideration of resolution 2021-08 a resolution of the city of delaware beach florida establishing the final at the lauren military or fiscal year 2021 through 2022 or the city of delaware beach florida at 2.0394 mills and establishing an effective date here's the explanation final military for fiscal year 2021 through 2022 is 2.0394 mills which is higher than the roll to back rate of 1.9053 mils the roll of that rate is the millage rate that would provide the same appalachian tax revenue as his levy levy during the prior year the rollback rate is higher than last year's than last fiscal years due to an increase in this year's property values by 7.04 the reason for setting the military at 2.039 is to fund expenses for the general fund for the fiscal year beginning october 1st 2021 through september 30th 2022. so now i'm going to open the public hearing and ask for comments from the public if anyone would like to speak please come right up here to the podium and give your name and make any comments you'd like on this consideration of the military caps for next year anyone from the public seeing all hands i'm going to close the public comments and at this point i'm going to ask for a motion leslie the tara makes the motion and the second sorry if gaddis makes the second and it's open for discussion beginning with leslie sorry i believe it makes sense to adopt it we've talked about before the council i believe we should accept the rollback rate is certified by the county appraisers you know it's not a big increase but in april this year we just increased the five cents tax on the county on fuel consumption for motor vehicles that wasn't a terrible increase but gas is probably going up about 75 cents a gallon total since then and what we get out of the car mostly people drive maybe 15 to 18 000 miles only gonna cost you another forty dollars but actually what we get out of it is less than four cents at 40 bucks so it's just more taxes and more taxes i'm just going to stay with that rate yeah 100 agree with you frank um i said it last time i'll say it again this time i'm not going to read all statistics again but um this is a 7.5 increase we there was a 5.79 cpi consumer price index increase uh giving you a little bit of history of the city of delaware beach back in 2014 this is going to generate if it's accepted 1.251 251 815 okay back in 2013 we ran this city with 733 178 dollars and it steadily went up 824 48.97 876 760 2015. we broke a million in 2018 a million sixty two thousand twenty eleven one million one sixty four and now one million two fifty one we're spending money on generators we're spending money on signs we're spending money spending money spending money taxes spend taxes spend taxes spending taxes that went up every year going way back before even 2013. now we play this little hocus pocus game we leave we some people like to say well we kept the millage the same yeah but your property values went up and if you remember back to like third fourth grade multiplication a is the millage d is your property values you multiply the two together that's the tax you pay whether i increase a or increase b c goes up so to plan a shell game your taxes are going up i somebody came through less times that my property value went down well you're the exception overall went up seven percent this year so that's what we're going to wind up paying okay now there's caps and things like that whether you're a homesteader or not bottom line your taxes are going up i can't vote for this we put a um a charge on your water bill which is nothing but a tax it's for storm water fee okay and on top of this uncle sam was giving us like eight million dollars will be in to us i think by october and the remaining comes within the next year or two so even like eight hundred thousand dollars is spent on infrastructure projects so it's not like we can't take care of the infrastructure this city could do with a little bit less and i think people could do better with more of their money and quite frankly your social security can go up by 7.5 neither did you cost the living on anything else taxes so i'm going to vote no on this and join me frank anyone else i find it hard to believe people's cost of living is not going up i just i don't buy that for a second i see inflation everywhere yes gas prices are rising basically groceries are going up everything is going up cost of construction is going up which means that also uh things that this city has to buy they're going up also um this makes perfect sense to uh to hold at this current military and uh i'm going to vote yes for it um i agree cost of living is going up like you said but as a result to help with that if taxes didn't go up would benefit the residents especially the ones that are living more paycheck to paycheck or social security check the social security check um you're right if things that need to be done for the city prices for those are also going up but remember we're doing things that don't need to be done for the city in my opinion like the sun so stuff like that i think we're i think we're using our money we're not being smart or fiscally responsible we're using it as in it's never going to run out so buy whatever you want and hey last minute throw the extra five thousand dollar wave on that i think it is inexcusable so i don't agree with this i would be more in favor of the rollback rate council comments and this is really a message to the citizens we're going to very shortly i'm going to go back to leslie mantero since she brought this motion shot the last word and then we're gonna call this question okay and yes vote on this raises your taxes it's that simple so there's gonna be minutes that are gonna be published and you can copy those minutes they'll be out on the website and you remember that you remember that in march remember that if any of the people that vote yes for that if they run again you can do what you want or if somebody votes no and you think they should have voted yes you can take care of that too you get your say at the ballot box we can try and get our say tonight we'll see what we're going to do leslie matero you have the last word i maintain the position that this is a responsible move to take it helps build some reserves that we need it does some infrastructure improvements that we need and i strongly urge everyone to vote in favor of this military [Music] closer um then it says call for the vote but we always typically read the question so i think we should read the question okay that's fine all right so this is consideration of resolution 2021-08 a resolution of the city of delaware beach florida establishing the final advelor military for the fiscal year 2021 through 2022 for the city of bellar beach florida at 2.0394 mills and establishing an effective date patty would you please call council member aki no council member banker no councilmember gunn hi councilmember notaro notaro council member swope aye vice mayor gattis aye mayor manzo nay so the votes are four to three and the motion passes the millage rate will be set at 2.0394 i have to read something else and it says the final village rate for the city of bel air beach is 2.0394 mills for the fiscal year beginning october 1st 2021 and ending september 30th 2022 and is seven point zero four percent higher than the world bank rate of seven but one point nine zero five three mills due to a 7.6 increase in property values the purpose for setting the millage rate at 2.0394 is to fund the general fund expenses for the fiscal year beginning october 1st 2021 through september 30th 2022. that concludes question number one question number two is consideration of resolution 2021-09 a resolution of the city of eller beach florida making appropriations for certain expenditures expenses capital improvements and certain indebtedness of the city of delaware beach florida for the fiscal year beginning october 1st 2021 and ending september 30th 2022 and establishing an effective date let me ask again with the this is for the budget now any comments from the public seeing no hands i'll close public comment i have motion gaddis makes motion and a second second i'll refer to the city manager city manager reeves yes marine council this is uh the the approval of the general fund capital projects budgets for fiscal year 2122 and we've reviewed the budgets and uh over the last few months we've had things added and subtracted which we've discussed with the last year so i'm asking for your approval [Music] taxes this is the money that's being spent this is the operating budget capital budget same reasons tax and spend just can be much better sharpening that pencil and tell me this video right my big question is we will probably get 400 000 this year 400 000 next year what do we do when that money drives up because we're going to be in this spending mode in [Music] that's a lot of money you ask me what i would do you know what i would do i wouldn't have proven to begin with okay i take that gift from the federal government i'd cut back everybody's taxes but that tax thing is over with but we could still trim the budget okay um but it would go into our reserves we've got plenty of reserves i think we've got two million dollars of reserves we're way better now than where we were uh three years ago so we're racking up the money and look we are fixing some infrastructure that had been deferred over time that there's no question about that um there was some you know some um neglect they'll say this is the far past this isn't anybody on this council or probably the prior council but it's being addressed now you can see it if you go around the city there's you know when we're starting from block one and is working his way through the town with flood water control and everything else so um no one can complain about how we're maintaining the infrastructure now we're getting more money just a gift a total gift i mean that's free money citizens don't benefit from it they'll get some construction but they won't save anyone sorry i don't matter publix hasn't lowered their prices this week but anyways um dave gadge you have the last word call the question so this is consideration of resolution 202109 a resolution of the city of delaware beach florida making appropriations for certain expenditures expenses capital improvements and certain indebtedness of the city of bellar beach florida for the fiscal year beginning october 1st 2021 and ending september 30th 2022 and establishing an effective council member banker no councilmember gunn aye councilmember noterow councilmember slope i am councilmember aki um vice mayor gaddis hi mayor manzo nick so it passes five to two and i have to read something it says resolution 2021.09 is adopted establishing a budget for the city of bella beach this is cut off but i think it says fourth uh fiscal year beginning october 1st 2021 and ending september 30th 2022 with the final millage rate of 2.0394 mills which is 7.04 higher than the rollback rate of 1.905 bills that concludes question number two it also concludes this meeting motion to adjourn please so get a second please second i inverted uh and um all right anyone closed the meeting is
