time before you have a major accident if you don't already had not already had one I was told the counties studying it I suggested them that something remedial needs to be done in the in room um I don't know what's going on I look at the uh sheriff's report about accidents it just tells you where the accident Sor it doesn't give you any details or anything like that but something's going to happen there and it's going to be bad so I'm just bringing it to the council's attention and I'm imploring you as a citizen and someone who has rendered Aid at too many accidents we need to get

item number three which is a presentation for the pelis county sheriff's department uh I'm sorry officer I did not get your name so would you please uh tell us who you are and what your title is certainly good evening my name is Sergeant John shield with the pelis county sheriff's office um I'm here to present the uh stats that you all have have received already previously should have received them in an email uh if you all have any questions about any of the statistics I'll answer them all right uh if do you have the report with I do presid if you don't mind just kind of share the highlights most people in the audience have not seen that report sure no worries uh so it's broken down in monthly and we have the uh it's kind of uh 6 months I'm sorry six weeks in so we're in March so with the present uh crime stats that we have for the month of March 2024 uh so in the March uh we have four people arrested theity city of b beach uh they are broken down into different uh felony misdemeanor traffic felonies and broken down in the stats there were 644 events in the city of b beach um with 728 units responding the units are comprised of Deputy sheriffs there were three traffic crashes in the city um um for the month of March they may include accident and hit and run divided up we have 212 citations to to include warning citations for the city also they broken up I believe 97% of them uh are listed as parking citations we have uh 95 of them are warnings and 20 are ISU of traffics that all I have Sergeant any questions or comments for the sergeant Council yes thank you Sergeant uh I did notice on the um I guess the second page that it does reference an accident um involving cway Boulevard and gold Boulevard do you have any TP any data on that particular one I don't I haven't given General uh stats broken down uh for instance the def activity is broken in down to what they out code on and what traffic control uh suspicious vehicles and such when it comes to the um tra traffic crashes it kind of gives a there was one at 103 it's listed as our location of what we utilize for our our acent reports 1038 Street uh 3100 Golf Boulevard and Howard Drive at the intersection with Golf Boulevard I know there's are a little few of them are a little vague but um that's what we have so we have the three of those in the city okay yeah I misread that that's my fault that it was a citation that was awarded on Causeway Boulevard and Del Boulevard so but I do have another question I was curious about the two assaults in March of 24 you any detail on those I don't have any details no they're just broken up when you have a uniform uh it's a UCR it's a data that we're colle that our analysts collect and it's within our computer system kind of generates and we kind of classify those but I don't have any details on those reports okay is there a way what would be the easiest way for us to get that information if we wanted in uh we can uh look into getting it from the crime analysis okay and about that specifically right thank you anyone else I did have a a question Sergeant there was a over the week and there was a pretty serious accident on G Boulevard but I believe it was in San key you may have heard about it I did I was actually off this weekend so it's my first day back to work I did see it through the media uh I don't know the details other than involving a pickup truck and I semi truck the the details and nuances of that I do not ha okay all right um yeah I guess what we'd like to do is find out more about that for sure all right anything else Sergeant I appreciate you being here tonight thank you very much my pleasure have you too thank you and is Deputy Trump here tonight yes sir now we're up to the monthly code enforcement report how you doing tonight how are you sir well again depy Trump with Al count Sheriff's Office I try and help you guys out with your code enforcement uh for the month um for the month uh I had 34 entries um a lot of them varied and stuff but what we're basically finding for the the month is we're starting to get into that growing season so we're trying to make sure everybody with their yards and stuff like that are trying to keep finds about that so we've been doing a lot of patrols there talking a lot of people I get out right now come to wor and I talk to a lot of people and you know trying to get them to come back into compliance with that uh you'll notice the other big topic was pretty much uh other enforcement and other enforcement is a uh St that I actually had added to it um but that will vary as far as um uh doing my beach patrols cuz I've been trying to get out and do a lot more Beach patrols out on the Polaris and trying to talk to a lot of people out there making sure everybody's enjoying and being safe um so uh we also had I I'm sorry so besides that uh other enforcement also included a couple things we had a jet ski that was unauthorized up at the marina that uh uh the city manager helped take care of uh along with the rest of the city staff and uh we had a boat and a trailer in the front yard um I've talked to that gentleman now twice and I think we've got that one streamed out that if he takes his boat out you know it's got to go away pretty quick instead of sitting there for a week so we've dealt with that so um for the rest of it it it's pretty pretty minor um we uh do have one note here that uh had references the 107 21st Street property this property uh has been in pretty bad shape uh especially for the last 6 months that I've been here I know a lot of neighbors have complained about it the city's been working with it there's actually fines that are um growing on that property so right now just to inform you there is a title company and there's actually for sale sign in front of it now uh but there is a title company that has taken control of the property uh it's going into a trust and then the title company will be bringing the property into compliance uh in the very near future from what I hear uh and I'll keep you guys updated on that uh as we progress and I'm sure the city manager will also uh but after that then they are going to work with the city and the attorney uh in order to try and come up with some type of settlement for all the fines and leans that are currently posted on it so any questions yes um thank you for the detail regarding the other category because that was one that I had a question about and that as an approaches one third of the offenses I'm wondering if that should be broken down in any way categories in the future I can try to I can work with the city manager see if I can break that down for you uh but before like if I went out I I try to uh take numbers and make sure that we have statistics on other things that I'm doing like the beach Patrols and things like that that weren't documented before so with that I was able to work with the city manager at we at least got that entry but I can work with them see if we can't break it down a little bit more for you if that would help sure any other questions Mr thank you uh for the report and thank you for bringing up the point about the the uh height of the grass and the Clutter so that's basically 50% and I think that I feel very very fortunate the street that I live on everybody does a great job taking care of those items I think that this city overall really wants the city to look as nice as it possibly can yes sir so I think it's wonderful that you are bringing that to our citizens ATT attention those that may not be complying with our current um rules about grass height and clutter and things like that so thank you for doing that the simplest way that I can put it without going into there's a bunch of different details it's basically grass and weeds if it's over 7 in it's not complain so just kind of keep the grasses cut and keep them under seven in and keep the bushes trimmed and everybody should be happy thank you thank you next up item four a presentation from the pel sun fire and rescue District by Chief Jeffrey Davidson There You Go Chief good May for you ccil members good evening uh here to present the uh fire and rescue report for the month of April there were 15 calls for emergency service into b beach including motor vehicle accidents cardia events and fire alarms uh we recently outfitted a new jesi uh for to add to our water rescue Fleet our marine unit Fleet and the training is underway um hoping to have it here on display uh for you all uh at the next meeting um currently uh we just finished Coast Guard um water rescue training with the Coast Guard and once we finish up the training that that unit will be in service um we also have been working as you know to purchase the land on the Northern end of Indian Rocks Beach the better serve Belair Beach and that's moved along very well uh we'll have their contracts completed in the next week and we'll move forward and hopefully we'll have a new fire station to better serve your area uh in less than two years that's the goal and then our Mainland station which we're in the design phase we're continue with that we're just waiting on some engineering to see what we can do with the retention funds over there and uh can you moving forward any questions or comments for the fire no thank you very much have a good evening thanks for having me number five City attorney report thank you Mr Mayor um since our last meeting I've been uh researching uh how different communities have adapted to sign code revisions I've been Gathering that information including addition of just general research um series of public records requests of different communities and getting that material together so as directed I can meet with member Shaw Elliot and have a a discourse on Gathering that information in a way that will be helpful and just here's a flood of information um in addition to that of course working with the manager on on day-to-day issues we are almost exactly two months post the close of legislative session and honestly there is a lot up in the air um remember recall that the process is that both Chambers pass identical bills those bills if passed in identical form are at some point transmitted to the governor and the governor signs them or Vos them um he has 15 days to do so once a bill is transmitted to him um and if if the governor does not sign him within those 15 days it's deemed pass so for those of you remember the lore of the pocket veto in the 9s it's a pocket approval in in our state system um there are many bills that were passed that still have not been sent to the governor um notably uh the short-term rental bill that a lot of communities were tracking housing Bill Transportation bill there's just a number of them that are sort of in limbo that doesn't mean he will be Ving them they just have not been sent to him and there's not necessarily a date certain that they will all be sent by uh most bills are typically sent by now or at least mid June because a lot of bills tend to have an effective July 1 so you want to have them signed you know at least 2 weeks after from that or have a 15-day window before that uh so we expect to see a little bit more motion but if you're you know if you track something or or there was a legislative issue that was near and dear to Your Heart during session you're wondering why am I not hearing about this or why are we not doing anything yet it ain't over till it's over it's got to be signed and so we are tracking that closely but I do want to make make that known it's a little bit curious um bunch of theories on why it happens some way but it is a very it's a truly arcade process and that is like the final document sits in a drawer and until it is summoned it's out sit under locking key and so we're waiting for those bills to either be summoned by the governor or otherwise get to his desk so um other than that happy to answer any questions you may have um I also just because it was a topic of of discussion at at April's meeting I continue to remain in weekly contact with the uh whether it just be a simple phone call to check in or otherwise with the attorney um for the town of bell Shore uh the parties are both generally um amenable to working through towards a revised document the interal agreement of course the details matter and we'll see where that goes um but there's at least right now both parties are postured towards let's work this out um and so that's where that presently stands I think U my my peer colleague is awaiting some directions similarly I'm you know meeting with Pyle and identifying what are the issues Community we need addressed in a revised draft and and also recently reached out to Banker to meet with him in in the same regard so that's uh where that is happy to answer any questions I have a question um where are we on the look back period there's an ordinance on the agenda tonight sir okay for some reason I didn't read it the same way uh you may if you were tracking it through the um entire process recall that when you first said you know this is a priority we want this as a council we want this prioritized my concern at the time was um it may need to go before the Planning and Zoning Board did um and and they considered all the provisions and looking at it I thought it best to break them out into multiple ordinances um and so that's what you have three ordinances tonight on different land restrictions that are including it was a little confusing whenever I was reading it but I'll make it clear when we get there thank you very much uh any questions for the City attorney um this is no reflection okay okay this is just about because on the back page um you you gave us a letter after the meeting after the last month's meeting of April sent on page two there was a February 28th citation and Kyle took the Brun of this storm from a resident at the that there was unauthorized parking permit that was issued reflecting that I don't know if you issue I don't really care you issue you can you took the run in the storm but I visit the six Street beach access and this is what I'm talking about okay now I come from the construction trade I'm sympathetic to construction workers fell Shores wants to tell us what we can and what we can't do meanwhile they issue these parking permits at will okay now I've also copied on the back page Beller Schwarz code parking permits I'm not I'm just going to paraphrase such parking permits shall only be issued as may be provided by the Board of Commissioners to the property owners in the city of Beller Beach east of Doc Boulevard in be number these guys aren't east of this east of the Golf Boulevard all right they're construction workers they're given a permit to park here all year this thing goes from February till the end of December all right our our interlocal agreement also notes who can park in these lots east of goth bore the residents of balair Beach the deeds and the Cur be on out also notes who can par and who can use these lots and what are the purposes to be used Beach and Bing purposes now if b beach and B shes wants to really get along okay they have to they have to comply and give us equal treatment is what I'm saying so I know you're in talks with that a lot and I would bring this up because one day there was 10 cars pared in in B in the six Street axis and the one guy backed up I was coming off the beach it was two well I'm old now so I I can say there was two older wom okay one one in a wasn't a wheelchair was an assist he backs all the way up 2 feet from the access point where the grass starts and she says I can't get around there so I went I went up and I said hey how about moving your truck he says I'm busy doing paper that guy Robert Shaw our deputy comes pulling in he pulled right out but what I'm saying is he had no right to part and this is just bad behavior on a member bankard I appreciate you bringing this tangible example to my attention what I would say is one we are as as I've stated I I think that the to the extent I've been in contact with their officials I think that all those representations of working uh toward a resolution are in good faith I'd also caution um as we work through this process um just generally understanding especially in these small communities as we see turnover like we're talking about an agreement that goes back almost 20 years right and we've seen a lot of turnover in our communities in those 20 years there's not always an an awareness or an appreciation and that doesn't necessarily excuse it way but I would not suggest that it's necessarily always malicious and so I I agree with with you that we need to bring this to their attention and we need to address it and and this needs to be not just on the list of things we address long term but near term making them aware of that concern and I'm happy to do that and again he got landed and I like that okay and um I don't think he did any I don't know what the circumstances were like I said I don't have a problem with construction workers parking there if they work that's if they work and we can navigate thank you for bringing that to our attention I'll I'll make note of that any other questions or comments for the City attorney Mr Mor you have anything else no thank you may' all right thank you very much and now we're moving on to the city manager report Mr Reef you're up thank you mayor uh start off with the Golf Boulevard undergrounding last month we uh did a uh contract with UCF to install the conduit for the uh rest of the communication portion of the uh Phase 2 North Side well north and east side of B Boulevard and good news is that um the material should be arriving within a couple of weeks and think they're going to get started on that the uh storm water Improvement project um currently we're still working up from uh Morgan drive down to 23rd Street um they are replacing the curve and you know they'll do the milling and resurfacing for those four streets and after that the plan is to come down to this uh south portion which is going to be the Ninth Street Harvard Drive um Cedar Drive Spruce Drive and Palm Drive um speaking on that I'm going to try to share a screen the member sha Elliot and I went out and met with uh two property owners for the for the uh options that we were looking at uh one during our work session the concern was um would they be willing to have um that pump station and power panel in front of their properties see and what we found in meeting with the neighbors is that they would prefer not to have um The Pump Station out in front uh that would be between 9007 and 905 Harbor so um since then since learning that from these residents um and they actually Mr will and Mr Brown are both here tonight um to support the project um we started looking at other options um right now given um that the previous options we have aren't going to work out our next best option is going to be um what I'm showing on the screen right now which is going to be our option one um which would require an easement with the property in the screen um which is 1259 Street um we feel they may be willing to give an easement because the idea is to run from the from the corner where that manhole is um slightly into the property which is all grass area but in doing so it avoids uh there's a line of oak trees um if we if we couldn't get an easement and we had to go north we would be um running into those oak trees and that' be required to we'd have to remove them so that that's our our next best effort um the residents of the area are helping us get into contact with the owner of that property to hopefully negotiate um being able to get that easement so that we can reduce the flooding in the area um the other option we're looking at I want to jump to my other show better there we go there is okay so this is a a shot I took from the corner and let see if I can mark it up a little bit so this on the left where it says Pump Station option moment easement so that kind of shows you the line of sight um going from that manhole it have to cut to the L A little bit um the property line for 1259 street is slightly to the west of that telephone pole directly in front of the screen um but with the easement we'd be able to move more over into the grass area to get the pump station roughly um just past their property before it got to the the existing Pike that run from the attention Pond the idea would be to put the pump station in that area and then um trench the force force line across to the sale through the road um the other option Pump Station option two um that would be to go directly across the road and position it we'd have to keep it to the south of the Swale because we couldn't cross over the sale and we can't go through the pipe in the road um but that would be the less uh preferred option to put the pump station in that general area as far away from being from of the property owner's house to to eject the uh water into the well same same way and I have some arals too to kind of show option one and option two and I spoke with uh Larry flu city engineer um he's aware of what we're looking into it's really pending um when we can get in contact with the property owner one 259 street so hopefully we can do that soon um to narrow down if that is a feasible option then we can get him to start um drafting the plans to get a cost estimate um the one both these options um we can still move the project down to this area um and at this point we've be able to replace the um Valley curb and Mill up to um just north of uh Mr Brown's driveway and then what we could do is not um do the replacement of the remainder of Harbor Drive and B the park um we could do that in the future um with this project if we felt um we still needed to do so the curves and the street aren't in horrible conditions I don't think it would negatively affect anything but that way we wouldn't be uh refurbishing the streets and curves um only to tear them up again so that's a quick update on where we're at with that hopefully I was able to show you um the ideas and you can understand I don't know if um later we want to give an opportunity to the two Property Owners to speak on it but um they they support the project um and they've been working with us to find a a a reasonable way to put put the pump station in and make it work let see anything else I do have other jump around this for a banker that has a question for you sure option one at that house do that take a lot of flooding um the house at 1259 Street does take a lot of flooding so we felt that they would they would feel strong there I just thought is there water just to that was well that was the day after I came city right thank you um so again what I will uh keep the city council um aware of where we're at on that and our progress as we try to make contact with that Resident uh the code review project uh Mr s is compiling all his recommendations for us to review and we will be um putting together the draft ordinances again most of them are going to be more restrictive but we want to get started um for review to get looked over and and uh for more discussion on what we're recommending the oh gol Golf Boulevard um and cuser Boulevard intersection study we did have an update on that the Dallas County Public Works invited remember Roberts and I out on May 1st I believe was Wednesday and they uh showed us the um camera that they installed at the intersection they the camera is like is kind of the best technology they have that they're using within the County right now um when they learned about our um our uh our need to to study the intersection and to to analyze if it's working and it's a most efficient um way they they thought sell it as an opportunity that we kind of looked out on and got it installed so now that we have it it's um it's operates on AI software it's very Hightech they showed us um real live Imaging of the high camera identifying Vehicles was and go through the intersection it can um it operates on demand so there has I've noticed personally when they asked and um and it's mainly because the the computer is watching the traffic patterns and and it's changing the lights not on a timer but more so in analyzing what best way to to change the lights to get the most traffic through the intersection I've noticed uh uh increase in um um well it's just say decrease in backup I noticed early in the morning one of the major complaints that residents had was you know pulling up to the light 6:00 a.m. in the morning nobody's at the intersection nobody's coming in any direction and you're sitting there for almost over a minute which seems like an attorney was that early um that's gone away the I don't know if the uh the previous is well whatever they were using motion sensors just wasn't picking up but this this new technology is definitely doing a better job a question about this um actually too uh first when when was that system installed I want to say ear that's probably why whenever the turn signal is turned off and it's too green straight through lights occasionally it'll turn back on it let you make that left turn if your head because it's detecting the cars there's nothing coming it must just automatically uh by any chance does this technology uh will it Aid in uh the maybe resolve in the concerns that were um addressed it it should be able to because it it it can uh recognize near misses and obviously pans um to their knowledge now it's only been running for like a matter of weeks they showed us a report example they showed all the accounts um they can get the data on how like they could tell the speeds the traffic was moving through in all different directions they can tell when near misses they can tell when a car comes out of the lane like it it's very very complex they offered um they're going to send me a report uh based on their recommendation and what their recommendation to us is at this moment that they feel the intersection works most efficiently with this technology installed the way it is with the two lanes going left what they did feel when they really looked it over and uh analyzed the numbers was that the when you turn left you have the uh the I should say delineating lines that um guide the two lanes as you turn they felt that um we could use another set not in not just in between those Lan but another set on the far which would be the east lane turning the left to go over cway to help them guide them to not cut short on the uh Stop Bar um another thing they thought that would make a difference is um repainting those lines all the way through so once you make the turn you're heading towards the bridge um they're kind of worn out so it um they felt like it was a marking it better would uh help traffic stay stay in their Lanes but at the same time we as soon as you turn to C Boulevard there's a merge Arrow so um I guess you know the guys that work at the Traffic Division felt like that could be playing into the fact as soon as people turn they see that merge Arrow so it's causing them to feel like they got to get right over um there's plenty of space that you know it extends almost all the way up to Ceder drive and they felt that that might also um help with that intersection it's not perfect but where we're at right now um with the new camera they got in there um they really can tell what's going on they you know like I said they can tell if there's an accident um they offered to share this data with us so um as we move forward I think if we have questions if you know concerning near misses concerning accidents speeds um they can provide that data and I think it'll be very helpful I don't want to keep talking about traffic all night but I I will say that uh uh I think we've suggested possibly moving that Stop Bar the line that's painted that the thick white line that tells where you're supposed to stop your car at as you're waiting to make a left turn or a right turn um at the end of Causeway if that thing was moved back they could make a less drastic turn and I believe that that would help because right now it's almost impossible if you're doing the speed limit and you go around that you're going to go in the other way so that's something that I think we had discussed it before but maybe it just has been brought up uh any questions or comments for the city manager yes yeah first of all I think the county uh did a good job and Kyle did a good job making sure that they followed through I think we brought this to their attention sometime last year so Kyle didn't let that just lay there uh talk to them a couple of times and and out of the shoot I think the county did a good job of increasing and putting in a system that was better it's always good to do better so the problem is still there though Mr Hans they showed us video which was pretty awesome every time there's a near miss the camera system takes a picture a video of that there are a lot of near misses making that left hand turn when there are two vehicles making the left hand turn there's a lot of variables that go into that I think the and we talk about this the spring break time of the year and we have a lot of people down here that are not familiar with the traffic plugs those are the people that don't realize that when two cars are making a leftand turn off a go Boulevard on the causeway you have to go out and make effectively a 90\u00b0 turn if you start making less than that somebody's going to have an issue also we have the the fine folks that travel down from the north at that time of the year many of those drivers are not familiar with those two left turns necessarily but it is just a matter of time time now when the county made the recommendation of staying with the two lanes and count can correct me they based that on traffic flow so they were looking to see how many vehicles are getting queued up since they made the changes with the new technology and that has improved immensely and that was my first issue when I was calling for the two lanes when cars have to sit there for a long period of time it's not effective they in my opinion they fixed that problem which is great because you can see the flows going through it just doesn't queue up anymore which is awesome but the fact that we still have two lanes turned and left and they recognize the fact that the merge distance is very short that problem's not going to go away and I hope we don't get in a scenario where and we all see this in life sometimes people are saying man that could be a problem that could be a problem and we wait until something catastrophic happens and then we say oh gosh we need to change that let's let's think this through if it needs to be changed one of the options can still be to turn that back to a single Lane and move it further back and take that um little island out uh the county was assured me that if we do take it out and for some particular reason we find out that it's not working as well as as we thought they have no problem in putting it back but there is an option I believe still in coming back one single Lane and going through down through that biral lane to eliminate two vehicles turning left but just want to make sure everybody understands it is a big Improvement like KY said the cars are not queuing up there because in the morning perfect example I've had citizens talk to me that when they first opened up that double turn line everything was set on a timer that was that was designed based on traffic flow now it's the demand base which is Works terrific so if you come up there in the morning and and the cameras recognize there's nobody coming from Causeway and there's nobody coming from the south to the north it immediately changes back to green so that works great but I still think the issue when when I sat there for just 5 minutes and saw those near misses P what's all lot uh and you don't really see if it's in near Miss because it shows you in that one C view we saw that it looks like they're going to hit and then it doesn't show you that anymore it just kind of goes out of the camera but it's something I think we need to discuss and make sure that that's taken care of my biggest concern is somebody actually walking on the sidewalk and those two cars battling for a merge position and somebody gets pushed up on the sidewalk that's my biggest concern the speeds of the cars are going going it's just going to be a couple of dents and somebody's going to be sad but if it goes up on that curve and hits somebody that won't be any F you're also sharing those lines with bicycles yes yes definitely definitely something we'll keep an eye on and yes council member thank you sir um to comment to Echo your comment as well as Mr I'm one makes a left hand turn there from theway onto the and I I feel vulnerable because there are many many times where you sitting there and someone doesn't pay a lot of attention makes that left hand permanent it's practically a yeah so I think back that up would be very help um the other comment there is that I when walk in that area I will not walk at that intersection because if you take a step off the curve um at Gulf and Causeway Crossing across the caway uh to get back over like to live 12 Street each access um in that direction people come blind around from go and again you're very vulnerable because they can't see you and they come very quickly around that corner and so that pedestrian area can be adjusted in some way I instead just cross Al um and if I could also turn back to the storm water project and I I want to thank you very much Mr keer for all of your collaboration and work on this to our neighbors you very much and my thanks to our neighbors for um all their careful consideration of all this when we look at the two options the two new options that you reviewed tonight the benefit of both of them is that uh in option one it literally is only going through grass and we preserve the wonderful live oos that we have along our e the that we have to have permission to encroach into that grass uh but it's a very good option and it crosses the road places the it doesn't cross that doesn't cross the road at all cross the pump station would be uh up on the Rion pond near the pipe um where it's goes into the sale but from there it would just be that 8 in so the pump would pump just the water over under or sorry excuse B through the street out well okay yeah so it doesn't cross the road at all so uh that option also brings potential cost savings because we're not disrupting the Bo and you could address those a little bit as well as on option number two it did involve potentially crossing the road but it involves no commission from anyone um and gets it directly into the creek which is another good option for the water flow uh but both options offer a pause on any further construction further on the street because the portion right out here uh has a good curb system the road isn't fairly good shape um so we can put a pause on any of that as and and it might become permanent and therefore more cost savings into the project so if you could address that yeah so the the both those options were important because what we're trying to do is get the current project down to the 9th Street area to get those improvements done um and I was talking to Mr FIA today about um getting with the contractor to um to stop um earlier on Harbor and just not do Those portions cuz that way we're not doing anything that we're going to tear up later so if we want to get that done we could we could build it off of the future project or leave it as is we'd still be able to get the uh 2 F Type great inlets in at the well um just not resurface the street right there until we know what we're doing that's where we keep up to up to dat any other questions or comments for the city manager we uh so the we released the RFP for auditing Services um we got questions going to come in on May 14th and it's due May 31st from there we'll call back the audit committee to review um quickly the uh I have a the uh Florida City County Manager Association conference from May 29th to May 31st um I will be in Orlando but still you know working answering emails and um I don't know if anyone noticed but we did get the carpet changed out in this room um one thing we were not satisfied and and neither was the installer you can see some some seam lines so um the actual uh manufacturer came out and they're going to replace all of it they weren't satisfied with the product either I mean it looks pretty good but it's not perfect when the sun catches it you do see some lies you're not supposed to see and they think it's just because um had a little bit thicker of a padding to it and the Machine that cut it just didn't cut it correctly so they're eventually going to be coming out to redo it again guess they didn't want that word to get out but we like we like it it looks nice but looks very nice um and then lastly this month I'd like to um once I get my budget draft um just set up individual meetings um whether we do it virtually or in person just with each council member to to go through the first draft of the budget before we have our first uh work work session good idea thanks all right any other questions or comments you had enough anyway right good all right now we're on to item seven City cler report M Rose you have the floor just we've been working as business as usual I have nothing further to report and you're doing a great job anyone have questions for the city cler all right now we are on to the consent agenda items 8 and N this is for approval of the April 8th 2024 city council meeting minutes and the April 22nd 2024 city council work session me we'll have a motion to approve motion to approve consent agenda as written propos motion made by Frank Banker do I have a second second second by Lloyd Roberts all in favor I any opposed all right consent agenda passes and over on to the regular agenda item 10 uh this is consideration of accepting the annual comprehensive uh financial report for fiscal year anding September 30th 2023 presented by salt marsh Cleveland and gun certified public accountant welcome thank you good evening my name is Chuck Landers I'm with salt Mar Cleveland and Gund and we've had the privilege of serving as the the city's Auditors for several years um with our predecessors before that tonight I'm going to present the annual comprehensive financial report not in detail but in summary I believe everybody's been given a copy at this point before getting started I definely want to say thank you to Kyle for your assistance to the audit process there's no way we can do it without you and especially then Heather with Ander test CPA I don't know if you all work with Heather very much oneon-one but she is tremendous asset to the city very fortunate to have her in the uh packet of the booklet that I should say you turn to page one which is after all the Roman numerals which you have to get through so it's about 10 or 11 pages in it's our letterhead and this is the independent auditor report it's a multi-page report but I'm only going to read the first two paragraphs these are the the ones that I consider the most important out of these pages these are the opinions paragraphs under the report on financial statements we have audited the accompanying financial statements that the governmental activities the business type activities each major Fund in the respective budgetary comparison for the general fund of the city of Belair Beach Florida the city as of and for the year ended September 30th 2023 and the related notes to the financial statements which collectively comprise the city's basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents this next paragraph is is the important one in our opinion the financial statements referred to above present fairly in all material respects the respective financial position of the governmental activities the business type activities each major fund and the respective budgetary comparison for the general fund of the city as of and for the year ended September 30th 2023 and the respective changes in financial position and where applicable cash flows thereof for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America that's what's called an unmodified opinion it's the clean opinion that's the uh the best that we can give and the best that you can receive the next several pages are the basic financial statements and the notes I'm not going to go through these in detail like I said but there are a few that I'll just point out if you don't mind following along with me on page 17 Page 17 is What's called the statement of net position this shows the assets and the liabilities and the net position of the city as of September 30th 2023 this is a snapshot the numbers were different the day the day before they were different the day after but it's what they look like on this day and again I'm on page 17 the statement of net position just above the middle half of the page you see total assets 24,32 2,000 in the far right column so you have the governmental activities in the in the middle column the business type activities uh next to that and then the total column again 24.3 million total assets total liabilities jumping down towards the bottom of the page 3.8 almost 3.9 million which leaves net position of 20,44 7,000 of which 10.9 million you all have invested in your Capital assets leaving 9.5 million as unrestricted very healthy uh net position I commend you for that so again that's page 17 this statement of that position the next page page 18 this is the the statement of activities and this attempts to show the the expenses and the revenue and then ex uh Revenue again it's in my in my uh opinion this is a confusing statement to look at and so I'm not going to take you through this instead if we turn to page 21 I believe this is a a a more readable format to following go through Page 21 this is the statement of revenues and expenditures and changes in fund balance for the governmental funds you'll see that there's a column for the general fund and a column for the capital projects fund a third of the way down the page total revenues 3.3 million for the general fund a little over 2 million for the capital projects fund for total governmental revenues of 5.3 almost 5.4 million the middle third of the page shows the expenditures total expenditures for the general fund a little over 2 million capital projects fund just under 2.2 million for Combined of 4.2 4, 250,000 roughly in expenditures for the two funds then the bottom third of the page you see these are other financing sources in uses the general fund did transfer 1.1 million to the capital projects fund but overall the net other financing sources was 381,000 which consisted of debt proceeds if you're looking at this from a business perspective this would be roughly what net income would be so in the in the general fund you see net change in fund balance a positive 173,000 for the capital projects fund a positive balance positive increase of 1, 335,000 for a combined 1, 159,000 increases all across the board if you turn to page 25 page 25 is the statement of revenues and expenses and changes in net position for the proprietary funds these are your business type funds you have the storm water fund and the marina fund what are the two funds that the city operates again this is looking at the revenues and the expenses the revenues for the storm water fund 975,000 the marina fund 78,000 for a combined million 153,000 their expenditures 232,000 for the storm water fund 75 ,000 almost 76,000 for the marina fund for Combined 308,000 what does that yield that yields a net increase in net position of $743,000 roughly for the storm water fund $3,000 for the marina fund combined 745,000 so again positive net increases across the two funds and in total the next several Pages there's some more statements but then you get into the notes financial statements there's only just a few notes that I want to point out if you turn to page 44 page 44 at the top of page 44 this is Note 4 and uh the reason I point this out is uh this is concerning the receivables of the city so money that's owed to the city in the general fund the accounts receivable 334 almost 335,000 and underneath the the um chart that you see there I'm just going to read this this one paragraph This is on page 44 it's note4 accounts receivable accounts receivable for the general fund include $282,500 from a resident of the city for code violations for failure to meet construction scheduled timelines ordered by special Master on May 19th 2021 the city has no intention to forgive these findes and believes the balance will be fully collectible therefore the city has not recorded an allowance as of September 30th 2023 that's just a little unique to what you all have in the city so that's why I point that out as a no disclosure for you the next note disclosure I would point out is on page 45 sorry 46 46 is note n the bottom of the page these are the non-current liabilities of the city this lists the the loans the bonds and the compensated absences the top half of the the table are the governmental activities at the end of the year there were 1, 93,000 of non-current liabilities we call longterm and then underneath that the business type activities they have long-term or non-current liabilities of 1.7 million so again just pointing out what the the liabilities are for the city now we're going to jump almost to the very end page 86 under governmental auditing standards were required to issue a few more reports and on page 86 is what's called The Independent auditor report on internal control over financial reporting and on compliance and other matters based on an audit of financial statements performed in accordance with government auditing standards lots of words on this page the middle section of this page is called internal control over financial reporting it describes what a material weakness is and what a significant deficiency is I'm going to jump to the next and last sentence on this page it says in part during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we considered to be material weaknesses that's the part of that page you want to know if you turn to the next page the top of the page this is on page 87 the compliance and other matters last sentence in that top paragraph the results of our test disclose no instances of non-compliance or other matters that are required to be reported under government auditing standards again I would consider that to be the important sentence on that page the next page is the beginning of the management letter the management letter is presenting information that is required uh some more specifically for the State of Florida there's one section that I do need to point out uh it's the very last section on last on the last paragraph on page 89 so the second page of this letter so this the additional matters paragraph So it's it's this is just additional matters I'll just read it Section 10554 1 I3 rules of the auditor general requires us to communicate non-compliance with provisions of contracts or Grant agreements or abuse that have occurred or likely to have occurred that have an effect on the financial statements that is less than material again I want to point out that is less than material but warrants the attention of those charged with governance the city council in connection with our audit we noted the following control efficiencies during testing over the city's dispersements it was noticed six out of the 15 vendors tested that were issued material payments during the fiscal year were not registered with be verified the city entered into a contract with one vendor which explicitly listed terms related to eify this vendor also does not appear to be enrolled in E verify and is not registered as an active entity on the Florida Department of State website Sun his out so just a little little more background there we're not saying that this is a a material problem it's just something that came up during our testing we've discussed it with Kyle uh the the vendor in question I I believe uh you all are working out uh to make sure that you get the the contracts the the name of the contract correct or the name in the contract correct and um that if they would need to be issued to 1099 that you all would take care of that as well so just again not a material item but it's something that came up in our testing and so we needed to present that to you and then the very last thing on page 91 this is the independent accountants report on compliance with Section 218 415 for statutes section 218 415 Florida Statutes is concerning the investment of public funds during the year ended September 30th 2023 and the next to the last paragraph on this page says in our opinion the city of Belair Beach Florida complied in all material respects with the aform mentioned requirements for the year ended September 30th 2023 that concludes the presentation I welcome any questions thank you very much Mr Landers so do we have any questions that we would like to ask yes sir so everything there seemed very very positive with the exception of as you reference on page 89 is there anything that you can recommend that we can do so that we don't have a scenario where some of the vendors that we contract with are not registered with e verify sure absolutely uh I I would recommend as you on board a new vendor or or engage in business with them uh make sure that you get a uh the W I want to say before I'm not sure if that's the right number at this point got taxes going through my head also but but um W9 I believe is in the correct form uh so you get their full name uh their type of entity that they are and their EIN number and then uh just check it uh again before uh activating a new a new vendor check Sun Biz make sure that they are registered and that they're in active uh in the State of Florida if they require some type of professional license look at that or CPA firm you can check my name and our firm to make sure that that we're properly licensed as well so just a little bit of due diligence at the beginning I think we do good all right thank you other questionss all right um let's go to the citizens for comments thank you thank you very much indeed would any citizen like to make comments on this report before I uh ask for a motion to approve this to accept this report see a thumbs up everybody okay all right in

much for serving our city and welcome to planning and own all right we are on to the mysterious item number 12 it helps when your FL Drive is fully engaged it was all corrupt was just the strangest thing okay so this is for consideration of ordinance 24-02 Mr Mo would you please read the ordinance then provide a brief summary of what it all means happy Mr Mayor this is ordinance number 24-02 an ordinance of the city council of the city of Beller Beach Florida amending the Beller Beach code of ordinances subp Part B Land Development code chapter 94 zoning Article 1 in general section Improvement to reduce the look back period from substantial Improvement calculations down from 5 years to 1 year and amending Article 5 supplementary District regulations Division 1 generally section 24 94255 alterations improvements and repairs to align with flood plane ordinance requirements providing for implementation providing for resolution of conflicts providing for severability and providing for an effective date this has been a reading of ordinance number 24-02 by title only on first reading Mr Mayor uh this is um again in the spirit of the um Land Development code review that this Council has undertaken we are we are implementing those amendments that can that the city does not deem to be more burdensome or restrictive but rather less burdensome or restrictive uh purum to the restrictions of Senate Bill 250 or 280 sorry I think it's Senate Bill 250 um adopted during the 2023 legislative session uh in this amendment what we're doing and you can see the the the 5year calculation actually comes from the definition of substantial Improvement in your code it's a little hard to see because we do everything through strike through and underline but if you're looking at the definition uh on page 204 for this ordinance where it says substantial Improvement definition towards the right on the second line and also the like seventh line you can see five year has been stricken out and one year has been underlined and that's that's substantively where that definition and guidance comes for your administrators and your code so we're changing the substantial Improvement calculus to be a one-year look back as opposed to a 5-year look back um and then also because this is a a consonant Amendment um or consistent Amendment as far as being related to FEMA regulations and this is also came at the um encouragement of Mr sna and and with the manager's review where where it provides under the remodeling language it says um presently it says any permit application for which the total value exceeds a certain dollar threshold 20,000 shall be required have a certified appraisal we've removed that requirement to say market value shall be determined as defined in section 74134 and second section 74134 sets forth a few options for that appraisal not limited uh or for that um valuation not limited to a certified appraisal and so that's what we're doing there again making it less restrictive not enhancing the requirements and so those are these two amendments and again these have been discussed previously in the abstract during your code review and this is the ordinance implenting them on first reading we'll still have to do a second reading where this to pass tonight thank you Mr MOA uh before we take this to the council open for citizen comments yes sir please right on John Hy 22nd Street is not so much a comment it's more of a question the City attorney referenced a a Senate Bill 280 so we're being forced to reduce the look back based on the state law that I'm assuming has already been signed into law I'm just trying to get a little clarification and something about new FEMA Maps so that's all thrown into this trying letter understanding to U Council discussion I'm sure someone will try to uh make bring light to this okay thank you thank you any other questions or comments for the council our citiz and comments are closed Council uh when you need a motion to approve ordinance 24-02 Mr Mayor I would like the great honor of moving that this ordinance be adopted as proposed okay I'm going to give that to council member Elliot do I have second second second by frame than yes sir if I may just to inform the dialogue of the council address the inquiry that was posed based on my comment um from the from the member of the public um the during my during my opening explanation I referenced Senate Bill 250 uh during the 2023 not this legislative session but the last what that bill did was it was passed um post Ian and Nicole and provided that with within nowhere within 100 miles of landfall of those storms of which Beller Beach is within 100 miles of landfall of those storms and again landfall might be multiple places but be that as it may um you cannot adopt any land restrict Land Development code provision that is more burdensome or restrictive and so as we have done our Land Development code review some things we've said hey maybe we need to tighten this up or make this a little more restrictive these are not those um as it relates to changing look back from 5 years to one year that's a legislative decision that this body has made based on input from its residents um the study that the the student had presented and other other legislative inputs that each of you individually consider this is not a mandate this is legislative discretion being exercised um in terms of changing the look back period from 5 Year to one year and all the um Benchmark comparisons you've done so that's why we're here I just want to be clear this is not pursued to a mandate thank you um council member Elliott you have the Flor um we want to thank our mayor for bringing this to um a quick resolution as we have reviewed our set of ordinances um but this is maybe just pull it a little closer to you have a feeling that can't hear out there got to get on on record also but we want to thank our mayor for bringing this issue up as we were reviewing our ordinances and we were looking for improvements this is something certainly that the city has struggled with for a long time our citizens have struggled with this there is no requirement anywhere in other statutes or regulations that would require a 5year look back uh we support thema's rules in terms of trying to provide for good flood management uh but there's no purpose to a fiveyear look back and certainly support one year thank you very much uh other comments yeah I I think the important issue here is the only negative part of five years or one years is we have M permits come in rather than uh waiting 5 years and I don't think probably 9 10% of the citizens understand this that when you buy a house and someone lot of repairs to the house that you bought that gets taxed on to that 5year look back if it staying at 5 years so if your house is a praise let's say and this is famous structure of the house it's not your entire property it's just the structure of your house so if your house is at $300,000 of Praise You can only do $150,000 in repairs modifications substantial improvements so some people put new windows in put a roof on you can have 7 $5,000 tied up and you didn't even know it when you purchased the house wo a hurricane comes you got $80,000 in repairs the county will tell you to tear the house down all right because you're over that $150,000 and we had a resident that beat up on Kyle and Kyle didn't do anything but follow the code okay to the letter of the law in fact he tried to help me now a million times I believe and the county said tough it was over 12,000 uh yeah I mean we grossly calculated it but it was it was and and she's still out of it she's still out of her own I mean it's just it's it's a horrible situation and reducing this now to one year is is really just common sense thank you Mr Baker any comments Mr Roberts all right I uh I do think that this is a good good thing for our city it's uh it's also uh going to help us maintain the character that we love about Belair Beach it's going to help us keep our homes um in the spirit of the small Hometown Community beachfront community uh that U it brought us all here so it's not going to solve The World's problems I thought that zero was maybe uh too little and uh could be problematic in the future and uh it might actually put us on someone's radar so I think one year is uh is appropriate and I think in the long run this is this is the right way to go so would everyone like to vote on this now all right Rene would you mind calling the rooll please council member bankard yes council member Roberts I council member Elliott hi mayor gtis hi all right so the ordinance passes unanimously and we will vote again on this next month thank you everyone for uh working so hard on this I'd also like to thank planning only taking a look at this all right now we're on to item number 13 consideration of ordinance 24-3 Mr Mor you're up thank you Mr Mayor this is city of Beller Beach ordinance number 24-3 an ordinance of the city council of the city of Beller Beach Florida amending the Beller Beach code of ordinances subp Part B Land Development code chapter 19 4 zoning Article 4 districts division 3 residential low RL District 2 Section 94220 minimum living areas and setbacks to reduce the side setback for specified Lots in the Beller Beach first edition subdivision providing for implementation providing for resolution of conflicts providing for separability and providing for an effective date this has been a first reading of ordinance number 24-3 by title only uh as you can see here again in the strike through an underline on page two of three for this ordinance page 147 of the PDF the uh um lot change here is on the Lots one two and three row that is the second or the first substantive row with numbers in that table there on the side setback you see we're reducing the side setback from 15 to 7 which is why it is not more burdensome or restrictive it is reducing the setback and that's to make it consistent with other side setbacks you see such as in units AC and D in the area um this was presented initially by a particular property owner again we're not zoning to a specific property owner but rather two lots one two and three because your Land Development code has different side setbacks based on the platted Lots it's that's done in this format um so we're keeping the format just changing one little line here from 15ot back setback to seven and um if there's any more specific inquiries I think Kyle can provide rather manager refer can provide additional detail if me be but that's the proposed ordinance as with the last ordinance you have the business impact estimate as required by um statute and otherwise if if pass tonight this will pass this will have to pass on a second reading at ler dat thank you Mr MOA before we uh go into discussion we have any citizen comments yes sir Mr yes sir please come up and give us your name and address please hi my name is Scott Brown uh address is 907 Harvard Drive I am lot one of uh this area and I just wanted to introduce myself and uh express my support for the change I understand this is the first reading and there's second raing next month I'm going to be out of town for that raing I just didn't want it to appear that I wasn't interested I'm very interested and uh so I won't be here for the second one but uh I do support and uh hope it passes thank you Mr Brown appreciate your comments Mr [Music] transic John Hy 22nd Street I did my homework on this one I I found the code and these setbacks that are referenced my problem with this is you're going to go from 15 ft setback or on the side to 7t and yet we have people who complain about flooding basically in Lay terms if you go down to 7t for a side setback that means somebody could build a house within 7 foot of his property line 7t of the other property line we still got the 15t I I check mine too so I'm looking at this and I'm thinking we're going to put more stuff on the ground where rain isn't going to be abs or will be able to run off and create more flood I really don't understand what the point is but given the fact that we have issues with flooding and now we're trying to figure out where we're going to put Pump Station at the South End of the city and we do get Flooding at the North End I'm opposed to this for the simple fact run off from rain we haven't had a bad storm yet but the last one that came through last year while I was out of town my rain gauge only had 3 and 1/2 in from that total storm CU I use that to monitor what I need to do for irrigation but I'm not for that for that simple reason you got to have more porest land to absorb the water thank you Mr an any other citizen comments Council I need a motion to approve ordinance 24-3 I have a motion Mo motion made by council member Elliott do I have a second a second second by council member Banker council member Elliot you have the floor um I just wanted to respond to our citizen that the this particular change affects literally only three lots in the city um and houses I believe are already on these lots and um I think it is a change to make things consistent among our homeowners throughout the city and I support it thank you other comments or questions I was under the same impression you were on this and any new construction um it has to be up it's 10 10t above sea levels 100 maress and most people building 14 ft now 500 Mark so it still does reduce the drainage depending on how much concrete's p and I do have a problem with that um but again this is this is really say specific this if I'm wrong tell me it's it's one lot the uh Lots two three and four are all Bayside AP okay because I can support that but I I Sy citizens if we trying to we we do have an impervious surface ratio that every lot has to follow that plays into that Robert Kyle do we know why it was ever initially do we know why it was initially 15 ft was there a specific reason for that that anybody knows the history of I think originally one invest I think company owned all the Lots um before we got the uh Community Trust Grant um where we got money from federal government to purchase the three lots for a park okay um I I don't know that far back okay but the 15 it is the only 15t side setback the largest side set back and the rest of the city is 10 ft um and that's on the North End there's not one side setep back that is um 10 ft on the sou so it does match all the Beller Beach um units a c d e and D on the south end okay so I should have checked this myself so is that lot currently built on yes the house is already there yes okay so this unless he was to tear it down and rebuild the house this allows him to have um I don't know if if you want to place a shed or some kind of covering off of his house it allows him to get a little closer to the side prop line right then you normally go okay you have a map of that area that you could project yeah I just so yeah it's 907 Harbor so as you can see he's got 15 ft which is a pretty big you can't see the house next to it um so the planning planning and zoning board made this recommendation as well did did you have to go out and and work with them and present to them already yes sorry no I I didn't I met with uh Kyle and had a discussion with Kyle and made the request cuz I it really was a question why is my lot the only lot in the entire city of L Beach it has a 15t setback and it literally is the he looked it he couldn't believe it either it's the only house that has a OT setback okay so I just said can we make it the same as the rest of the city okay what is the size of the lot in relations to the others Mr Roberts more to your inquiry just as a point of Education while we do this in terms of what we're doing here it's a a legislative change not a variance and so the the gentleman or a property owner in a similar position would not ordinarily go planing and Zoning Board beyond the same interest he has here as a m to comment on it um it's not an application for Relief that he's seeking it's it's a just a legislative policy I just while we've got the downtime G the opportunity just clarify that difference thanks so you can see that dimensions a lot off the same most lots are about 110 ft it's on one side 114 on the other and it's close to 100 wide the front and on the back um if you look at some of these other houses they're not quite the same size lot you can see that they all have a little bit smaller setbacks to build closer to the property lines do you think that the uh setback was was put in place to prevent building bigger it's hard to say I mean you can Union two lots and and build a big house if you buy two Lots next to each other um we have larger size Lots if you go north into the city that might be the largest lot in the South but as you can see with some of these houses you know this being the biggest in the city and what is the U flooding issue in that area I mean if I don't have the exact square footage of what uh difference that s back would make but like I said the the impervious surf surface ratio of 65 is going to apply to every lot so regardless the size it's the same ratio so I'm not sure why we would you know he still held to the same standard okay I might point out also that this lot is Waterfront as well as adjoining a creek and that many of the improvements that are there are permeable surfaces so their papers are not concrete so um I for one am very concerned about flooding but I don't think this house is one that is contributing significantly to it we flooding however is in front of that house in the ad joining house where the storm water drain is and that's what project is a vient part is to stop the flooding that goes from the front of that in the street and backing up into the street the other all right thank you any other comments all right well let's just uh let's let's take it to a vote Rene would you please call the RO council member bankard yes council member Roberts I council member Elliott I mayor gtis I all right so that ordinance passes we'll vote again on it next month now we're on to item number 14 consideration of ordinance 24-4 Mr MOA would you please read the ordinance and then give us a brief summary Happ Mr Mayor one moment please this is ordinance number 24-4 of the city council the city of B Beach Florida amending the b beach code of ordinances sub Part B Land Development code chapter 94 zoning section 94-72 fences and section 94251 fences walls and hedges to allow for fences walls or Hedges on seaw wall caps providing for implementation providing for resolution of conflicts providing for separability and providing for an effective date this has been a first reading W is number 24-4 by title only uh and again um turning to substantively you're amending two sections so that they're consistent with each other but both of these um involve allowing for um offense so you can see on page two of six the second paragraph 94-72 subb the language is changed now so that offense shall also be permitted on but not Beyond The Waterfront facing side of the seaw wall cap to a height of 48 in uh there was some discussion at work sessions about this desire especially when you consider pets and other small children who might go across such caps and why those things may wish to be extended that was some of the your discourse on that again this is a policy decision for you and then 94251 fences walls and hedges uh you can see in sub two there's been language added to say fences walls and hedges shall be permitted on and not plac Beyond or overgrowing the Waterfront facing side of the seaw wall cap so if you want to use the dimensions of your seaw wall cap you can this does not give you license to extend it out or have hazly install a fence that extends you know several inches beyond your sea W line or other onse but you you wanted to be flush with your seaw wall cap to cover that space you can do so uh should this amendment be adopted and that's the language you have this is a longer Amendment only because I included the entirety of section 94251 um SE all the subsections but the only subsection being amended substantively is subsection two that spans Pages two and three of six of this or Pages 153 or 152 and 153 of the PDF of your track so um there's a bunch of other numbers after there that's just for completeness so it's there's no mystery as to what the rest of that section States um otherwise it pass tonight this we go to a second reading for thank you Mr Mora let's go to the citizens for comments any would like to comment on this ordinance all right citizen comments are closed made a motion to approve ordinance [Music] 24-4 so Mo motion made by council member Robert go have a second second second B Mr Roberts you have the floor yeah I just think it makes sense I don't think it's it's a big deal but um I think it makes sense as um Mr Morris said briefly when he was that that um you there are some issues with kids being on it that type of thing so it makes sense to be able to to be able to put a fence um you know the dimensions did not change so it's not like the neighbor is going to be obstructed now because of this change I think it makes sense thank you Mr Roberts any other comments right my question about this is um whether the Integrity of the seaw wall would be protected in the event that someone puts a fence there they're going have to drill into it and somehow fix the fence and how will the sea be protected I have a neighbor who just install a new F and I don't think that they fully understood the code um so it does extend a little further over the secap then stopping before it but the post that holds the entire fence in place is in the ground not in the sea wall um as far as Purp this everybody's got a dog in this city and if you don't block that seaw wall or the seap they're going to snake around they're going to come into your yard or you're going to be piling up like I did for years bricks and blocks and everything else that's falling into the uh into the water and it just looks awful and I I see nothing wrong with this I think it's a good idea any other questions or comments no all right then let's take it to a vote please council member bankard yes council member Roberts I council member Elliott I mayor gtis I so that one passes unanimously and we will vote on this one again next mon all right item number 15 this is for consideration uh authorizing a purchase order for Engineering Services to replace the South Park sea wall Mr Rachel thank you mayor so after we completed 7th Street Park and 16th Street Park sea walls um South Park was the next one on the list um I included some pictures it's very obvious um it's a very old seaw wall it's got a lot of spalling a lot of cracking um mostly cap valure um but you know at each joint of the concrete slabs it's separating um so we uh have been budgeting money to replace our seaw walls and um this has been on the corrective action list for the Park and Recreation board um for two years now so it's been noticed and um this would be to um start the design um to go go out the bid to get the seaw wall replaced thank you Mr re let's go to Citizens for comments anyone like to speak on this topic all right citizen comments are closed Council I need a motion to authorize a purchase order for Engineering Services to replace the South Park seaw wall motion made by council member ellott do I have a second I'll give that one to Mr Baker ellot you have the floor sounds perfectly sensible we need to maintain our sea walls this part of that process thank you um I have a question um just because I don't know what the real difference is between a city on piece of property versus private property but generally well in fact I'm as you know I'm working on getting an new all now um I just hired one company and they did it all um is there specific reason why we have to do Engineering Services with one company to hand the project off to another company that might have done that anyway um mainly because and um attorney more here from Ron it's mainly because we need to have the plans so that we can because of the price of the project we know that it's going to be something that needs to be bided out um so to get that um all the you know plan design done so that when we we release the bit um we have all that taken care of and then any company that comes and replaces sea walls can use that um from the bid so it's perfectly specked out of how it's going to be done yes and then every uh bitter of same design on so that it's fair it's uh it just seems a little shocking to me that it cost 6,000 bucks to go yep you need a seaw wall and and and it's going to look the same no matter whose it is this does um you know this does include the um the engineers coming out up to three site visits um to do the inspecting on top of what the county will already do it was part of the permitting process so it's actually a little it's a little extra um being its public property um making sure that it's done correct that's fun that's fine I was just uh just just curious there are there are multiple ways as the mayor to to get construction projects done the kind of would basically be like a design bill so you find one firm who does both of those or you do a hard bid you design it with company a and then bid it out to multiple construction Learners there's three or four other ones you can use but a simple thing like this uh is a the way the way our city manager is doing it makes sense all right thank you very much any other comments no all right well let's take it uh to we'll just do a Voice vote on this one all in favor I any oppos all right Mr reefer you are authorized to proceed sir unfinished business we have any unfinished business all right uh let's see here now we're on to council comments we're going to start with council member Elliot this one I don't have a whole lot to say I think we've accomplished a lot over the last month we've gotten great input from our citizenry and I think we've reached some good decisions so a good night I agree uh Mr Roberts I do have something to say about the way I just didn't have a good feeling or taste regarding how we handled the three citizens who step forward after we were um really trying to get citizens to step forward to join the council so I'm concerned that in the future when we try to do something like that again that we may have people that saw that and witnessed that and saw what happened May deter other citizens from stepping forward so it just bothered me so I just wanted to talk about it a little bit and say I hope that if we decide to proceed and bring on an additional council member or three that other people will understand what we did and not be deterred from stepping up because I still think and I think we all agree that we'll probably need at least one more councilman member to be up here with us and we're not saying necessarily that the three that appli earlier are done I don't believe so I just wanted to to voice my opinion on that because if I were in their shoes and they did all the things that they did to step up and say Hey I want to be on on the city's Council I think I bring something to the table and nothing happened I may not be to happy about that so I just wanted to voice thank you very much Mr Banker you're up I going take Elliot's time um last month I went to the bores meeting because I spoke to sheriff about b beach residents visiting the beach being moved on the beaches of B Shores when they're laying laying out just sitting in a chair the sheriff know he would inform his deputies should not move people sitting or lying on the beach because simply there is no certified I actually in the area no certified ero control line either the only true Mark is the construction line by fale which is the sea wall of the properties of that area I do want to stress that this should be in no way telling anyone to approach themselves as close as possible to keep property B shs this was further noted by the sheriff's at that Mee also noted at the was two complaints about b beach R beaches at B Shores one of the complaints is from commissioner stories no we took out Sea Oats on his property he lives all the way at the South End of the Val Shores although I seen pictures of our ring and truly that's not the case The Rake marked were many feet away from the sea of this property another complaint from a resident of B was that a bottle fell out of the rap during the rap period and was left under a problem just to know me and this Council woman did Beach clean up Saturday and there was what six or seven cans and bottles St bikes and chairs shes that I guess people were just faring that night just said just leave here so anyway so also was also noted that that me was the denial of Bard Beach would be compensated for B Shores for any legal action they saw their Mor's letter to b beach that was followed by one of the Commissioners possibly suggesting removing the parking in the Lots dedicated to the b beach I know during citizens comments if that was the wishes of the Commissioners I would contact American Disability associated in during the meeting was also noted for Citizens comments B Shores ordinance 2201 which was addressed last year by a resident Val Beach to sum up this ordinance it allows B air Shores residents to erect temp temporary structures of shade Etc anywhere and leave on Ved beaches while prohibiting residence of Beller be ET the same simply ordinance 2201 I believe as the councilman violates the fedal for equal protection after the meeting I was thanked by all the Commissioners for my input I had a long talk with commissioner stories who also lives at the First Southern House of B Shores thiser adjacent to the IRB 28 Street beach access I told commissioner story that b beach residents are not the problems and most are simp B insurance issues although we need to work together I further noted that the resident that brought up the 2020 20221 ordinance is serious about filing a federal lawsuit B shes attorney needs to contact him sooner then later I also emailed valur attorney the next day emphasizing this and was upset with legal cost of the other lawsuit a federal one might not might not be covered under their insurance and please seek out the resid to avoid litigation I further sent a text to commissioner story in this regard simply I have not heard back since I sent this email I further noted all this to Mr Moore this past week and hopes he could motivate their counsel taking to not as a councilman like my colleagues who pledged to up hold our federal and state constitution B refuses to rectify 2201 I compelled to be of any student res I am oppos that Mr nor their counsel and their Commissioners look at that ordinance and work each thank you Mr Baker on that note would anyone like to make a motion to adjourn motion motion made by Banker again do I have a second second second by Roberts all in favor hi all right good night everyone"
