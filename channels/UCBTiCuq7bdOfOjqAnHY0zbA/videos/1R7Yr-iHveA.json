good evening mayor and council members my name is Aaron glance I just want to take one of your time to introduce myself uh recently I accepted a position here with the city Builder Beach as the community services administrator that's the reason why I came in this evening just wanted to show my face and can't wait to meet you at some point during my time here with the city thank you Mr glance very nice to meet you anyone else like to speak yes hey everyone good evening Tammy lavender 97 Harbor Drive um just want to say a couple things um representing the Bellaire Beach Community Foundation a couple updates and announcements so so far our break program has been going very well we've had enough brick orders to do our first Square so that should be installed shortly one new addition if you say you have um if you own your own company or if you have your own logo you can for an additional ten dollars put your own logo as you stamp on the brick and if you have any questions about that there's more details on our website [Music] second thing we're going to have our first fundraiser on April 20 to an end it's a little bit different from the events that we've had in the past it's from six to nine pm on a Saturday it will be an indoor event it's going to be an Earth Day Sunset social celebration we're going to have a DJ clean eats is going to be here with the food we're going to have cash bar and it's going to be a 10 minimum entry fee for our donation for entry fee and the fundraiser is to raise money for the 16th Street kayak launch was which has been requested many times but hopefully we raise enough money to get that installed the next thing I'd like to talk about is um February is free friends in February it's a drive for the Pinellas County Animal Shelter so there is more information on our website and there are two boxes in the Lobby of City Hall and they have a list of things that they're requesting as you know Frank banker and city council he volunteers there and so he he mentioned it each cleanup one day that there was a need so we thought that we would do a drive during the month of February um keeping those beautiful I posted about this our first Bridge cleanup was very successful we had 22 volunteers which was wonderful and we collected about 40 bags of trash from under the bridge please look for our new sign that they should be installing it on the causeway shortly and our next cleanup is in April and then last but not least the receipts if you donated in 2022 all the receipts have been sent out if you did not get your donations receipt please just reach out for Wendy Nicole or I will be happy to get that to you and that's all they have thank you very much thank you would any other citizens like to speak all right all right Moses sent some comments uh now we're on item three we have a presentation from the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office beginning with law enforcement monthly report good evening to everyone Sergeant Royce Switched at Pinellas County Sheriff's Office and I am here presenting the activity for December of 2022 under the UCR property and person crimes hold wrong I would like to say that it was a slow month but unfortunately if you weren't aware we had a lot of vehicle burglaries uh one weekend during the month of December it was the weekend I believe of December 10th and 11th so with that being said there was also one motor motor vehicle theft related to that burglary where a key was left inside an unlocked vehicle so with that being said again we use the Sheriff's Office strongly encourage residents and visitors to make sure they lock their doors and not leave any valuables inside if we move along to the arrest section there were a total of four people that were arrested within the city and in looking at the activity that looked like that was transient activity a couple of DUIs and a dwlsr under Deputy activity you'll see that there were a total of 720 events in this city we leading that work directed to trolls and traffic's activity I'm sorry traffic enforcement and then there was one crash in the city and that was located at Gulf Boulevard and 7th Street and then there were a total of 174 combined citations and warnings issued within the city and that is all I have questions from the council Mr Baker um December 10th and 11th uh was anyone apprehended or keep quiet in in the research that I did that has not yet been anybody apprehended the detectives are following up on any leads looking at video evidence and whatever they can find to go for that I just want to comment that um that means we're going up and down just your deputies were going up and down the street knocking on everybody's door I thought that was just great I mean a little bit concerned about it what that is uh obviously and I wasn't working that weekend my deputies weren't working that weekend but I enjoyed as part of routine control driving up and down every street within the city and I can tell you that Deputy Dean also enjoys driving up and down the city sits out on Gulf Boulevard so unfortunately we can't be everywhere so that's where we strongly encourage residents to make sure that they lock their doors and not leave any valuables inside any other questions or comments thank you very much Sergeant thank you all right now we're on the code enforcement monthly report good evening Mr mayor council member staff citizens Deputy cloudcraft for the record uh as you see in your reports we again very busy for the month of January um some of the things that we did take care of is we had three properties within Miller Beach that we had some major issues on one at 12 and gold one on 17 and one on 21st um with the help of Kyle we issued uh letters and summons or for hearings for it to get these properties cleaned up um and again throughout the city also trying to get some more of the citizens to comply with local ordinances um had a few extra issues with permits again unlicensed contractors but again we're working on that with the building department and the Pinellas County Construction licensing board questions or comments from the council yesterday um looking down the list here 109th 13th Street was that mentioned on previous month reports of code violations uh 109 13th show search posted notice reference to violation oh yes that was a um an issue without having a pool installed there and so there's a sediment bag that had to be changed so we had we had some issues with that before [Music] any other questions or comments I I didn't notice that we received more information than we usually do which is uh which is nice I'm sure it's a it's a combined effort to put all this together but this is uh this is an incredible data and it's nice to see it thank you well the credit's got to go to Kyle he's my teacher and we just got to work on these things together but yes all right thank you very much I do foreign now we are on to item four this is a presentation from Pinellas Suncoast fire and rescue District by Chief Jeff Davidson I have invited Jeff Davis to begin this monthly reports again thank you good evening mayor and council members and Community I'm Jeffrey Davidson the fire chief for Pinellas Suncoast fire and rescue District proudly serving Miller Beach on on behalf of the entire District I wanted to express my sincere thank you for the support on passing the referendum vote in November by 74 percent which will allow us to continue to serve our residents in Bellaire Beach we've been serving since 1951 so thank everybody very much for your support there's a lot of activity in psfrd as we continue to strengthen our organization we're actively pursuing the assistance of firefighter grants through FEMA and based on our population we're eligible for up to one million dollars in funding and we're looking at all the items that meet the notice of funding opportunities requirements uh the submissions are due this Friday and the awards begin weekly in September so we're submitting for new fire hose extrication equipment bunker gear thermal imaging cameras new Motorola radios physical fitness equipment many of the things that firefighters need to do their jobs in the upcoming months I will be asking my Board of Commissioners to allow me to put out a RFP for fire station design and construction we are conducting a study to verify the proper placement of the stations and currently we are looking at a place for a new fire station at the very Northern end of Indian Rocks Beach to better serve the city of Bellaire Beach are our firefighters and paramedics recently saved the life of a commissioner and a neighboring Town who had suffered a massive heart attack early placement of the AED and CPR by the police chief who was there was very instrumental my Crews arrived in under four minutes and they performed Advanced cardiac life support the patient was transported to a local hospital and he made any full recovery their commission honored by firefighters for their efforts and then I submitted that to the John Maroney Legacy foundation and art groups were chosen out of all of Pinellas County to receive an award that the First Responders preseason dinner this Saturday so I'm very proud of the hard work and Professional Services that our firefighters and paramedics always provide to our community I would like to ask the Commissioners here today and council members to allow me to use the Bel Air Base City Hall to do any public information session upcoming on the status of the Emergency Medical Services for the beaches particularly Bellaire Beach and how the services need to be improved and would be funded by the county at no additional cost to our residents if I could have your permission to coordinate a date that the hall is open and looking at possibly February 27th it's a Monday night and would be open to questions answers and the presentation from anybody who would like to attend our Council before I turn the floor over to you uh this is a kind of a problem with with the chief working date out with the city manager for this event it sounds like uh you just need to reach out to the city manager and plan a date accordingly and we look forward there and now council do you have any questions for the fire team all right I have I have one what was the response time on the event that you described from notification to the fire department to at the patient was uh four minutes and three seconds I believe and that's one of the things that I want to explain in this presentation is the correlation between time and survival rates you know there's a lot of things that in the medical field where time is muscle if it's a cardiac event or time is brain if it's a stroke event and things that need to be done and some things that are lacking in the system that have been lacking for quite some time and I want to address how we can fix that so that we can have the best services for our residents and all of our visitors to keep everybody safe thank you very much there's a that's an impressive time and uh I hope that I never have to use your services but if I do I hope that yes sir I left a few business cards on the table if anybody like to get a hold of me never my email address and phone numbers on there you can call me at any time and again thank you very much thank you thank you all right we're up to item number five this is the city attorney's report Mr Morton thank you Mr Mayor during the last few weeks I had the occasion to meet with the manager on a few occasions on various items one of which was facilitating two meetings with the planning and zoning boards in its capacity as your land Planning Association so we continue to move forward potential plan amendments as well as one of the ordinances that's before you this evening as we approach discussing the ordinance this evening it occurred to me that before our last meeting on the 21st I had the opportunity to travel to St Augustine and present to the institute for elected Municipal officials emo your newest council member joined there and attended and I had the opportunity to present on a parliamentary procedure and enroll the City attorney and one of the things that I talked to at some length I mean that was only a few weeks after having given a similar presentation to the Volusia County Commission was on the importance of debating the measured hand and not the individual members or motives of your peers ostensibly we are all here in service of the public trust at the last meeting and on at least one likely two occasions that I can remember previously there's been some suggestion that I produce for a product for you with the sole purpose of generating lawsuits or some other profit mechanism for myself on the back end I take my job very seriously I take the my oath to Florida the oath I take as a constitutional officer Charter officer in your communities this is my livelihood this is how I put food on the table this is my good name so it's important to me that you recognize that as I give you work product I take no issue with you telling me that you're unsatisfied with the product if you think the policy should move in a different direction be better framed better phrase approach differently take into account factors that I may have in my uh fallible state of the human overlooked some Factor I'm happy to consider all of that all of that is appropriate I will I do take umbrage with the suggestion that I'm doing work driven by some profit motive most especially because I I truly believe in the altruism of what it is you folks do I thank you for the work you do because frankly I don't do it I get to tell you man that sounds like a tough decision tell me what you're going to say um and and that's how this whole system works I can't go out um something is Insidious if that's anyone address and I did not wish to derail your work session as you debated an important matter to your community by addressing it in that moment but it was something that to me I felt needed addressing so I appreciate the opportunity to address that during my report otherwise I continue to work with the manager to advance the suggested revisions that assign code to advance your comp plan amendments through the LPA and any other issues as they present themselves and I'm happy to answer any questions or address any concerns you may have thank you Council okay I guess yeah I just want to thank you personally uh you know looking at what you do for us and at least after talking with you I appreciate everything you do for this Council very much so I appreciate that and I'm certainly not fishing for any compliments or any other sort Factory sheet and gesture I just wish to make clear that I can't let a signal like that going interest anyone else like to make a comment all right thank you for addressing that and uh I appreciate your work also and thank you for this report all right next we are about to item six which is the city manager's report Mr reefer thank you mayor council um starting off with the 12th and 13th Street project we did on January 24th get that album I talked about in the last minute he replaced I came in under warranty from the manufacturer staff down there immediately put it back in so that the check valves function properly and they're not getting tied washing back into the streets we came a little bit over a budget that is on the agenda tonight for a budget amendment one of the quotes about from the televised for the Cure place line and for Two Plates we're looking at about fifty thousand dollars I want to see if I can get that out the bid possibly internet store or a project because if we can get competitive pricing on that it'll be useful to us but we need to do pipe prepared so I'm hoping to tag that along on the bed the underground project right now we're just waiting on the materials let's do get some materials I stopped off at the marina same place as the last project you know it'll take off pretty quickly with the conduit building the 7th Street boat ramp I got a sketch drawing from the engineer it was the last meeting you guys if there's some way we can make direct or functional for the residents you can recommend it if we could do anything we uh you drew out a sketch of concrete bags in burlap and he you know in her I guess you'd say something to see if something happened and some Filter Fabric underneath it and he says that's done in a lot of areas and it'll just increase like the stability with the ground after the wrap so I'm glad I ordered all the supplies my stuff hopefully out there probably won't want to finishing that up after that you know they replaced all the filter in the sod on January 26th I think they did a beautiful job really excited to get the ramp over the residents um for our 17th and AC 3's project uh the citizens advisory Ron saganic and I have been working pretty hard along with Heather our financial advisor and putting the other protections for the next five years and we've shared that with the financers and we're looking good to be able to approved for a loan at this point where you're not we received one term sheet for One bank and we're trying to get another form of South State so um at that point when I take it back to scac and then you'll be here for the last one of these meetings for a presentation to proposal um code enforcement and like I said I kind of revise the report I tried to make it a little bit more visual take out a lot of that check boxes that were in between all the cells and uh related back to the Serbian lead so what I do so what I did is I made STEEZ and pour a drop down list of the categories we've talked about on our survey so that you could select what you know what where the issue fell and then we could track it and then be able to put the numbers back we'll be surveyed um another thing I noticed I was looking at it is you kind of have like a start date a close date and if you looked at every violation it was like it started in closing the same thing and then it didn't really apply to anything so I reworked the sheet so that um and instructed Steve that when you know his first sighting or whatever the violation is that date and then when he comes back it closes it up and bounces back around and shows they're told the kids open so it reflects under until the issue is solved um like I said I tried to put some grass in here I'm using Excel just to kind of give it an overview you can see kind of the areas you're focusing on if there's any concerns from the council I think you know we'll be able to see where the Network's getting focused and maybe ask questions the other graph it's a little pie graph this is on the streets I think Steve does a pretty good job getting around the city pretty evenly they just found things up on the different species here and then the last table I played was an outstanding code violations this is actually an idea from a resident who asked you know what's going on with this issue and how do we get information on it I was like it's a very good point because the code for it you know show us a month and putting track things that are outstanding so it kind of put the others outstanding I think it's good because uh you know so it shows a lot about fines doesn't help and uh you know lists the co-violation notices or hearings are sent out the city hall generator I got another option it's the uh it's a mobile unit it's used it's got a one-year warranty asked if there's any extended warranty plan for that but it's a diesel generator and if we were to get because in the past if you remember it was I think donated to the fire department but we had a multiple generator that is what hooked up to the quick unit down there so it's pretty much the same idea to run the whole building if we use the same connection point which would be in the back it's a lower elevation but it'll be 97 000. but if we want to it is another option because the parking lot's a higher area and you know if we get some flooding down in there we can put the connection station where the crawl spaces of our building in the front parking lot and pull right up into there so it wouldn't be uh we would be avoiding the cost of putting it up on a stand and um you know tough it away or use it let me ask you where you would store a uh a trailer generator that could help into the arm there it'd be a little tight but we could do it these stockpiles and materials there so let me just bring that up golf can I spell buoy replacement uh I have the permit I am waiting on one more installation quote good news is identify the contractor of 12 500. and then as far as Bel Air Shore I relayed the message to their class their talent attorney and she's taking it to February 21st meeting along the lines that if we were willing to fund the cost of the installation of the lease and the payments would they be willing to do the necessary steps of changing their avoidance so we'll see what comes back on that um Morgan parking lot is getting done this this month I've just checked the contractor during their Dean so we're probably about the closer to fight children's play around like the shipping they got pushed back to April 14th it sounds like it's solid at this point a little disappointing it's taking us along but the this place that company is still interested in the building so I'm kind of keeping in touch thank you uh Council questions yes Mr Banker good questions you know the make of the generator it's a John Deere here that's right here maintenance contract over the local Johnson I don't know if you're going to address this Mr Mayor or not but Mr weather up here on 109 13th Street and it's it's in his city manager report seeing this guy from hearing careers just at large short-term rentals or whatever this is uh I planning over the recipe is all this is just the information for the record um I think member stable is asking about the 109 13th Street and that is a short-term rental and it does have a hearing schedule thank you any other questions or comments from the city manager yes sir Mr Roberts so Kyle on the um extending the boat ramp on 7th street I'm just curious so and actually go down there myself to see it but when it's low tide is the end of the ram still in the water we live in the tides very very low it really pulls back I mean you get that little island out there that gets exposed so there's still good after that far out into the into the water a lot to go to that point okay if that's what they want to do it's possible but really does draw back okay so the engineering firm has in mind some distance that they're going to extend those concrete bags different bags to allow build trailers to go further to go further off yeah basically get down to the sort of the bottom of the surgeon and just um without like drop off or anything unstable okay now as far as the water going back it really types out you know they're just going to have to go with that if they can okay the goal was to make sure that they didn't have a launch that they would fall off Direct ly the 17th and 18th Street stormwater project so that's listed there as a single project but we're really not pursuing that as a single project is that correct that's correct that's why we want to pull a odd issue all the projects okay um any other questions or comments Mr reefer I gave you a call a week or two ago about a situation where there was some growth coming out into the street was a hazard it was an eyesore I won't mentioned what street it was but it was an unfortunate situation where the homeowner was basically impossible for the homeowner to do about it so I called this Reaper and he took care of it and his staff took care of him and I greatly appreciate it as I'm sure the residents who've been surround that so thank you very much yes sir thank you on the 12th and 13th Street I did see the contract after maybe a week or two ago with they were addressing some of the low spots in the gutter which is wonderful but it looks like and I know you're probably no more than I am but it looks like kind of a domino effect where they would raise the gutter level to make the water move in a certain direction and it may have caused you know an additional problem Upstream effective lack of a better term in the other system but I know you're on top of that so are they finished completely because they have still notice and gutters that are policy water we're still holding the retainers so all the engineers go back and I'm sure okay there was that one section they put that uh flow line in within favorite flag is there a specific area on 12th or 13th yeah were they were working kind of on 12 well close to the pond you know on every side of the pond so they were working in there raising it which I'm sure that was a low spot so they were trying to create a scenario where the water would move to one of the grates which I'm sure did but to do it so it sort of looked like because they raised that area to move the corner then some water upstream was now being held back but something just take a look at and across the street I did notice one thing that I've asked before one of the grades looks like I guess they weren't removed during the original project so this lack of a better terms of rusting older right right there at the turn you come in when you're heading East on 12 and you make a left-hand turn what's that base all day right there on the left hand side it maybe that was one of those grades where we couldn't get them out I'm not sure what the deal was there they saw the immigrants and thanks what else cool all right thank you very much Mr reedler I appreciate all your hard work but that's the seven Gentry I don't have a project update per se but for personnel you saw you met Aaron and he's really jumped in with both feet he's really enthusiastic and then we made a offer of employment for an administrative assistant so we're waiting for that process to go through you know for more help in the front to help more residents and we're really excited about that and that's that's all I have all right thank you very much thank you very much thank you all right now we are up to the consent agenda this is items eight and nine for approval of the January 9th 2023 city council meeting minutes and approval of the January 21st 2023 city council work session and it's do I have a motion to approve motion to improve as presented it was made by Frank Banker do I have a second thanks second bye Floyd Roberts all in favor aye any opposed consent agenda Passage all right we are now on to the regular agenda I am number 10. this is for consideration of the appointment of Mr Mark Mariano is a board of adjustments alternate member Mr Mariano is present would you like to address the council future good evening Council mayor thanks for having me so recently moved to the city of Miller Beach approximately a year ago a group from the town of Bel Air so I've done the planning board there for about seven or eight years I have about 24-ish years of experience in land planning City Planning I own my own real estate development company now I'm the CEO of another real estate development company so I do bring a unique perspective the level of experience to rewards and I do like to give back to the community and participate as a board member where I can and when I moved in I talked to Patty about any openings there were circled back towards the end of the year that's began and she said yeah there are two one for report adjustments and then one for maybe your Parks and Rec board which probably is less applicable to my experience level so I sent the application in hey Miss Gentry said yeah I want to come in and meet the board there is a alternative spot open so I'm here to see if I can be appointed to the board of Justice thank you very much first off am I pronouncing your name Mariano um I'd like you to stick around for just a few minutes council do you have any questions for Mr Mariana yes I say are you pursuing any uh business within Bel Air meet you at this time no we don't we do multi-family residential apartment communities that was my old company and we do multi-family but it's single-family rental large scale 350 400 unit developments throughout Florida and seven other states across the country so no nothing any other questions okay Mr Mariano I um I Heard a little bit about you and uh apparently you're just grossly overall for this position however if you would like to stick around and work with us uh we'll we'll wait and see what the council says and uh I appreciate you applying for the position all right thank you all right let's go to the citizens uh you can have a seat sir let's go to the citizens for comments and would anyone like to comment uh yes sir Mike Kelly evening Council my name is Mike Kelly I'm your board of adjustment chairman um I agree that Mr Mariano is very very qualified for the position I think the opportunity of our board to to add in as an alternative member and potentially ultimately on the actual board is his Advantage for Bellaire Beach I've had the opportunity to work with Mr Mariano's development company Mosaic in the last two years at a commercial project in downtown St Petersburg although I only had a couple meetings with him for reconstruction working with general contractor the job went very smooth and the staff and the experience that I had working with his firm was very very positive so I endorse the council to consider his appointment and recommend him to be headed to our board thank you very much Mr all right before we uh we debate this appointment I'm going to need a motion to move forward especially the Tara do I have a second second by Mike said Miss materials [Music] all right would anyone else like to comment so right well if that's the case on this Gentry would you please call the roll council member Bank sorry yes council member Baker yes council member Livingstone yes council member Notaro yes council member Roberts council members Abel yes mayor Gaddis hi so uh unanimously congratulations Mr Mariano thank you for volunteering for service [Applause] thank you all right we're on to agenda item number 11. this is consideration of ordinance 23-01 Mr Mora would you please read the ordinance I don't believe Mr Mayor this is ordinance 23-01 an ordinance of the city council of the city of Bellaire Beach Florida amending section 94-220 pertaining to the table of designated living areas and housing setbacks providing for separability and providing for an effective date it's been a first reading coordinates 23-01 by title loan foreign yes you're about to give us a brief history of this ordinance and what it will accomplish yes there's been a few in in the recent months there's been a few hearings that have preceded a variance not based on any um misrepresentations by a property owner or perhaps not even based on a staff oversight but based on confusion with how the city's code should be administered as you can see typically you're going to strike through Runner line I don't call things out in red text I did hear because of the density of the table but you can see here that the code made a reference to a Bellevue Estates in a few instances spelled v-i-e-w there is no such place in the city the prior ordinance actually did have the right language there but as it was Quantified it was unclear it was it was uh written incorrectly as codified however in addition to that edit there was most substantively the very final row provided a completely different set of setbacks you can see here it's a 7.7 and a half in the final row it suggests that the Bellevue Estates Island side setbacks were seven and a half feet well earlier to the top of the same page it says that it's 10 feet unless it's on a series of certain Lots in which case it's seven and a half and so as administering it became very difficult for the engineer staff and otherwise to reconcile those positions and see okay if somebody is applying what's the number well it's kind of sort of this but also that and So to avoid that confusion this is what in some communities might be called a housekeeping matter of cleaning up the code to avoid that confusion and that's what this revision does this is an instance of your city manager as the administrator of the code having administered it in a few instances now and said I think we can do better Randy can you address something though we took it before PNC PNC reviewed it at the meeting last week and recommended approval to the commissioner founded in line for the commission to move forward and so it is now before you on first grade uh before we give to the council we need to go to the citizens with any citizen like to comment on this uh ordinance 23-01 nope all right I'm going to need a motion to approve coordinates 23-01 and then we will discuss ocean motion made by Frank Baker do I have a second second all right Lloyd Roberts Mr Banker do you have the floor [Music] um I guess the ordinances says what it says I don't think there's any more discussion anyone else no I do have a question who caught this I'll caught this um in the East Movement he's over there trying to address his mission he ran away Kyle caught this after after a couple instances where you know property owners are their developers representatives were trying to apply and try and make sure we administered the code properly and I would say that Kyle will only caught it I prioritized it now issue that manifested only in the last less than two months and Kyle immediately said well we I know we can change hope let's change this right away nice job uh do we have any other questions or comments yes um recording in progress it says and then it says within the residential little District the following the actual living areas and missing house setbacks and then the table talks about the minimum living area so is that that will be harmonized by second reading and that was in the original text as well and I appreciate you catching that and bringing it to my attention so right before the meeting and we'll definitely make sure that that is harmonized a member uh nataro's noting that it says the title of the section is minimum living areas and setbacks and well we're concerned with setbacks here very principally um the next thing that's under it says maximum and then the table goes back to minimum so we just need to fix that alignment so the following Max I'm going to change it to minimum okay that will be done before your next meeting thank you any more comments before we take a roll call on this one no Mr Gentry council member bankard yes councilmember Livingstone yes council member Notaro yes council member Roberts aye council member Sabo aye mayor Gaddis hi so it passes unanimously that is the first reading of ordinance 23-01 okay we are on to agenda item number 12. this is for authorization to execute continuing contracts for Engineering Services and this was placed on the agenda by city manager reefer Mr reefer you have the floor thank you mayor um so in October council meeting is recommended that go out and get do an RFQ for continuing to use in your Contracting services so from that point to turn Laura providing me with a great template to start from that he was comfortable with and we changed it around for our purposes and advertising November 16th and we receive your statements qualifications if it's all the way up to December 20th from there distributed the packages to Heather our Financial Consultant and I went through them we did an initial screening I scored them based on the score sheet that's valued in the RFQ at that point we had six further or more qualified we would want to bring them all into your view so scheduled all those interviews and learned a lot finishes scoring up again my recommendation because we've determined that all these engineering firms are professionally qualifying for our services they have a lot of examples of projects they've done in local communities in other small cities so I'm recommending that all six we do continuing contracts with and then when we have a proposal we send it out and see people to get back pushing there okay I bet that that was a uh very interesting interview process and uh before we uh bring it back to the council do we have any comments from these citizens I'm going to need a motion to authorize the city manager to execute continuing contracts for Engineering Services through our Evolution so moved eligible contractors and uh just like to move into a vote any other comments from the council yeah oh yes that's where Arts not just a quick question Kyle so once this gets passed which I'm confident it will and we have the six engineering firms in-house what's the process that we typically use so we have a need for engineering firm do we have a process in place what is the process of the process sort of changes with this RFQ because it does have an actual a way to assign projects here so it's called a work authorization form it's found in the stairway in the back contract and for example like if we're here in Crystal my project here we've made it up on that form in a universal format that we distribute to it engineer firms that have the contract okay and then they'll come back with different proposals um the other thing would be the site plan review same idea we're gonna look we're going to put together the school and lay out all our needs and then we're going to see what comes back I'm kind of have some feeling right now but that's cool and then you and your team which is fine internally you guys make the decision with regards to whatever the qualification process is as to who you want to award it to um my idea with the site plan review is to have multiple firms on Deck I knew what we ran into in the past is we have one person who did it very well and health issues and then it's kind of scrambled so I'd like to at least kind of add to be in practice and then you'll go from there and that's that's more along the lines of when someone does a new build it's a hundred dollar fee um keeping keep the fees and collect in check with what the Engineering Services we're having to be in place no majorities when it when it's a project proposal um that will be will distribute the work authorization for me that the proposals back but that will come before you thank you other questions for Mr Lee for concerning this comments no okay let's take it to a vote this is to authorize the city manager to execute continuing contracts for Engineering Services hey council member Banker yes councilmember Livingstone yes council member Notaro yes council member Roberts council member Zabo aye mayor Gaddis hi again it passes unanimously Mr reefer you were also all right we are up to item number 13. this is the consideration of approval for a budget commitment to increase the storm water system account due to project change Awards also was placed on the agenda by city manager reader Mr Reed for you at the board okay just to clarify that um the money will come from the same phone the stormwater fund is increasing our project budget based on diverse that we experienced and that counts the total amount is 30 977.98 that's made up of 26 562.98 which was from the main contractor company lights the exceed of the contract which I'm going to um and then the other is for because of some conflicts and we're not experience there was more additional engineering hours of the field and that was a an increase by trans systems which is previous Associates um you remember engineer science group originally had this contract from the Dual took over that contracts the I just went over the history here in the original contractor now the one thing that to note bill has been we did a total big amount of 717 thousand dollars uh base project line items in the 652 000 and then you know with every project we have a 10 contingency and in that bed we had if needed items instead of having those built into the contract and yet that we said that they would come out of the contingency so that left us with that 65 000 dollars into easy to work um over the course of the project we had seven change orders which came before you because of the amounts that covered the inlet box and modified conflict structure an unknown RCP removal plus the replacement of the 12 inch PVC pipe we it was a smaller change order decided to put a class three or a class 4 RCP versus class three because special education Union president asphalt increased over the project that was a verified those engineers and lastly we didn't set the volume Mr Milling because if you're about to 12th Street and 13th Street the crown of the road is extremely high in that area so there's a lot of asphalt over late on top of it and in some areas it was a fun so we did some extra healing to bring it more in line with the curve for the front project I think the engineers that calculated and did a great job as they ended up um so I included not only their pay app but I included my spreadsheet which I was tracking the project and um there's two items that um that went significantly over um over what their employment um and uh it was a explanation from the engineer because of the additional pipe that we put in just areas where we had to do the conflict structures needed more base so that ran over the other area point out any if needed items was the direct driveway replacement after discussing with the engineer the brake driver replacement was it was an estimated amount that there really was no way of going around and replacing those potatoes so I just kind of you know for future projects you know ask you know this this is not this isn't really interesting um and I think that would give us a better forecast yourself um and then like like I said the additional field where from the engineer to deal with the conflicts we had some inaccuracies with the survey which I've talked about in a previous meeting just caused a lot of our feelings thank you very much let's go to the citizens would anyone like to make a comment right now we're back to the council we're going to need a motion for approval for a budget amendment to increase the storm water system account if I have a motion made by Leslie Ontario second second thank you council member of the Terry you have the floor Kyle was done a great job of explaining what this is and why it is [Music] I also like to comment or ask a question uh yeah this is just brief I just received a text that they cannot hear some people outside cannot hear us it's marked as admin our microphones we're having internet connection to be waiting for uh 38 seconds or so when I leave all right that should do it thank you Rob and I apologize for chapter inflow all right would anyone else like today I think that's a great idea in the future projects and anything we can do to minimize the ads needed phrase so that we can tighten down on the budget and get closer at the end of the project so I think that's great in the future we do that so that's perfect I too appreciate the great amount of detail that you're giving us whenever you're especially whenever you're asking for money this is a very refreshing and sure all of us appreciate it do we have any more comments or questions before we take this code so all right hey would you mind calling the world council member Banker yes councilmember Notaro council member Livingstone council member Roberts aye aye council members Abel hi mayor Gaddis okay now we are on to unfinished business I think we've pretty much covered everything in the city manager's report that it was outstanding already and now we are on to Thomas wall member of comments into your selected councilmember Roberts do you have a board that like the lottery so um actually I could have something to say Kyle I'm at the um on the 12th and 13th Street and plates um for the two clients that are actually that go to the out balls into the um they were able to talk about previously could we could we talk to the engineering firm to see if they could come up with additional alternate options obviously secured in place is one option another one might be the slip line those bikes that would reduce some of the volume that it's a pipe within a pipe technology changes so fast up there so that we could ask for alternate approaches so that when it goes out to bed that the contractors could maybe on their own if we give them the authority to submit an alternate bid that they think May save us money and provide us with a similar quality solution just so we're not confining the bid to one option and perhaps there's another option available out there that they're aware of but we didn't give them that flexibility that's nice thank you Mr Roberts next up is council member Notaro no comments council member Livingstone good evening I had a conversation with Kyle before the meeting I had a citizen come up to me inquiring about the road signs in Bel Air and how the Sun fading has affected several of them and Kyle has assured me that those rounds happen on a semi-annual basis and that with the implementation of our new team member that he will be checking that that'll be on his checklist it's going to be what I earnings new assignments I'm happy to say we have him it takes a lot of weight off with me yeah thank you very much and just for the rest of us that we have a home and and the road signs are in your home and there's some foliage some Hedges whatnot that are impeding those signs just to be aware of that and make sure for the safety of all of our residents that that we take care of those because it all assured me that that's our our responsibility as a homeowners so thank you for that Kyle I welcome our new team member on board I think you already left for the evening and also welcome to the team just to come and he had a very late flight I think he got in about 3 30 this morning so he was very tired all day only we'd say there's no excuse for that all right council member Baker who comment Mr America all right council member Sable sure just wanted to say thank you to councilman Frank Becker for the invocation and the Pledge of Allegiance and for admin I have I will be out the next monthly council meeting I got a corporate meeting out on the west coast today thank you very much all right um vice mayor Shirley is out so uh now I'm up I met with the other Santee Mayors today as along with the county commissioner Brian Scott we discussed alternatives for Beach nourishment right now looks like the Army Corps of Engineers who's unwilling to move project and uh the clock was taken every time I get a heavy rain win any type of the storm it's just a wiggling away our beach and we're in good shape there's a the others from the south on Sandy Island today was just a start we had some some Lively discussion and I think having commissioner Scott beer the word will get back to the County Commission that it's probably time that they seriously consider doing something for our beaches without the beaches they would not be able to collect the amount of Revenue that they do and I think it's time that they consider giving some of that back to save our beaches we're meeting again soon and we're also going to take the County Administrator for a little tour to show him exactly what's going on with the beaches make sure that he's fully aware and held accountable um as we continue to discuss this and have these meetings I will do everything I can to keep you updated hearing our meetings uh and other than that as always I'd like to thank everyone for coming out tonight and for those attending at home I do apologize if there was a break in communication and uh to keep keep your messages coming in if there's a failure please notify one of this if not the city manager just to make him aware that maybe we should all the meeting for a couple of minutes and with that all that being said do I have a motion to adjourn motion adjourn motion made by Frank Baker do I have a second second made by Lloyd Roberts all in favor I any opposed good night everyone"
