answer questions in alphabetical order but we'll start with a different person each time the mayor candidates will just alternate back and forth as far as he goes first so the first question is you have your two-minute your opportunity for two-minute introductory statement so mr guest hello everyone thanks for coming my name is dave gass and i've been serving on the council since 2019. i'm the vice mayor of bellar beach and represent our city on the big sea i'm a member of leadership pinellas class of 2022 and recently completed the final class with the florida league of cities institute for elected municipal i am also vice president of engineering at ditec and have over 30 years experience in information technology and project management so why am i on the big c despite what my opponent may have told you i have never been in support of bel air shore's shade ordinance what should have been a few weeks of negotiations has now turned into two or more years of litigation unfortunately it is the citizens of bel air beach who continue to suffer from this lengthy and unnecessary lawsuit i knew that the only way to begin repairing the damage was to remove the mayor from the big sea and by eventually unseating him as mayor since working with the big c i've been building relationships with neighboring communities up and down the beach including bel air shore i firmly believe that if the manzo lawsuit was dropped today negotiations would resume and a reasonable compromise would eventually be reached if you look at the way our council meetings are ran today it's no wonder that we rarely agree great leaders know that threats and intimidation gain little traction for compelling arguments as your mayor i will continue to be the voice of reason and will work with the council to identify real problems search for practical solutions and reach genuine consensus for final decisions thank you thank you mr manzo thank you very much good evening bellar beach thank you for coming tonight my name is joseph manzo i am your mayor and i've been so for the last three years as many of you know i'm an attorney in my past life i was a cpa and a business executive for sony corporation and casio corporation i originally ran for mayor for this city because i saw a broken city i saw broken infrastructure i saw city management that thought that the citizens were the enemy there was no citizen service i saw a neglect for the finances i saw a bloated bureaucracy and in three years i've cleaned all of that up our streets are being paved our valley curves are being fixed the sewerage project that was running down the street on seventh street and i was told by the city manager was impossible to fix i got it fixed with the county two million a nearly two million dollar project that cost us nothing that was my hard work to make that happen when i see what's happening with my opponent i get sick to my stomach what i'm seeing is tens of thousands of dollars being poured into a campaign from outside this city and i have to ask myself what do these people want they're not doing this for free they don't give a damn about how we run a council meeting they have ideas on what they want to do his political supporters have all favored short-term rentals and have and have voted for those short-term rentals i spoke out when i was on the big c for two years against short-term rentals i'm never gonna let short-term rentals come here and i'm never gonna let some mayor take away your beach rights i run toward the problem not away from it when there was a meeting to solve the problem they've got a steady home i went to the meeting we gave them two months to settle it they didn't do it and i'm bringing the lawsuit and if i win it you win it ladies and gentlemen i'm asking for three more years to continue to protect this city i'm the only person with the ability and the backbone to do it thank you thank you in alphabetical order the candidates for city council are robin uh if i say that's right hockey everyone i'm robinaki um i'm currently on the city council i've had the pleasure and the honor to serve you for the last two and a half years during the day i'm a general surgeon i specialize in care i'm used to hard work i'm used to resolving conflict as well as staying calm under pressure all of these attributes have been used at many cigar councilmen many city council meetings in the past i've often had to speak up and be the voice of reason between two screaming parties i have no problem doing that i have a very laid back personality i can get along with anybody i'm willing to work hard um i like to explain it in a medical analogy when i'm treating a patient if i'm treating it with another doctor who i may not personally like i'm going to put all that aside and make sure that we do the right thing for the patient in this analogy the patient is bella beach i'm going to do whatever i need to do to get along with anybody up here so we get that done i'm very objective in all my decisions i don't make up my mind until i listen to all the arguments and the citizens and then based on that i do what i feel is best for the city i'm very consistent i've often said on black and white what we do for one we do for the other i don't play favorites if this law applies to this citizen then this should apply to all citizens i'm very big on compromise i'm often trying to find the middle ground to make things work um i will say that i am only one citizen of this city so therefore my personal opinion is not the only one i listen very closely to the citizens and use that in order to make uh my decisions um so if i'm re-elected i'd love to continue representing the city and the bel air beach i will not be influenced by outside cities um all my decisions are based for the residents that i represent which is bellar beach and only bellar beach so hopefully i will earn your vote and thank you very much to the league of women voters and thank you guys all for coming tonight thank you next is lloyd roberts thank you very much my name is lloyd roberts and i'm probably the newest person to our wonderful city here on this group up here so i'm going to read a couple of things which i don't normally do but i want you to get a full experience what my experience is so i graduated from auburn university with a degree in civil engineering while i was at auburn i was elected president of my fraternity i'm a licensed state of florida professional engineer as well as a licensed uh general contractor with the state of florida my working career began dealing with slumber j wealth services as a well-logging engineer in the oil industry afterwards we'd like to talk more about that there's a lot of great stories that goes along with that i also work with tennessee valley authority as a construction engineer at the watts bar nuclear power plant worked with ibm for 10 years as an engineering scientific sales and marketing representatives where i was elected president of my ibm sales school i worked for the city of brooksville i was the public works director there for a few years as well and my final working experience was with southwest florida water management district uh very well known as swifma that most of you are probably familiar with i was the general services director that dealt mainly with construction and maintenance of all of our facilities at our poor locations and also responsible for the fleet management and acquisition of all of our vehicles and heavy equipment also the last five years i was the emergency management director for swift mud while in those positions i gained a lot of experience in budgeting leadership engineering construction and rfp and rfb development so why am i running i came here to the city about two years ago i attended several of the council meetings and i came out completely embarrassed about how the meetings were handled and what went on so i decided at that point that i'm gonna do something about it not just complaining so i'm running for city council and my goal is to make bellerin beach a city that will all be proud of thank you thank you next is joey sherlock hello thank you guys for coming i appreciate the participation from the city i'm jody shirley i've lived in this city for 22 years my husband and i have raised two children here in the city and i'm blessed and grateful to be part of this beautiful city i have extensive background in commercial real estate development i'm a licensed contractor and a licensed real estate broker my office is nearby that's a five-minute drive from my home i was previously on council and in my service on council before i was able to establish long-term funding long-term funding sources for our maintenance of our stormwater system which has gone um unmaintained for years uh our proponent of keeping in place our strategic plan and following it and referencing it we rarely talk about that in council meetings i like to keep my eye on the big picture and not get too tied down in the day-to-day operations we have a city manager for that my major focus is to continue on in infrastructure improvements and to move forward with capital improvements and they are all identified in the strategic plan already just carrying forward what's been done in the past if i'm elected to city council i hope to bring civility back to the council the city's become so divided there's a level of hostility in every meeting and i hope to see that and here's with this new election if uh if you guys would consider voting for me i would be honored and i am available by phone by email if anyone wants to speak with me regarding any concerns you might have in the city thank you for your time thank you next is linda catherine welch i thank you for um coming tonight and giving us the opportunity to um let you know why we're all here um thank you to the lead women voters for putting this on for us as well a little bit about me i lived in atlanta my entire life in a neighborhood that was actually larger than bellar beach and when i was looking for a place to live i wanted something similar to what i had been accustomed to which was a lot of good zoning a lot of planning and development a lot of structure everybody playing by the same rules and having those rules being enforced and i looked all up and down the beach even down the naples and i settled here and when i got here i got here during coded and i realized that this beautiful opportunity i had had been locked down and shut down so um in my work experience what i would bring to city council is come from a legal background i'm not afraid of litigation i don't think filing a lawsuit is the unforgivable sin i can read financial statements and had a long career in banking finance in my own company i also serve on the board for the daughters of the american revolution and which is the largest women's service organization and so i know about giving back and trying to you know make a place better by being here i'm happy to try to work with anybody on this council to try to get rid of this divisiveness that we have it is a disappointment um to move here to live here and to live in this beautiful sandbox but you know we're not enjoying what we have here so thank you my time so alright sorry quite stable

seconds to answer so mr manzo will go first and what in your experience expertise and personal characteristics qualifies you for the job you're seeking thank you i've been doing the job for the last three years i have been the mayor um background attorney rose pass the laws construction i built stores around the country for sony and cassio multi-million dollar stores and finally finance i was a cpa still i'm cpa inactive and um having worked for one of the biggest auditing firms in the world called deloitte when you put all of that together it's the absolute stuff that you need to run a city and i've proven that by running the city as well as it has been done in the last three years thank you mr gaddis yes i have experience with managing people i have experience with running a good ship and knowing how to treat people the right way one thing that i am not good at is creating conflict where it's not necessary i find efficient ways to get things done without having to create all of these problems that we've seen for the last three years i believe we can do a much better job i've been working on training for the last year all right thank you same for the same question of mike saban uh expertise and personal characteristics yeah i'm running multi-billion dollar projects the biggest thing is make sure you give your team as much support as you possibly can back them up 100 of the way and then get that hell out of the way we have a city manager former government let that gather on the job um well my experience is i've been on council for two and a half years so i'm currently doing the job um i'm used to hard work i'm used to working with various personalities to get hard come put conflicts resolved i have no problem bringing compromise and compassion as well as excellent listening skills and willingness to listen to all of our citizens and all of their concerns and no concern is too small as far as i am concerned thank you mr roberts yes i have a very diverse and extensive engineering and background i'm looking forward to working with the city if i'm fortunate enough to be elected to work with the projects of infrastructure and traffic control things like that around our city that some people that i talked to are concerned about a little bit my management style is as said before by somebody earlier i love to tell people what needs to be done and why it needs to be done and then get out of the way and let them do it thank you linda catherine welch hi my background is finance legal and accounting will qualify me to be able to understand what's happening to understand the ordinances and the law that goes behind them my management style of being more of a team i would like to work with others and come to a solution and also be someone who's willing to compromise and to work together to make this place that we live in better than it already is so i have uh i served three years on council and since uh i was off council i have served in a advisory committee position i have the training with the league of cities besides that my site development experience and knowledge of infrastructure has been a world of helpful information to the city manager and my management style is that we have a city manager who is our ceo and i will let him manage thank you okay i apologize i've gotten myself all tied and answered but uh shirley joy jodie shirley heavy mixed which doesn't make sense have you answered this question next question is what is your position on undergrounding our city's utilities sure i agree with the undergrounding only if the citizens want it there's some neighborhoods that would want it and some neighborhoods that don't in the case of bellevue island states we got together and paid for it ourselves and we were lucky to have the city manager to assist us with that task if anyone wants that then i recommend that they do a petition and then we'll we will speak with them about getting it done the same question mr manzo yes thank you um i actually agree with david gaddis for once um undergrounding is the purview of the citizens i would never force it on any community person or any street it's up to you you're going to pay for it if you want it it's approximately 25 to 30 thousand dollars not everybody wants to spend that money to bury a wire there's people on fixed incomes in the city and i'm very cognizant of that everyone's not multi-millionaires here so only if you want it but if you do want it and your street wants it certainly would approve it being on the council okay um some of you have not answered that question i could go first i agree with both of the candidates for mayor i think it goes uh street by street area by area if you want it we would be happy to help you get through the process like uh mr gaddis said we have some experience with it with the valve uil in the state so we know the process so it would be a little bit of an easier transition if it's something that the street wants but again it would have to be by petition and something the citizens want and will certainly support it uh yes absolutely i agree bubba what i add though is you need to gather the people that are for this and try to achieve contractual edge by you know basically purchasing in all if we can thank you mr roberts yes thank you i agree as well that it is a resident's decision so we work closely and find out who wants it who doesn't want it and then i would feel comfortable working with the utility company and help everybody understand what's going to be involved shirley i am very much in support of undergrounding and utilities there uh what no one mentioned is that we are still in process by undergrounding the boulevard utilities and all the funding is not there for that so there's got to be funding sources sought after once we were able to complete that project then i think it's a great idea to bring it into the city and those streets where the residents want to participate let's focus on those first but continue to try to get funding whether it's federal or local funding has everyone answered that question ms welch thank you thank you i'm proud to be in favor of undergrounding the utilities for safety reasons and for the aesthetic and i agree with everyone here that it needs to be down in a way that takes these citizens wishes and your advisement and we do need to have the proper funding to do so thank you finances what do you know about our city's current financial status and who you advocate to keep bellaire beach fiscally sound and the mayoral candidates [Music] excuse me mr vandal will go first thank you so when i took office the first thing that i did uh and some people fought me on this was to put a finance committee together we looked at every single facet of the city we cut out some of the waste and inefficiency some of the bloated bureaucracy we had people at the headquarters here that weren't doing enough for their work so we'll continue to do that what do i know about it i'm cpa i've sat through this thing three years in a row i've voted no on tax increases all three years my opponent has voted yes that's what i know about finances i'll keep trying to save you money yes i did i voted to maintain the military and the reason why is because we had many capital projects that were not getting done you look around look at the uh the storm water drainage look at the streets things that are going on around our city they're getting fixed in the past we weren't doing that we were surviving on the rollback rate and nothing was getting done so i'm happy with what's happened over the last three years okay so everyone answered that one the five of us um i'm very well aware of the finances being on city council i've been reviewing the budget for the last three years as well as the recommendations from the finance committee i also know that many of our citizens are on a fixed income so i don't always agree with raising the taxes if it's not necessary but i also understand that sometimes it is so i'm willing to make those uh decisions based on what's best for the city and what's best for the residents thank you i'm very familiar with developing and reviewing budgets in my previous occupations so i look forward to i have read the bellar beach current budget looked over each line item and i look forward if i'm elected to sit down and review all of those again and i'm all about continuous improvement so if there's any line islands that can be reduced and move money around to make better decisions for our city i'll be in favor of that have you answered this so i'm current i'm currently on the advisory committee and i completed the budget review in this last budget cycle so i'm very familiar with the current financial situation in the city moving forward i'd like to continue to seek new revenue sources rather than stay in the status quo balancing the budget with strictly admiral room taxes we there are probably some opportunities for saving and we kind of beat that to death and the budget review but they're we're always open to looking at new opportunities okay mrs welch have you answered a financial question and i haven't answered the question i have glanced over the budget i haven't picked through it line my mind i feel like if i'm elected that'll be um something that i will dig into extensively on its face value i wouldn't really be in favor of raising taxes for the same reason that we have people on a fixed income and i wouldn't be open to looking for new revenue sources to help fund some of the things that we want to do here you know the data you're just going through but what we're trying to do is basically take that budget it's a finite amount we are not a big company town that has plenty of businesses but right now we have capital expenditure projects you know listed by street we're trying to divide and work from the south going to the north to make sure we have the best bang for frankly a limited budget the next question um we've got lots of questions about this and coming in different forums but it has to do with the delaware beach relationship with bel air shore in the umbrella issue and do you have ideas for resolving that yes i would say the best idea would be to draw the current lawsuit and resume negotiations this council city council agreed on july the 6th to allow our city manager to negotiate by august the 3rd it was abandoned because letters of intent had already been sent which made them apprehensive and not want to talk to us anymore thank mr you you know this is a real lawsuit tried by real lawyers in a real court dave gaddis is none of that he's not going to settle or solve anything you don't drop the lawsuit and start negotiations that's what some citizen threw on a sign you settle it and then you drop the lawsuit they've had their opportunity to settle five times they've said no to us they've thrown three-year-old children out into the sun to burn i'm not gonna let that happen i'll try this case this next coming summer i'll try this case in the appellate court and i'll try it in the supreme court if i have to i'm going to get your umbrella's back dave gaddis can't do it thank you mr roberts yes i have to agree with dave on this one as well i feel like we can sit down with people from bellaire shores and come to a an agreement that's a win-win situation situation i've heard many different options that have been talked about amongst us and i think we have the opportunity to sit down and build our shores we can get to that win-win solution that will result in umbrellas on our beach thank you shirley yeah so everything's not a supreme court um question there are things that can be negotiated at a local level and i think this is one of those items that we can talk about and not be litigious about everything but baby sit down have the conversation we did have some proven response in a zoo call that we had but there was not enough time given to allow us to work something out before an intense intent to sue was already sent miss welch i'm in agreement with the mayor on this one i feel like the time has come and gone for any kind of negotiations they have taken our right to enjoy the beach that we were deeded and i'm all for the litigation in fact i'm an intervener and i'm a proud interviewer and i'm proud to support the mayor on this one it's only 35 people running on that case hundred and eighty they've effectively taken away your right to fair representation that beach is only half of the entire beach of bellar beach thank you so negotiations were tried and one thing i don't agree with is bullying tactics i'm not i don't play well with bullies nor do i allow them to bully me so when a bully pushes me i push back so i think that negotiations are trying great ideas were brought from the citizens such as towing zones gates all these things and they were rejected so do i think that you know jumping to a lawsuit is the first thing but am i afraid of a fight you know and i don't agree with other cities bullying us because they think they can next question is much more general what would you like to accomplish if you were elected what would you like to accomplish or see accomplished in your term of office and that would be mr manson what i'd like to see accomplished is a council that's a little bit more in tune to what the right thing to do is that means right by way of constitutional law it also means what's right by way of common sense dave gaddis wants to tell you what color you can paint your doc caps that's absurd that's government overreach it's too much we have a beautiful city i want to keep it that way but i'm not going to tell you what color you can paint your house i want to see people working together i want to say council that works together and does the right thing they don't do that right now they do what they think is politically correct sir what i'd like to see is a council that can actually work together as a team right now our council is broken it's split right down the middle and it's always turmoil and heartache with every single meeting this should never happen in bel air beach we should be able to work together in work sessions and then come together with a consensus whenever it's time for regular council meetings yes if i'm elected i would like to bring back stability to these chambers and welcoming to our residents tonight there are a lot of residents here but if this was a regular regular council session many of you wouldn't speak because you're afraid of being bullied by our current mayor that has got to end we need to change i know i sat out there in those council chambers and will not speak because of the response you get from the mayor and the council we need civility divisiveness needs to end and that we need to come together as a community thank you miss wilsh yes i agree that the divisiveness needs to end i don't think the mayor is the one causing it i think it started at valor beach with the umbrellas i think they're the bullying i don't think he's the bad guy i think he's really trying to help us and i'd like to see a council that can work together and to quote one of our citizens that got up last week he said he'd like to see us try to get to yes every once in a while and that's what i'd like to see is that they wouldn't kick the ball down the road on a lot of issues and that they would work together and get some things done for the good of the city mr ziegler yeah return a non-threatening environment city council meetings look welcome don't threaten and definitely don't lecture the citizens be sure we review our strategic plan and stick to priority negotiating good faith within the navy and cities uh by the way provide the city manager with all the tools and support they need to be successful don't hammer on them give them everything they need succeed back fully and let them run the day-to-day government [Music] yes i'll continue doing what i have been doing and the reason why i joined the council was to represent all citizens when i first joined i felt like the families weren't represented so that's why i wanted to get on and make sure i was a voice for the unrepresented um i'm very big about compromise so i'll continue to try to bridge those gaps between the two sides i often feel like i run down the middle trying to bring them together and i have uh if you've been to council meetings you've seen me i say it like it is i will say it like it is i don't sugarcoat i don't dance around the issue i say it like it is and get down to the bottom so we can fix it thank you mr roberts yes thank you what's been said a few times the divisiveness does have to stop what's amazing to me is i still feel it happening right before my eyes tonight it's insane so it can be fixed and you guys can fix it but we vote for it thank you all right we've mentioned a number of person issues but in order of priority what are the pressing issues facing valor reach in the next few years so what would you say are some of the top the most important issues sure the number one priority is to get the council working again right now this council is stuck between rock and a hard place we can't get along we can't reach consensus nothing is moving forward once that's taken care of i would like to address the bel air store problem i don't think it's as big a problem as it's made into because we've made it that problem i think that we could work together and resolve this issue quickly and then move on with the regular general business most important thing is keeping our city the way it is right now keeping the outside influences out of our city the big businesses that my opponent embraces the short-term rentals the officials that he looks up to all vote in favor of short-term rentals ed hooper chris lavella and nick disickly those are his supporters they're not my supporters i've spoken out against those people i'm gonna keep your city free of short-term rentals and they've got their eyes on that big anchorage right by our arena i'm going to make sure it doesn't get built he'll build it he's got three restaurants after thank you the most pressing issues i think um this time of year probably traffic would be one of the things that we need to work on a little bit more we need to continue to try to keep our community safe and keep it a place that people want to come to i think we have a pr problem in the community i think that this thing that we have going on has permeated and everybody knows about it so i think we have a lot of work to do to try to restore our reputation as a town that's not imploding from yeah i gotta admit last two meetings we should be sticking to the strategic plan last two meetings were wasted your time wasted chasing down parking passes and signs first of all get back to the strategic plan make sure we got planetary eventuality including flooding and get the funding for it thank you mr key i agree that we need to work on our council meetings and make it more cohesive i think we definitely need to show more respect to each other and be willing to work and compromise i think we need to start doing the the basic works which is continue working on the infrastructure making it better in our city continuing to work on our roads and the drainage problems traffic is always a big issue and i think we need to try to focus on that the life change has helped but we need to keep moving forward to make our city as beautiful and as accessible to all of our residents as possible mr roberts thank you we do need to have a mayor and city council that do work together without that we're not going to move very far i've talked to people out of the city knocking on doors and there's a large amount of people that do not attend the city council meetings because of how uncomfortable they are that's a sad state of affairs say thank you sherlin yeah so for me the number one item we need to focus on so social strategic plan uh we have fallen away pushed that aside and i don't think that's been looked at in the last three years it's a priority it's a list of how we plan to move forward additionally i'd like to honor the city code and our government structure which is not being honored right now and the most important as we move forward is preparing for our city manager's retirement that's going to happen very soon miss wealth should you answer this question and we'll start with next um uh rising water levels storm water drainage and flooding issues are significant concerns for valley beach what are the first steps the city should take and maybe if not just the first steps but what's the long-range plan to deal with that mr gas so i think the city's taking its first step already which was to get a storm water fee um i was not in support of the fee because it happened to be the highest in pinellas county i am in support of anything just not the highest in pinellas county um we have 800 000 gift from uncle sam coming into this city we haven't decided how to spend it i would recommend that we spend it towards fixing up our storm order working on these check valves and trying to stop as much flooding as we possibly can can never eliminate it we live on an island but we can do our best to stop it yes i believe we should continue to maintain what we have yet continue with the upgrades that we need also fema and pinellas county make recommendations and as new homes are being built we should follow their recommendations so that not everyone is underwater [Music] our city manager has already kind of labeled a plan based on the streets our most need and priorities so i think we should definitely continue to follow his guide we do have the stormwater fee that is helping in that with uh some financial so i think we need to keep going we've done a lot of improvements so far i think we need to just keep the momentum going so that we can resolve this issue mr roberts thank you yeah my background and experience is a perfect fit for this question that's what i dealt with for 20 years with swift mud and the department of public works for brooksville so i would love to have the opportunity to work with the city manager and his team to improve the infrastructure and the stormwater issues that we currently have thank you surely yes i likewise have a pretty extensive background in storm systems and we have in the past have this funding source put in place that helps us with the maintenance side of it as being part of the advisory committee we did recommended that 800 thousand dollars be used for the capital improvements of the stormwater and we do have a capital improvements budget in place and have outlined how those projects will be funded over the time mrs welch i'm just happy we can all agree that the storm water is something that we can grant so um i think that's a good thing i think that we do have a good plan and um i'm excited the fact that everybody up here is all on the same page about it and looking forward to you know hopefully not having any problems after the next hurricane mr ziegler yeah when i was working with fema uh basically hosting on a plane this was that's the capital expansion people that's street by street trying to work toward the strategic plan and making sure that you're safe and you also got to work with neighboring communities you had a hurricane here you get a flood you're going to work with everybody in the neighborhood we better start making friends quick because we have to rely on each other code enforcement has always been near the top of the list of residents concerns in bel air beach what is your position on code enforcement and how should it be handled mr guest yes i uh i believe that our code is what actually attracted us to bel air beach unfortunately i feel like our code is currently under assault by the current mayor i believe that we should continue to enforce it and not just selectively say we're going to ignore code unless the council as a whole agrees to change that code mr manzo i was the person who took code away from this city because it was being weaponized by our city manager i heard nothing but complaints about how he was using it to intimidate citizens it's now in the hands of pinellas sheriff and when the city manager was trying to take it back in-house i was the only one who stood up for him dave gaddis was ready to bring it back in-house i won that one because i support the police and i brought it out where i brought it back to the sheriff sheriff saved the life by doing code had nothing to do with worrying about our lawns had to do with being aware of what was happening in our community code enforcements uh mr roberts thank you it's been identified we we have a code that tells us what we're supposed to do when we're not supposed to do we have a code enforcement officer we need to let that person do their job and if the citizens of this city want any changes to our current code then we should listen to them evaluate it and make whatever changes we think are correct thank you i'm in support of code enforcement we periodically have code review committee that will review the entire code and at that time if we have changes that we see necessary to make then i think it's that residents can get involved and be involved in making those changes we do have a we do have laws on the books we need to follow them we can't change them in every meeting because we don't like what's being said there's a process to change them and we need to follow that process which is outlining our code thank you miss welch i agree with miss shirley that we get out of code we need to follow it um i'm happy for our police officers to enforce the code so that it is an arbitrary um i think the code's benefit everybody and yeah um there's no need to see who wins you know that's device that we're trying to bring together um i mean actually you look at food enforcement right here i believe it majority here is obviously uh weeds and lawns master chief piano we got to make sure that your lawn is not getting weeds we'll take care of you now yes right now we have an excellent code enforcement uh with the penthouse uh sheriff so i think we definitely can um continue that um i think the codes are there for everybody and they should be administered equally and i also agree with my counterparts that you know sometimes the codes need to be changed but there's a process to do it and we need to respect and honor that process and more importantly work together as a team to make that happen for our citizens next question communication with citizens is really important and what do you feel is the most effective way to communicate with all the citizens and is it do you agree that it's important and that would be mr mansell communications is absolutely important in fact we had a communications committee but sadly some of the suggestions that came to that committee were ignored citizens said they didn't want a digital sign outside and my opponent here spent 35 000 of your hard-earned money to stick a sign that looks like it belongs in a car wash we're in the 19th century 20th century it's time to get to the 21st century let's start using texts and all the other stuff i've got better communications for my mayoral campaign than this city has and that's pathetic for the amount of money we spend as a city i beg to differ things have changed since i started working with the communication committee and i did listen to the citizens the sign was old they wanted a new sign even whenever the sign was gone and it was a great debate i listened to everyone not just the people that came down here and were very vocal i've heard nothing but compliments over that sign and i'm very proud that i did it thank you yeah so i think communication is really important and i find it interesting the mayor who won't return an email he won't even use an email address it's talking about communication and how he like communicates that aside the signs great does great service for me when i go by i can see where the meetings are i can see when the parks court is doing something which i never had that feedback before i'm always available by phone i'm always available by email i i think communication is extremely important and i encourage anyone to reach out to me that has a question thank you mr welch i also think communication is very important i'd like to see us set up a community resident portal so that we can communicate with each other and communicate with our city officials i think that a portal type situation we could take a poll as to you know who who might have wanted to sign or who did it um and so that you know people don't wake up one day and they have a sign that that i have never spoken to anybody that ever wanted to sign so i think that we need better communication clearly but we also need to follow what the citizens want once that communication is put out there thank you and mrs yeah yeah i was on that communications community got the thing right here basically look at a lecture you guys got this i'm really approachable i'll work with everybody that's communications not lecturing not intimidating gotta work with people um yes i'm all in favor of communication with the citizens i've always been available by email cell text you guys um are always welcome to call me um i'm all about the website there's a great tool for finding out what's going on so i think communication is very important we should definitely do whatever we can to open it more with the citizens thank you mr roberts thank you yeah there's plenty of technology out there that can take care of communication problems or at least enhance them in addition to that i've enjoyed the sign the old sign when i used to drive by i think once i almost hit city hall trying to read it so there's a lot of opportunity out there i have seen other cities that offer like meet the council for lunch and i agree with mike i think the face-to-face is a beautiful thing so i would personally try to set something up like that it would be open to the citizens to maybe prolong somewhere and charge it to the city i'm sure what is the best way to preserve the bel air lifestyle without imposing commercial activity within our community and that would be um mr gas great question primarily maintain our code don't change a thing we have a beautiful environment and we've got great neighbors and uh more than anything we just need to to get the council calm down so that we're not fighting amongst ourselves mr manzo i'm going to keep the beach in bellaire beach that's why i moved here that's why my house is worth what it's worth take my house and move it to largo it's worth 50 of it and when people start taking away our beach rides is the time that they start to get me annoyed i'm going to continue to fight to keep our beach rights for all of our citizens and no they don't want to negotiate they've already said it they said they'll listen but they will not change their mind mr gaddis can't do a thing for you i'm your only hope on that you see the one can you repeat the question please yes what is the best way to preserve the bel-air lifestyle without an artist or beach lifestyle without imposing commercial activity within our community thank you miss welch i'd like to see us get back to a situation where as a community we do things together we maybe have some days that we volunteer as a group that we get out away from baylor beach but we get out as a community and show that we are unified and that we are friends and that we care about other people other than ourselves and that we're just not sitting here on this beautiful stretch of beach turning our noses up and everybody else i want us to be [Music] a community that other people can be proud to be associated with thank you mr mrs yeah when the mayor talks about things remember bellar beach next i have never met as friendly as people when i'm not walking the dog loving people look reach out there block parties enjoy your neighbors that's why we moved here and basically also could enforce when i agree with it keep a safe beach environment for all so we can all enjoy it that's one of the reasons many of us moved here was for access to beach and safety while there um we're a very residential community we don't have much commercial influence i can't see that happening in the future and hope never to see that happening um and just uh i like the idea of more uh events together and more community events would be great to get the citizens uh interacting with each other more mr rose thank you i did participate with my lovely wife back there in the back with a beef clean up and uh it was a good time and i tell you i was surprised at how clean the beach was when we started so i think the monthly beach cleanups we have are working well and that's that's a good thing um the block party was also great for us we moved in we were there probably about two months and i'm sure it wasn't for me necessarily but he had a block party and we had a chance to meet everybody and it was awesome so those upstairs shirley yeah i think our community is great it's a great beach community we have access to all the beaches i would say we just continue to live the way we do everyone in my neighborhood is out walking we're all neighbors we know each other by name we stop we talk we have dinner together we have wine together we have a great group our parks committee is doing an incredible job bringing people together they have quite a few events on the on the board and just continue down that path miss welsh are you an advocate for changing our existing parental ordinance [Music] no absolutely not we don't do short-term rentals here and if you want to see how bad it is go to indian rocks they got houses that turn over 40 times a year problem is is that people that support my opponent nick desegli ed hooper and chris lavala do support that they voted for it every single time it came up in tallahassee you've got to keep that influence out i spoke out publicly against him the sickly this guy takes money from him that's the difference between us i'll keep it out of your city he'll bring it in interesting i remember a day whenever i saw an endorsement from joseph manzo for nick declan once he was named in a lawsuit by his significant other his name was pulled quickly off of the seaglues website so i don't want to hear the double standard no i am not for short-term rentals in bel air beach mr zabal um yes i'm not in favor of short-term realms that's all i don't talk very much so all right i'm also not in favor of short-term rentals i don't want an airbnb overturning every weekend next to any of us so it's definitely against short term thank you that is one of the things that actually took me towards bel air beach was the fact that they do not have short-term rentals so i am completely against short-term numbers for sure so i purchased my home in a residential community because i want to live in a residential community as soon as you allow short-term rentals you've turned that house next door into a commercial property it becomes a hotel i am absolutely against short-term rentals and airbnbs in our community and that i would say that for the condos as well although somehow they keep getting away with it i didn't get a chance to answer but i'll weigh in and i'm absolutely opposed to having any kind of short-term rentals i'm an agreement with everybody here no would you be open to changing our golf cart ordinance to allow travel on our streets well you got me on that one i'm not sure what our golf cart ordinance is however i see golf carts riding around you know we allow them i think right now if they're licensed i have no problem as long as there's license and a means of of tracking them i'll go back to something that dave gatta said i've never supported nick to sickly whoever put that up there wasn't me and since the state law requires that to be in writing mr gaddis i'll be reaching out to nick to sickly tomorrow to ask for the copy signed by me so either he's lying and i think it's you dave you're a liar [Music] stop lying um yeah i'm a dave on this one i really don't know what our code ordinance says i do see golf carts so as long as they're safe and uh street legal then i have no problem with golf roads thank you um i really didn't have much thought about it until the other day i was actually speaking to a resident and while we were standing there a golf cart a larger cop car came zooming by and he complained that that happens way too often and they're in his opinion they were kind of dangerous because you don't really see it in time because it doesn't make a lot of noise so i see where it could be an issue but i don't have a strong opinion on it either way thank you i don't know what our code is on golf carts but uh if it's a street legal vehicle which many of them are most of them are i own an electric car that is open air gem and it is i guess many would consider it a golf cart but it's street legal it's licensed it's got insurance and i have a parking pass for it so it's my beach buggy and yes i am in complete support of using those especially for all of you that think you want to be green that's a good addition as well i'm in support of the golf cart um ordinance if there is one um definitely a problem with golf carts but if we allow the golf carts and those are street legal does that mean we're okay with the buggies that come down from clearwater and drag race on our streets so i think we need to maybe look at that somehow when we're visiting street-legal cars because they actually this time of year do run through our neighborhoods for sport and i'm not on board with that mr sable um yeah obviously as long as they're street legal um kind of got to apologize i mean seeing you know two grown men calling each other liars but i'll tell you it's if we do these beach buggies uh jane am i allowed to buy one i would love to do that [Music] [Laughter] something that's really important i think to residents of delaware beach is beach access so how can you what are your thoughts about protecting the beach access for residents of miller beach i'm sorry i'm trying to clarify your question are you are you speaking about the access to belarus shore or bellar beach there's two separate beaches that we need residents beach or for residents of delaware beach perfect got it so bella beach everyone's welcome come and enjoy our beach there's no prohibitions we like we don't want your children to get some skin cancer but bella shore yeah we have problems with the beach access we've got legal deeded access to that beach and unfortunately little by little they're taking it away from us take a look at the sign there's a four foot sign of stuff you can't do previous administrations previous mayors have just rolled over and given it all to them i'm the first person to stand up and fight for your rights i'm going to keep fighting make sure you keep that beach access that's what makes bellar beach better beach and i believe that we should continue to work on negotiations with bel air shore keep poking the bear and what they're going to do is they're going to ruin our under local agreement and we will have a parking lot on those accesses i don't think that that's what any of us want we'd like to be able to continue using those accesses and park our cars there i don't want to see them as grass lots mr roberts thank you well i keep winning the lotteries um it goes without saying everybody wants beach access i do as well and if elected i'll do everything possible to work towards that end um i'm very fortunate where we live it's just across the street to get to the beach and we go through the 19th street parking area and there's also another access you can just walk through on the other side of the motel so i love the beach access and we'll definitely fight for that thank you shirley yeah so we have access to the beach on from the north to the south and i would continue to support keeping access available it's not it's not an issue at the moment and i don't foresee it being an issue unless we continue down the path of threatening suits and taking things to the supreme court mr walsh i think the beach access is one of our greatest amenities i think it's why people move here certainly was why i got here and i appreciate the mayor's efforts to try to protect that on all of our behalf even if it does mean going to the supreme court it's not going to hopefully get that far but you know this is this thing um is already on the track and it's it's not really i don't think negotiable at this point but um you know we can all hope thank you mr szabo uh yeah like i said before look it's not a strategy um never go to lawsuit that's the last report let's look at the war you save that from the last but you know talk about the beach i like to see kayak access paddle board access the inland water beautiful area dolphins everything else and i think some people would support that thank you mr king all for maintaining our beach access and our ability to go to all our parking lots with our beach stickers and maintaining morgan park so i'm definitely all about the beach i enjoy it with my kids my mother always takes my kids to the beach when i'm working so it's a great access for all of us and it's one of the reasons why i lived okay i would like to thank the audience and all the candidates for having a very civil discussion this evening and it's now time for the one-minute closing comments it will be a reverse order of the opening comments before they the mayoral candidates mr manzo will go first for the one minute time thank you everyone in bellaire beach thank you league for hosting this thanks for coming out and taking the interest in our city i've had the privilege of being your mayor for the last three years we've made great strides and i continue to hope that i'll have that opportunity to protect our city protect your beach accesses and try and keep the city on the right course it's not just about being nice and playing nice it's about getting stuff done sometimes it's tough to be the mayor and have to say no to people that's just the way it is when you're the top person in the city i'll continue to fight for the citizens continue to fight for your rights and i will never give it to another city never i work for bellar beach i work for the citizens of bellar beach you're my only priority you've never seen me taking pictures of robert schmidt taking money from robert schmidt the mayor of bellershore when three-year-old children are being thrown into the hot sun to get skin cancer they woke up and passed this ordinance not us they started the fight i'm going to finish it and i'm going to win it for you thank you and i hope to continue for three more years my name is steve gaddis and i'd like to thank everyone for coming out tonight in this upcoming election you will be given two choices one is to continue going down the same path of threats intimidation and lawsuits that produce little to no positive outcomes the other choice is to put your trust in a leader who is capable of negotiating with our neighbors and will work closely with the council to identify real problems for our city search for workable solutions and as a team reach genuine consensus for most of you i believe that you've already made your decision for the rest of you i only ask that you consider what is not only best for you but also what is best for our city that's why i'm asking for your vote it's been an honor speaking with you tonight thank you so much for coming out and have a good night okay the council candidates in reverse order will start with mr sable sure thank you very much for everybody coming out um if you do anything tonight look closer dave yes say there hey definitely vote for me but i want to draw attention to mr is you here tonight so we're back there lynn's a fellow combat veteran i just wanted to draw attention to him he served two tours in vietnam the man was shot down behind ebony lines he has 13 air medals and the nation's fourth highest award for valor like i have the bronze star i just want to thank him on behalf of the seal edt and combat craft community for rescuing our team members and making sure we leave no man behind [Applause] miss welch hi thank you for coming out um certainly i'm not the most qualified person to be here i'm not the smartest person sitting up here or the most established or uh decorated however i'm just an ordinary citizen like you all i came here for a good life at the beach and was very disappointed in what i encountered i want to apologize for it but i'm definitely team joe all the way and i appreciate his efforts to lead our city i appreciate a legal mind and the acumen that he brings to the job and i think that's what you need to get the city moving forward i'm looking forward to a changing of the council whatever that is i think that anything that happens here will be an improvement and i would appreciate your vote but if not good luck and uh you know i think everybody has the same goal that they want valor beach to be a wonderful place and it will be um that's just how we get there is a thing so thank you and god bless surely thank you league of legends voters for putting this on i appreciate your time and residents for attending it's been a pleasure i again just want to thank everyone and i am looking forward to potentially serving again for the city i previously was on council and got involved because i wasn't being heard and i felt like there was a real lack of communication with residents and after three years it felt better things were getting better we were communicating well now we're back to the worst i've ever seen i've lived in this city 22 years i've never seen the amount of hostility in a meeting that i see today and i hope that we can change that through this election and changing path with the council members and mayor thank you again for everything you've done and uh your participation mr roberts thank you i'd like to thank the league of women voters and all the residents that came out tonight even though this is the football championship night i think we're still going to make so that's great i currently play softball with the indian rock speech senior softball my wife will tell you that's a mistake because the first day i played i got severely injured when i recovered i met two gentlemen there in the in the league that are actually uh bellaire beach residents so i started campaigning to them we got to know each other better and last week they said hey boy come on over and put a sign on y'all it's a beautiful one there so i did it and that same time that i got one guy looked at me and said you know what i'm voting for you lloyd i said no i don't because i'm a good kid or maybe he said no he said i really think you care i said wow thank you and i really do care and i'm retired as well so i have a lot of time to work hard for this city which i will do and i also support dave dennis thank you thank you mr keith hey thank you everybody for coming thank you believe in women voters um if i'm re-elected i'll continue to work hard i'll continue to work with all council members um willing to compromise to find a solution i think every problem has a solution you just got to put the work in and uh to find the compromise we need to on our council drop the egos drop the personal attacks drop the the personal opinions of each other and just get together and work and do what we need to do for the community i have no problem doing that i want to work with continue to work closely with the city manager and have him help a guide and lead our city and i feel what i bring to the council right now is sometimes it's a voice of reason a voice of common sense a voice of uh let's just get this done and resolve our conflict so if i'm re-elected i'll definitely continue to do that and to continue representing all residents of all ages thank you and i think everybody here should give themselves a round of applause [Music] [Applause] again the election is march 15th make sure that you are registered to vote you have to do that before february 14. and you can request absolute offices not nav city ballon anymore it's a book by mail value so make those requests and please participate on election day"
