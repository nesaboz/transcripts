Drive West I know it's about the agenda tonight so I wanted to come up at citizens accountants and express to the council that I am in full support of the city managers campaign to go ahead and consider purchasing a vote I know that he's got good intentions for the purpose of which this bill will be used especially for his Public Works projects your other projects that give the problem give us problems that the book would definitely help one of which and in 2003 we had our own police vote here and they actually did a lot of Maintenance of all things of the buoys the buoys get Barnacles all the time they get heavy they start to sink and they actually had our police in our Public Works departments at that time going around maintaining the inside and the outside abilities so I just want to wish well wish God while I'm moving forward of it and you got my support you can email thank you thank you Mr Kelly with any other citizens would like to speak in this topic for any other topic okay do we have any Citizens online oh yes sir John hancy 22nd Street I'm kind of in the middle on this one I've read all the feedback on Nextdoor crosses alliances I think there's good in it yes but the one underlying concern I have is the sea walls for private property I don't understand unless it's in code that is the city's responsibility to inspect them if that's private property why is the city having to inspect it I get about the boys um the outflows and that sort of stuff and to maybe a lesser degree um traffic enforcement on weekends or whatever but I see the sea walls on these properties water from properties and being commercial property they should be responsible for it so I'm kind of in the middle right now but I kind of still leaning towards to be out there it might be a good idea but we just maybe need to do a little more research I'd like to get a little more feedback about to see water special aspect thank you thank you Mr Hanson we have anyone else in the audience before I call them uh promote yes sir please thanks for the time Attack under what Mr Hansen just said uh yeah I'm kind of interesting I heard about both I initially thought it's a ridiculous idea but as in everything I started looking into it doing my own research listening to the city manager I think that's my focus to stand up today is to support the city manager I and Trust what he's doing I trust that as a city manager he feels this is long term this is something that will help with the staff I don't think it's fiscally irresponsible which I think we need to step back sometimes and look at what do we do over well I'm pretty smart right now we're pretty smart with what we're making decisions on so I trust that piece just to help with the argument on both sides I'll give it just a couple pieces of data um first of all did you know actually I wasn't even surprised that's our history that's why we're probably speaking that we used to have a boat and it did more than policing that we have a police department that's a nice question other cities Clearwater Dunedin even Madera sometimes we compare ourselves to them they have Arenas their municipalities and remote it's uh it's nothing tied to some of the information I've seen fly around they have stiffs they do a lot of Maintenance I think if if I were the city manager you might want to step back and just rebuy some of your comments and this is something you really feel uh we need a revised some of the comments so that the use case scenarios for the citizens I think that one of the Mr Anderson problems not what I originally thought you were wanting to vote for was City inspections of sea levels which I don't think it is we do know code everyone should review it I'm starting to see things around divers and boats and it's not being cracks and I just know that that's not your intent um in five years you just spent the amount of money and rentals if you would for what you're asking for which I think is around 80 to 85 000 when you put something higher in a budget can you always be better on research on What boat s just looking at that expenditure it justifies itself so I can go through this information I see playing around the city uh 90 of it seems to be addressed towards fear bad decision making liability knowledge of attendance terminology so maybe address the sea wall specific I think even without the sea wall application you can justify this take our Pilots did you know that not scraping the oysters off you lose yield on the islands themselves I didn't even know we had ownership of an island that you brought up that we should be maintaining so just to clear up some confusion maybe address that one that seems to be highlighted other than that there's a lot of misinformation in here Mr mosque I'm going to happen about you just because we're uh we'll show the best we're over there thank you I appreciate thank you I support your decision we have other residence in the audience that would like to speak tonight all right in that case let's close uh public comments here and let's go to remote is there anyone that would like to speak remote hello yes okay uh please give us your name and your address please Roger and Deborah Mall 115 Causeway Boulevard and Roger you're going to give me your three minutes in case I run over yes okay please go right here um I want to voice our opinion on the purchasing a hundred thousand dollar vote in the July 24th minutes from the city council work session the following reasons were stated to purchase a vote first of all to check storm water out files once a monthly negate the need to get permission from private property owner to check these alcohols how many of these apples are actually on private property um we've been here over 20 years and we've not heard that this is a significant problem uh if it is maybe it would be cheaper to rent a boat for a day a month to check the alcohols that we can't get access to and I've actually talked to one of the rental Boat companies and I I don't believe that we would it would it would exceed the cost of buying a boat over a five-year periodivergent a continual of Queen names from the past news over the years we've never employed a person qualified to set movies so I don't understand how we could have a person who would be qualified on staff to maintain them if you've ever swam out to the movies you guys would know that the water is not good or out there and checking on them would require Scoopa or dying with you so does our insurance cover our employees to do this type of work you've heard people speak about the sea walls I do not believe we should ever get in that business I think it exposes us to problems with our citizens liabilities and other things we have other options available we can require homeowners to provide their own inspections on an annual basis and get over there to have their seat law as far as the stop by those monitoring those we've lived here again over 20 years and it's never been a big issue our current vote can monitor maybe we can put together a volunteer group as we do for the bridge and the beach remember we jumped on the bridge and we don't offer a good portion of the beach where we pick up trash and things so it would our our islands should really take precedented with our volunteer groups as far as another issue was objects in the water and underground debris our residents pay taxes that cover the Pinellas County Sheriff's boats and Coast Guard to handle this do we have anyone qualified on staff to remove underground debris most responsible voters will remove small objects from the water when they can and if they're too big then we do have agencies we can call a dentist again our residents pay taxes and the company contracts out for this why should we double pass our residents to perform this pass I realized that the smell effects Waterfront owners probably more than normal but there are positives and negatives to living underwater another issue that was listed was darling vessels these minutes state that we would have two routine bi-weekly patrols plus maintenance issues and projects our current Public Works staff is very overworked who's going to conduct two bi-weekly controllers I assume it would need to hire a vote captain or at least not additional qualified person to do that would be a considerable in these minutes the pros and cons of writing a vote were reviewed yet only cons were stated those cons were timely accessibility to a rental boat having a suitable model of a boat available that we've required and liability there was no mention of the pros of renting books such as no maintenance costs but we need right to vote no insurance costs when you branch code and no budget item replacement cost when renting a vote liabilities in issue I think will ever be writer um however I would guess I remind it [Music] also I found the statistic for taxable values and conservative costs presented at that meeting extremely wise first to not include the condos in the statistics is skewing the data condo owners are part of our city and deserve to be included in all data to compare Harbor front property with our city screens is a faulty analogy regardless of whether you live on the water you must use our streets to get to your house and to get in and out of the city so there's no relevance in comparing City students to Harbor Park property we have to maintain our city speeds for all citizens for the record Another preparation was made to spending fifty thousand dollars on a track with the radar Beach I'm actually not for this another important according to our city managers data we have 1.1 miles of beach in our city to spend fifty thousand dollars to rate four or five times a year is crazy again we could hire it out or do nothing we actually break more valid service down on the beach and most of that is private property did we get permission from each homeowner to access their property to Reagan and if they do why aren't we collecting to see from that um I'm also against the terminal the changes on the United States we passed term limits a while back currently the maximum time resident can serve on Council is six years then they must take a break for one year one term before running ahead the change for four year terms and expanding the limit to three terms means that a council member can serve 12 years without being timed out this model I believe you've uh you've exhausted your six minutes okay thank you very much we have anyone else who would like to speak remote nope all right that closes there's some comments thank you to everyone who spoke tonight we appreciate your help all right we're on the item three which is a presentation from the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office beginning with the monthly law enforcement report good afternoon um there's a total of 789 events in the city of Bel Air consisting of various directing patrols house checks and traffic stops 192 citations and warnings were issued the majority is being issued in multiple or Causeway Boulevard this is a thing of six assaults and Courts for crime statistics total Fortune we were arrested varying from traffic interactions the right questions Council questions comments I do a question without going into uh identity specifics what was the larcenes I don't have those specific services right now we're on the monthly code enforcement report hello Debbie good evening commission rare council members staff of citizens Steve caught me for the record for the month of July I kept pretty busy again continuing keeping up with a lot of the uh growth problems as far as weeds and trees one of the biggest things that I had for this month or this last month was parking citations I've been pretty much controlling all the beach accesses and parking areas to make sure that people are paying for for the parking I'm happy to say again that our unpermitted Contracting workers down again so I believe that the the the homeowners and these contractors are provided by the rules of Bel Air beach in Iowa's County that's my report I'll stand for any questions any questions uh you're doing a great job thank you very much thank you sir you have a great evening you will see you next one all right it's Pinellas Suncoast here tonight yes sir please come up let us have your name and uh thank you good evening District Chief Steve Reish I'm here as on behalf of Chief Davidson I'm basic party to your monthly

above that is the final report for us okay before I call on the council I'd like to make a comment you gave us a lot of Omega and we don't have anything back to remember it I've been possibly write all that down yep we can either send you a copy or I can give it to you again either one if it would be great if uh if whenever you guys present they leave a copy the copy clerk actually was creepy to all of us I appreciate it do we have any comments or questions from the council all right all right thank you very much appreciate you for coming out tonight thank you all right item five let's see the attorney report Mr Morgan thank you and thank you uh Council for your Indulgence last month as I was traveling and unable to attend the meeting I did want to take the opportunity ordinarily I would have done this last month but I do want to take the opportunity to briefly update you on some recent legislative changes that are starting to take effect between now and whatever that will impact some of what you see or don't see for that matter the first is Senate Bill 170 we talked extensively through session about Senate Bill 170 Senegal 170 does a few things as it relates to the adoption of ordinances this is the statute that requires now economic impact statements for ordinances adopted after October 1st 2023 so there will be an element of the Staffing now that has to speak to for any ordinance we adopt speak to it's with some exceptions for sure for instance if an audience is adopted pursuant to to make it complying the consistent with state law or something like that but with putting those exemptions aside absent exemption will have to have an economic impact statement or business impact State those should be relatively easy in the city of Miller Beach where you do not have a commercial District to speak of however we still may need to know our ancillary effects as you are part of the Barrier Island community the tourism and I'm like so that's one thing that came out of Senate by 170. another thing that came out of Senate Bill 170 is the ability for litigants to challenge a city ordinance as recently as 2019 the legislature adopted a provision that gave lit against challenging an ordinance as preempted the ability to to cover attorneys ordinarily in the American legal system you don't pay for the oversized lawyer win or lose unless there's a law or a contract that says so now there's a lot that since 2019 there's been a law that says if somebody challenges the city ordinance that they can that they have the they may have the ability to remember attorneys fees if that business is expressly preempted this has now been rotted from performances that are expressly preempted to those that are arbitrary or unreasonable know those terms are not defined and so if someone brings a challenge that an organizes arbitrary or unreasonable and prevails they have the ability to cover attorney's fees of a thousand dollars so that's a new provision with that there's also new language that where an ordinance is challenged in as arbitrary and reasonable or expressly preempted that the um that the ordinance should be suspended during the dependency of the perceived suspension of enforcement so it's not enforced while the parties argue over whether or not it's legitimate and there's a lot more new ones there but that's really some of the major things that came to affect the Senate Bill 170 um um and those are changes to chapter 57 112 of the Florida Statutes and I've made your your manager aware of these and we're talking about how we want to adapt as one of these economic impact statements another bill that we should be aware of here is Senate Bill 250. we've talked about this a little bit Senate Bill 250 is the bill that prohibits a community from adopting more restrictive or burden some amendments to its comprehensive plan for Land Development regulations if that Community is within partially or entirely a hundred miles of where Ian or not remembering at the moment where hurricane Ian made landfill it doesn't say first landfall it says landfall which is interesting since one of our Peninsula called minimum Place regardless we are as the crow flies within those 100 miles from te Acosta where Ian made its initial rainfall and so that prevents the community from adopting any more restrictive Land Development regulations comprehensive plan amendments through October of 2024 and it is retroactive to September 28 2022 the date again and so if an ordinance is passed that is deemed to be more restrictive or burdensome as a comprehensive planner Land Development regulation and just to avoid AB initio meaning as it has a great permanency so that is a another um gift from the legislature of the session obviously there's competing areas on that that facilitates Redevelopment without government restricting it the the counter argument to that is governments adapt based on what happened in the storm and change their regulations accordingly those changes can't be England now we'll see what happens on October 24 when San Antonio amendments go by the wayside but that is those are some of the two of the more notable ones I tell you that those two specifically because it informs what you're likely to see or not see in the coming months so our loan development strict doing a b ABC I'm a stadium we're not in a position to do that and we'll have to analyze whether it is in fact more restrictive regulation all of those things but that may inform what you and some of your support and boards to the extent of the boards or his members and the boards are here tonight if you're on pnz and you're saying why haven't you seen any rain changes that's that main form of kind of business that does and also for your purposes when you start seeing economic impact statements you know addition to our already think packet that's that's where that's coming from so there are a series of other legislative updates that I can provide them I've been providing those um as they go and happy answering the questions but I wanted to make sure you're aware of those two more as they relate to how to discover thank you Mr Moore I think we have any questions or comments yes Mr Baker where'd you say this the legislative terms manifold a number of Ian where I mean Paul Ian's land policy Movement by the National Weather Service and I mean the chaos is down in Lee County and we are up here in Pinellas County at Miles like 91 to 99 and in fact it just it occurs like just at uh Antarctica now the reason I'm asking because I've been in a fight with FEMA and I've been getting some supporting federal government they're saying his name but at the same family Casa and I mean I know they're nirish I don't know what that exactly I said and that's why our beach saying he's getting these shorts rich and I said well let's take a quick survey here that's 100 and maybe also means statement that anything with an hour Circle I said well we're at 160 kilos and is it that in that measuring is that as the pro flies or by linear highway mileage yeah and we'll hook me with tolerance is I think it's 200 miles be generally accepted um knowledge is that it was que Acosta which is nearby but again it skirted several years insurance and so it has more than one landfall for purposes of Senate Bill 250 it just says landfall it doesn't say first landfall so um for our purposes we're within the range um outside of organ exchanges I did want to add this Thursday and Friday I think looking Saturday is the Florida League of cities annual conference I will be presenting there on Thursday for the four-hour at the Assumption level the records presentation on Friday I'll be doing a presentation as part of the panel on disability and efficient meetings if you haven't already I'm sure they still take questions or comments thank you very much Mr Miller all right now we are on item six city manager report Mr Rico thank you mayor so the first project we have on the report is our upcoming history of 2023-24 budget the major piece that we're working on right now is getting the RFP returning for the southwestern recycling uh is on the command Star we have three of the major places of the area which are Waste Pro Waste Connections and these these were contract holders for our people owners and we have a mandatory preliminary meeting and how attended so over the weekend we got the draft contract up and answered the first seven questions from the contractors and attend so as soon as we get that I am going to immediately start reviewing and just being the selection process to make a right infer on contract negotiation so that's an important piece of the budget I just wanted to be up to date with that um as far as dates there's also the in September is our first public hearing and on the budget and the proposed of military so that's the number six that's a Wednesday because of Labor Day Holiday currently uh based on our last meeting Alaska Financial Consultant myself have been preparing the draft for that first hearing undergrounding project is moving along the contractors are put in the three and four inch conduit they have started a bigger six inch main conduit and bolts with the concrete pads for the equipment so that phase one section of conduit is expected to received this month and from there it'll be depending on which I expect to have this soon after unless we get some storms or something that diverse their resources don't let our Improvement products I had a meeting with Gemini engineering an obvious it was August 1st Avenue meeting and we reviewed the 60 submittals for the engineering plans we went over uh what they came up with so far as far as design work through some two points that I and questions that I had I need to make sure when it's going to work for a work session this month because I wanted to have the present or at our own design plans and we're going to buy the council so I I tend to at least August 21st we'll choose our usual our third Monday and then we will start working on Invitational bid once we have our design complete policy Personnel policy manual there is a ordinance that we're doing our first reading tonight the reason for that workings briefly is because in the history of the person on policy changes we've passed by organs so in order for us to adopt a new personal policy kind of what we need to capacity orders that kind of uh relaxes and sets it up for adoptionary resolution which is the way to go because there is no two readings programs for personal resolution so that first reading is tonight I also provided the manual pieces of rehash worked at First taking cities handbook and current manual which is two documents with a HR consultant current Instagram and we work through that combine it into one useful document to the employees and then after that pass it through the city attorney's Law Firm I review all the policies for to make sure it's proper proper legal wording and we finished that and that's what I presented to you with the agenda the as an update I did get um information on the intersection study that was mentioned that's probably about four or five months ago it looks like the counties collected accounts that we talked about uh vehicle traffic pedestrian traffic they're consulting firm was put together before it's going to need a couple more months um just to go over some of the things that were brought up with with the boat purchase of the the seawall inspection that kind of got a little out of hand um the main purpose was to be inspecting coolant violations on the water side of the properties um finding these degree we want to thoroughly expect students are qualified to respect to emails I think the intention is to um which we see a lot more is these dogs failing um a lift scaling the the sea walls we had in the past have a problem with SeaWolves collapsing into the harbor um the hope would be to identify sea log pipe General observation that it could be a major issue of failure and then do what's within our readings I'm trying to prevent them from falling that would be utilizing our city engineer in our code violation process that was my thoughts on that um the buoys so the buoys there is maintenance that you can do um before you actually have to you know we work the whole anchor system and uh some of that might be as simple as just unplugging the glue that's in the water and re-tie into a new version and also the movies over time they build up Barnacles around the bases of them so over time it kind of reflects experience of that currently and that would be to prolong to pull out of the water and scrape off some of those particles to allowed the service purpose there was some comments on the the fish from red tide and the name of the smell produces and they accumulate on the little fingers and the inlets in the harbor it is true that the county does contract now fish pick up services but usually for that to happen it has to be an expensive fish kill and then in my experience I stayed in three weeks to get them in operation the last Bishop kill we have they didn't even activate the contractors so our staff went out there and picked up all the fish and God will be cut out the water but when the experience before that we had a fish go and they did uh I could be the contractors we had all our officials picked up before they even got there and maybe the reason for that is it takes a very long time foreign versus the coastline some of those stats are just perspective I was trying to give some perspective distance no means it's really trying to directly prepare to cosine Council any questions or comments to Roberts I found um when I did speak with the transportation director for Pinellas County one of the things he told me they were going to take a look at was the timing of the traffic lights Boulevard right there in that intersection so it appears to me that they did that what he was going to do was have some of his staff and then you have probably noticed that there's cameras there Causeway so he was going to have this staff monitor those cameras and see how the traffic flow was going but it's okay I haven't verified this but it's pretty apparent to me that they changed some of the cycles for the good if you're traveling from north to south on Gulf Boulevard and you were trying to make a left-hand turn to go across the bridge that light didn't stay the Green Arrow very long now it's staying raining for a very long time which I think has helped significantly with the traffic in the morning when we were going to work to be able to make that up here in turn so that that's a great thing also I've noticed that once that like does turn red to the left hand turn if you come up to it it's apparent to me that they made some changes regarding if you're stuck there with a left-hand turn there's no traffic coming the South to the north that light remains red for just a short period of time and then the turn arrow turns green pretty rapidly again so I think I've gotten feedback from some of the our citizens that make their makeup travel in the morning to work and they've noticed that as well so I think that the county did a great job with those changes that as it definitely has impacted shortly in the left-hand turn lane and backing it up so so additionally on the 60 plan review what were the design of just a couple of things that you had to discuss with the engineering firm and give them additional info for regards to the 60 that they gave to you so when we looked at uh Ninth Street I told them that you know we need to to do whatever kind of permits you can there at 9th Street and they they examined the whole elevation profile of that road and told me that um there's really not much room to work but because it's basically flat from those inlets that are further to the West they come to um to the sea level or the place would be at the end of the road so I told everyone we need to find another some way to give it some more holding capacity um and the pressure necessary to make sure that um you know we're doing everything in that location so they're looking into possibly connecting from the junction of the pipe down towards the east side of the road connecting that with the system that is over by their tensure pond so combine the two so we're going to see if that makes sense if it will improve the flooding that um one thing that in our discussion about it really came down to realizing is that that is by far one of the most crucial battles that we maintain because that check valve is really what determines if it's cold water or not so it's you know if we can give that the attention it needs that we know that it's always working that's really a good reason residents so we're really looking at that I want to make sure that that we really explored what could be done in that area some other things we talked about were just what areas does how's the condition of the pipe um it better online the product is anything needs to be done to the pipe at this point also we're talking about hello in certain areas do we have a problem with flows or is it necessary to change the internet or is even though that's still a good condition and we're not we don't need to do anything to it at all so a lot we looked at a lot of the different streets and compare the systems in really instead of just following what was recommended originally we sort of used my experience with what I saw their new survey again of the of those streets and kind of came up with a course of action to justify what we're doing out there excellent thank you any other Council all right Mr Rayford going back to the Crossing um resident reached out I forwarded the email to you and uh and you confirmed that we weren't discussing doing that removing that cruising can you confirm that the county has not made that recommendation also heavy they're just collecting data at this point so okay they're gonna tell us okay unless they've gotta you know rabbit in a hats from where I I don't see that as a practical solution to ever hear of the screen so I just want to go directly and say that um also I appreciate you clarifying however I think hopefully we've learned some some valuable lessons about how many percent of where you want to spend money in Butler Beach other than that um any of the last comments or questions from the counselor no all right thank you very much all right we're up to number seven uh this is the city clerk report it's Gentry you have a florist my report is just an overview of the meetings and hearings that we've had this past month and the most significant being The Big C meeting where the topic was Speech merge thank you very much Miss Jeffrey any questions or comments all right let's move on to the concept agenda this is iOS 8 through 11.

has been the first meeting of ordinance number 23-04 by title loans thank you Mr Moore this is placed on the agenda by Mr reefer and would you like to comment on this order that's Mr Speaker I think yes I covered a little bit of it in a manager reports because we think to digging into the past and found that ordinances were used to pass Personnel policies and to make it a legal document to adopt we need to pass enormous to kind of cancel out the previous ones and set it up in a way that we can do a little bit more efficient if this doesn't mean lit resolutions thank you Mr reefer before we go

himself very well I think it's extremely important to update your policies and procedures so thank you for working your dreams thank you Miss Livingstone anyone else would like to make a comment yes sir I have a couple of comments especially refers to a city manager in other places that just refers to a manager that's the same yes that is the same I can go through and have that I could have that changed out to all city manager on page 11 we talked about um the Personnel director we don't have one of those Suzanne are we big to city manager how far down on the page we're on page 11 um vertical of copologies the Personnel director for clarity procedurally speaking of this ordinance an ordinance tonight does not adopt the draft of doing these comments are well taken what I want to tell you folks is if you if you do sit down with this document and find concerns between now and your next meeting please let us know because it would be adopted on on my resolution which is only one reading at the next meeting provided to you now first so we can meaningfully get this kind of feedback and also so you can see what if we're appealing and what comes next which would be the natural question so just want to be clear procedurally where this is more of a strike on ordinance the replacement is preview here in your comments are appreciated should I wait and just give you the other comment if if you have mine edits like that I think it may be easiest to give it to us in writing so we make sure we capture exactly what you're going at and I'm not trying to you as an account so I work for you you're free to speak um I'm supposed to go ahead and make sure that if you have a series of substance of alignments that might be important more productive and operation material we're not adopting that tonight in fact it'll be at the next meeting under a neighborhood celebration I think the the primary reason for doing this is uh for expedience if we need to make a change and also we don't have to pay for an economic impact so I doing it now definitely helps that way the other part of this is King of the results of this could have this as we went through negotiating with um manager candidates and otherwise that we were looking at policies and there was inconsistencies between what was called personal plan what was the Personnel policy which one are we pointing to and this is eliminating some of that can foreign things out of the order so that we can alter a an employee Amber by resolution okay so this should be the handbook handbook that will be so we are proposing a resolution next month that will adopt what you see there um it's it's sort of interesting because what we've done historically we did this as sort of a housekeeping cleanliness of the record matter uh you have periodically revised your personnel and annual by coordinates but it doesn't appear codified anywhere in your qualified ordinances it's just we would adopt an organ sustain an official act and So to avoid any confusion on what supersedes what this says anything that was done in the past were about to supersede high resolution and we're going to make it clear in our code that when we change this in the future it will be by resolution so there's no guesswork at what as to what is the best way to see my client biggest complaint is on page five employment will age 11 disciplinary action discharge the purchase both standards in there I could never vote in any sort of rules I'm sure it'll be able to Kyle you're a great guy and he always love you with Dr baby leave us or something happens today we are told on um feedback's appreciated any other questions or comments all right let's take it to a vote it's Gentry this is to approve ordinance 23-0 forward would you please call the Royals council member Baker for the ordinance yes council member Livingstone yes council member Notaro yes council member Roberts aye AmeriGas all right so the passage unanimously 50. we will have the second reading and final vote next month all right we are on to item 13. this we authorized city manager to execute an extension to the memorandum of understanding for accounting services Mr Reaper you have before thank you mayor um so this is our Financial Consultant Andrew test with CPA and underhanded marks Heather is there any person this is a this agreement is a continuing it it actually has written into it that uh I think in a hundred percent it would be changing the agreement annually attack so um we started this Within as early as of 2019 [Music] and we've got it after rain this is uh the official acceptance that we're going to continue budget upcoming budget to to meet that requirements so I included the current um understanding and that's a great work let's go to the citizens for comments we would like to speak on this topic all right some comments are closed uh before we continue I'm going to need a motion from the council second all right this material you have before services for any other questions or comments is that a good question was there ever a time in our history where we actually had an employee that provided this service yes I found a few years ago two three actually you know it's a 2019 so yeah it was shortly after our previous employee Who's acting as uh I can't remember the official title um he resigned Outsource any other questions all right let's do a course book it's all in favor all right can you post all right Mr greenford you were authorized to proceed thank you all right next up item 14 authorization or this is two authorized the city manager to execute a service agreement with Victor I said earlier okay uh mystery thank you mayor uh so this uh is the outcome of the past two meetings trial of this equipment that he's been setting up really uh when we started doing this Zoom software for our meetings we purchased a kind of a classroom style camera it's a light screening of what's going on and it's tough to follow up so uh through talking to Mr granick we kind of came up with the idea of using his equipment which is a little bit it's a lot better but it always high quality to integrate it into our current system to provide a better live viewing experience for people is you know zooming in and out in multiple cameras so uh over those two meetings we were testing and I saw an improvement from you know I was creating the second meeting and he's continuing to approve it already um so this disagreement it incorporates in the history of Manpower I need it to to do all the administration on these the cameras the operation the canvas the microphone and also uh the plus is like as a result tonight when we have remote speakers he's had to help to control all of them so that's kind of a solution so yeah I I believe that uh you know the price that he's offered to do this service is I recommend that we take it I think it drastically improves for people that have a lot to reading for him more residents who can get to participated and watch the reads I think is a good thing thank you Mr reefer before we continue with the council for how close to continue to be a council to the Colorado city manager to execute the service agreement I moved daily to exactly confirm that we're working with women's contracts everybody is what anyone like to say about that secretary Chris Roberts here before thank you yeah I think it's uh it's obvious that this is going to provide a better product for our citizens at a fee that's not really that bad so I think anytime we can do that if this allows more citizens to participate in our that's a good thing so that's what I'm in favor other questions or comments I would like to say that I'm very impressed with what I've seen so far I'm sure that this is a service the way that everything's changed here's there's a still room for improvement but I think that if we have more and more meetings you'll want to definitely get it dialed in um my only complaint at this time is sound I don't know how we can get on top of it you know the sound was better but I believe it was it was a distancy weird Echo did it definitely threw me off and it was difficult to listen to but I have a good feeling you're going to get that dialed right in and don't be afraid to if we move forward with this don't be afraid to to come to us and say hey I need you to speak up a little louder than x meeting or get the microphone closer or whatever any other questions or comments no all right let's take it to a Voice vote all in favor any opposed all right congratulations Victor I look forward to working with you in this for a Reaper you were authorized to proceeding thank you all right we are now on to unfinished business and we have a unfinished business we're now up to city council comments of this month we begin with council member Livingstone thank you thank you so I just wanted to um talk for a minute about citizen comments I really appreciate everybody's feedback you know our job is to take the expertise of the city managerialert in her Menorah and with your guidance helped to make those political decision through the city so all City comments are very much appreciated I think sometimes there might be so soon the data out there that's not accurate but the fact that that's why we come together to talk about that and to bring everybody back into perspective and I believe it was Mr Lusk really that stated there were several other Barrier Island cities that also had a vote I wasn't aware of that so that feedback I really appreciated as well as everybody else's feedback so let's utilize our time wisely and use our citizen comments use our time to express how you feel about things because that's going to help us make our decisions and do what's right you miss Livingstone uh I guess it was lady's first tonight this material no comments okay Mr Roberts nothing new and the Mr Baker um I've been speaking about flood insurance and GPS meetings I've been working Center of Scott's office and doing frustrated to at least we finally what the team that I spoke about a month ago we've got a generic political weather fact pushing the issue a little bit farther and we found out that there's a case in 2.23 cd-01839 Bobby s e n f i p and female and these are all the reasons I have deciding down towns and cities and there's 10 states that have entered into this lawsuit against England and MIP towns and cities cannot find their discounts they also when the citizens like myself complains or Horizon and complaints and says hey I've got a point elevation today four feet a lot of this I should be getting 40 off of my flood rates FEMA cannot give any answers to this so This suit was filed it's supposed to be expedited but we know how the government works we're hoping to get an answer back sometime this year I don't know if there's going to be retributions you know recovery of money or whatever like that but this is a mess and a half um I just want to chime in on the purchase of the boat too I don't think it is your best interest within our city applied vote for a price of 85 or 100 reasons one you do not have a staff equipped to maintain a reform the test if required I want to know we only have two maintenance workers they can barely keep up with their agenda now we further have to purchase underwater equipment or some other other duties noted if we do buy the vote because the duties amount according to Coast Guard standings raining about we could enter into the release of Soviet this sort of mixed maintenance storage insurance want to know both charms presently is for Grand a yearly report arguments of Leasing and purchasing have been talking to citizens some say it's better to just buy the boat and in a couple years if we lease the vote it would pay for itself why did some research on that if I'm a Taurus and I want to go buy or rent a pontoon boat they'll cost me 500 for six hours times two okay we're going to use it twice a month that's twelve thousand dollars a year times five that's sixty thousand dollars minus four thousand dollars times five years with for the insurance that's 20 000. we're now down to forty thousand dollars and that's using a pontoon boat as in tours we could simply enter a lease with a boat company get the boat whenever we want it use the boat when we need it probably cost us a five-year period under twenty thousand dollars we see a boat we don't have any maintenance anyone has found a boat I'm sure there's maintenance on I had a boat years ago it was a big hole I threw my money all right um I found out that we did have a boat as it was another game tonight when we had around uh police report where the hell is I heard we gave it to the Pinellas County issue please whatever the sheriff's department took over our entire operation they got all the equipment all the inventory the sheriff's subsequently so why do you washed so I'm totally against buying a boat Kyle I think you're a great guy I think some of the audience you've made and you do need to use a boat every now and then but I just don't think this saved you before a hundred grand for a boat we don't have Commercial Business in the city but we keep these spending habits up what's going to happen I don't believe in you Rochester saying he doesn't have a boat um I'm just deadliest thank you hey Christopher Baker concerning Beach nourishment on the 26th of July Bellaire Beach hosted the big sea where a County Administrator Barry Burton and Public Works director Kelly Levy discussed the Dilemma created by the Army Corps of Engineers and they're digging in on requirement or required 100 easements which by the way they got ours they also responded to the multiple commands that have that they received from myself and other Mayors to immediately self-fund the nourishment projects with TDC money that has been reserved for that very purpose any of you may have seen that it's about 36 million at this moment of our money because anybody who has a who pays a bad tax it goes into that fund and by the way that's only a half cent on every dollar collected the rest of it goes to advertising primarily all over the world to bring people here to guess what see the Beast it's no longer here so lastly perfect here's some good news last week the board of County Commissioners voted to place me on the you're not going to believe this the tourist Development Council by serving on the TDC my primary function will be to keep members the importance of maintaining our Shoreline while urging the county to increase the bed tax and to do the right thing and let's go it alone and quit waiting on the Army Corps years to change their mind if others are able to put an end to the stalemate at a later date they should have no issues with us protecting our land during the course project blackout also last week I had a web conference with representative Luna's chief of staff and Clifford Gibbons of Bellaire Beach I wanted Mr Gibbons to have the opportunity to share his ideas on how to motivate the Army Corps of this material you may have recalled he was uh he was an important player in that in making that happen they were receptive to Mr Gibbons ideas but assured us his suggested tactics had already been tried in Fallen flat they have another plan to permanently resolve the problem of the course requirements but will not be able to implement it until sometime next year basically what they're going to do is they're they're going to insert some language that will prevent the Army Corps from being able to do this ever again supposedly we'll see if that actually happens or not but right now I have no reason to believe otherwise I was assured that representative Luna had made each nourishment her top priority while she is in office and plans to hold a q a session for all Mayors on the BC on August the 14th let's hope that she has some good news for us finally I'd like to thank everyone who took the time to contact me directly concerning the possible purchase of a city on the boat even more so I'd like to thank all those who cared enough about our city to look Beyond a social media post and an anonymous email from a fictitious Organization for the whole tree as always I'd like to thank everyone who came out tonight and to those who also watch this meeting remotely would anyone like to make a motion posture say Mr Bankers go ahead and say Mr Roberts all in favor aye any advice good night everyone"
