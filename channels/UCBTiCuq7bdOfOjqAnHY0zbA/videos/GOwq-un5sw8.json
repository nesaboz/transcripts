    "transcript": "okay so this is a meeting of the city of Elder Beach citizens advisory committee Wednesday September 21st five o'clock called the meeting to order and a roll call Joe you've already got through it I've already gone through it so glad to have Todd on board your first meeting Dr Brian uh as well so thank you and so can you hear us yes I can thank you yeah okay great hey Tim this is

second time okay I'll get used to this shortly yeah uh all in favor any opposed okay great so we'll do that and so we're on to our topic of business today which is to discuss future line of credit for Emergency Management purposes so I'll turn it over to uh interim city manager Kyle okay thank you um so I've been doing some research through with our financial uh Financial Officer contract Heather and she has been reaching out to Adam horns with truest and trying to see what the requirements and costs would be to establish a line of credit because this is this goes back to the presentation of the Underground uh project on Golf Boulevard where we considered the idea of supplementing funds by lowering our dedicated one million dollar hurricane reserves and um so we reached out with the idea of 500 000 line of credit in discovering that there would be a lot of Financial fees involved where it looked like we'd be paying for you know Financial Personnel to calculate the line of credit as on top of attorney fees working on both sides of the city and the bank so that option it looked to be from what I saw on the fees you know around ten thousand dollars it could cost just to open that line of credit um so I sent some of the information the correspondence um to run to sort of look over and he did some work just looking at the overall Financial Health of the city based on our audit and some other documents I provided and um so I mean that's all I'll let you talk further sure with the swap ideas and things like that but um he had some ideas so the original idea of reaching out to truest which is where we primarily do our city banking um doesn't seem to be what what we thought could possibly be with a with a large line of credit we have a regular credit line with them which we use for our P cards but it's not nearly the the level of uh you know so yeah I would need to ask a question though it it's not really customary for The Lending institution on the line of credit to charge you a lot of fees to loan your money especially when they're holding a mortgage on your city hall building and not allowing you to prepay it okay which is perked the hell out of me to begin with but the relationship I think lacks a lot of two-way or two two-way relationship it's a one-way relationship and that's really ever since we tried to prepay it and they said absolutely not we're not doing it and it it just was not didn't seem fair anyway well yeah so I was looking through the agreement with that loan and I think from what I can tell there's a prepayment penalty and at the time it was assessed if we paid on this such and such date the penalty did not make it worth it I couldn't find the actual documents that I did I've had to reach back out to Adam harm to get another day of prepayment if we were to pay off the rest of the principal was what that fee would be that's great and how that sounds oh well good yeah so it might make sense to do it but it's probably going to be onerous well it's it's like most prepayments you gotta intruse up against the existing Treasury and so since treasuries are up it may be in a good window to where you know we could take advantage of it yeah the good news is there's only three years left on the note so in 2026 the note matures and pays off I think the balance is going to be around 460 if I remember going into the beginning of this budget season so um I think as Kyle shared uh the notes from Heather with Adam and back when we had the uh finance committee project that we worked on I talked to Adam and I've known Adam a long time I'm a retired Banker myself and so I think Adam the way I interpreted Adam is 500 000 is too low of a dollar for me to be bothered with is is kind of how I interpreted it and so I've got a buddy who's with a TD Bank and that's who gave me the ratios I sent out to you guys you know I'm so the good news is is as you can see through those ratios the bank or the city is very conservatively leveraged and probably over generous in our cash deposits and and so you know with all the projects that we have at the city you know there's a balance of looking at what we do so I think um you know Kyle and I caught up briefly the other day you um we did the storm water Revenue Bond and the Bellevue bond for the undergrounding through South State and you know you guys have a banker at South State I'd be happy to call them and whoever the context is I know Angel Gonzalez who's the market president I call Angel as well but I'd be happy to follow up and just track down the one thing that Adam said is that it requires that the city hire an fa a financial advisor which is this card okay that when I talked to my buddy at TV that's not a requirement okay that that is probably it's in the city's best interest if you're doing a large issue like back in 2006 and you know that helps protect the city that they do diligence gone through a good um competitive process and and the financial advisor has led them to the right solution um but just to put a half a million dollar line in place uh I don't think that's necessary and then load fees I I know we could get these capped at 2500 bucks and you know just depends I don't think we want to go through um the tax-free route now it's not worth it for 500 000 that's where you get the Bob councils involved sure um and it gets pretty expensive but I bet you the college because 2 500 bucks tops it's a big difference and then if anything there might be an annual fee um what are you feeling like that you I think it goes back to Mark's Point hey you if we keep a half a million dollars in the bank with you I mean I'd almost say here's a half a million in cash it's not collateral but here's a half a million in cash which is half of our hurricane because the whole purpose of this is the city has a resolution and Kyle's looking for where it is but we created a resolution probably after Charlie in 2004 2005 and all that where we mandated the city has to have a million dollar cash Reserve in an arcade fund so we've got this million dollars that's been sitting there of course for the last several years making no money no interest and do we take 500 of that and keep it in the reserve and then we just say go borrow 500 so or we'd have a lie to access if we need to and then we can take that 500 and put it to the infrastructure projects that we've got going on in the city and can accelerate those projects well plus it would be earning interest which now would be something anything yeah I mean so that millions should be earning a little bit now but this way you know instead of borrowing money if we want we can we've got we're going to come up about a million dollars short on the gulf underground right yes and so that's part of the thought process is we could apply this 500 now and then if penny for Penthouse gets extended and they re do go back to what the purpose has been for the undergrounding then the city can file to get the grant to get that money and reimburse but as we've all learned in this city finances you have to budget and spend the money to get it back so I think the the project uh the spirit of the project is right in line I think you know if we want to take um a half a million dollars reduction in our cash balance put a lot of credit together you know I would be happy to do some more homework with you okay South State and um yeah I I'm not a affordable financial advisor uh with the state of Florida I don't even know what the process is but you know that's basically what I'm doing for companies today so you know I I'll do it without charging the city so um uh happy to help do some homework this is Brian two quick questions we're the five hundred thousand dollar amount come from well we currently have reserves and of the reserves a million dollars is dedicated for emergency funds okay um so that 500 that we're looking to lower the requirement of dedicated Reserves by 500 000 leaving 500 000 and then freeing that up for capital projects and then getting them oh yeah I got you okay it's a little live a couple places so I think if you go back and play it out so um hurricane irva hit um in in 2017 and so the city we had a lot of debris in the roads and in the yards and so uh the city had to follow a process that FEMA mandated and I think Kyle you said the total expense was over 200 Grand a little over 200 to remove it mostly we clean up So eventually we got most of it reimbursed through uh City or through FEMA and state grants uh so the thought processes is 500 will probably cover you know um what would hopefully be a worst case scenario in a cleanup but if not that we've got the 500 000 line available for at essentially a million dollars so we we amend you if we can find the the resolution we have been the resolution um to modify it so that'll be like we'll recommend a resolution modification to city council which then they'll approve and then they would go through and do the revolver request because you mentioned the FEMA um they do pre-disaster grants for preparation for mediation yeah for that kind of stuff so I didn't know if that was something you'd already looked into those are things that we look into all the time we have a tough time meeting the criteria for the cost benefit ratio yeah I did see the cost benefit ratio analysis so yeah okay so it's a one point 1.0 again meet in closest we became is we won our stormwater projects we were around 0.6 um and the New Hope is I'm going to talk to you the brick Grant people the building infrastructures and hopefully with our undergrounding and the amount of customers served we may be able to reach the cost of that information when we need gotcha anybody have any other questions on I guess the question would be do we recommend recommend a motion to continue looking at this line of credit and and looking at the resolution on the million dollar cash balance and you recommend we look to modify that resolution as well as modify the resolution from a million dollar cash balance to a 500 000 cash balance and a 500 000 revolver if it could be put together at a a a low cost to the city all right modify our resolution to reduce emergency hurricane Reserve from a million dollars to balance to the 500 000 balance of the 500 000 revolving line of credit establish 500 okay one incredible okay I think I got it I did some abbreviating there but I'll get it smoothed out okay so um so I made the motion okay give me one second off second all right all in favor aye aye any opposed all right so this isn't impressive could you put together we're a small City but we we're packing a punch here with our credibility and our um available to meet the thresholds for sure yeah I mean I was pretty shocked when I ran the number and you know we could drop our cash balances to 300 Grand and we can borrow coming up 30 million dollars based on the new real estate values right for these years exactly which is amazing that's gotta you know just from a side this is a thought I've had for a while I mentioned to Kyle but I'm starting to hear I think what was it's 17 18th Street is where we ended up 200 000 over 12 and 13. yes so last year going through uh for the uh storm water project on 12th and 13th Street it ended up coming in 200 000 750 000 over and above what our thought projected cost was going into it and it's just because the cost of steel concrete and labor so what the thought process was well maybe we go out and borrow five million dollars if we could accelerate all the projects and we're conservatively leveraged and you know at that point if we could you know prepay this and and wrap it in you know yeah that's what I have a conversation with Adam to say hey Adam he let us prepay it but here it lend us five million and you know your net four and a half billion ahead I think you'd be open to that idea uh but that's just a thought process that's not you know it's just it's a it's a solution for what we're always bumping up against is not having the funds um to take advantage of what might be a presumed deal if we did it now rather than wait for prices to continue to escalate or could be the opposite go into a recession people can be out of work and the contractors would drop their bid by 25 well that's all yeah I think you just never know predictable foreign bundling them all I think you get a better price break than what-offs I think so absolutely would too but yeah I said well Kyle um you're gonna go through it was it is the engineer going to re-look it all these projects and get an estimated new cost and yes moving forward we're going to take the original plan from the master plan and kind of reassess it to make sure that we're we're putting the money where we need to get things returned and where we I remember reading it but I didn't know if it was in the plan we are going to a larger pipe everything News 14 or something right now everything new is going to be 15.50 okay it's existing is 10 or uh 12. 12. okay yeah okay um and we have to also look at the condition of the pipes because in this last project it was it was a little late um but it was the idea of do we need to replace the RCP now or does that have more life um and you can save cost if the pipe is still in a good State doesn't necessarily need to be replaced right now um but would you have to sleeve it or just clean it or what um it depends on we just hammered and that will be used uh the engineer to analyze to say okay there's damage here and here and this definitely has to be taken care of get the the opinion of an engineer of okay maybe this section of pipe is still in good condition it doesn't need to be replaced but then we're still stuck with the 12 inch right you still be stuck with the 12 inch um again I guess all the uh the numbers will be presented and analyzed yeah so because you can calculate the volume and sure and put it into a typical situation where you have a closed system because the plot the tides up and you get some rainfall per area and how much is going to back up as Reese just saw the other day yeah we had those downpours well unfortunately on 22nd Street we have a lot of construction going on so we had the drains all covered with the socks was that that I remember yeah oh back there around all the way down on 22nd all right pull it out of the way yeah I was going to do it okay and then we've been riding this guy um and I had the code officer contacted him because it wasn't the first time I had the the contract I didn't clean up the debris yeah they he just needs to he's clean the street he was we're being very reactive to our requests because that from what I saw that he had the socks out there the day after I talked to the deputy about it so he he did and when they went bad he actually replaced him with something bigger and better okay yeah so the the Builder was being um responsive but it was there was just so much water and it was high tide there's nothing to do but with them he did remove them but we put him back okay since there's an overtime sorry okay how often uh is it a one-year event or a six-month event that what happened with the high tide and the heading right it's at least twice a year I believe we get a motorcycle like that I mean you know the rain is hard to predict because early in this season we didn't get the ring we typically get yeah it was we were dry this year yeah compared to the normal years and I I have a leather apps I try I've been experimenting with to set up to to be able to track the tide and Rain to get an idea of when we're looking at a problem before but even though it is a problem it's only a problem for a few hours once the tide goes down everything flows right into the bay but it didn't even this that Heavy Rain only came up the driveway maybe a foot that's about it you know the thing that people and it they keep repeating this but for whatever reason people don't get it we live on a Barrier Island right we're surrounded by water now the smart thing was that the city was putting in those check valves to keep goal for the Intracoastal for backing up into our systems all right so when you get high you get a high tide it's going to close them but if you've got a rain event like we've had recently that water is not going to go out because of that back pressure you're going to get some flooding and it's like he said it's going to be for a little while just a little while it is what it is I mean you know there's nothing else you can do about it if we've got you know two inches an hour first four days then we have something that we would have to be really concerned about for sure but from what I've seen even even during the the quasi hurricanes or the ones that really were related it for some reason as soon as it the wind stops and everything gets back to normal it's gone that water dissipates quickly back well we had that tropical depression off the coast last year last fall November and November there was steady rain but it wasn't extremely torrential and I don't recall any complaints major complaints about flooding so you know well is there any other General business we need to talk about on the committee um I'm just bring one thing up about still on the uh storm water we have one council member who doesn't think we need to replace all this stuff he made it very clear in his opinion and I'm not sure what kind of an engineer he is but my concern is maybe there's a compromise as Kyle's explaining you know because we did agree to camera the remaining part of the system all the way Clearwater Beach City Line If you will to see what's what if it gets to the point where we're taking a lot of different lines and we're putting in reducers whatever to accommodate the 10 inch to the 15. at some point in time you're going to have a lot you know and we do it as progressively you're going to have more problems where it you know it's fun and cost Factor I'm looking at cost and labor because nothing's going to come down um I guess we'll have to wait and see what comes of those I think yeah we're just out with the due diligence okay analyzing it all and considering the options okay and we'll get that from the engineers yeah and we can get you're going to update the whole plan right well the remaining we're going to do a project by project okay so um and you know we can get a different engineering firms opinion too now is there uh can we rely on the results of say 12 through 14th as being typical from what you've seen with the with the structures could we expect the same thing in say 16th and 17th were they done about the same time and by the in the same manner or are there differences as far as timeline of the project well if we're the original pipes put in at the same time and it did they all use approximately the same plan and the same structure so that we could we could yeah typical inlets and and pipe on the RCP and bought the relatively the same size there's some differences depending on the location like I just discovered on 17 Stewart and Camera again they actually instead of just having one probably two and out fall running down property line and they have one pipe coming out on each other property line with two outfalls and I don't know uh the history behind it I don't know if one caved in or something it was a problem or someone reduced it there was an issue with the they put another pipe in um that's I mean just going back to records I don't know if I could find the answer to that I don't know but but it was interesting because they both come out of you have two inlets and one plug goes to one Inlet and then you have it going to another box that's up in the right way from people's property and from that box you have two separate pipes going on each side maybe there was one's only about 12 and then the other one I think is an 18 inch so maybe something was in the ground and rather than go dig it up sure but they both are still functioning so I don't know the history behind them strange okay there's no other business can I get a motion too well it's a just a different point I'm speaking to the history I test ran it today with uh 2060 minutes we we don't currently have from a certain date of minutes resolutions and just City documents um electronically scanned but I was showing Patty or clerk today that I was able to scan all the mess for 2006 um on our current machine in about six minutes and then I took it to Adobe and was able to combine those minutes and make it readable and another five to ten minutes so now just as an example I have all the 2006 minutes where I can go through and I can find keywords in the document it's a start but having an electronic is hopefully again allow me to find when when this especially the resolution oh sure so there you go yeah well that's about the only hope you have because you can't look through the paper no no I quickly scanned the handwritten you know titles of the resolution yeah we didn't find it okay yeah it was on my own education sure Tim hello um you know you mentioned this you know kind of the thought process of you know kind of restructuring you know the uh the debt of the bank and looking at a five million dollar pool uh to kind of knock all this out at once is this all related to kind of a a five-year project a 10-year project that set at you know 200 000 a year I'm just trying to understand that you know kind of where we're you know what we're talking about there for my own benefit there the storm water plan sure so there's a storm water plan that we've put together and it was within about a 10-year yeah it's about 10 years about projects a year yeah and so it's that it's it's the uh remaining we're probably about Midway through it yeah so this is the you know the second half and we probably spend uh I want to say the budget said anywhere between 750 to a million four a year in projects um total projects for stormwater only they were running about four or five hundred thousand and then this last one creeped up to 700 and I guess I'm also putting in like there's also a plan uh for repaving the streets and uh and gutters and so that's kind of where I was getting that 750 to a million four five thousand yeah savings a year and we're at 60 000 a year for the valley curve okay thank you okay all right great thanks Tim uh any anybody anything else and this is just uh it was a municipal financial advisor I got from Heather okay she was out of training so but just an FYI his cost is a thousand per quarters so I mean and he wants a he wants a like an annual contract and when we did the finance project there's another guy based in Orlando uh he's done a lot of Associates and you know I financed a lot of projects um that he was the fa on big projects over the years so that's why I called him and he was a great resource and I know I could have called him again but you know I like talking to the lender and uh you know like my buddy though he's he's right now is 100 million so um I mean it's just the the bigger the bank the bigger the projects of South state is it's a great Community focused bank that we develop it grows like crazy yeah and you know we and we got that lead through uh League cities this is how we got connected to them uh Lynn had gone to the Florida Legal cities to get that connection yeah I'll get that information for the contact yeah okay all right motion to ensure moved Jerome second all right thanks everybody"
