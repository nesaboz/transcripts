all right the agenda for today is approved um if I could I'm not sure if this is where I insert this but um since I sent this agenda to Patty I have I have to have a hard three o'clock stop today um so we could do one of two things because sometimes the um the review of the park surveys can go a little bit longer depending on how much description and what whatever we're covering so we could either one um Patty can take over as Vice chair and I will excuse myself at exactly three o'clock or we can move we can just stop where we are at three and finish next month no I won't be here next month so okay so then I would like to make a motion for Patty to just continue on with today's meeting anyways so move he made a motion I did in your second sure that's okay everyone go with that hi hi okay so all right perfect so that's what we'll do and then agenda item number two um can I can someone please make a motion for the approval of the March 14th I will minutes and may have a second second thank you all in favor aye okay [Applause] I had an agenda item number four today I'm like my brain can't my my tongue can't keep up with my brain on how fast I want to talk so water I left him I just have coffee I have more coffee um inventory of Bellar Beach logo merchandise if did you are you good with the number okay so Penny if you could please okay there's 13 beach towels as of last Friday um 10 hand towels six tags or license plates 13 logo stickers two belly bags and the welcome bags I didn't know so I there's hours there's eight of them in Publix there's eight of those that are filled up already okay ready to hand out I asked Patty I said these are ready and she said yes I'll count them anyway no hats no t-shirts and no visors okay so we are out of hats and I'll check with Kyle because he did place an order for a different color I don't know where that is and then I have a question um did you say what was it eight welcome bags or 16 hours and eight that are in a big green Publix bag so I'll give you an update on that real quick for Newton put all of those together because since January we have 10 new residents all of those welcome bags have names on it I believe Aaron went out and put little door tags on their doors and said hey we have a welcome back for you with Vital Information that you need to know for living in the city of Bella Beach if you could please come pick them up so only two people have picked them up so um that being said I know that some of them maybe you know the number I don't know the exact number are condos that may not actually be yeah I think it was two or three of them two or three are rentals yeah our rentals I I believe it's three I'll tell my mice himself yeah and I mean with that being said I mean is the tenant allowed to come pick up the bag if they're a long-term tenant or is it just the no they're all Airbnb rentals so they're not long-term rentals which um isn't really allowed here but it is because yeah they have different roles that's crazy so yeah like their rules over right our rules so so the condos are allowed yeah we see a condo odds are it's going to be a it's going to be a weekly rental odds are but I still think it's worth the knocking knock and talk and see if there was a doctor in the resident or not are you saying that the three-month minimum rental doesn't apply to the condos correct that is correct where'd you say that in the rules big grandfather did I could bring Steven from code enforcement you can explain that but yeah I didn't know that either yeah I knew it I just did yeah a good majority of those condos or or uh vacation rentals how many residents are in those condos about full-time I'm not sure I'll clicking that how many units oh gosh um I have no I was looking out too that's something like a thousand or something probably give or take you think yeah maybe a thousand yeah when they say there's only 800 households residents is that including the condos yes okay okay so that is high and I'm only going by those door-to-door handoffs we have because guess who did all the condos you did yes and like a lot of them you can't even get I mean I couldn't go door to door like you guys know from campaign it's very difficult I mean a lot of them wouldn't even let me hang a survey saying please go online and do you know because you could do a little QR code or whatever so well I ran into a new Resident who moved in on 7th street I'm sure you guys know who it is because the cops have been called several times yeah anyway is it that house he mentioned is that a condo no it's a house he mentioned that um he got a tag for a pickup bag I was actually at John's house today we were discussing that let's snatch my neighbor behind me and it's an Airbnb no no no no no better not be yeah update well Messi well it's the way she put it is he's from Polk County so what time poke oh okay so I guess it wasn't unusual to have things in the front lawn like bars and Campers or you know is John's View this backyard that's what my husband well I won't say it now okay moving on I'm sorry I brought that up John that's so um or we've never had visors so I know and then t-shirts you can just take off because we won't be doing more they need to go to Mary Mouse and then hats we're going to be getting back in we are getting hats yes they're already ordered and we're not going to be getting those license plates again either but those were putting in the welcome back so like okay those will go hand in hand yeah these already have all the way and then there's a whole nother box of logo stickers so we have a ton of those okay um and then these will keep and then um maybe next week we can start looking at samples for like the cups okay okay all right does anybody have any questions about the merchandise no ma'am okay so the big guy review of the 2023 park and rec surveys um and John thank you very much for doing mine and for helping me thank you for helping Deb and person thank you all for doing them because they I mean they're not terribly taxing but you know it's it's a project so with that being said who would like to go first I don't know I I guess I'll I'll uh I'll go right I don't know how we want to do the format I was involved in I did eight uh I rode with um yeah I'm that's okay I'm getting senile yeah Patty and Tammy um and Aaron uh so I you know I went to 12 of the sites and um I thought it was uh I don't know how you wanted I don't know how you want to do this I'd just say my general impression was as I went through them um I did notice you know that there's some different the uses are different but I would say that the ones that are really just set up as parks uh are nicer than any of the other facilities I guess I would say Bell that Belle Isle Park is really nice and I think Deb you would agree with me that 20th and 25th are you cut above yeah I don't know you know what you saw Patty but I'm pretty familiar with all the accesses down and Morgan part there's we have three really nice uh facility so if we were to say we'd like to have some kind of a standard damn all look like that well we do have we do have a template or what can be done having said that uh you know what are you gonna do with the marina no I mean well the biggest thing at the Maria would be to pave the parking lot but that's like a ginormous project because like driving on that Michelle yes I hate it well I don't know it's pretty nasty stuff but I don't know what it costs and it probably drains pretty good uh but it's it's an eyesore but if it works and it's cheap you know I don't uh I I guess what would be of interest um you know I don't know if we've ever you know like on the Walking easement we did no I don't want to do that I'm just going to talk about what I saw I don't want to make more work out of it than it is thank you right exactly if I do that tell remind me that will um you know just what we do just that the city knows that we have somebody going we're going to do some kind of a report to the city council I assume if there's nothing other than just a compendium of these things handed out so that's a very important step in and of itself um just going out there somebody knows you're looking from on a plus and a minus side you know it's like hey I think for the most part I think everything I saw was debris free very little safety issues um but as I went through them and right at the end I just happened to do this Belle Isle Park and it was the same day that Deb and I went to do hers the 20th 20th and 25th Street access compared to 16th particularly quite frankly because it's such a big invaluable piece of property uh uh it and it you know seventh is a little different because you've got that utility there although it's really not bad it's got a nice oak tree and it works well uh of course she has a brand new dock which works fine I noticed you know that uh the South and second they're nice but when you compare them to Belle Isle and 20th and 25th I mean it's like there's just no comparison have you guys seen those Parks sure they're really nice I go down there at least once a week do you have a picture of 20th I do okay so I didn't print it though I have it on my phone to first and second or south and second now and in my brain I'm comparing it to 20th so I I didn't write the most Pleasant things about her well this is I guess South Park is an absolute disaster right now and anyway what is it called Southport well I think this is my my point is that as I went through that all of a sudden I got to these three parks at the last and I said wait a minute I've already published all these reports I'm not saying that the word you'll have more photos sorry I didn't print this too and it's um education yes both parts yes and that's what I was wondering if those dedications um decorated or furnished those parks with the beautiful trees and the Shrubbery and everything well it's the same thing with Belle Isle like it's got the double benches there's dedications there which is why unlike the foundation side of it like we're putting together this adopt-a-part program so because the parks that like look better or that are our templates someone else has donated or put money into other than the city so um we do have those opportunities to do benches to do different things where you can buy that get a dedication plaque and it's a tax write-off now which when those people did these things it wasn't a tax write-off they just did it from their heart from their heart because they I mean and it and it still would be but especially if you're dedicated to you know a loved one or something like that um I didn't really read the dedications but I know the city does a really good job like if they get a little like patina Ed over too much or whatever we can't read um Kyle had a company come in like six months I can't remember the exact time frame but they do take care of those um dedication plaques it was the same family on 20th and 25th so because he was the developer okay so in that whole area oh that's cool well I guess so the thing that stood out was the Landscaping there there are smaller spaces I mean like 16th is like twice as wide as the other deals and had been beaten up by some something I've been driving on yeah something's driving in the middle of that I don't know if it's the person next door doing that work it's the contractors so he should be responsible no here's the thing though um the difficulty part is finding out who the suspect is on that yeah it's the kind of the contractor is going to say well it wasn't me it was a subconscious it's going to be a subcontractor we can't prove move the subcontractor is so they've been warned not to drive on the grass we haven't seen any issues of that sense however I was there last week or so and somebody again was on the grass some of the ideas I've discussed this with Kyle um is you know because especially with our books because we're having illegal dumping our Parks we're having some other things are happening uh is potentially just getting some uh game troll cameras and just a monitor stuff like that not the citizens but for the violations of problem uh problematic areas um if that makes sense yeah so that's the idea we're going to discuss it further I know that's something that we've done at a different municipality and it's worked um but you know without a without a suspect we truly can't do anything other than that that's real damage those oh there's Russian or anything else that's going to cost some money to fix that it is um you would think the contractor has to take responsibility he should the general contractor should be responsible for his General conditions going to Google Earth you can actually see a trailer on the grass and it actually has a trailer on there but you can't tell if that person didn't well maybe part of the permit process should be the general contractor who agrees who he receives a permit our permit should include a clause in there they're responsible to all damages either by them or any subcontract or any authorized person on this site in connection period looking at that 12 and 13. and they tore up people's driveways into yards and things they had to put it back and and mailboxes um so two things about that number one I actually think cameras are a good idea for safety reasons as well if you ever need to look back at something you can but number two it's probably just cheaper just to do a polar poll a chain we we're going to start that on uh 25th or the 25th Street I think that would look good a black chain or 24th width it's 25th it's pretty good yeah we're actually going to do that what if it's a four by fours um in there uh one two three four four those with a chain you kind of give it a shot see how we go so it isn't my my to-do board um in my office I think we should consider that for all of the bay accessors I think it would look good you could it it would uh it keeps people going into the entrances as opposed to going over the grass I mean at least grown-ups yeah it frames it in it looks better as like an entrance I'm talking about a chain with posts you know and then like that that black is real nice nautical um so on 25th they have those pilings all tied up with the ropes so I could see why you're saying that it would kind of tie into that you know it's really thick yeah the thing is you can come around the Marin there's no reason why you can't go on the sidewalk and come around them but it prevents people from the driving where yeah we're gonna try to really take up the majority of that Frontage okay that way we can't people can't put their call cards in because that's what they're that's what's killing South Carolina Yeah okay or golf cart so um so we are on that yeah and I love that you guys say that because I know when Kyle and I were discussing this it was just hey let's start with the one Park first so I think collectively if people leave that might look good at an event somehow we can move forward with and it's not a hard thing for us to do we can probably get two days to be done with it that would be great yeah so do you know why you're doing 25th Street first as opposed to South Park we've had complaints uh Universal complaints uh from both sides of the Neighbors in regards to golf carts going in there during autographs I know but South Park too you've had a million complaints of inch wow but no like about golf carts and like kids they're having parties at like midnight yeah that's what they do on easement the easements where they have their parties I have had it yet I believe you um maybe Paul has gotten them and just hasn't relayed those things well I know he's got them because it's been me and Patty pie seriously because it's constant and like she can literally sit in her backyard and people hang over her fence and it's called after call it's either her or it's me and it's a lot like that's not the first time the bench has gone in the water yes yeah so wait what yeah there's just one bedroom wait by Patty's house that's called South Park yeah well that's the one one of the ones I had and I did say that there's a couple of Hazards there yeah they're always there yes this piece of rebar sticking out on one of them um I said it could use another bench I didn't know that there were one of them yeah but isn't there a way to you know bolt them down or well he said they change it now it was changing yeah it does look that looks really ugly the only other thing that we could do it's ghetto um but you know when you dig V3 a little bit of damage but it takes time for it to regrowth not a big deal so is there any irrigation systems in any of the parks oh yeah it looks like there isn't some and it looks like there's enough so uh last week uh public works great new crew um I just bought the new head split irrigation those have all been replaced we've been replacing leaks uh Bayside uh Sixth Street and a few other Parks we've got some lake so those have been repaired so yeah this park they've stolen the heads yeah oh yeah from oh my goodness that Park is Problem Child that's because it has the parts across the street it is where it is it has potential to be a great party yeah it's great it needs more um something it needs a tray plant I missed which one are we talking about it's the one right on Harbor Drive down by Tammy's house oh yeah yeah you mean south or second yeah so the keys are on second with the dock and then South is just an observatory a lot of dog traffic through there well it's good Indian Rocks you know so it's heavily used well Brown's Park is right there that's what I just said yeah right right the manager of the company and uh I was surprised not I'm not the pro at pesticide stuff so uh um but I was told that when they sprayed it it was in the middle of the day hot sort of baited on the grass which causes that running right so after contacting the manager guy he said it's all water based I shouldn't do that so I ordered taking photos of that waiting to see hey the before and after results so because it's all done oh it's all dead oh yeah all the girls it was great on a 31st so um of March yeah um you said you were handling irrigation for which Parks Bayside sixth oh they Aaron and Kyle get all these surveys from us right and y'all just go over them right so I looked at your survey with Morgan I have some to-do's from your list okay so um no did you have questions in that working order or not yet uh so how I thought it was because you know I know John was had done other people's I didn't know whose was whose uh well I kind of did I just did tammys yeah she had four I had four added her so I've got the list and I got the email from myself that didn't it goes in order so so like when you did um City Hall I got all the clothes for city hall and then we did uh Bayside I've got your to-do's or your observations and my Amendment so I got your opinion in there so I I stand corrected the kids the kids play stuff does need to be replaced there was a hole in it I missed it so it's a learning experience Monday Monday it gets uh taken out I suppose Tammy brought that up last night for real yeah there's a hole that they do need to be replaced so you're replacing the whole playground or just just the actual you know the structure of the slides and all that oh that's so exciting yeah well what is uh so when we're all done with this Tammy so what so Patty you you produce some reports then obviously okay so then you put them all together in that order and that's submitted to the city council what has done Tammy do some kind of a summary at a meeting or something or yeah so can you this is what I'm talking about Aaron because Kyle took all of the reports and then he put it in that one page and then he color coded it yes so that's what um you want me to hold it for you so it literally will like to do list like so there's a column for emergency like there's a big hole that needs to be fixed like the problem with like South Park sea wall is that section of the seawall belongs to Indian Rocks Beach not Bella reach so that's why there's a line right there and so but someone needs to contact Indian Rocks Beach like and say the end of the park but it's still there it's their property it's on their property line it's um but there's two spaces and they're four or five feet apart where it's where it's broken off I just know that I have surveyed this part before and I brought it to the attention and Kyle's like that end of the park because I had the picture he's like that whole section is Indian Rocks Beach like this is the property line like the property line almost goes along the tree where the benches jump to so then that's where we need to put a row of shrubs yeah because we don't do it so Kyle we would submit this amount will be Aaron and then he would take all of the information that we gave and then he compiles it into into this format take a picture of it yeah and so it's basically like what what's an emergency what needs to be taken care of immediately like it's a danger what can be handled like in the next week with stuff that they already have and what's like a long-term project so like say for example the last time I surveyed Morgan Park in the parking lot was a disaster well that was a long-term thing but the parking lot just got repaved but some of the easy fixes were like there was rust around sinks there was rust on the walls there was you know so that was a quick eat like water lines you know so that was a quick easy where they could just go and paint it one day and then it looks nice um like the water fountain being rusted out that would be another thing that they can't be replaced tomorrow but it's on like the you know maybe the next quarter or whatever um so I can't remember the exact categories can you read them real quick Patty no maybe prescription responsibility data identified date corrected okay I think it's color-coded things these are all the things that went wrong yeah oh the blue was finished pink was future planning yellow was immediate orange is soon and green is ready to do okay so that's like how he kind of broke it down after we give all the results if I'd have known that I would have that done and ready to go okay so yeah but I did notice you know the the some of the easy ones that we could do like by the way like on yours uh was the uh the like yellow Perfect Painting because the blue look I had just been painted but the yellow one is all chipped up the new pavement yeah okay so um so I will be looking into that um I'll start going through looking at oh you you and I already did Bayside I'm very familiar with City Hall area here uh all the other parts of us are going and looking myself now that we're on the caught up from getting all the rest of the stuff we've been having to do that so sounds like your your guys are being pretty attentive to the parks on your own already but kill on it yeah we picked up uh uh Justin phenomenal pickup and not be happier um he's like the miniature version of Brady um so yeah we're super happy to have them so you have two crewmen working yes we do and they I I have to give them props to everybody here because they do more work and they've got Indian Rocks uh that the folks in charge Arab want to send their guys here to see uh we have two guys that are doing all the work of what five or six of those guys there so yeah can I say just uh you know just looking at what we're saying here kind of looking at it like on a big picture basis the people that we actually have doing the cutting edging uh we hire all the fertilizing um you know most of the stuff I saw BG be nice if we had a little more Landscaping here okay but generally speaking they not only go through and pick up the garbage they also clean up the dog waste okay they clean up the dog waste they cut the grass so in terms of what our crews do I think it should be we should we should agree or we should have some position on how we feel at least from our observation that our crews in the city are doing with what they got and I personally from what I saw there's some spots there's just not much you can do clearly there's kids and stuff like that there's some spots that they use to get together to smoke dope or smoke cigarettes or whatever they do and there's not much the cities can do about that okay but generally speaking from what I saw I thought the parks were well maintained the grass was cut frequently enough I didn't think there were not a lot of weeds I agree so I think basically our maintenance Crews do a pretty good job they do you know and not only that again just to kind of put them in a highlight right here is like I said they do they're digging at the parks doing the irrigation they did all the tree training Parts oh really red all red tide uh all those dead fish we went out and picked up um so on top of cleaning this facility every day setting up every Friday and tearing down every Monday you know there's a lot to have on airplane ideally I mean it would be great to have two more people I was going to say at least another part-time person would be phenomenal it would it would Elite a lot of the the pressures they have because they have a lot on their plate a lot of expectations so do you have that in your budget I don't remember yet is it room in the budget for another one or we just can't find one because nobody likes to work anymore well that's the big part I'll tell you just to find full-time I only had three or four applicants the majority of our applicants didn't meet our standards or how the necessary skills that we wanted so to have Justin come in um and to be as motivated as he has been it's been I've got the pressure don't let anyone steal them well that's yeah and that's what happens up and down the beach yeah yeah it's an issue I mean I mean me someone's trying to I already told Kyle that's so not gonna happen but yeah it happens all up and down the beach you said you had looked at my Morgan Park one and there were a couple of things like the yellow curving absolutely there were some what else that you said I mean just the easy stuff to paint uh the bike rack you know so the plastic the plastic uh like recycled plastic items that we have but I pretty good tables and stuff I do have two that are on order right now um so you know those run the five foot tables run 550 bucks each so they're pretty expensive yeah you know but they asked for Hammer forever and they float which we know so yeah then like my Adirondack chair um Jesse one floated under 10 we stock okay so oh from the island no from uh South Side border so the kids do the bench in there and and yeah the bench is under my Dock and then she's like now the bench is under here yeah I was like pretty soon it's going to be under her dock because the curtain is really strong in the face so well like the bike rack I just thought because it's metal it's gonna rust and that's what makes it look bad or is there something else like that kind of material they do make bike racks uh they're equally as expensive um everything is made to order there so I can look to see um I mean I don't know I'm still being new I can't pretend like I know all the ins and outs so just a suggestion because that requires no maintenance absolutely right so you just put in there bolted down yeah uh and now weights these as a permanent fixture I think that's a great idea uh again um not making an excuse but I'm still learning the the um what my specific Beauties are even the smaller details is where I need to focus on more but the big details going on really well but the small details like looking at the condition of a bike rack yeah that's something I 100 will admit I overlook um so that's why going back next week I'm supposed to be looking forward and that's why these reports are actually like oh great so this actually helps me out a ton and I never go there yeah so it's uh yeah so this is very helpful so when you order things for each Park do you try to keep it color consistent with everything is it like our Bel Air Blue Bel Air Beach blue it depends on the park uh one of the parks we're doing I think it's uh gray oh that's what I meant across all the parks just like no I think well you know I'd be lying to if I told you if I knew that okay it looks like all the dots are great most yes they're all gray yeah they're very nice very very nice very nice so I will tell I would have painted those rocks I know you were you were bothered by that I wasn't bothered I just thought we just put these things in brand new these guys put up and they got these exposed wood parts and all the rest of it's all coated that's your report Deb the 20th Street beach approach Bridge you know that pathway that goes there where the bridge that goes over onto the beach yeah I don't know if you guys can wear that or not we we have that by 19th or 19th yeah yeah so we do have a disabled child that is in the area so uh part of the benches were actually putting handrails to help and tax strips also on the actual boring that way it's better attraction for the child that's interesting that you said that because it was one of my Parks had the handrails coming up and I said to him look at this it's like really convenient I mean it's still a step up and a step down but yeah you know they had a handrail sticking way out now that's what we're doing good so making some parks handicap more handicapped because I live in the city council man lady came in oh yeah she's she's a nice lady hello we put signs up for there we put some new signs there um so those are already been posted up and done um now I'm just waiting for uh recycle whatever to call myself a great cycle Plastics that just from a just out of curiosity here I I I'm a I was a professional Port report writer I'm trying to get away from it but um anyway uh so do we have like kind of a standard format did you take Clinic I mean I put this I put these reports eight reports together they look like this do all of our Reports look the same does it make anything I used your format if that helps a little bit different but I think I think of saying I use notes at our meeting there were five categories that Kyle listed and I did basic maintenance General observations hazards amenities and bathrooms because basically it doesn't matter what format we all use it's all going to go into that one piece of paper because at the end of the day that is our our Channel there's only one I would the only thing I would uh add to that if you will is this might be this process might be most effective if we continue to rotate locations okay oh yeah because I don't know that Deb and I necessarily our observations were exactly the same I think this looks fine I think you think it looks like crap or vice versa okay so over some period of time over a year or two if everybody kind of makes the rounds then you know you're going to get a pretty good uh you know feel how the whole committee feels about any specific place I think there's some me I do yeah I think I think it's really good that's the reason I make my point though about the format is is that rather than rewriting a report okay rather than rewriting a report when you go out there you have the previous report okay I mean these are public records uh so you had the previous report we can work off the previous reports all you gotta do is call a thing up and change stuff if you want to that's why I have enough track of that so this is about Finance board okay so everything that you guys mail to me or to Kyle he's ordered me what not is going to be going into this binder so everyone here has their own folder so does that make sense yes so you know Tammy says Hey notice this you know I want to print that out let's take it in here and we're going to figure out what we do to fix it and John just so you know we have been doing that this is our third year doing this and we all have been rotating Parks it's just the people have changed and we're going to do it twice a year right twice a year and also um what you should do is once these people get the parts like if Patty's doing what I did you should give her the papers so she knows what I worked on and then she could write these improvements have been made this hasn't so well that's what that form is Kyle Kyle once it's updated with our new survey results he or Aaron will bring that into every meeting and give an update on it okay we did all of last year so we will get an update like all the way up until the next time we do these surveys and sometime at some point Kyle said okay everything on this list has been done that we can do for this fiscal year so he stopped updating us but up until that point he was bringing that updated form to every meeting every month and passing it out and updating the colors because you know as it switched to whatever color was you know done it's been done it's pretty impressive so yeah so we I want to say the first time we did these surveys it um I think that list got put together the second time we did the surveys and we've been using it ever since so yeah it's very nice yeah so we should use that form not not what I got my format could be adapted to whatever's there you know what I'm saying but nobody gave me any reports it's probably going to be me that's doing this taking this over yes so what are you going to take these observations and put them into put them into that chart yeah well that would be good because like I say so you're I think what you have makes at least as much sense as what I put together I just did it sure he said he said here's where right the same categories different words right whatever font size so if we got a standard deal if you could take these reports and put them together so they'd be in a single format then I could just next time I go patty just did this one last time her all I got to do is take hours hour standard format okay our standard format and update it for whatever ice you're looking for a template for us that's what he's looking for a common template I want a common template for the report is that and maybe I misunderstood so did Kyle not do a template like this now I said if we could follow John's if we wanted okay we could use our own yeah but her thing is just as good I'm not gonna so why don't you and we'll just choose it right just put together something and say how does this look cut and paste Patty inside is very good at making templates so yeah I do have one quick question I don't know if we're about to move on but you said the signs for some parks have been um just printed what are those for so I didn't say I don't know if I said science but I can't tell you that I have ordered new signage uh we do have some new center going into our parks that needed to be replaced because they're oh okay yeah oh just okay we've already got those they've already been printed they're sitting an hour okay in our shop right now so and news feed signs new stop signs new yield signs um but like I said we had to get caught up with you know we were down a guy for about a month and a half so yeah so now that we're pretty much all kind of pretty much received brand new science okay [Applause] to help with Landscaping I'll be a volunteer I mean like around the parts like in front of 19 it really need some more mulch I don't know if y'all put that but it's right yeah you know yeah I don't know if I'm allowed to volunteer you know but I would I just like to do that I like to get dirty maybe maybe we could have like a volunteer group once a month or twice a month as as you can do it to go out and with the permission of the city maybe maybe donate their time and helping well that's exactly the adopt Park program yeah okay okay like I filled in like everything and then Kyle sent it to the City attorney and then he put all the legal ease around my wording and then he sent it back to me there are some questions that I have So like um and then I'm hoping to kind of put it like like we would launch it in June but yeah so like you don't actually have to spend money like say for example if Patty Popoff and I adopt South Park because obviously we live right there we keep looking at it it's an eyesore and you compare it to some of these other ones because I've surveyed every Park it's sort of a disgrace and it's gotten worse not better and it's just like it is what it is it gets beat up because of location but so like if Patty and I adopt that Park and say so we have set budget that we plan to spend and then we have to here is our basically our schematic of what you know here's our list of what we'd like to do here's the placement what we'd like it to work with there is a very specific list of what the the city is responsible for what the adoptee is responsible for like and it also includes like doing the landscaping and planting things that are under like a certain like you would know this I don't know this like a 15 Gallons would you plant something that's 15 gallons or is that too heavy for you oh way too heavy for me okay so like that that's what we just that's like 75 80 pounds that I have for Kyle because he said anything from gallons or below Patty and I have to plant which I'm like Patty's like do you know how heavy that is Tammy I'm like nope because I don't like excuse me I don't know so she's like that is way too much for us but we're gonna put out your back that's the insurance is going to be a big piece of what you're talking about but you put out your back 15 Gallons big would you be paying for those 15 or is the foundation paying for no no like Community pay it through the foundation so we get the tax rate up Foundation is always if you're a Patty me as in me and Patty as a private citizens right as whoever adopts the park pays for it but I do have a question about that if you adopt the park and you put in landscaping is it then your responsibility to continue to maintain whatever you put in for the next two years two years it depends on so like you've adopted the park now it doesn't necessarily mean that you have to maintain that Landscaping meaning replanted if it dies or whatever um but like you know if you do something like a bench then obviously it's it's got the same thing as all of our other benches like the lifespan of the benches some of them are five to ten years so like all of that is written into the legal ease about how long you would okay responsible for it respect materials [Music] do does would we or the city spec materials specify materials yes it was coming from the city yes it will come from the city because those benches at the Bel Air Garden Club put in are much higher grade than the benches over here much higher they're much more expensive yeah the benches over here they're all sway back like this those things are not going to get sway backed yeah period we should get the Garden Club involved with us yes like to yeah even if we just like go out one day and plant flowers or something you know I don't know because of them approach me because of when I was whatever I had to do to stand in front of the council and say yeah I want to be on the parks and rec I thought Parks and Rec did more of that kind of thing planting and so some and so I said oh yeah and I love to be outside and do this and do that and then the garden lady came up and said you should join the art Club what do you do we meet once a month and have lunch I know they must do more than that if we if we do something like that okay to me I would be looking to do what I would call permanent permanent plantings okay so no it's all going to be perennials right so that the city okay the city can maintain and stuff because this is a relatively transient uh place I mean it's not like living in Saint Paul or you know do it's not it's not like that people beat the turnover is fairly high so we want to do perennials and so like yeah I love flowers I went up to this Belle Isle Park they got flowering trees and there's flowering bushes and flowering shrubs so they're maintained kitchen it's more they're more expensive to put in but once they're put in if they're main they can be maintained by the city and you got flowers yes whereas annuals are you know it's great in Minnesota I can tell you uh we just replaced flowers in the flower pots out here outside of the community center because those flowers were dead um so you know if we were to put in obviously flowers I'd made sure like what we put in there were stuff that was low maintenance because I want to put more more work on the guys right but something looks pretty but low maintenance yeah low maintenance is important I mean that's very important potted a bunch of pots around my pool so and I just I like to that concept that kind of stuff okay Michelle have a green thumb I don't have a green thumb but I like to do it sure cool so I would volunteer for something like that if you have a low okay yeah we just did those yesterday but yeah I mean hopefully the city has um uh specifications about what can and can't be planted okay which we somehow whether we get an expert in here or whatever maybe the maybe the Garden Club knows this stuff okay but you can't plant this because it's invasive this works really good there's a lot of this around but we can't have it anymore I'd love to I you know what made that what makes that Belle Isle Park up there they got four oak trees in a little space now we're never going to see these oak trees grow up and then you're never going to get them to go up on the 6th Street Gulf exit because the soil is too bad but you know so there's a lot of the soil is different yes you know the soil is different on the other side of golf and then where I live from where you live I mean it's different so you know if you're going to do this stuff which I totally think that that's where we're at I mean it all got down to Landscaping when you looked at I was like what is it and I can't even say what is it that is so inviting about this park I couldn't describe it to you I don't know because I'm not an expert okay so I'd like to you know if we want to do a tip pick a park or something like this why don't we get somebody else involved maybe the Garden Club or something like that we would need more knowledge to do the job right to say I would like to do this to this park providing they're not just lunch goers and actually know what they're doing so well I know they have a like guest speakers they call one of them called me but it was just basically about buying a break it wasn't about like you know they um they had some money and I think aren't they buying like more benches or something I don't know what she said I thought they were not until that working on something but anyway so um as far as like reporting on your actual Parks like are you done I'm never done it okay I mean I just wasn't like you know you talked a little bit about 20th and 25th and Belle Isle being like you know your you're nice but you saw well that's what I saw I mean Deb I we only went to four places together but these 20th 20th and 25th they just stood out and frankly the farther south you went the more kind of deteriorated as far as the access you know on on the gulf which is on the on the bay okay the the gulf accesses are completely different first of all they're all parking lot which is an unnatural act but that's life okay but you know because of the the the the amount of uh sure we have and some of it's so sparse it's kind of like it is what it is you know so it's not going to be to the same grade as what you can get on outside plus you have soil on this side and there's no soil over here it's all sand so it's completely different that way um from what you know from what I know about it but that's that's that's what I saw I think that we could do a lot more with these access is on the Bay Side there's not probably much you can do with on the Gulf side I you know they're just there's not that much to work with there and then um the marina [Music] I surveyed the marina there were some things that were broken and then the signs for the marina slips one two they needed to be repainted like they were coming off in chunks so those are those were fixed yeah I thought the signage was good I mean everything worked every time because like when I did I would I personally I'm not sure uh what the objection is to that parking lot that's gonna it's a very sparsely used space I don't know what that stuff is yeah we you know I I completely agree with you on that um that I mean it doesn't get used I mean I you know I do all the all the collections from our parking and all that I have never seen that so I've never seen that that that material I've worked with asphalt contractors Paving you know concrete Paving Contractors I'm familiar with that stuff I've never seen that stuff before and I looked and said this is ugly and I bet it's cheap but it drains great I'm not really sure uh but I mean I might when I do my rounds I might see a vehicle or two inner a week so um you know right now we're doing uh we're submitting our proposal I just finished up with it for the Doppler innovation um on what street or labrina out of the marina yeah um so we're sending out that's going to be uh get approved by is that outside our scope yeah oh yeah okay I'm sorry um yeah so uh that was something that Kyle started before I got here um we just got to be inspect it but anyways I'll move on from that but that space though that was something that I had taught or we had taught about it's underutilized and it is definitely this piece that can be kind of a fun area for um like like weekend farmers markets and we could actually eat oh that's a great idea rent out those spaces canopies you know um like every other little town has absolutely and I think it would be a great use of that space even food trucks you know or events there I think it'd be a lot of fun um that sounds fun so anyways that was the idea about that space it's good can I I'm just gonna interject real quick right here because I have to step out in like three minutes but um hopefully I see you guys all I know some of you are volunteering actually oh you're volunteering on the 22nd so I will see you um then at 5 15 but we'll be contacting you and then hopefully you all have and you can attend the um the board of appreciation lunch on the 20 sixth of April Patty sent out an invite let me see if I wrote that okay I have yeah I have company in town and you can't I cannot what about you I literally canceled my dentist appointment today because I didn't want to miss this like I know but no no I know Wednesday I take care of my mom I know what about you John are you coming uh yeah I am um I am I'm gonna be gone like I think I told you for about five months and so if if yeah so your meetings go a lot faster because what I would like to do if it's possible is I would like to um participate via zoom in order for me to do that the only way I can talk is I have to raise my hand and everybody else has to be quiet otherwise you can't hear anything but no what I'm saying can we do a zoom meeting but I am saying that I cannot talk unless unless I unless I push a button and I only have audio so you'll be able to hear me but if then when I go back out of that on a zoom meeting like this then I won't be able to talk at all yeah we know how so in other words you have to recognize me at the chair John has something to say and I'll say whatever it is and then you'll say are you done now finally and you know and I'll say I'm done I'll push a button and then you go but before timing and if I can ask okay I know I I have a very difficult time filing I can do this in this format I will have a difficult time sometimes following if people are two people are talking at one time that's that's what it takes for me to do a zoom meeting so I'll do the best I can if you want me to be in on the zoom meeting can we just jump in and get a date that all works before you leave yeah for next month yeah May 23rd anyone let me make sure I'm gonna May 23rd-ish is that Tuesday or Thursday it's a Tuesday or we can do May 18th what time after 3 30 maybe it's a little late Tuesday are we on May yeah May so 16 18 23 or 25. I could do 25. I can do 25 too I can do 25. 25 should be good well it looks it looks goodbye now on that day well I was trying to see if it's something on my mark but it doesn't come come up to what it is maybe it's just that it's his birthday still two o'clock well it depends on the day so no two to the 25 you don't know I well I prefer not to if we can do 23rd or 18 or 16. what about the 11. we're not still on the 25th 11 is good I could do the 11th John are you good for the May 11th uh uh I actually on the 11th May 11th um I think I'm actually going to come back here I may be here on the 11th that'd be perfect I'll be here on the 11th I'm going up coming back then my wife and I are driving the pets up so I'll be here on the 11th I think we are actually might be leaving on the 11th I can't say and then you're gone for five months pardon then you're gone for five months yeah except on Zoom but I don't know we like I say it wouldn't surprise me if I have come back at least once so so is this date okay I I kind of think we're actually when I know I look at it I think we might be leaving on the 11th so no it doesn't work can we do the 10th the 10th for sure I'm here no they can't do Wednesdays how about the ninth the ninth I'll be back here I should be am I going to be back here one two three I could do the ninth I can't okay that's why I wanted to do this while you were still here yeah yeah um I could do what was it I couldn't I couldn't do the 18th you can't do the 25th right I could maybe change 23rd 20 John 23rd I think is okay for me it's perfect for me May 23rd it is two o'clock tomorrow and Amia that was fun two o'clock imagine if there were 10 of us the meeting is on this day every month and if you can't come you can't come but like we're lucky there's only four of us so right because we can do that we still at two o'clock still at two o'clock all right thank you and now Patty the vice chair is going to take over thank you that's on your way out and experience we're supposed to be here tomorrow between ten and two and I did give them Kyle's cell phone number because a lot of times when I call the city number it'll it won't no one picks up either you know like if they're not at their desk the last two times I've called the city it goes to a voicemail they've got Lynn on it so um you can if you want my phone's always on me it's like okay I'm very really fix up also okay it's supposed to be ten to two so do you want us each person to go through I think it's a general consensus I think we've discussed Parks enough thanks one question um this isn't how we've done it in the past but like I said everybody can be it doesn't matter because if if he has all the information he puts it on the recap sheet um like we would literally go through an H bar each Park and you would read your results um we've talked about them for an hour and we really haven't done that with any of them yet so it's it is what it is like well we can redo that next month if you want yeah I mean it's fine and maybe like we can do it from the recap sheet yeah yeah so we'll just revisit it next month yeah yeah I don't I don't that the reports are written I don't know that they have to go through them item by item as long as they have them it's a matter again it's a matter of public record it's on the record not going to change it now if he does a recap and I go back through my notes and I let it look at his recap and I say well you didn't mention this that's to me that would be the summary Doc and you would that would go along with this report from the city council I would guess no how do we report to the city council we don't we don't no okay I mean we haven't in the past like I gave it they know like in doing our spring serving of the parks we give the results I did it the other night and I do it usually before right after you know the following us doing them so they know that we do them okay and pretty much it's Kyle and Aaron because anything that goes up one step higher like say um we surveyed the park and the playground equipment is falling apart then it all goes to Kyle or Aaron and then it gets presented to City Hall to say are you going to approve the budget for you know if it takes on a different level okay so like there's nothing that that city council really needs to know other than the fact that we do do the surveys and then Aaron and the team follow up on what needs to be taken care of what they can take care of et cetera so as far as like standing up there and reading that to them again okay they don't want to hear it I don't know okay fly with me just trying to figure out here yeah yeah no no it's um that's I mean and I think like if they had a question about anything specific they would see you know I mean they would be able to ask him we would have the answer so okay okay I missed my heart cut off all right bye guys all right see you later thank you I have a question about like if you're putting it all into that format I don't know if that format had beautification because that's what John was saying a lot of it was just beautification because one thing at Morgan Park I don't know if you read that part but the bathrooms needed inside and out and um when Lauren and I were looking at them and thinking you know you could do something really cool with this the outside wall could be a mural if we had a resident that wanted an artist or something yeah I think it's a great idea I love those ideas I really do um that's something obviously I can't meet the colon that's about having to speak with Kyle about yeah but I meant can it go on that format I mean I think all it's an improvement it's a suggestion for an improvement I like that idea actually with the painting on the outside of mural and then on the like the floor if y'all it looked like recent painting but it's already appealing the floor in the bathroom so you can do something in there that's like the pebble paint so it doesn't show when it's peeling or something yeah um and it's I think you're right those are difficult to do because the foot traffic especially with the now let's see the sand and the sand and everything so um but I do agree with you on that um we just have to figure out when we could actually do that well we're not going to interrupt well Monday through Friday it's not that bad well again I guess it will start then yeah at least from now but um do it in the summer when no one's here were the Beautiful location Parts just the Landscaping not the not the problems or the hazards right those included in that kind of report that's that's my question I guess I think they ought to be yeah I think they ought to be as well I think it's all hand in hand with that okay so because everything that you're doing you're pointing out you know in those reports you're saying hey these are some things that don't look so good and here's some things that do look good all right so I mean is this a Premiere you know I mean I live in Indian Rocks but um I can't afford where you all live yet so that's okay I'm a little behind the behind it we're also a little older Aaron hey hey I'm trying I'm working so um but uh but no this is an area that has an expectation of here's how I look at it outside in forgetting that I work for the city is that when I see you guys that live here you guys worked hard to get to this area and you guys take pride in this area and there's this kind of this culture of hey because we've worked so hard this is what we get because of that so and again it has the dessert to do with me being in the city that's how I look at these things so because of that I think that you're right I think if there's suggestions for hey this would look prettier who did this or this will look a little bit nicer I think it ties in with this okay so sorry what happened well yeah I think it's important because honestly people who live in Bel Air Beach consider a paradise and the more it continues to look like paradise the more you will continue to attract people that look for that and I think it's important I mean it's good with that traffic on Gulf Boulevard yes thank God I turn left um then I go two and a half miles I live right there at Walsingham golf I know in your rights if you head down south take a right there walsing out right in there how come Belair Beach owns so many parks I don't know you know we just had a park survey well we didn't really fit into this park survey because it was uh asking about you know our fuels and soccer and softball and all this so we yeah a lot of those but we have a ton of parks here so I don't know and the city just owns all that property I mean that's amazing yeah that's a lot of problems it's a lot and John was like this is valuable property that's 16th Street uh accessor that's that's that's a full bill that's a Mansions lot yeah it's a large lot yes it's I mean it's big and it's wide and it's a nice spot yeah that's what we determined as well it's got to get close to a million dollars property easy one thing one thing I guess uh just just from just from listening there's I mean this is the way I kind of did these is I started out I looked at um this is what's here and how well is it maintained but I think a lot of our discussion is I don't want to take that for granted because that's a really important part of what we're doing we do these audits in my opinion okay because the city needs to know the hell we do care about this and we do we appreciate the job you're doing but then the other part of it is what could this be and that's that's something where I do this piece feels this piece feels organized what's here how it's maintained what needs to be done with what's here the other piece about what could this be especially like I said in 20th 25th and um Belle Isle that that is um I think that at some point we need to have that kind of worked into the agenda somehow and figure out some way uh to spread that around so maybe some of that can happen I know we have this the Brooks thing is a good thing I don't know exactly what we're going to do with this but I I think our bricks are going out front here out front of City Hall the Brook's going on furnaces yeah and uh is that in connection with the fundraiser for 16th I mean no that's in connection with um the Bel Air Beach Community Foundation which is a non-profit organization that works on behalf of the citizens of this town for different reasons fundraising beautification um so that has nothing to do with 16 so what what then what what am I missing about the 16th Street beach in this activity that's coming up the 16th Street access what activity the kayak the kayak launch and all this what am I that's not um I don't think that's tied into any event that we have going on like City events I'm aware of yeah me neither really I'm the only person who's confused about that well I must have it wrong so the event that we're doing is on the 22nd it's here in city hall right um I'll be here for that it has nothing it has nothing to do with that 16th Street kayak launch this that Daddy Ben that's the that's her that's the uh Earth Day Earth Day birthday is for that that's the kayak watch but it says events coming up there's there's two events right there's 20s I think it's not people were thinking that that Earth Day from my understanding was at 16th Street before a kayak watch that's what he's thinking but it's not so there is something no no the second is here which is Earth Day that's the event here yeah on the 22nd oh I for some reason I would okay I was kind of confused I thought that there's the bricks and then there's 16th Street and then there's Dessert Day deal we can double check I mean if you guys know if you guys got it figured out I want to be that stupid who's this guy from outer space what is he reading people thought I had heard that people thought that this Earth Day thing was for a kayak launch at 16th Street which is it is not for that you've heard somebody else say that yes see I didn't say you were wrong right so I was just confused but I but it but that it was so I was confusing I think maybe because the way they put it out in the first place was that raising money but like maybe they're raising money for different events in or or objects in the city and maybe that was one of them projects thank you so it might have got misconstrued that it was there okay so we have a foundation event coming up there's a 16th and a 20th no we have something here on Saturday we're going to do this we're going to pick that's a pi that's a Pinellas County deal right oh the bridge no that's that's the um Community Bel Air Community Foundation so that's Saturday right and then there's Earth Day is 20. the beach clean uh the bridge cleanup he's talking about nine to eleven 10 to 20 then on the 22nd we have Earth Day um let me find out real quick yeah the 22nd is Earth Day right yes it is and that's is that a Saturday or Sunday it's a Saturday it's a Saturday evening event right come dressed nice oh yeah no I'll do the best I can honest to God I think I might even give my life but he looks very nice right now well yeah I don't yeah anyway I'm coming just to me this is coming downtown um you got that right all right so on the 22nd we have Earth day it is that a fundraiser is that it is a fundraiser for foreign for the foundation to receive money which will go to different projects within our community one of which is the now it's coming together well the Earth thing with the kayak deal is so you know they're so like hand in hand same thing kind of deal and anyway and then we have the appreciation deal and that's a lunch like during the week or something like that it's on 25th okay I was just trying to the foundation do you guys want to talk anymore about the parks or say whatever not really okay I wrote it I wrote my stuff down so I didn't have to really say anything again if somebody wants to read it right well we will we will it's all going to be compiled okay and we'll read everyone's okay is there any other business then we can move on to number six we're not going to discuss the parks anymore so wait it wait one second okay so other business yeah I think I don't have anything to you I don't no I mean I have a lot on more that but they're going to see it okay but that's why I was asking for that because that mural I really think that was so cool so um but so for other business do you have anything for other businesses other business oh that's the next thing on our agenda if we're finished with the park surveys do you want any more you've got all this I cut them all I've got them on here just to discuss anymore good so yes so I have I can tell exactly what we're talking about I can prioritize now that way I know about this forum which I wasn't aware of now I can prioritize what what I think needs to be done and what we can can't do at this point so you're learning right along with us yeah yeah I I am green still with this you know I you know like I told my back profession is law enforcement so this is new for me so okay but uh I think that's all I've got right now so the only thing I would ask the only thing I would ask though and I'm just going to back my boys uh or the guys out is anything extra that we do just puts more work on them um so just be kind of cognizant of those those ideas um say again any any extra things that we do uh just kind of add some extra work for our two crew guys um so you know uh trying to bind Alternatives of keeping you know morale good of course um and keeping it relatively uh how do I say this I don't want to say easy to do because it's not easy to do but it's something that they can actually do and not um [Music] yeah we have we don't expect them to get everything done well I think that's what your chart does it priorities for them yeah it's a long-term plan so I just want to make sure we're on the same page because I've been really kind of going to that forum you know I would love to get another two people we we probably could with as much as we do other cities Outsource a lot of stuff we don't that's great yeah so we do pass on our comments from these meetings obviously if we the observation was they did these guys did a good job I don't know if you guys ever see them out there but everyone always tells them thank you and everything okay let me see Grady a lot yeah when he was all by himself yeah yeah poor guy he was he is running around crazy yeah would you find out about the wedding doesn't know what time the store says she's gonna have to figure for White House yeah because we'll we'll be well we're all going to be parked in the parking lot too yeah but a lot of people walked I can't imagine a wedding starting at 9 or 11. I mean and no I don't think so usually you would be like a four or five yeah I think you're fine okay all right so 20 I just have one observation on there I'm not sure it's even other business I think it's part of the parks and uh Rec survey okay but um it's been discussed to it to do this twice okay but I would like to suggest strictly from a selfish standpoint because I want to participate to the extent I can I really like if we say like this April deal or whatever this meeting is like our final entry or we set a time and we say once a year we do these reports if we're only going to do it once we do it twice okay I got that's what I'm getting to so we should say we're at this meeting is when all these reports are submitted and Tammy Tammy goes to the meeting before that and says that they're in okay so we have that's once here after that okay we should have some flexibility in terms of the timing and we talked about having another report in October or something I think we could maybe say sometime we'll every everything will get hit by some person between October and December uh and I don't know if we want to go through the same reporting maybe more of an exception report kind of a deal uh or what's your thoughts my thought is keep it the same and um you go back out in six months you do the same job we hand them the same papers hopefully by then some improvements have been made so our list decreases yeah yeah I think you know we'll put it on the books when we need to you want to keep checking out parks do it why I'm not gonna know I'm not gonna do it you guys will think I don't have a life no that's what Patty's saying you could always report something yeah if you see something when you're out definitely well I I I I I I think that doing the things on a periodic basis so that you get some uh what do you say well things change every day you know somebody comes along today and uh throws you know five no good um uh tickets you know what I mean gambling tickets throws them you know and they're they're there sitting in front of my house and taking out the garbage well that's just today it's never happened before so I guess my point is we do this twice if we could have the other ones done in like more like by November or something I don't care I just so we're going to do it twice but we're gonna have a report once a year or twice a year twice a year we're gonna do a report twice twice a year so when do we need to have them done by we'll determine that when Tammy tells us it's time to think of it again okay I just want to have enough time I I want to get my fall fishing seasoning up there okay if you want to dealership okay okay will you let us know when we're back and then we'll do it well I I plan to be back by around the middle of October and I'd like to have at least until the middle of November to do my all right we will put that down middle of November I'll put it in the notes thank you do thank you everything right away we'll you'll be in Vietnam visit in October wow why every November good for you yeah yeah okay it's oh move on yeah that's it oh that was it time and then wait even though we had the other date and time we still needed a motion exactly but I can't make it I I as vice president did you want you want us to move on the on the next meeting date yeah okay we already did that but I think I think we should still have motions yes I said but um oh you can't make it yes okay I'll make a motion to approve the next meeting date John will anyone second I second and John will second and the date is set May 23rd at two o'clock that's a Tuesday gotcha perfect okay and uh but you have to read it okay May 23rd at two o'clock no the next one making a motion to adjourn is there anything else I guess yeah so Patty's making the motion John is adjourning John is seconding it Dad okay hi all right all right excellent"
