we had two assaults and I wrote them up and they looked like they were both domestic related for that month we had six total arrests for the domestic related incident possession of Narcotics and dental warrant arrest for deadly opportunity for that month we had 603 total events leading that it was the record patrols and traffic enforcement for crashes we had three two were at Gulf Boulevard and Causeway and another one was at 2000 Gulf Boulevard and then finally there were 149 citations and warnings issued for that month and it looks like uh combined obviously in that is going to be the voting citations and warnings as well as parking citations along with traffic and that is all I have Council relations or comments do you have any details I'm just curious on the causeway and Gulf Boulevard accident I don't have any specific details of that I do not any other questions or comments resource and I appreciated thank you right now we're on to the code enforcement monthly report good evening Steve podcast for the record um as far as the code enforcement for the month of March we did some different things this time around I did spend one day out on the water with Marine that radio we actually went throughout the whole city okay uh we've had some issues with some docs we did find poor violations that we were working on now the other issue we've had is a short-term rental uh we're having on 13th Street since December up until today we've had four violations and three of those violations were actually done in the last week that those reports are have been filed and will be sent to a city manager to set up for a hearing on that particular home other than that we have done a lot of cleanup with a lot of the residents and one of them particularly on 21st Street we finally got the the house cleaned up we're working on a couple more one on 17th and one on on six but those slow process but we're getting them done other than that we had a few more complaints as far as construction licensing and no permits which have been addressed and taken care of through the building department and Licensing Council sure um two questions uh they're both on the second page why is the burglary to a residents code correlation well inside of the follow-on after that solicitor yes what had happened was if if there's a call for service I was right down the street from that so I responded to it so I actually handled it um it actually turned out to be um that solicitor handing out materials out of the street so unfortunately because the way the calls classified we have to reclassify it and then I I met with the individual because we caught them up on Howard and you should have a warrant as far as no solicitation within the city limits whatsoever all right bye other questions so there's an error on your Wednesday code unfortunate report you're showing unpermitted remodel at 112th 6th Street I believe okay which which Pages put down towards the bottom uh okay we will correct that thank you thank you any other questions or comments thank you I appreciate it have a good evening thank you all right we are up to item four which is the presentation from Heather baranoli CBA from Henry tests CPA LLC of the fiscal year 2022 Financial overview Mr Mayor thank you all for inviting me please I know you have a lot going on so I'll go quickly I'm going to provide a quick overview of the budget Maxwell for 22. I'm going to discuss some items I'd like you to consider as we start developing the budget coming near but these are my numbers these are my numbers people these spreadsheets on here are Pages out of the audit that you received the draft last month so the first one is a general fund it's the main operating fund of the city and you'll see here that all areas of Revenue were over budget so they were favorable variances and to live app you'll see that all the areas of the expenditures were under budget so you had positive results in goals so the very first line is to add more impact since it's the largest single item of revenue for the city so when you start to consider the budget for 24. I just wanted to point out that historically we've budgeted 96 of the ad alarm taxes that could be collected and the reason for that is that we were expecting that all residents are going to take advantage of the early payment discount you've been trying to impact the bill like the November payment amount is less and then as you get closer to the March it gets up to the full amount so it's a very conservative way to budget you know we'll you see on here that we were over the budgeted amount and that's because not everybody did take advantage of that early payment discounts um so on June 1st we'll get the first estimate of the flexible values of your city and then we'll start the process of establishing the military from here at the podium that you've got tonight is a full budget calendar and then my last slide is just a couple of highlighted dates that I'd like you to put on your calendar so if we keep on going down the list you'll see the franchise fees and utility taxes that's what I'm doing one of that is intergovernmental Revenue that's state-derived Revenue that gets passed on to us we've got charges for services that's a big number that's the garbage and refuse from Pinellas County Utilities and that that particular number is shown as Revenue at the top and then it gets offset by the amount that we paid to at least management down in the expenditures we've also got a map of charges for services of the community center rentals site plan reviews The Marina payment that gets transferred to the general fund and then code violation fees and as you know they auditor commented during his presentation and then also actually in the note disclosures and the financial statements this year we've bought a resident that has a substantial amount in code violations that are owed to the city just as a part of the disability requirements that was a big increase from the prior year so we had to include that in the audit report we don't have an allowance and not a reduction shown and the amount that we're anticipating the orc time the audit report was done and even you know there's no indication that Anna is going to be forgiven until that full amount is shown and the accounting records I just said you know when that case is settled if the full amount does not received we'll show that that expense at that point in time so I know that's going to have to be on your radar I don't know it is a substantial amount so if we keep on going down the line below that is fine those are parking tickets licenses and permits are the need to parking passes parking meters registrations we've got interest on investments which was well over budget that's because of higher interest rates than we have projected and the SBA even this year every month is increasing the interest rate so that's very good and then lastly in miscellaneously both of that amount for this year 22 with the insurance payment that we got for the signs that fell down up front so that's a higher number than normal you've got the expenditures and flying item here and is a summarization of a lot of accountants you know a lot of other departments think about General government and that number is made out of the city council expenses the clerk finance non-departmental and I.T that I summarize into that number there got Public Safety so that's food protection and code enforcement physical environment there's Public Works in the trash culture and recreation is the park maintenance and the library program reimbursement and then you get down to Capital outline and so you'll see that we were under budget for that and that's because all the projects that were budgeted weren't started during the year so when this happens we monitor that amount it's kind of like a savings income we're earmarking the money that's left in this fund we're saving it up and then when the expense comes we know that we have accounted for that money in the past year for saving it up or we abandoned the project that doesn't happen a lot here you guys are pretty good at the same um so the largest impact on this one was not making the anticipated transfers to the other funds um so you'll see here that the general fund had this changed from the draft to the actual on your paper it says deficiency of revenues under expenditure that it's actually Revenue succeeded the expenditure so this as you can see was the draft and it has been benefits but so it was a big year for the journal fund um but by the time that fiscal year 23 budget was prepared we had a lot closer estimate of the timing of the project so we know that um although they didn't start at 22 the money will be needed you know in this year's coming through so at the very bottom you'll see the end of the year fund balance is over 5.4 million so it's a it's a very healthy amount plus enough you want to ask questions right now I don't think you want questions uh Mr brighter um [Music] a lot of it is yeah yeah um I want to say in excess of thirty thousand dollars for them but we were received a Insurance went forward over 35. okay no I mean so that would be impossible for me if that that's the money that would come back on it oh it was no it wasn't that much in excess as it costed in the new sign no we got reimbursed and then we send the money online you got 35 and new side costs four years old well so I can't we can't show the revenue and then cancel out that Revenue because then it doesn't really show the full picture um so we have to show it as revenue and then a separate expenditure so it'll be into the different places yeah is that one question I just you know the concern where you've looked at so when we're going forward into the budget process we're going to understand that this is not really with all that it's already offset all right uh second one and this is more personal can you double the font sizes on these things we're trying to make decisions up here again most of us really can't breathe oh okay sure 20 seconds any other questions or comments please okay next we have the capital project fund so the revenue here is intergovernmental revenue and you'll see that there's a big budget amount here that includes our Penny money and then the amount that would have gone on the Bel Air Force for the Gulf Boulevard underground project and that gets diverted to us because we're overseeing the project I say we but it's not me I don't [Music] so we've had about 930 000 budgeted as reimbursement revenue from that and then that offsets the same amount and expenditures down below um when you see the lineup for Capital Outlet that's also a big number so there's 930 000 in revenue and then 930 000 in the expenditure again the same concept as what we were discussing so that project is well underway this year as you know over a million dollars has been spent so far we've gotten back about 966 thousand dollars in reimbursements from Pinellas County and then we'll submit for the next reimbursement in phase one is finished so for this year 23 we'll have a much higher Revenue a much higher expenditures than you're seeing here in these numbers um the capital outplay in this one it had the audio video the video upgrades here some boat ramps sea walls and then in the budgeted amounts it's another you know Savings Program we're saving for the roof on this building and the carpet and um some sea walls and street lights and and things like that so um things to consider as you're moving forward the projects that you're you want to move forward with The Debt Service here is The Debt Service on this building the city hall and then the special assessment bonds and then move it further down the page no transfers were needed from the general fund is a big project program started we've had budgeted for Street resurfacing street lights Bridge Bridgeport but it didn't need that influx of money yet so the bottom line of this fund is that we actually use about 61 000 but there's still over 600 000 left in this amount awesome okay next up is the marina fun so the revenue here is charges for services as the split rentals parking fees um we were under budgeted a little bit because of um the parking fees were a little bit less than we had expected if you recall after the beach was open when we were in the middle of covet we had a huge amount of parking Revenue city-wide so that's been dropping off a little bit we'd love to go back to work um and so the new rates the new rentals are in effect this month all the renters have been notified most of the costs in this fund like the very first line says materials and supplies and a lot of what makes up that number is if we budget whatever amount we're projecting as profit in the sun we transfer that to the general fund and that's what makes up the most expensive year um and so we've as long as I've been here we've made that full the marina fund has been able to make that full transfer to the general fund um so even with that full budgeted transfer the marina fund made another ten thousand dollars in a profit and then they're still as you can see about 365 000 in this fund okay question control system and then here we have the stormwater fund the storm water assessment Revenue comes to us from Pinellas County Utilities you'll see that we have Personnel Services here it was the actual intenses were thirty two thousand eighty dollars and fifty cents the Auditors rounded up and that drives microcd crazy you'll see that it's one dollar under or over that one so that's 15 of the Public Works salaries we move over to the Swarm water fund um and as you move forward with the budgeting process I've you know I feel comfortable with that amount again if you discuss it and you get to that point we have contractual services that one was significantly under budget because we had planned on spending over a hundred over 105 000 on the nvds compliance and then the city ended up doing that analysis in-house that was a big project Kyle did a great job um I wasn't sure how I was going to be able to say that he's doing a great job in my presentation and I figured it is um M2 and Laura and everybody here really I mean honestly it's a great place to work and um I know you've known Ever Getting to hear that from my perspective but I feel very fortunate to work here so next is depreciation um this fund was new in 21 it was the first year so we didn't when we were developing the budget for this year we didn't really have a great idea of what that number should have been but for the budget and 23 we did include the depreciation now we have a much better idea going forward um but when you look at this on the whole you know that number was over budget but then the contractual Services was under so they offset so we're still within the rules um so we've had a lot of discussion about the storm water improvements and that will continue so I won't go into it but we do have good numbers to develop the budget for the upcoming year and this fund it did come close to sustaining itself it only had a loss of 2 740 but then it did need 25 000 transferred from the general fund and then their meaning plan volunteer is 1.7 million but that's not cash that's an infrastructure of that storm water system so you'll be talking about taking on debt for the upcoming improvements to accelerate that plan um again not trying to steal for service um any questions [Music] I have to argue that question what are we depreciating okay so smaller improvements themselves yes and so we have um like for all of the capital items we have a very detailed listing um you know that each item is depreciated by itself and then we get both up into one big number what part of that is check the house or I'm sorry that's not a question for me yeah yeah maybe the the curves the the pipe and then checked out all the importance of the system the plot the boxes you know what's okay okay and is that scheduled based on the new improvements or is that it are you really remembers of schedule of bringing from well that comes from actual expenses so however much we put in the service in any year that it's added to the list and then that total cost gets appreciated over the length of what is a video theoretically whenever we do both of these projects going forward here yes yeah you'll see us at San Juan trees so tonight we just I'm showing revenue and expenditure if we're not showing the balance sheet but those the costs of all the big items that are capitalized are on the balance sheet so you'll see a large amount of infrastructure for the sewer and the equipment and the different properties and things and then yes so we'll appreciate that value over here so my last slide is what I'd like you to put in your calendar these are the key date for you guys I did print out a detailed budget schedule um a budget calendar a lot of that is um external parties deadlines that we've set for ourselves but these are the the meetings that we'd like you to be around for the budget Workshop is on June 19th July 17th is when you're gonna need to adopt the military and then the September meetings are the important the ones you know to um so if you have any questions this is the full schedule and the the full schedule talks more about like um like that June 1st deadline the first time the property appraiser sends us the estimated the taxable values and then um you know the the property appraiser certifications those are forms that we fill out and um you know sign online it's an opportunity [Music] I just wanted you to have a full understanding of the whole budget process um and that's it for me tonight if you have any other questions I'll probably not any answers I just want to say thanks for coming I think this is the first time you guys have appeared in our meetings since we contracted with you all and I really appreciate your time so I think it's going to be helpful will you attend any of these budget meetings at all um and the reason I'm asking is because you know I see we've got two of us you know I've just made me some guidance and [Music] tighten that number a little bit in the scheme of things in this budget which is a very big budget that's a long way it is a lot of money um and so what I did want to definitely point out tonight like you like for the general fund especially like you did have a big and big youth um but we need that money now like um so yes I'll be I'll have to be as involved as you'd like Community um Kyle and I meet a lot we discuss things and get down into the details and then thank you so okay thank you thank you all right I appreciate it all right now we are up to item five if this is a presentation the Pinellas Suncoast fire industry rescue District uh welcome Chief Jeff Davis thank you mayor and hitting in everyone else every day it's in your fire scene but El Suncoast fire rescue I want to give you an update on the fire department and how we are trying to improve the Emergency Services on the beaches specifically to Miller Beach um there has been response time compliance challenges to this area for a very long time I was identified by the county in 2009 and today the same problem exists the county has a response time of seven and a half minutes standard and as we make 90 percent of the time and it's not being met these areas up here are 77 and 87 coach nobody can meet their response times not the railstone coast not our partners in Clearwater not our partners in Largo why is that well one of the reasons for response times is the geographical coverage that's needed on the beaches right we are a Barrier Island we have multiple Bridges with limited access we have narrow roads with low speed limits we have severe pedestrian and vehicle traffic and every year 10 increase in cold morning I think nobody can meet those response signs last month in March we have 17 responses to this area 16 emergency they were handled with panel simco's Clearwater and Marco and 31 of those who calls did not meet the response times and that's not acceptable it's not acceptable to me and it should not be acceptable to you another reason for the lacking coverage to this area is fire station on the beaches average about two and a half 2.4 miles apart from each other and vanilla Suncoast station and Clearwater station is 5.6 miles apart the Columbine with the amount of resources that are needed on calls that's simply too far or so this year every year around February marks there's a process where we put it for our ALS first responder means for the next fiscal year similar to what you're you're starting to do here and I've asked the county to find us two additional paramedics firefighters per day as well as an ALS Advanced life support transport equal unit for the beaches and that will improve those response lines we're looking at a piece of property on the Northern end of Indian Rocks Beach we're planning to build a fire station and more than likely we would move the fire truck there um that would have three firefighter air mix on there now this is already paid for it's already paid for by the citizens you already paying into the EMS fund for the county and there's a need for this service and you're just not getting it fighting for that to improve the services I've been doing this for 35 years I know how this goes and what should be provided and it's not being provided so I submitted a letter to the county asking for the announcement I've left a copy on the back table there along with some contact numbers email addresses of the County Commission because the next step in the process is I'm meeting one-on-one with all the County Commissioners to explain why we need this and they similar to what you do is you decide on what are the priorities for your budget and this is the priority for this budget thank you these residents deserve this service they need the service and they pay for this service and they're not getting it from the county so I asked for your support if you could take a copy my letter read through it my phone number is on there you can contact me with any questions and a letter support to the accounting commission would really help perhaps some dialogue there any questions that I could answer for you I'm happy to give you some useful Council G are you still leaving business cards back here yes sir thank you other questions um Chief I hope you continue because you weren't after the last EMS advisory meeting I did speak on your behalf and uh and I believe that you're one of your assistant Chiefs yes sir and the response was not exactly what I expected or you know I I felt that there would be more sympathetic to uh to what you were asking for and it just seemed like they were trying to put a Band-Aid on on this problem that we have here so I would advise everyone to please reach out to the County Commissioners and uh and give them a little nudge please unfortunately if you're waiting on the EMS Advisory Board to to push it Forward I don't think that's going to happen right and sometimes just like with Beach nourishment sometimes you kind of have to jump ahead and jump chain and come in to get things done whenever lower levels don't respond to keep fighting a good fight and just to confirm what the plan is it's even if you get the extra Personnel they will be stationed in Indian Rocks Beach until you are able to until you're able to build a new station is that correct sort of so we have that lined up the property is three miles from your city borders and once I know that this funding is going to come through we'll finalize the property acquisition there but I'll put temporary housing on the very next day on there so we'll be running that service the minute this gets great and and that's going to bridge the gap right now you said it's about six miles yes sir depending on which map you look 5.6 miles uh between the Middle South Coast any rock station and the Clearwater station 44. um and many times these responses require multiple units there's many times that the beaches are empty you know there's that many emergency calls going on at one time and we don't have that many units on the beaches because each fire station only has one unit in the fire station nearly one fire truck or a specialty unit or a rescue truck and that rescue truck would definitely enhance the response times but also it enhances the service because right now we rely on private Ambulance Company to do the transports and they said that their last name they're down 40 paramedics which means we're waiting for them and waiting for them there's times that we're waiting a very long time where with the transport cable unit our own ambulance right staff with two parabenic firefighters in situations like that we would be able to take you to the emergency right away we work on scene injury we're not waiting for the end of the Endless we're going to treat you and Katie to the surgeon the emergency room as soon as possible and so what they're saying right now is that the way they're accommodating us is they're providing us with what I call it volume service anticipated volume service well you can't predict when an emergency is going to happen so hosting somebody nearby whenever they think an emergency is going to happen it's not [Music] so again I appreciate everything you're doing and I appreciate the amount thank you any other questions all right thank you very much thank you okay um as you may or may not know against the start of uh sea turtle nesting season and last year we had a presentation this Wednesday morning and uh everyone was so happy with the presentation and entertained by it tonight we're going to come back again trying to get her the first of the day but she said for some reason she's too busy so uh welcome back Nancy and uh please let's let's hear your presidency good evening everybody thank you so much for having me on this evening again my name is Lindsay Flynn I'm a sea turtle conservation program manager at Clearwater Community aquarium just off the road here and I am going to be speaking to you tonight about sea turtle nesting here in Pinellas County sure um and I'm going to start my presentation by asking you some trivia questions that I hope you'll participate with me so how many species of sea turtles are there in the world Rod number thirty thousand any other guesses 20 20. and yet against us 47 47. there are seven species of sea turtles in the world yeah yeah all right next question how of these seven species how many of them nest in the state of Florida all of them none of them seven of them three three of them one of them I get up to five of them which is amazing almost all species of sea turtles Nest here in the state of Florida but we of them are more common so the one to your left here that's the largest species of sea turtle it's called the leather bag the middle one is our important species here it's called the loggerhead sea turtle which I'll learn about that just a second and the one all the way to the right the right there is called the crazy chart okay now you may or may not know we do have the internal nesting even here in the city of Philadelphia and the official sea turtle nesting season is May 1st through October 31st C primarily gets a loggerhead sea turtle nesting here so I'm going to talk about a little bit about their nesting process so that process starts with the adult female emerging from the surf zone at night and she's going to crawl up the beach somewhere between typically uh between the high sideline and the primary Dune trying to select unappropriate test site we actually don't know the criteria that they use to select that in that site we think it might have something into the temperature maybe the product's going to need for the June line we still don't know that that's more important research [Music] a shallow depression in the sand and she does that by pushing the surface Band Away with her front loafers next she's going to create something called an egg chamber or the Egg cavity and she's going to do that by curling her hair flippers like a shovel and she's going to dig a hole in the sand and it kind of looks like an upside down rifle and what's cool about this parting process is she does that by feeling she can't look behind her and see how she's doing so she feels how that feels and once she can't bring up any more sand she knows it's time to lay her eggs loggerhead sea turtles will deposit somewhere between 80 and 120 eggs per nest and she will lay anywhere from one to eight nests in a season although it's more typical for her to lay four to five in this kind of season every two weeks that is a lot of work for her so she does not blame this every year she typically lays messed every two to four years once she's done with that she's simply going to work backwards so she's going to use her rear flippers to cover the eggs with sand she's not going to camouflage the sight and the scent of that mask I um sort of casting sand about with her front flippers and um sort of things are very fluffy mess site when she's done with that she's simply going to turn around and return to the scene she does not provide any maternal care for her nest she'll come back in about two weeks but only to lay another mess she's not going to check on her otherness while she's up there so that Nest is going to incubate for about two months underneath the sand and then those hatchlings are going to merge together at night and hopefully make their way directly towards the water we're going to talk about why that may not happen [Music] but now that we know it's internal mess here in Bella Beach why should we care well there's legal reasons here they are protected under his state and federal law they're protected at the federal level Through The Endangered Species Act and at the state level through the marine turtle protection act there is also ecological reasons so Florida hosts more than 90 percent of all loggerhead nesting activities in North America more importantly so I should say here that that black line around the State of Florida is where's the loggerheads Eternal mess in your purse so it occurs nearly around the entire climate of the state and the only reason it doesn't occur in the Big Bend area is because national land and sea turtles need expanded Sandy now more interestingly internationally Florida is one of two primary nesting sites for the loggerhead sea turtle in the entire world Oman the country of Oman is the other location if you don't remember where Oman is from your chair is it in the Arabian Peninsula right next to uh Yemen and Saudi Arabia so I think it's really cool that little Florida is a really important nesting site for this sea turtle but what is sort of theory about that is the country of Oman is seeing decline in loggerhead sea turtle nesting rising to 79 percent that means arguably Florida is the number one nesting site for the loggerhead sea turtle in the entire planet so that has implications so as the nesting population goes here in the State of Florida so those the global population of Florida so we have a responsibility to protect our loggerhead seizure illness the best of our ability because it can affect their global population other ecological reasons I think this is kind of timely right now because we're talking about a feature nourishment sea turtles help stabilize Beach and My Little Pony when they lay their nests not all their eggs are going to produce actions some of them just simply aren't fertilized so they're going to end up breaking down eventually and when they do that those eggs are going to release things like nitrogen and phosphorus that can be used by the gym vegetation to grow and grow their root system and by doing that that then stabilizes the sand and builds up the dunes cells stabilizing the beach of course maintains and more nesting habitat for sea turtles and shortbreads and secrets they are an important part of the process there we go there's also economic reasons so visit St Pete Clearwater recently released a report that said tourism brings 10.8 billion County so we want our tourists to come here to spend their money and sea turtles can help you do that so there was a marketing analysis done recently and during that market analysis American Travelers were asked um if they were they want to be more proactive in reducing an impact of their [Music] mother and nearly 40 of individuals said yes that is important to me so that means that Travelers want to be conscious they're doing and the impact they have on the environment why not let them know that they can have an impact on Central investing and I will tell you how they can do it in just a little bit also they found that they that Travelers want more authentic less commercial travel experiences so they want to go somewhere they feel good about going to so what is the destination doing to set their destination apart from Temple typical commercial experiences what's more authentic than within a destination carrying before is precious precious sources like their sea turtles we can fit all of these criteria um if we just do more to care about unnecess vehicles finally um one of the so they were asked please think deeply about what motivates you to travel what really fuels your desire to travel right now and one of the tier one motivators was creating memories and experiencing new places and what cooler way to create a memory or experience a new area than to know that where you're staying at hosts sea turtle investing and to be a part of that experience I maybe taking a morning walk and seeing the new crawl or maybe taking a look at those March sites and calling to see you know when they have a concern maybe they see a hatchimal sea turtle they can be a part of that by reporting it they also found that a tier two motivator is going somewhere where interesting things happen and learning something and expanding their perspective we have an opportunity to do that with their missing the sea turtles I think nesting sea turtles are pretty interesting and I think your tour is fine to stay sing have an opportunity to teach them something expand their perspective and go and show them what interesting things happen right here so things that we can talk to them about while they're here is reducing their obstructions and reducing light pollution and sea turtle disorientations one of the things that they don't tend to think about is that leaving their tents and their toys and things on the beach can negatively impact sea turtles remember they come on the beach at night to lay their mess if they encounter something they're not expecting like that pile of toys you see there they're going to be adverse to that they're probably going to return to the water without laying nests this false problem now it's possible that our sea turtles can come ashore that same night or within a few nights to lay a successful event but if they keep coming ashore they keep encountering these items they will eventually turn to the water and they will release those eggs into the water and those eggs are now no longer viable so we've now reduce the potential number of passions we could have produced had the [Music] and there's plenty of instances unfortunately where seachures that come Shore you can see their crawl track right near those poles there where she came ashore and simply could not locate a because these items were in the way sand castles and poles can do the same thing sometimes they can crawl over it like you see here or sometimes they crawl right on and and if they experience that they can leave without nesting something else that can negatively impact sea turtles is artificial rating so you can see here the nighttime image of the State of Florida you can see areas where there's lots of lighting of the Miami area or Orlando Jacksonville and here in Pinellas County interestingly Pinellas County is the most densely populated county for humans in the State of Florida we lack we like to use along a light and light for safety security and providing them a whole well-lit place for a tourists to go but how does that affect our journals well under natural conditions both adults and Ashley sea turtles use bright water and water and so normally our Moonlight and starlight called Celestial light is bouncing off of the water creating a Bright Horizon and that's contrasting with the darkness over the land so they're able to follow that bright light right towards water now here in Pinellas County we're well developed we have lots of white artificial light on at night Heats with the celestial light sea turtles will go to whatever length is the greatest so that artificial light is brighter they will go towards that so they will find themselves in areas where they should not be pools hot tubs parking lots storm drains in the middle of Gulf Boulevard where they can and they have the number of urban cars so the rule of thumb for artificial lighting is if you're standing warmly on the beach and you can see the light so too can the turtles so we need to do something about it okay so here's an example of an adult Sea Turtle Crawl tracks of that crawl track is coming towards you way back there is our nesting truck but that is where the nest was laid so she spends a lot of time crawling along the beach um when she should not have remember we talked about as soon as she's done laying furnace she returns it right back towards the water so the fact that she spent all this time falling along the beach tells us that there was some sort of artificial light source that was impeding her ability to get back towards wasn't a problem because she only has so much energy to lay these nests so she may not come ashore to lay another Nest later because she just runs out of energy and again let's our overall population over 10 um I would warn you that the next couple of photos are graphic and I only show you this because this is a consequence of the problems of artificial light in here in Pinellas County so remember we talked about that sea turtles could find their way to areas where they should not be and that does include the roadway that includes adults and hatchlings we have had adult sea turtles cross Gulf Boulevard after they are done nesting and very nearly getting hit by cars this is an instance here where it this female was struck by a vehicle down south you can see that she was carrying eggs and those were no longer be viable for those that have not been removed from the population of very prevalently in their actions as well and even if they don't manage to find a roadway they can use precious energy sort of wandering about the beach just trying to find the water um they only have so much energy to find water when you need that energy because their goal was they reach the water is to swim to this offshore weed line it's called the sargassing rewind where they rest and feed for the first few years of life they're wandering them each they no longer have the energy to get out there so they're very likely to predict be predated by birds and fish a long way um while they're wandering the beach they're also susceptible to donation by Coyotes we've seen them out on the beach coyotes raccoons bird species they can eat graded by all of them this is just another example unfortunately of our hatchling theme run over in the major roadway this is an example of a hatchling disorientation event so if you're having trouble seeing matching tracks and going to highlight them for you so you can see this is an instance where a a nest was in the middle of the beach the hashlings did not go anywhere near the water they instead traveled towards the land where we found them long crawling along Seawall in the in the gymline wasting preciousness but there's something we can do to help there's something called sea turtle friendly lighting that sea turtles are less affected by and our governing agency is called clarkfish along the conservation conservation Mission trying to Mango for that secret of filming lighting it's called keep it long children and quickly I'll keep it long leads use a long wait wait that's wavelength above 560 nanometers that's LED light that is emitting light in the orange Amber or Red Spectrum and less likely to be attracted to that light and you're more likely to be able to run it correctly towards the water next we want to keep it low we want to keep the wattage in the lumens of the light is low for the necessary purpose we also want to keep it flow to the ground so the turtles are less likely to see the light source itself finally more people like Source shielded so they're less likely to see that point source of lint it's important to mention here that all three of those guidelines must be met in order to be considered to be traveling friendly so I want to provide an example we'll see you really understand what we're asking for so you can see under the before image this is an example of a property of Independence or Flora prior to a retro fit that was completed by the Sea Turtle Conservancy it's another non-profit organization based out of Gainesville Florida and you can see this property that there's a lot of white artificial light up on the top you can see some ceiling mounted lights a lot of interior white light that allows the property owner to see or about their property that is also very attractive to their sea turtles so it was very likely that we were trying hatchlings on this property the after image shows what the property looks like as a sea turtle friendly property so certainly not asking people to turn their lights off understand that Safety and Security and insurance liabilities are important consideration we are simply asking people to change the type of bolts and fixtures they are using so this after image is a sea turtle friendly property Fair using light in the Amber spectrum and they're using fixtures that are thrown or directed and they are shielded so even at these properties these sea turtles are less confused by this light they're able to correctly Orient towards the water as they normally would but can sea turtles really see a difference I mean that just looks like a different color house right so what's the big deal but quickly want to do a lightning demonstration with you and I hope you will participate I'm going to show you a couple different lights and I want you to look at them with your naked eye and then I want you to look and add them with your handy dandy uh light card that I provided to you so first is a white artificial light so don't look directly at the light but use your uh naked eye first so this could be an example of a typical white light that might be installed on somebody's property on the outside um so that you can see maybe their walkway at night and you can very clearly see that people use that all the time this is an example of a sea turtle friendly light so you can see it's in a shielded fixture and the bulb itself is an LED light that's emitted in the Amber drum I just want you to show that it's on before reading the next part all right now I want you to look at that same light with your sea turtle filter and that will allow you to see what a sea turtle sees okay so look at that light where your special guy can you see the light yeah you can so sea turtles see that very clearly they are going to be very attracted to that light they're probably going to go towards that light instead of the water next I want you to look at this light can you see it how about now you do not so um that is less attractive to those and they are more likely to throw in towards the water so it does make a difference the type of lights and fixtures we are using out on our beaches and that goes for city-owned property to things like street lights a public parking lot lights public restroom lights those affect sea turtles just as much as any property other types of artificial lights can affect Turtles as well things like flashlights and cell phone lights everyone's probably seen the flashlight parade on the beach at night guests or a tourists looking for girls crafts exactly our hatchling sea turtles in particular so you can find that they will be crawling towards that flashlight or that cell phone light just like they would any other artificial light source so we ask that people try and to blend their eyes in just to the night and try not to use the cell phone lights and flashlights but if they feel like they need it for safety or security they do sell red LED headlamps at hardware stores and we encourage people to use um people can report a sea turtle sightings during this uh Missing season they can use the FWC Wildlife alert hotline anywhere in the State of Florida that will route to the correct organization they can also call Clearwater Marine Emporium we monitor from the city of Clearwater through the city of Treasure Island it's about 21 miles beaches and they can call our rescue hotline at that number for 24 hours a day the city of Bellaire Beach also has these lovely signs at all of their public beach accesses that tell our tourists and our residents what the Jews and don'ts of Seashore on the sea season and it provides the same phone numbers that they'd like to call a new concern and these signs are also located at our Miss site specifically so they do provide the basic do's and don'ts at that last night and to please call those numbers in case they want to report something and again I think it's important to mention here that when we're we're talking about lighting to please consider reviewing your city-owned properties things like Morgan Park your street lights those all kind of fast sea turtle hatchlings in our adults from oriented correctly so I I highly recommend that you review that when we're talking about a retrofitting or street lights we're happy to talk to you about what we can do to improve the lighting and sitting on properties I say thank you very much for listening to me and I'd be happy to take any questions that you have to tell you what let's go to this have any questions if you want to go to our community website we do have um [Music] any others Council yes um and some email specifically about Gulf Boulevard I mean that's really that the lights aren't owned by us I mean what should we do I mean we can't just say hey replace all the bubbles can there's an ability to do that now Duke Energy has a wonderful seizure relating specialist his name's Michael Smith he's specifically working in this area to help measure its street lights so yes it's true that you don't own the lights you'll probably release them from duke they have the ability to to retrofit all the street legs with citro friendly molds and shields unfortunately are they providing for funding as well no however I believe they he did mention that he is talking about potentially doing some sort of and this I may be misspeaking here so please bear that in mind that he was talking about some sort of payment system too so Duke has been really good about working with municipalities about this they want to help with this sort of situation so they may be able to help in some sort of payment s okay just be asking if you need a city manager just gets in contact just as long as we have a you know there's a there's a number out there so we understand kind of impact if we were attended to go along that route absolutely I'd be happy [Music] to do other questions um or the blue light that's being replaced is that cheap turtle from it blue lighting is not sea turtle friendly in fact it's one of the colored lights besides white lights that is the most attractive to turtles so blue light green light purple light very attractive to our turtles so they are going to be drawn towards that instead of [Music] might be back no that's a that's a problem actually just knows that they find them it's just that it's a technical issue because often the other thing is uh RPG is a paper year after year and I see especially the first the 19th Street it's very little beach but so when you guys come out and we put up a nice little barricade mild storm comes takes that barricade right out we have to do that Nestle that's a great question so what happens when our barricades are lost we have a couple of methods that we use um to refine the mess so we're very fortunate that a bank gave us a grant to purchase a special GPS units that are called Trimble and TBC 150s they're sub meter GPS's so instead of knowing our GPS location of our Nest down to 10 feet we can now know them four to six inches so if we were to lose all of those Nest markers we can use those GPS standards now to just like a compass to refine theirness so we're very thankful for those funds but we also Place secondary markers in the back Beach as a backup to this let's start washed out uh no well sometimes yes sometimes no so nests can take some wash over so long as that water is drained out fairly quickly um you can think about it like if we were in a pool so we have to be able to surface debris every now and again in order to be okay but if we go sit under the water for too long we run out of air eventually it's very similar with our our eggs they have they exchange gases with the environment down in the bottom and if they sit under the water too long they can no longer do that [Music] it has Clear Water Range Rover protection afterwards I'll try to get Beach rehearsalences we have no pizza nothing yeah say that one more time for me it has a Clearwater Marine or sea turtle protection Society sweet Turtle Conservatory where they involved trying to feature nourishment because well if they reached out to the FED because we're not going to get anything for at least 200 years that's a great question we do our best to make sure that our federal agencies are well educated on how our sea turtles use the environment as well as our SDC Church our secrets forwards because our sea turtles are not the only brain animal that are usually utilizing nothing so nice so I think it's very important that I think if you do our due diligence to educate our our stakeholders about how the beach is utilized right I have a question um if you had any interactions with the Army Corps of Engineers yes and uh and how did that go um well our main interaction comes from working with them during the 2018 International project so we worked what we have communications with them during that project and it was their take and years on the value of nourishment for the sea turtle population good question so sea turtles need sandy beaches ultimately to Nest successfully I think our Pinellas County Environmental Management would agree that typically our ages are original beaches so we back to that our beaches will loose sand over time now [Music] how full disclosure sea turtle listing can be negatively impacted in the short term with patriarchment because typically here in Pinellas County for nourishment projects happen during the sea Journal messing season sometimes between the day and October and that typically happens because other areas like the east coast of Florida for example gets much higher nesting density than we do here we can expect two to three hundred nests in our area in the season they can expect tens of thousands investors experience so typically they are given priority [Music] so we're then asked to do those projects into running season that negatively impacts our mess because we are required to relocate them so we don't want a bunch of sand dumped onto the sea turtle nest because they would not the hatchlings would not be able to crawl out successfully so we have to when they're big we have to pick them up transfer them to an area that will not receive the sand anytime you do that it can affect the hatching and emergence success of those eggs which can affect the more captions that you're going to produce so um while we do we certainly do our utmost to make sure that business is a little protected it can impact them however for nourishment projects typically offer wider beaches for our sea turtles to Nest so their negatives and positives to that project okay thank you very much any other questions so the um I'm assuming then so the actual nesting always takes place at night typically some species can lay their nests during the day that's the critically endangered comes with police sea turtle and we have gotten a cancer friendly nests in our survey area we we got into your North but we do get those barrier nasty species and the nest during the day the majority at night how about that hatching happens at night you get the very rare mixed signals that the hatchlings think it's nighttime and it is not and you get a day hatch out but 99 of it that night when you guys ran across those particular hatchings that were disoriented so what do you guys do at that point do you pick them up and take them to the water certainly it depends on the condition of the hatchling and what's going on so we do have a 24-hour hotline that we ask the public to call we will respond to those calls 24 hours a day we assess the situation try and locate those hatchlings and we will either release them with approval from our veterinarian or we will bring them to the aquarium for veterinarian evaluation and sometimes they look very tired and very weak sometimes they might have some sort of injury maybe from a predator or something like that they need to be seen so the best thing for us to do if we were to see that is not pick them up and take them to the bar and call you guys correct absolutely [Music] so we can expect among the hash lines that reach the water that one in one thousand hatchlings Will Survive that's 0.1 percent um so they can be predated we truly don't know the extent to what happens to them out on the water it's hard for us to research that but they can be predated by fish and bird species sometimes they're too weak from you know a oriented on the beach if they just so happened to make it to the water on the knee no longer have the energy reserves to make yourself it's critically important that we make sure we do our best to protect all of the hatchlings and try and get them to the only point one percent of them survival individual all right thank you Miss Lambert knowing a little short all the time but uh I greatly appreciate you coming for your education and a lot of people a conversation about sea turtles India you are welcome to come back next year and into this presentation again thank you very much all right we are on to item seven which is the quarterly board reports let's begin with the board of adjustments report from Mr Mike Kelly good evening Mr Mayor and council members I'm Mike Kelly board chairman um since we're talking about the quarter January February and March the board of Justice start off with bang having a various meeting in January we're at issue on 22nd Street our new house of construction in March we were supposed to have another hearing on an appeal of administration appeal by our city manager it was deemed to be postponed by our City attorney for further work with with the residents so March was canceled but coming up in April next week we have a variance for a pool and in March in May we also have another variance for a pool on the same issue that I harp on all the time about crown of the roads so that's to be discussed whenever the council subdings it so we're moving along having a good quarter any questions thank you very much thank you all right next up is the citizens advisory equipment committee to Ron Skinner thank you mayor council uh assistance advisory committee uh about two times this court February 22nd we got to review at recommended financing options to accelerate multi-year Capital Improvements for the city related to Street resurfacing saltwater projects which will be presented later this evening in the agenda secondly we met as the audit committee on March 22nd uh that was to review the annual comprehensive financial report that was prepared by the city Auditors of saltwater the committee recommended delay got approval until the uh full reports in the financial statistics are added to the uh to the audit Council thank you we'll see you shortly all right next up is uh the Park and Recreation before Tammy govender um quick update for park and rec board January through March we welcome team members which are happy to have um we had three successful Beach cleanups we welcome everyone that comes every month we're thankful for them and to everyone that comes on a regular basis and to our guests always happy to have people there um January we had our second annual health and wellness Fair which went very well we had some tried and true returning from the first one that we had and we had some new people out which was great um we've already started booking people for 2024 if anybody has a connection with the Mobile Patrol please call me because I'm really trying to get them here for next year a new program that we started um this quarter was the new Resident welcome bags because it became apparent when everyone was trying to get off the island that there were people that didn't know that they needed a hurricane pass to get off or you know they moved here and there's so many things that you're doing to try to move so we put together like a nice little welcome bag and then it has all pertinent information that they need for City information and then um Aaron the door hangers and then we hang them on the door for them to come to the city hall so something new that we started we are right in the middle of a park survey for this quarter so our board goes out we look we spend significant time in every single looking for the good the bad safety issues and then we do a recap with the city manager and we um we work on that list diligently throughout the quarter Bellard Beach merchandise you have the things that we have right now we're looking for something new if anyone has any suggestions or if they're looking for something or I think I might have mentioned it before what we're looking into like the yeti light cups with the Bel Air Beach logo on them I think for something new and then fall events we have our third annual Halloween on October 28th we have our holiday social on December 4th we have our second annual mayor's Philly Cook-Off on December 10th which is a Sunday this year and then we'll have our third annual health and wellness Fair on January 13th so is there any questions [Music] that's that's crazy too would any dermatologist worker that you want the mobile no any dermatologist we've worked we've had a hard time getting a dermatologist here but they're kind of like they have a trap kind of like the blood donator mobile there they would be in the parking lot and when you could actually go in and get a checkout as opposed to just talking to a dermatologist in the book but yeah and we would love to intervermatologist thank you thank you uh now we're up to the planning and tell him before after we have a Planning and Zoning report tonight oh all right moving right on to item number eight this is the City attorney report Mr Moore you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor since our last meeting for our office has been tracking and legislative session very closely recent days last week I made a presentation before the Big C concerning one bill for your interest to many of each communities filled with less impact here which is Senate Bill 714 in its house corollary household 833 concerning short-term rental regulations um The Cliff Notes version of it is UFOs have grandfather protective Provisions prohibiting short-term rentals in certain zoning districts not every each community and not every Community for us so fortunate and the landscape for those outside of that protective bubble is ever changing and often unsatisfying and at present there's a bill proposed that would change that landscape further it's being sponsored in the Senate by Senator Sibley from locally the bill seems to presently be stalled in its committee hearings are passed on the session is still only halfway through so it may gain traction we need to be continue to monitor those one that affects you folks particularly is House Bill 37 and cscs Senegal 774 which concerns Financial exposure forms for elected officials at the local level until now and perhaps including so many video owners I'm familiar with this at this point you've filled out form One Financial disclosures there are different forms for the financial disclosures and the current legislation which is um gained a lot of traction I believe it has already moved through one of the two Chambers and is likely to move through the other would have you fill out a form six form six gets much more granular in its attention to your finances including Assets in excess of 1000 liability your interest Holdings and businesses and the lighting so that is understanding The Narrative behind it is increased transparency of interest in local government of the the counter narrative that's been offered to is the chilling effect they may have we're going to go to their own service knowing how open their Affairs may be another one another set of bills that we're tracking closely is uh the what was Senate Bill 1372 and House Bill 1321 it's not moving in the house so this is at least what I consider to be good news but it was a bill that would render local elections open two-partisan advertisement and partisan elections in the event you felt local elections weren't contentious enough um but here it was a potential to add another layer to that that seems to be stalling but again things can move in session rather quickly or become writers or other bills so we will keep tracking that the other we'll be looking at very closely is Senate Bill 170 and it's houseboat 15-15 to me this is of the greatest consequence to the business we do here together um Senate Bill 170 units which is already past the Senate and House Bill 1515 which is headed to the floor of the house would require any adopted ordinance to have a business impact statement which does not say what expert or detailed would be required to give some values or factors how those will be determined and substantiated or being received of added concern to that is not just hey there's one more step to getting ordinances adopted but most telling me or until now there's been a statutory element on the books concerning ordinances that are preemptive and when somebody challenges an ordinance and says hey it's been preempted Amazon in addition to the last three years and if you sustain if you kept any ordinance on the book after being told it was preemptive or challenged you faced exposure to returning speeds as a community for the plaintiff's attorney Suites that language has been enhanced to say if it's arbitrary um or or what's the other word frivolous I believe it was the word archery for a list or preempted and a and in some validity it brings student against the city to challenge its organs you face exposure to fees and not only that but while during the tendency of that suit you have to stay the enforcement of the ordinance so somebody said if you pass something tomorrow somebody challenges it you cannot enforce it while that challenge is being resulted I imagine the course will have to give these priority however our courts are already taxed and Detour performed if you've not seen the news coverage on that wallet on spending on where you settlements and the scene is impossible it has resulted in a massive influx of litigation to the markets at least in the short term the courts are trying to figure out how to handle that because separate building but the tour performing material change in a period for negligence institutes for four years to two years so Plagueis attorneys who were sitting on things watching this legislative session something said well I've got like two 2 000 cases in the backlog and I'm just going to get a whole file right now so there's been an influx application and we've seen that in some of our cities as well cities that haven't seen soup in a decade have two or three kind of but getting back to the extended Bill 170 houseboat 1515 the business impact and mandatory State elements are peculiar and Main Service for the purple the home rule elements of what you do here especially as a smaller Community how to forecast business impact statements and who knows how those findings end up being leveraged later for against you so that is the same again where we continue to track this as I have substance of updates I will continue to provide them either in writing or otherwise to make sure you have timely updates on session the the most notable news though not necessarily specific to municipalities who of course would impact on our deputies and other alliances and single carry changes let's go to go into effect in July where you do not mean it's a very Urban to carry a firearm in a state of Florida women forward and I don't stay there with any natural realization just can't ask and be aware so outside of that we because I have a feeling if I don't say anything I will get asked at the last meeting there was some lengthy exchange concerning the property of the antenna structure his attorney is presently on vacation this weekend expecting to get us a statement on or before April 14th of a substantive submission again the antenna tower is not being erected during that time it does not mean that it's not being addressed or resolved that is the current status of that I did communicate I'm taking semi memorandum at our last meeting had um some some fields of inquiry I communicated those and more to his attorney and he's since been in touch with Kyle they are exchanging emails that have exchanged emails and it's not radio silence but that that matter continues forward otherwise I'm happy to answer any questions thank you Mr Moore any questions or comments uh actually this is random somebody unplugged that late before it burns Street report please thank you actually I was I was going to suggest just a brief pause in the meeting so uh if you if you needed to remove your equipment you're more than welcome to I'm not going to make you wait for the whole meeting [Music] I appreciate dropping mayor I believe um he has not his his complete permit submission is forthcoming one of the one of the delays if you will or on top of his just personal lead was one of the questions that we asked very specifically that goes to this inquiry is not only what is the capacity in terms of height and and signal for this entire structure but what does its actual mean if he only needs to for example you know the analogy I do and speaking with some of you is when I was in Middle School I had basketball hoop I didn't we could have gone to 10 feet I didn't mean it to go higher than seven for what I was doing right and so similarly he may not need to get the full capacity and there's a study that he needs to do I can't remember the term Proctor profit study or something I forget to turn the word obligation thank you propagation study the needed that needed to be done and so that allowing some time for that based on the inquiries that we post thank you any other questions or comments you can see the attorney I have a question regarding that house bill 37 can you say it looked like it was their class or yes House Bill 37 I mean let me just pull over that's the financial disclosure one yeah let me just I have several times here I want to make sure that I'm I'm speaking to the right one so the Senate bill is 774 and uh that bill has um gone through these two of its committees and it's heading to this um it's gone through ethics and elections and it's gone through the rules committee uh 16-4 voters pending reference review so it's going to that senate floor um is for the Senate version and then it's the related bill of house bill 37. House Bill 37 has favorable by all by it's in its last committee I believe state affairs committee and so likely to um and we see its way to the house for whether it passes I can't say but the other element to all of this is food better and different you have a party that has a super majority in the legislature and the same party is in power and the governor's seat which is to say if leadership wants something done it's almost certain ly yeah there's not going to be a lot of surprises with split votes or hey that was that you know came close but one person came across the aisle his leadership won something that it's like the going to be done and by the rate that this has moved through the Committees and the discussion that's been happening on these they've generally been passing along party lines and it is it is moving and there's still roughly a month left in the session so very likely to get work and if the if the votes thus far on committee or any negation likely events not not a certainty again I don't I know since there I just I hope that the voters pay attention and speak to our Representatives because in our small town you'll get no one running for eign I think that's that's the goal I really think that that is to drive out these fogginess found I've had several conversations with people around the county and just like the uh the the lawsuit the maximum penalty they can be awarded from the lawsuit we're talking about including around 200 000 and they're talking about probably 200 2.5 yeah that has been proposed that one has not moved quite as much to Sovereign Unity cap extension but yes that is on the table that's a that's a a store closure for us it has the potential to be in any number of these things and you know I know mayor Gaddis was President for my presentation um that they see and at the risk of you know getting too much within a soapbox or platform I'd just say the current trajectory of our of this legislative session and more recent ones presents at least if not an existential transfer from the United's essential concern for smaller communities and you can you see that in the public comment you're seeing not just here but in other communities the people lamenting the loss of their neighborhoods and and just having streets whether that short-term rentals home-based businesses property rights protections and everything what about my property rights they always seem to be in competition and you're starting to lose the ability to cultivate and sustain the unique character of each of these small communities that we've developed that has made this community and communities like it across Florida so attractive and so you know I I to the extent I can make a statement to the to the to you as the council and to your public is recognizing that your remedy isn't always here we've been taught in in Civics that the government the governor's local governments best or you know governs closest government's best and that's your local government so much of that is being recaptured if you will by Tallahassee and the remedies that people come to you and say why don't you guys fix this and then you know you folks run and then you meet some poor staff like me who tells you yeah all the things you wanted to do you can't do in our system of government they have the ability to take those things back and they um whereas that was done as the exception it seems to be rewarded just beginning to make the uh the State of Florida losing to last year taking our character in a way and uh Unfortunately they don't listen to us they don't listen to the lines information or whatever [Music] oh sorry uh for the name of the economics there obviously just briefly this morning I would joined to address briefly the situation in the letters and the emails that we received signs and the uh I guess protesters uh because it's been added as an agenda item I'll I'll withhold until we get to National Bank thank you any other questions I guess uh last year when the um the inspection requirement was passed for the condos three stories and up there was talk that it might be free get dressed this year is there anything that looks like that's happening excellent question thank you I don't remember and have not written it down the the bill number and I can follow up with you on that it is being Revisited which is one of the reasons why um to the assemble jurisdictions we're trying to advise or or be advised about the issue there's everybody's kind of being told hold on let me let's see because some of [Music] and the entire regime around that every 20 years 10 years is this and all that stuff that came out some of the it was it was well intentioned and as many as a much specialization that's done you know reactive and accelerated pace people after the fact realized like hey it says this but it doesn't really put that on this on anybody whose responsibility is it to do this and it says abuse panel you must but then there's no timeline there's no how do I know what to do and so yes there is some legislation being proposed and discussed this session no I don't have a specific regulations terms so I'll make sure you get that update to you after the meeting any other questions or comments we'll see attorney all right thank you very much Mr Moore now we're up to item number nine senior manager report Mr Reaper thank you Mary um so I'm going to start off with the uh Phillip Oliver undergrounding we just had a progress meeting on March 29 and that unfortunately we're still kind of waiting on the materials to get here uh Duke Energy has contracted those materials they just do not have a confirmation on the date but the underground the contractor so when I have a date of the actual progress breaking around the project breaking ground level uh maybe another city out there where the adult Baltimore buoy replacement for the new Zone that we created with the ordinance those are now installed we installed the 16 were labeled buoys we had to bring them in based on the feature erosion to get that 300 foot distance of the line is actually a little closer than it was who is the city staff is planning to remove the remaining old Idol weight buoys in the meantime those are actually outside of our new creative swim zones they're not actually causing confusion within that sound so similar Improvement projects as we come in the agenda tonight we're going to be a bank Nova solution the city hall generator I told you I would get some side by side quotes of the portable unit we discussed in the original unit which result engineer I understand I did see both of them come in on my email today while we didn't see him so they're the prices are holding pretty much where they were again it's a 15-day price period to start building I wanted to follow up with one of the vendors on some of the specific questions we have concerned whole thing in terms of the email out to this week children's playground replacement that will be up on the back to April 21st so I'm very hopeful I think this month I started working on Personnel policy we currently have a personal policy procedure manual as well as an employee handbook what I've noticed over the years of working here is there is a lot of the same material covered in both documents one document will probably more detail in one section in another section and there is some areas that it isn't congruent so what I'm having done on the currents group is to update and combine combine those documents so that I can be having more ready resource to to look at personal matters and make sure that we're where we need to be as far as how important we must change I'm out there they have provided to knock and I said we'll have it reviewed by the I'm working on a grant policy which would be an administrative policy of political outline the boom we have a project coming before us looking at funding how we approach it and formal process of how we look for other funding methods we know before we do all our budget so and also cover some of the ongoing grants that we have throughout the year that that we all we plan on getting every year and how we go about that I'm hoping that that it'll be a future work session for the next work session I wanted to start presenting an example of what I see the scorecard we should should we the sunrise where we're at and in our projects the Strategic plan how our finance ties into it and they also how to code enforce around it so that I will be presenting to the next work session to get some feedback and I just wanted to follow up on the icma FCC MMA development um I actually miss I suppose it needs in this report on the April 13th that our 11th the 13th I'll give you the four-point conference I will be going to the uh the Florida government commission uh City Managers Association conference on May 30th through June 2nd and um I've been in touch with the icna the uh they there is a level of experience credits you have to reach they told me that they would provide a report based on where I am at so I have a realistic timeline and also I'm waiting for the leadership development program that they offer to be reimagined they've told me it was supposed to be this year or early in January than it was last time could be in April that they don't have that program but you know where you can start to register for it what that will do is it will provide education for me and also at the same time reduce the amount of years experience that would be the helicopter experience credit what a key importance of Korea actually um it was mentioned the traffic study of assistance Commons I've been in touch with Charles County at Town of Washburn and some of his employee engineers and they we did a doodle poll it's a final meeting date to be on site at the intersection but one of the the dates I selected because I have the conference with April 18th in April 19th um I did ask uh if councilman Roberts groups from that meeting because he was involved in that review.com before that so I will follow up on that um part mobile we have everything turned in necessary to get started they had a proof for signs that we're going to install um that's the images I saw a video company I was getting a bank letter for the ACH depository so we'll talk something nice to them they told me at the Timeline would be about three or three week timeline [Music] [Music] I might say it when we uh selected your city manager we also took on the responsibility to make sure that you're being mentored uh giving you advice suggestions Etc I mean we talk daily but I just wanted to point out you found a problem here with a Personnel policy do you basically were extremely proactive if you found a need match the parties that would contribute most to this effort and I just wanted to point it out that that's a really it's an outstanding effort it shows insight and basically a level below above you so I just want to compliment you on that and I hope that you're collecting these city manager reports because we'll talk later about evaluations and these really are isn't part of your evaluations and just a brief timeline what I've seen here performance so far has been thoroughly outstanding professional at a rain well above your age very well done just wanted to publicly acknowledge your efforts and the outstanding efforts on behalf of the city thank you thank you any other questions or comments we'll see what you're saying was I've heard when I think of good things from the residents of backing too I agree your evaluations he met but uh since you're doing such a fine job I don't think we should be holding you to that two-year wage freeze Council gives you a raise of Shield any other questions yeah thank you guys so you had mentioned that you had a contact and so if you get back to say he was good with anything tonight I'm going to follow up on that yeah and I fill out the survey immediately um but I haven't heard so I'm gonna make any call okay great and one other questions has the city finalized who we're going to use as the engineering firm or the stormwater Improvement projects no we're not there yet um I'm planning on getting uh design proposals from all six foreign great thank you for uh we had a brief conversation a few days ago concerning the uh fines and metering and what we were subjecting to the public parking lots are you in a position where you can discuss that um so we did have a meeting and um all all sudden on the Army Corps is going to be able to provide some administrative guidance for further contracts and agreements for future nourishment um having presented a where we stood at the city and what you know what we were doing with our rates and all that they did not uh upfront see any major issues and they were able to justify what we were doing now but if you keep the policies that they feel are necessary to keep it open to public so the meeting went well I'm looking forward to the guy and said they provide because it's going to clear up on some confusion but among all the the recent colleagues are involved with their Management program I find it interesting that they only want to discuss each nourishment whenever we're trying to to increase the fines parking Bridge that's half the point that's interesting all right any other questions or comments for the city manager thank you very much Mr Rayford all right now we are on to item number 10 which is the city clerk report so I just want to do a follow-up on the uh quarterly reports the auctioning and the Planning and Zoning Board that we will be getting meetings with them so that we can get those two things to city council so that's we'll be setting up those meetings and the City attorney is going to be doing the government and the Sunshine um presentation on Wednesday at 5 30 for all the boards and committees but the public is welcome too and that's all I have questions or comments for the city first that's Mr Roberts so Patty is that Sunshine presentation is that required yearly by everybody or is that a once in a long time that it is required annually for for our elected members um and I believe it says support center as well but regard I'm not sure about that definitely to our elected members this training that we're doing on Wednesday is not towards that credit because this is sort of a cliff notes version the four hour course that you took at email less or enter in years past or is offered online through the LLC or through various other vehicles it's always available to meet you extra kid annually for you folks this one is intended more to make sure that top to bottom our teams know about their obligations duties responsibilities as public or semi-public officials as it relates to public records Sunshine Law in my tenure here I've not had the opportunity to meet all of those Awards and we've already in this one year happy members come on and you know hopefully establishing a pattern as we get new numbers a sort of a brief orientation excellence in our regression thank you any more questions or comments we'll see one last one form one team for us we're talking about the financial reforms the form one what does that do for us oh sorry when is the form one due for us my recollection is that they begin us to distribute those in the summer months mine is typically submitted by early July and you know that because I always said it is the last time I do before I go on my website all right so you usually see that in June they did change the policy of him with all respect added if I said what they've chosen the last two years they did change the policy administratively that they tend to send your specific form to your city registered email account when I say they I mean the commission on ethics and the state agency not they had any problem um and so you should be on the lookout for that as we get into June for that appointment if you haven't submitted by a certain big patty or somebody from the city usually start saying hey guys this is coming up get it in you know before July so they don't have late fees or start getting nasty grants about you know why aren't you buy them when you receive your form yet all right any other questions we're going to ask you okay nope all right so uh now we're moving on to the consent agenda this is IOS 11 through 15. this is for approval of the February 23rd 2023 city council work session minutes approval of March 6 2023

agenda so hopefully approval to consent agenda motion made by Mike table second by uh Frank Baker all in favor aye aye any opposed all right the consent agenda passes now we are on to the regular agenda item number 16. this is for consideration of resolution 2023.02 Mr Moore [Music] resolution 2023-02 a resolution of City fellow Beach Florida authorizing the issuance of the city's Capital improving Revenue no series 2023 in the principal amount of 2 million one hundred twenty thousand dollars improve to finance acquisition and construction Capital Improvements including Street reservancy and storm water facilities providing the note shall be a limited obligation of the city payable from non-alible or Revenue budgeting appropriated and deposited is provided here in provided for the right sanitories and remedies for the owner of the known authorizing certain officials and employees in the city to take all actions of priority connection with sale issuance and delivery such new making such determinations as they're required before the no Bank qualified status and Covenants and agreements in connection that they're with and fighting for an effective date this has been a reading of resolution 2023-02 by title loans Mr Mayor thank you before we get to see us in comments with the city managers like to summarize Hawaii temperature sorry so this is a resolution for a banknote um and we uh in the last work session presented with the five star water phases or projects that were part of our Master Plan update of 2017 the citizens advisory committee did a lot of work and Hazard who's here tonight um contributed into the projections of where the city was at financially and um you know there's been there's been a walk from residence to want to move these projects along the very important Initiative for the city so the assistant's Advisory Group took that on and uh and found a way that we can Finance all these projects and you know get them taken care of and uh you know move forward and at the same time with a plan to pay back this loan in an accelerated information thank you let's go to the citizens for uh comments on this particular version you would like to speak I guess good evening everyone my name is Kim Shaw Elliott I live at 121 9th Street very pleased to be with you tonight I am here to very strongly support the proposal I want to commend the city manager and committee that did this work that able to deal with a very complex issue and deal with confidence to be able to present to you a proposal that is critical and what's more important or fundamental to a city purpose purpose than to be able to provide the safe streets and things that so things don't float away which is kind of critical here it's timely we are facing many environmental issues right now and it's time that we act now and it's creative because it's brought a resolution to many issues that we have to deal with and it's doing it in a way that will actually bring some positive the end of it I won't spend a lot of time talking about what the benefits of this proposal are but in a quick summary what these proceeds will do is we'll give the city the opportunity to have better pricing so bidding one big job versus a bunch of smaller jobs is clearly an advantage he'll have more attention to more qualified providers and you'll be able to get a better pricing with that big bigger job you'll be able to provide for supplies maybe to do this involved rather than getting a bunch of serious a series of smaller jobs and it'll be able to accelerate completion of these critical repairs for just two years to finish all of our streets get it over with we don't know when the next big event will occur I think it's it's it's frightening in terms of what is impending and having our streets taken care of now is really really important and in the end of the day is going to give additional savings to the city in that we've had the opportunity to take advantage of some very favorable interest rates for the funds that will be sitting there so there are two things that I'd like to address about this proposal one is to make sure you're certain that it does adequately address the problem when we plan we need to plan for the future we're not going to recreate what has been done in the past or do what we think is needed now because we know the future will be different than what it is now and I would like to make sure that we take the opportunity to adequately address the needs of these flood control measures my understanding is that the proposal as it sits right now does not have any arrangement for any kind of retaining pool or or any kind of tanks that will hold excess water when it comes and if that's needed you need to address that now and not rebuild in a way that will already be proven inadequate so I would like to ask them to take them over to at least re-reassess and confirm what the needs for this project are and that they're taking care of now um the other thing is that I would ask that you prioritize 9th Street so 9th Street somehow was skipped over in the uh in the work that has been done to date 9th Street is the entryway to our beautiful Park here it's the parts it includes City parking it includes uh the back entrance to this lovely facility um 93 regularly gloves uh 9th Street I know has had property sales even rescinded because of the flooding that occurred right in the middle of a proposed sale so this is an important issue it's an important Street and I'd like to ask that you consider Ninth Street in this proposal thank you Michelle thank you yes hello my name is Fritz will 905 Harbor Drive and I can just say the same thing that Kim just said it's really necessary I tried for two years you would find an answer of why 9th Street or skipped in the first place and then what are what happened to eighths and seven streets what are what have you found out is it still flooding and I still don't know what you are really going to do to prevent the flooding um that those are questions that are still open otherwise I think we all agree that we have to do something especially in ice three I look at the end of Ninth Street and every time there is a flood and people are trying to collect the bags the syntax you know all all the trucks coming down the road they flood my front yard that is unacceptable so I thank you for the international World any other questions or comments yes Johnny is at 22nd Street I happen to sit on the citizens advisory committee and I speak very highly of this uh proposal one of the things that we also took into consideration when we contract or do two streets at a time you have the logistics of bringing in the equipment and then removing it it costs money that's factored in if we one of the things we looked at to do this successively was that would save a significant amount of money I think it was somewhere around 250 350 000 dollars just the moving equipment in and out of the city if we did it the way we're doing it now that's the issue with flooding inspection other folks have said before we're not going to solve it it's not going to go away we live on a Barrier Island the one thing it is a plus is the fact that these dreams that go out into the Intracoastal at the check valves so when you have a high tide it closes the valve and prevents the water from backing up and flooding it's just one of those things we're not ever going to solve the problem completely 100 of flooding it's not going to happen this will take care of it you know thank you thank you Mr engine we need more comments or questions from the citizens nope all right citizens comments are closed before we continue I'm going to make a motion to approve this resolution motion made by Frank Banker do I have a second I believe whatever I believe that's happened that way her hand would have any questions all right that's your Baker do you have the floor thank you I'm supporting this uh funding although replacing 70 year old pipes really never worked you're going to produce the same effects you're going to get the same effects unless we do this right you need to catch big balls a lot of homes in Harbor Drive when there's a place to put in we're not there that means the elevation of that discharge fight really needs to be raised up because it was check valves that we talk about they're nothing more than sunny day check valves when a high tide hung up on a sunny day order does not come in the street you're getting three inches of rain an hour or more that checked out closes not open until that time comes down I live on 8th Street George pipe was put in way before that house you know the houses were built and never elevated that pipe that means we have to wait about an hour and a half to two hours when high tide comes down for that about to open up to work actually accumulating more and more water because that wood will not move the street where does that order go in your yards hopefully not your homes so yes we need to solve the problem we don't need to solve a problem that these occur that created we didn't create 70 years ago we need to do it some more we need to spend the money smartly you also need like manset mobilization of equipment working in this field it'll cost you anywhere from 50 to 100 000 of moving equipment so you need to coordinate one street to be done and another screen to start right away if that appointment is moved out permitting cost is stowing the removal will cost us anywhere from fifty thousand to a hundred thousand dollars per Street or per project so when one Street's done we need to attack that next street we're going to have to find a contractor an award the same contractor to do all these projects because if we have contractor a and then we have to bring in contractor B we're already in the hole for medical position I think Mr American other comments nope all right vote now this is to approve resolution 2023-02 Miss Gentry would you please call the weather oh I'm sorry comment I've heard that the equipment that we're proposing to put it at the end of 9th Street in Clinton oh I apologize I'll come back you know what we're about uh we're about to vote on this uh Council would you like to entertainment please uh Cheryl gray 118 9th Street ballet beach one concern I do have and I parallels what Kim and Francis said earlier 9th Street is crumbling I've heard that the equipment we're talking about putting it in the parking lot at the end of Ninth Street to do that I'm concerned that we're going to see more crumbling I would really love to see parking over here and not take it down private streets that's my request thank you and that's the city manager referred to you loud and clear and uh three little big thing in consideration okay now let's go back to the phone call code pay council member Banker yes council member Livingstone yes councilman Otero yes councilman Robert signed council member stable all right vice mayor Shirley hi Mary Davis Hi so the resolution passes unanimously thank you all right we are on to item number size for consideration or coordinates 23-02 Mr Marvel instrument I was supporting this 23-02 on the first screen an ordinance of the city council the city of Bellaire Beach Florida amending section 58-38 lines and procedures to increase the fines associated with parking violations providing the modification separability and for an effective date this has been a Reading More Than This 23-02 by title only on first free Instagram thank you Mr Moore let's go 50 says comments on our support some comments and before we move forward I'm going to need a motion to approve D screen reading the passenger to make made by the Frank Baker do I have a second second model with Roberts Mr bank if you have before right now I'm looking to charge ten dollars per hour for part three hour match we're flying right now is 35 hours without me rocket science so would you rather spend 35 hours in park all day spent ten dollars per hour for three hours so this is well needed to be increased I think it should be moved because it just just makes common sense your favorite other comments from the council and I I agree with you also Mr Speaker all right so let's go ahead and take this to a roll call vote okay to approve ordinance 23-02 council member Baker yes council member Livingstone yes promotero yes councilman Roberts on it councilman disable aye vice mayor Shirley I'm here guys hi and so the ordinance passes unanimously and uh you are all prize for not over forever on the first reading Mr Mayor will come back in a second that's right I'm sorry all right all right so now we are on to item number 18 authorization of the city manager who advertised for Marina dock improvements this is placed on the agenda by city manager reefer uh take it away anywhere so over the over the years we have our pilings and our dogs facilities out at the marina and it's been wearing out through if there's way much and salt water and naturally leave over probably let's see the last 10 years I've been accumulating money for repair I saw a little bit of some spent time was after damage from Hurricane Irma but prior to that it was probably recruiting 2015 with an adult from Marine actually did an overhaul to the violence of the marina so we're getting the requirements to do it we did a comprehensive inspection there's 140 Marina pilings not all of them are City maintained 64 of them are the slope Runners that actually installed the web openers so that is their responsibility to feed them the remaining 76 miles out of the city's responsibilities these these function has a titles oracles and the sports and the catalogs we the especially shows where some of the patterns are fine just need to be cleaned and wrapped others that need to be completely replaced and then there was a recommendation let's see if blue squares which Institute are concrete contract I think that decision was recommended basically because the uh the pilings are going through younger they have a lot so I'm requesting an authorization so the council to go out to bid for the renovation that needs to take place at the marina like I said we have an accumulation of funding in front of 52 500 I'm expecting this project to cost somewhere between 30 000 35 000 um they don't want to bid out two two ways Blown Away um is to do the 30-day re-wraps that were recommended and then 38 complete Replacements so far and doing research and talking to the vendors I think to replace an options the other option but I also want to do some more recommendation of uh concrete yeah it's just the to weigh out the two options so that would be doing the 38 re-wraps 19 concentrate guys in the 19 replacements so yeah I included that Maria inspection report uh hopefully in time to look over it and then the other the other thing is that once uh once we get this figured out we want to share this report to each slip Runner and make sure that they're aware of the condition that they're all over the files thank you Mr reefer before we continue I would like to go to the census for comments on opportunity to item number 18. I used the comments are closed and now we're back to the council Council speak on this yesterday and ask that question can you explain to me what a concrete jacket is they they form around it I guess pop out the water and of course concrete are around the piling um so as we know concrete does absorb the water so it provides some protection to that file input I feel the brand new pressure treated complexities that are out there I just wanted the explorable for hours so what what's the anticipated life expectancy of a replacement versus a rewrap that's information number one together I mean I found that yet okay and do we know that the cost difference between the replacement versus the cleaning around um so cleaning the rabbi I believe the quote I got from the company that provided the inspection I think was around two to three thousand for for pilot and then a great replacement I want to say was closer to 7 000 and the economy check it was somewhere in between okay but yeah doing the re-wraps the cleaning of re-wraps it just provides a like a read um another form of protection around it so that it was over ones that aren't maturity okay it's not obviously I'll leave that up to you kind of but if if the um if the life expectancy is significant or replacement is compared to a wrap let me have the funding then maybe I would recommend them to go ahead and replace them all so we would have that done and completed now and not have to worry about them jacket which are underneath the the deck floors you know require a little extra weight pulling some doctor and Hardware of putting supports with them but you know it would be worth it if we expect the collector okay thanks any other questions or comments please okay uh I guess now [Music] what I don't think that I actually did the emotion I need emotion in this this island okay let me just leave it here do I have a second okay second by Frank Banker Leslie you had before it's obvious that Kyle has done his homework on this and knows what we're looking for and what to do and I think we need operations you go ahead any other comments nope all right so this is for authorization of the city manager to advertise for Marina dock improvements all in favor aye any opposed industry you are authorized to proceed thank you man all right now take a good shot for uh item number 19. the consideration of Merit pay increase for city clerk based on annual evaluation criteria a city manager briefly okay so um this you guys overall given the um the evaluations complete for City Clerk Patricia Gentry and um we've gotten all those in for the recommendations do you have the summary [Music] [Music] this was the first time that I've seen where we did not receive a summary score of the overall was mainly into the fact is that data available no I don't have that I can get that if you want to take this off I'm still waiting for one evaluation [Music] um so do you want to take it off and and I think I think it's it's fair that we are able to see all the schools and fancy uh how everyone rated you uh that's fine I hate to do that but what someone would like to but I I would do that if you retro for page from tonight I think that's fair enough I think that's fair enough I'll get all the evaluations together and put together a population okay well let me entertain a motion the table someone will make one motion the table to rent your own page for evaluation team second all in favor to table this one I I any opposed okay we'll we'll get this uh resolved next month and hopefully we can have these maybe for the next work session just so that we've got them and have ample time to review yes sir this is one quick question now so is there without a fixed payment that that this is supposed to be an annual married increase day for Advantage she has an anniversary gift that that America applies to sometimes when you do the voting evaluations they don't have their evaluation exactly on that date somewhere in that time period nearby in the air pressure okay so have we approved it tonight she would have gotten it then as a Believer it's the beginning remember the April 1st the your anniversary movies March 7th okay so it's more okay so it's based on your anniversary okay perfect okay thanks okay um let's do not let that happen again I feel a terrible but we have to we have to see everything [Music] it was my that I don't have that ready so please don't take any responsibility for that it's only I'm sorry I'm sorry oh no apology is necessary all right uh so now we are on to item number three which is consideration 2 support the nomination of Reddington Beach mayor David will as a representative to full Pinellas with a 10 Barrier Island communities what is for Pinellas or Pinellas is a land use and transportation planner agency they guide integrated transportation and land use solutions to sustain economic value by connecting the communities of Pinellas County and the Tampa Bay Region effectively they make it a lot of traffic and how it may or may not affect us there are other things that they are into but that's my biggest concern is traffic and where they Route traffic so before I go any further I would like to ask the citizens for comments anyone would like to comment on this topic the comments we'll bring it back to the council to continue this discussion I need a motion from the council was made by vice mayor Shirley who I have a second [Music] by Lloyd Roberts Vice versaille well clearly the beaches need representation um I am not a huge supporter of Ford Pinellas but I think that we just did the wrong and the do when it comes to for Pinellas I would love to see someone from our community be you know representation but and I don't know the mayor Bradenton Beach so I may be sleeping at a turn by saying he's a candidate but certainly some of the longer which part of exceed with me but the projection other problems where did I mean how did David will become a nominee okay so so let me give you a little backstory I normally allow everyone to do comments first but I'll kind of tell you what's going on for Pinellas they have so many seats they pick the four largest communities in the county and each one of those communities automatically gets seat the Barrier Islands all 10 of them only get one representative because we're tiny okay so I was on the nominated committee for a Big C and David will his name came it is a community it's much like ours they don't have businesses they have some private areas they they are over ran the tracking like we are we are also I've got to know David will pretty well and uh and I trust that I can have influence on David will and believe that he would look for into our best interest as he would his own because they're common in and this is really good for us because that's not always been the case normally our representative displaced by The Big C is always a tourism Community well this is the first time that we've had a representative who was not a tourism community more fairly represented here's a even deeper back story behind this also on the nominated committee it was not advertised but the the representative from the tourist Development Council was not reporting back to the big scene so also decided to to replace that that representative or delegate with a new one and I was selected to to attend the team or to be on the TDC so what does that have to do with us because we don't attract tourists well it's all about where the money goes it comes in from tourism and as you know we are all impacted by all tourism so we might as well have some impact on where the money goes and my number one goal will always be spend the money on renourishing on beaches so the first time we have a few people that are pretty much a private communities that that don't they're not Commerce communities representing the big city and I think it's going to be a great benefit [Music] the Barrier Islands to have it done this way so that's why I recommend that we move forward and approve David will any questions so how does the mechanism work from this point so once once we see okay so so what it is is that every Barrier island has or The Big C has delegates from each Community we need to be this Valley I'm the one vote however the way that I cast a hoe is if everyone agrees or we have a consensus that okay this is what's good for different in this case they're asking they're going to call vote at the next big c meeting and I will be casting official public representing Beller Beach in support of David mayor David any other questions or comments okay uh well in that case exactly very plainly just by saying all in favor I I have any appointments all right so I will confirm our vote at the state scene all right uh now we're on the item 21 there's a lot of these delegate uh delegate boats tonight so just bear with me as we get through them all the next one is consideration of selecting council members as voting delegates ultimate voting delegate number one and Alternate voting delegate number two for the Barrier Islands government Council known as The Big

section 38-87 of our city code to be presented and reviewed at our next work session with any citizens like to make you know they're shaking their heads just quickly cancel I need a motion to Brazilians a motion made by placing it here do I have a second second by Joey Shirley I just remember these areas you have before I think it's pretty clear that because we need to address this and um here it's like if I may please thank you um the issue that is in the agenda this evening concerns specific specifically section 38-87 of the city's code this issue came up not because of some kind of enforcement action or controversial event that's a place in the city but rather in response to an advocacy group bringing this to the city's attention the which happens from time to time I reviewed the code section at issue within what they inserted in a roughly four-page correspondence sent a week ago today the latest news a week ago uh is that the ordinance suffers various constitutional defects being void for vagueness and having content-based free speech limitations and unnecessary limitation around justifiable under strict scrutiny analysis restriction on freedom of Association and freedom unless about assembly they've asked that we respond to them by April 10th I will not suggest to you that they are going to sit either behind wait until April time to hear from us as evidenced by their advocacy in the last few days the former press releases and other ones that said having reviewed it I agree that the ordinance suffers defects and needs revision what those revisions look like I'd like a moment to to look at what is the what the language presently says and where this community wishes to go reviewing the history of this is almost like the language or at issue the language that is most at issue is 30 80 38-87 sub B which reads that no permits shall be granted by the city manager for the conduct of any commercial political or organized event by any person group or organizer that's not the only defective language if you will but the language that is most notable what's interesting to me about that is that this language came in in 2018 through Wardens number 1802 was saw at least ostensibly based on the minutes of the meeting at the time and agenda materials to address [Music] what at the time was various parties asking for to have weddings in city parks and bring chairs and other attendants elements that were perhaps congesting the public gathering areas I'm not sure how that issue morphed into that language but that was what the ordinance said before that the language came in of safari came in and ordinance 0-501 as part of an amendment to the city's code that was comprehensive in nature following this City's adoption of the city of manager form of government so all the references to the member or the council member overseeing this was changed to the manager and then before that language goes back to 81 based into your code's Origins on getting permits and so it's not uncommon to have ordinances requiring permits for larger Gatherings or gatherings in certain places with some kind of rational relationship to ensuring that we don't have five people so you know enough like people with five groups all agree with the same infrastructure at the same moment agree congestion or controversy that way and so we can manage our resources but we have to do similar there that is content neutral certainly number one that specifically targets political speech I would have shy away from that kind of language especially as we talk about we need to be yogurt and sign codes and the sort of analysis that goes with this free speech the point they've made in this advocacy group has made have made in passes or streets and sidewalks are traditionally considered public forum which is that is where your free speech rights are at their highest this seems to move in some degree in contravention of that so yes I would like the opportunity to amend this ordinance yes I can prepare something for your review at a subsequent Workshop or meeting my only request is if there's a specific issue that this community feels this language is addressing or resolving that I'd be aware of that so that I capture what you the legislators wish to do within the confines of the U.S Constitution Florida Constitution and statutes the one other thing I would add to this I'm not remembering the statutory site off my head there's a similar constitutional Challenge and being being lodged against the statute that was adopted in the last two years last legislative session as part of a Parcels of the Scott log act and that's not the language I'm making up that's um addressing protests and streets and and in response to some of the public discourse that happened in 2020 there was a statutory change on where people can gather and impede retards slows not traffic uh this I that is to say to the extent that was a concern of this ordinance there's a statute on coin whether or not that statute will support will sustain its own scrutiny as something else but I did what I wish to make sure you were aware of that context as well system this was about thank you Mr Moore you're on a deadline or we are on a deadline to responding to you yeah it's on April 10th if I'm giving your authority to draft an ordinance this evening what I would respond to them in within you know the next couple days would be correspondence directing them you know thank you for bringing this to our attention I received direction to amend this we attend them in this and into in so doing we tend to address any apparent constitutional defense legal issues which is to say if we're not at no point for what it's worth at no point had an interview of any record of inciting somebody for violating this they're no point do we have any record to my knowledge of any permits denied specifically because oh this is a political thing as some of you even mentioned to me inside conversations I'm pretty sure I did political sword on the city Side I've never had an issue so you know with that said I would respond to them and indicate that is to say that to the extent they reached out to us in the last week we have not once replied to them and said this is our ordinance you know get lost we're standing by it and it's fine all we ask for was the opportunity to review it and that's what we intended to right thank you we have uh we have three council members who are actually with either of you would like to just kind of explain why the coordination has changed I know it kind of kind of touched on it but you were there in you may or may not remember you were not there so you were not only on television you don't remember okay good answer okay well I just thought I'd give them the opportunity when anyone uh like to uh think about before we go any further let's see who makes emotion on this one or they would already do it I am so so lost there was a motion in the second gun that was open that's right that's right okay great okay I'm sorry I got completely caught it and then um okay all right so uh would anyone like to make any other comments so we all know why we're here and what what we're trying to do and they will know that we are responding to their request so um that being said uh all in favor [Music] okay I apologize for getting caught up at the moment there Mr Moore you're authorized to draft an ornaments to address section 38 and 1987. thank you Mr Mayor do you think it's possible we will have that draft file work session um remind me that is an expert session 17 uh that's a good experience today thank you sorry to burden you enough extra one over there all right now we are on to 2.5 p.m. Facebook I think uh most of the things that were we've been discussing work foreign [Music] has selected council member Livingstone take it away I know thank you all for being here this evening thank you Kyle for everything that you do for the city and and Patty as well we really appreciate you for sergeant for you extra is council member Notaro no comment uh Michigan Roberts you're up yeah I just want to make a comment um based on John's comment earlier in his New Hampshire so um as you heard from the city manager if he's setting up a meeting representative there was a comment made at the conclusion of our meeting last month that somebody had recommended you know maybe it's best to just let this issue go and not change anything I want everybody to know that that's not why I was elected any ever an opportunity to order something in the city I can tell you right now I I feel like you do that the current design of that system s is not a good good traffic pattern so I know there's better ways to do it and I'm confident that working with Kyle other City members um we're going to make it better and working with the county so there's improvements to be made and any final recommendation that we make minor City discussions uh just briefly as we begin at Holy Week yesterday we should all confessed Easter pray that all of our beach residents appreciate this special abuse of God and provide inspiration thank you Mr Whitaker uh yeah uh this past month we had a loss of a friend of many of us in the community and a family member of Joanne McIntyre just want to go up condellances to you Mr Mayor Wendy Michael and Mr Bob McIntyre as well she's wonderful yeah certainly um I know it's generated over time here but a lot of you out there are still here with us we really appreciate that and more importantly I want to publicly thank each of the council member of the council member Baker Livingstone Ontario Roberts wife mayor Shirley mayor guest for what you do I mean that was away the last week but you take time out of your family's lives to be here not only to be here but to prepare for the working sessions and everything else I just wanted to thank you also thank you Mr table so I'd just like to take a minute to thank um a local non-profit called Shepherd's Village it's a single family parenting program just open bridge and Melody gloves they sent a group of kids over here to City Hall from Indian Rocks School in New York's Christian Schools their missions week and they did quite a bit of landscape cleanup around city hall and tell us a little more about it but there's quite a pile of debris that I got to photograph of it they did a really great job and helped you know the community a bit um and then also I just want to thank all of our boards for giving us a part of the report it's nice to hear from everyone I appreciate it I appreciate everything that everyone's doing a little disappointed we didn't hear from Planning and Zoning again I know they have a project they're working on so it would have been nice for them to show up to the meeting today and um thanks for hanging in for guys appreciate it thank you for sure all right concerning reach nourishment this month I was able to meet on different days with county commissioner Crystal abala and the Pinellas Public Works director Kelly Levy they're both on board with 100 funding if the Army Corps will not touch commissioner County Commissioner Janet long Kelly Moody and any of our speech mayor cookie Kennedy met with representative Luna who has confirmed that she will approach the Army Corps from an environmental impact perspective see if she can gain any traction so far I've seen no evidence of any uh Beyond let's just keep our fingers crossed mayor Kennedy seemed hopeful at the last big c meeting but like that tells me that County funding and management are the only way that we will get sand anything so if that happens it will still take at least two years to communicate the project for the most part I would say that I've received very little pushback however let's see what happens whenever the whatever whenever they finally give us a final no we're not going to do this and you must get all your easements or else so we'll see how that goes but I have confidence with a little more influence on the TVC and more Pinellas we we may be able to turn up the pressure a little bit more and uh we'll see what happens so let's just keep the faith and wait and see as always I'd like to thank everyone who came out tonight as well as for those who are watching Wherever You Are Tonight do I have a motion to adjourn who's your journey secondary by Frank Baker second by Mike Sable all in favor aye any opposed all right good night everyone don't know"
