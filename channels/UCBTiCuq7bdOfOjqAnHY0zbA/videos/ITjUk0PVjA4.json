    "transcript": "good evening everyone welcome to the monday july 12th city council meeting for the city of bellar beach this was rescheduled from july 6th due to the storm before we rise for the pledge of allegiance um fellow city as i'm sure you're all aware uh on june 24th surf side florida experienced the horrible tragedy the champlain tower south collapsed as of today there's 94 people confirmed dead and 22 people missing so i'm going to ask that we rise and observe a moment of silence thank you pledge allegiance councilmember frank banker member glenn gunn council member leslie notaro councilmember rita swope vice mayor dave gattis mayor joseph manzo city manager lynn reeves city attorney fred riley here okay thank you um so the first item of business is the approval of the agenda on entertainment any discussion i have an item that needs to be moved the [Music] june 7th meetings are incomplete so i'm going to just ask that we can prove it to the regular objective taking all 30 seconds to explain what needs to be added but it has to be moved it cannot stay the way it is i have two ears that are infected right now it feels like i'm under water so please speak up tonight thank you robin in a second if you leave it the way it is it's illegal second okay it does mr riley if you were to approve this agenda if you've been elected so what would shall i do here i don't believe i have to entertain a motion well i'm sorry to uh you know for this uh for these minutes in this situation i can deal with it when we get to what's the basis for it to be on the area complete and they need something that's required by the law that's not in there i'm sorry i'm not following the train of thought okay the training is simple there's a required document that needs to be in these minutes and it has not been included by our clerk okay i'll second that it's it's okay okay i just want to understand what that means i knew this would counsel its own good seriously i don't care personally it's my paper that has to go in there so um all right i've got a second of my big guys um so the reason for the move is that there's something it's missing the formula that's required by law i don't know why it's not in here it's the second time it's happening it's with the minute book where the signed minutes are kept but it's not on our so what we're approving is it says it needs to be in the minutes and the minutes that we have do not have it so no i was just telling you where it was okay so as long as we have the stipulation that is going to be in the final ones i'm okay with that but that's required by law i'm going to ask if the clerk will stipulate to that we can leave everything alone i will stipulate today it will be included so that's the one day that's the recusal statement from last count succession okay approval of victor any further discussion citizen comments counsel all fair eye approved next move to item two citizen comments each speaker has three minutes to come up to the podium here please address the council you have three minutes to speak to us on any non-agenda item if you wish to speak on an agenda item later on you can get to that point and i will ask again for citizen comments on that item so if you go out of the water i'll just ask you to sit down until you until that letter comes back up there's conduct on the desk we observe that code of conduct so if you come up and speak with us please do the same would anyone like to address the counselor john hansen john hanson 22nd street another beach mr mayor council members at last month's council meeting accounts debated at length and ultimately passed a resolution distancing itself from a certain lawsuit brought forth by a member of the council and the citizen of the city during the discussion a council member questioned why the city had not requested or an injunction in the interim until this thing was resolved or came to court for resolution so that the citizens could enjoy the privilege to benefit of beach access on belair shore he got no response during citizen questions and comments i approached the podium ask the same question i did not get a response either i understand for as many years as i've been coming to these meetings i may not necessarily or a citizen necessarily get a response at the same meeting the question is posed but now it's been over a month i've heard nothing so i asked the question again why hasn't the city filed an injunction against the city of belair shore so that we can use the beach and even just the beach area in the parking areas and on a separate subject i just want to pay a compliment to the city manager the public works staff for keeping the beaches clean with all this mess with red tide and fish and everything else my wife and i enjoyed the beach on the fourth of july on our beach and it was very nice to go out here and see of clean beach we all do an outstanding job so mr lynn if you would share that please do thank you thank you mr nancy mr riley i have the uh authority to refer this matter and refer this matter to you i'm not going to comment on it we have litigants in the room and potentially not going to be breaking into this lawsuit in this room i'm not going to comment on it you can feel free to comment if you'd like now you don't have to comment at all but i do have the right to refer it to you so i did see that this had come up but again i'm not going to say why i'm not doing that okay well i i will make one or two comments one comment i'll make is the city was not named as according to the lawsuit because the city wasn't named as according to the law the lawsuit the city has not participated in any way shape or form in the lawsuit and neither of the parties have motioned at the court to have the court brought bring the city in as a indispensable party and although i personally know of the lawsuit's existence i have not gone over it i you know hear important things about it and i'm not going to comment on the merits of the case at all yeah because it involves several people one of which is a member of the city council and they i've said well at the meeting last month i said that the individuals that serve on the city council have their uh certainly are here in the representative capacity as an elected official but they also have the right as an individual to pursue a lawsuit or to vindicate their rights if they so choose and they've so they they've chosen and uh you know at this point i i want to identify the city code provisions about the discussing perspective litigation [Music] and that's that's really all i would like to say about it okay thank you the other citizens like to address the council so you know other hands up closer to some comments and move to the presentation by the pinellas sheriff sheriff are you prepared to make this presentation tonight okay please come up good evening for the month of may the bellar beach journey for the record oh i'm sorry corporal curling for the month of may there were zero for the ucr property in person crimes there were two people arrested in the entire city there was a total of 734 events of the top three house checks director controls and traffic stops and there was only one crash in the entire city that was along the uh beller beach causeway and there was also 142 citations and warnings issued for the entire city sure if we had a month of zero crime you can't get any better than that so again my thanks to the men and women of the sheriff's office um i have one observation i want to give you i went to the beach recently in bellar beach and a large group of individuals open containers of alcohol glass bottles doing it for hours on end no enforcement whatsoever and the sheriff came and i saw him go we were quite a ways away but some go up by other shore to i don't know what he was going to tell you the truth but he went and he left but he didn't come to the right side and start working his way down that they were well behaved i would say but class bottles corona you know i like it too but i don't drink it on the beach so i'll just point it out to you in terms of if you're out there you know if it's happening it was called all day long and they weren't bella beach people i think they were condo landers or something but that's what's happening out there so if we could just maybe keep an eye on things absolutely i'll pass that information along anyone else on the council citizens any comments from the sheriff thank you sheriff thank you mom excellent item four as the board reports we have ordered the just new board of records park and recreation and planning and zoning we'll start with board of adjustments kelly mike kelly 2740 hibiscus drive board chairman the board of adjustment um the best quarter the board had a really active quarter um two of our regular members resigned in april and thanks to the council you put back mark beam and many put back jane coleman in june and we added an alternate gerald was wet whizzo watty um who attended our one and only variants that we did have last month in june it was a full board plus an alternate new residents of the city needed something similar to what you did dave and what fred had with backyards that affected waterfront and wednesday's event the board granted the variance it was good discussion and the board members are getting more and more familiar and more experienced so i thank you all for filling our board i'm glad we have an alternate and we still have one opening for another second alternate which um i know one of the regular members has their house for sale down the street from you mr mayor i don't know if you sold me yet he was in attendance at our meeting in june but should he sell his home and leave bella beach we haven't altered it on board so busy busy quarter and i thank you all for following our vacancies mike thank you um i have a question for you i know you take the course not too long ago with some of your newer members now it looks like you've got a lot of new members here um and yes you're correct i don't believe that house is sold yet at least as the other day but um uh you thought maybe you could give another class an idea because when you look at the two that you appointed as our regular members one was mark beam who served with you on council he certainly be on the board of adjustment before he was on council so he he stepped right in he gave him a playbook and he was ready to roll jane goldman who's been involved in the city for years and years and years hit the ground running and she too had no problem with it mr hollis of all the people that ironically didn't attend the training session is the gentleman who has his home for sin so he did well at the meeting and you know the strengths and the experience of the other people is what's going to make this make this a click so it was a good it was a good quarter also any questions for not kelly citizens we have any questions thank you again thank you mr mayor thank you council park square hi everyone um i'm team luvenda i'm the chairperson of the park and rec board i actually have my whole board here with me this evening so um which is very nice we have three people right now um nicole sessman is here she's our new secretary anora kodak who you all met at the last meeting and voted on she's our new vice chair and then george ortel who i believe he's been on the last however many parks and rides work he's our historian so we do have one board opening and we have two alternates opening which are always posted and we're always looking for help because we too we've um like i mentioned during the last i think i started last september we have just been slowly acclimating new activities into our calendar so if you look online we still have the yoga and the paddle board we just um the blood drives and then we just started with the beach cleanups so august 7th they're always on the first saturday of the month we meet at 19th street they're growing month by month so we welcome volunteers to come we met some new members of our community last month which was very nice to see them come out and help out so we just kind of meet at 19th street and we go both directions and just gonna clean up so that's good um in the springtime i mentioned some of you were here some of you weren't we were talking about doing a couple of events oh sorry yeah so um we talked about doing three different events in the spring was one and we were looking at jazz in the park and because of covid and we really didn't want to have to wear a mask outside we kind of moved everything to the fall so there was a little bit of confusion i'm not sure i'm just going to give you a little bit of detail because everybody was pretty pointed on like you know their suggestions or their concerns about how this would be run so i just wanted to give a couple of um points and then i'll answer any questions and then i'm not sure it's like there needs to be a vote um speaking with lynn reeves i guess before like historically like things like this if they were small community events they didn't need to be voted on but i love all of your like um support and approval on this so just a few things that we talked about and we pretty much discuss it at every single meeting just to make sure that we have we want to be buttoned up and we want to make sure that everything is addressed but some of the biggest concerns that were presented to me either during the meeting or after the meeting was the fact that if we want this to be a better beach private party residence only is not open to the public it will not be advertised as such so like the residents will be invited individually like by a little postcard mailer and there will be no signage no newspapers no magazines nothing like that we will have a detailed parking plan we will have an officer on site and every single detail of the three events that we're looking at for september one in october which is the pet and fifth grade and then a little christmas like holiday social all of those are very in detail coordinated with all of city staff meaning kyle and lynn and patty so there's really nothing that we do or talk about like we kind of do research give the suggestions and then everything that's carried out as far as like i don't even buy the donuts for the beach cleanup like kyle orders those and pays for them and then i pick them up so like they're managing with us every detail so just to make sure that we're all like on the same page and there's no surprises and no one is being um you know like at the last minute going oh my god how is this managed what are we going to do with this so that being said i i don't know if you have questions about it the the jazz in the park we're looking at saturday september 25th from 5 to 8. we will not have we're maybe looking at one like italian ice vendor but for the most part we're leaving all the parking places open for residents you know we're encouraging if you can walk if you can ride your bike if you can carpool or whatnot because we don't want like the causeway jammed up we just want like a nice even flow and we'll just have room for everybody in back low-key simple um we'll be selling like you know the bella beach t-shirts and tank tops beach towels one of you we're kind of looking for a license plate that we used to have in the past so we're you know still working on those things as we speak so we'll have some nice things that residents can buy if they want no pressure obviously but otherwise it's just like a nice event to get to meet people and listen to some music and and be in a good pleasant atmosphere so i i don't know a lot of people on the north and i would love to meet some more because i know our neighbors are great and i would just love to meet more people and that's all that the board is hoping to find or you know to do with this event but all of us actually so but if you have any questions or if you guys want to is it something that you would vote for i mean as far as okay perfect [Music] [Music] can you provide that to city council because that's one of the things i have consistently asked for is some type of a plan you know granted if you're not going to tie up you know our streets or parking you need a parking plan but as far as your budget dollar amount you're going to spend your safety plan your you know plan to use the city personnel and what aspects you can put together a plan for us i would really like that because that's one thing i've wished for over a long time i also wanted to say i have received a lot of good feedback about the beach cleanup and the blood drive and so you can definitely put me on the list with each thing on and i've talked to quite a few of them and they are so appreciative of that part as well as the uh blood job so much about the exercise because there's lots [Music] just great feedback from thank you for appreciating that so that i'm very appreciative and i wanted to make sure i told you that so if you could just give this a plan that's the only thing else i'm looking for so as a plan for each event [Music] okay and we actually do already have that in place so like um it's on a spreadsheet that kyle has and probably lynn has as far as broken down by what we need what it will cost what not the way we've been discussing it and then maybe you can help me out with this is like our our budget has already been approved and then so on the spreadsheet is like basically how some of it will be broken down and then it's been approving it um but we do have that on spreadsheet i could get it all you know patti can email it to you tomorrow and because we're not having vendors or anything like that like we have the parking like layout is from past events but there's no street parking so i know that was a big concern and there's no vendors there's there's not going to be a whole lot going on to take up space so it'll just be for porky for residents and i'm going to encourage everybody to get their parking stickers because you know it's it's another way for like when the sheriff is looking here sorry he knows your president because you have your seeker on your mark without having to id people before we get too far along with this let me be the voice of some of them have something internal controls i don't know what mr reece told you but i know what we've done in the past and in the past we had this council approved the events now maybe i'm missing something i may okay and i don't remember every single item that comes by us but i think the last thing that we did was clear the slate with prior operating budgets dates all that kind of stuff so i think that is something we have to do with our council although the money's in the budget it doesn't mean that there's no city events unless this council approves it that's not going to hurt you the city manager you've been down that road already with um uh city-wide garage sales that he's been called out twice like it has to come by council for the council here to approve it i think we're going to approve every one of these but it does need to come up to council just for your protection and yours in the cities um and you know making sure we have insurance and everything else that's officially stationed here i don't remember us doing that and if i did then somebody refreshed my agent or a year ago did we ever approve the events for this year no no but it's july and the events aren't until like the end of september so like that's why i'm just kind of giving you some more detail that i really um we touched upon it last time but when everybody came to me with questions and concerns i wanted to make sure that i had the answers to those which we definitely have and it's all written down and then if you can um maybe because i'm not sure can we vote on these tonight yeah here's the game plan okay if you can you certainly can send everything out to council in advance if you have everything i think that would help because this way we have the information we already know the events i think you're talking about jason park in september there's a trick-or-treat thing with books and stuff okay and then there's one other event there's the um holiday social like a christmas tree lighting like before one of the council meetings like the first monday december so if you could just put together something on that or give it he will put it on the august agenda and then we will pass this in august and then you have full council support and blessing of course if it doesn't pass we have to do anything on it it's going to pass my only concern is just that we track the budget on this week last time we made sure we track what asia that does my only question for you with reports with parking in jazz in the park you said you're not gonna have street parking what happens when this spot fills up where did people go um i if it was only 35 cars what it's only 35 cars oh kyle said we have 70 parking places so this one i'm sorry yeah so we have 70 and you know if it was me and i came late and there was no parking i would if i really wanted to go i'd either walk take my stuff home and walk or i would get an uber i mean there's and we're going to encourage that we don't want that but we think we have enough parking if we filled this parking lot i would be very happy you know to the people that are walking and riding their bikes if we had that many residents in attendance i i would be thrilled um so yes um it sounds to me like parks and rec is uh very organized uh congratulations this is uh very refreshing uh hearing this it sounds like you're uh you're playing things out very well just get the formalities cleaned up so that we can vote on it i think if we had this two weeks ago we probably would be voting on tonight right okay now i understand thank you um are there any other questions in regards to this let me run that you know sure i'll answer the questions and then i'll get did anybody else have questions i'm just concerned on what councilman trump said about parking in the streets dabbling into closing this or opening the streets up in the parking via seven spots i mean he always departed 6th street 12 streams however if it's a real big success and i'm not big on the government on entertaining citizens and we were looked at like having psta uh giving us a short bus just hitting a couple of streets you don't understand i'm not sure i can look into that i don't think it would be that costly but i don't want to see the streets being opened up no they won't be and that was one of the biggest and loudest concerns that people had were street parking and if there used to be emergency access vehicles and all of that so we weren't doing that which is also why we're not doing vendors because they would take up half of the lot if they had their everything set up so but like the other concerns like just like the garbage and the recycle and like my board is small there's only four of us right now hopefully we get to our seven but um with a few volunteers which i know will have we pretty much won't have to ask the city for anything other than like you know what they would normally take out the garbage but we're going to do the setup we're going to man the tables which there are only three we're going to have a hydration station a first aid station and then like i said we'll have like a little table off to the side with our bellow our beach wearables or whatnot um and then we'll have to clean up so we're really not asking the city staff because i know they're you know they have a lot on their plates now so like we're not doing any more than we can manage ourselves if that makes sense like did you hear anything about restrooms and that group of things the inside ones any questions thank you very much we'll see you back in august and you can send us anything you have in the meantime i i would plan on these events going through so just continue and thank you the rest of the park sport for working on this appreciate it thank you mayor um i'm sorry my my microphone isn't working but i did want to let you know that chair enfeld said that he did not have a report so he didn't [Music] this is consideration of ordinance 21-03 an ordinance of the city council in the city of baltimore beach florida providing for the amendments to section 2 desk 245 e8

here with and providing for an effective date this is the second and final reading this is the this what this ordinance is about is consideration of the board's recommendation of recommended amendments to the city code regarding administrative procedures including authority for expenditures i'll entertain a motion uh no this is uh basically second time around nothing's changed i have one question um page two we changed these numbers last time i'm not if this may be correct or it may not appear correct somebody tell me um section 4a says the city manager shall establish an administrative policy setting for the procedures for obtaining pricing for expenditures up to ten thousand dollars but this is the section that deals with expenditures up to five thousand is that the way it's supposed to be or is that a typo i know we were changing these last time this didn't generate this question yeah it's just actually it's just saying i have to establish a policy for five to ten thousand that's all i'm saying well if that's the case then the next page talks about you establishing policies up to ten thousand dollars so it's something's not it doesn't seem right that's a procedure to give these two bids that's what that procedure is for okay and if it's in the approved city budget i can do that and that's the way the other term so the 5.5 the 10 000 is correct yes

price for the regular annual one and then there's a price for a single audience this single one of an optional thing no it's uh no the single audit is if you get 750 000 worth of federal funding in the year and that's highly unusual although this past year i'm not sure uh because of the cares act that some of our clients are actually going to cross the threshold realizing that 750 000 of expenditures so we do that in addition to our regular audit because of the extra if you receive that and and spend it in the year okay so what if you spend it over two years if you if you're below the

we addressed last time i was here i just kind of refreshed everybody's memory on those the two items i think that were a concern was the illumination and the impact that would have on neighbors the second item of course was cost so let's go over the brightness just to kind of get the impact on that again as you know like i referred to last time the sign comes with automatic reduction in looms based on the atmosphere meaning night day cloudy days it also has the ability to override that so if you feel that that isn't sufficient you can override it to whatever lumens you see fit also to remind you that should a neighbor say man this is just too bright at midnight you have the ability to put it on what we call a sleep mode it's essentially let's say from 10 at night to 6 in the morning you can totally put it in sleep mode which means there's no illumination there's no directory there's no verbiage on it at all and then at six o'clock on a scheduled platform it will come up again so if you have any of those issues you can't bear on a sneak pop so that would address any of those concerns of the neighbors who feel might be too bright at any time at times the other issue of course is the cost and i think if you look well first of all let's go with let's go with where i handed you out has anybody referred to mr robinson over at red asian shores has him [Music] what we're looking at that site is about the same size um as the one that i'm proposing um that sign is a three foot five by seven foot nine okay so that's the size of that sign and i think the sign that we're proposing is a 3.2 by 6 foot so relatively the same size so if you've gone by there you kind of see the impact uh they run theirs on auto so it's predetermined based on like i mentioned the light of the day night 50 days whatever um if you look at some of the photos that i've sent to you passed out those are just some of the items that they've displayed on their sign i've given you a night and a day representation so you can kind of see uh get a plan hurricane seasons november 1st november 30th do you have emergency access permits issued here and then i also gave you one that showed what if you didn't want color you just wanted to go with the red and you can do that even if it's a red green blue color display and they've done both you can do that as well no personal property allowed from the beach one hour after sunset until hey so those are just some of the items that can be put on this display i know just listening to parks and rep some of the issues they brought up park openings agendas private parties the jazz at the farm all those things would work well on this display so people driving back and forth going to publix going to their home all they have to do is look at the sign and they are exactly what's on the agenda so that's a very good illustration of what the sign can do just with the aspect of the community also the blood drive very important is there any questions uh other than uh let's go over the let's go over the uh the money the cost you've got two options so essentially you've got one which is well let me just say the difference between the two what we do is reduce the base we're going to have a concrete base the block similar to the building we've eliminated that we've done a stucco finish that sort of highlights the concrete if you look at the illustration it's got some lines kind of indicating grout lines but it's all painted and stucco so that was one of the things we changed the other thing we changed which we took off that wave top and i know a lot of you like that so what i did in the proposal i gave you an extra cost to add on um it's about a four thousand dollar add-on and if you look at the two options i've indicated the cost width without so you've got those numbers in front of you uh the difference between option one or a and option b is how we address the verbiage at the bottom community center you've got one that's channel letters that are illuminated you've got one which is a push through letter that has kind of a glow around the letters but it's not a channel letter it's just a push through out of the base so it's a very it's multi-faceted it's very nice and it gives good visibility either one so the only two options you have here just to show difference in cost if you wanted to reduce it a little bit more the visibility in what you're seeing is the same it's going to say community center it's going to be lit uh the main difference is you're going to get you're going to be eliminating the wave and you're going to be eliminating the plot phase for a stucco either one of those very viable doesn't really change other than the way it doesn't really change the overall dimension or the look of the sign if you want to go with the way you add on additional funds but in either event it's much lower than what we initially uh presented so we cost valued this and it became a very good very good option pretty long so what i want to do first you're finished with your hand presentation i want to see if we have any questions on counsel then i also want to see if there's any questions from the city these will just be questions while he's here then we'll have the debate on the council and we'll get our personal opinions and so questions you've got uh photographs of the digital sign of indian shores well i put that one in there only because it's a digital display it's full color and i just wanted to show you what another side would look like we did the one and ready for shorts we did not do the other reddington uh instructions but i wanted to show you the difference between just an electronic board it's much bigger without some of the you know decorative features just a plain board and that's essentially what it is now the photographs keep in mind these are photographs of a digital display it's not really representative exactly what you're going to see it's going to be much clearer photos don't really take well with digital displays but that way i just showed you another option down the road uh if you wanted to go by there and look at that um you know that's something as well just just another option of visibility okay so what you were trying to point out was just the plane digitally this way versus so my question is is having to drive by both sides and look at them i find the indian shores going to be a little more subdued so is that can you program something to define some dude uh well it's just not as loud and bright so i guess maybe it's a choice of colors it very well could be turned down or they have they very well may have turned it down as well because you have that ability to do that so i can't really answer your questions specifically because i don't know what they did but it could be the colors um it could be the board i don't know what led board they use they could have used a different manufacturer obviously that i'm not aware of and you know the manufacturer has it's different but we talked about mints which is the brightness and their knits may be a lot lower which means it wouldn't be as bright but it wouldn't last as long either so there's a lot of variables um i don't know exactly what they did but you do have the internal agent chunking down i want to make sure everybody's aware of that so yeah so two more questions one is they've got indian shores has this beautiful monument sign it's almost a piece of environment it's a sculpture and my thinking is they put that in front of a community center a long time ago what was the time frame when they decided to install a digital sign because obviously something changed where they said maybe there's a need for you know i don't know because we didn't do that and if you look out if you go past you go south where that intersection is going to park there's another very decorative similar display that they have there um it's a sculpture type art art piece um and i don't know uh with the time frame between the two did they obviously separate them because they didn't want to obstruct the art pieces so last question is the options if you were to go back and talk about the original proposal right the swoosh on the top what kind of lettering did it have did you have the routed letters or did it have the chat challenge it had the challenges because aesthetically that's more pleasing is that it's a matter of case i mean some people like the channel letters preferably i would like to do the robin only because channel letters have a little depth to them so when you're driving at an angle that depth sometimes you know you don't see this you have to almost go by when you see it because of the depth and sometimes uh take away some of that you know visibility where the router is about a half inch sticking out from the side base itself so it's a little bit close to that sign base and it gives it kind of a glow because it's routed and it's pushed through with that rich acrylic and what we do is we fire glaze the ends so that it does illuminate like it glows so that's it's a nice look so i think you'd be happy with either quite frankly any other questions yes sorry only the auto sensing sure mechanics sure is that completely fixed that functionality or is the overall range of auto adjustable so if you're saying well let's go back the auto adjustability is based on the the light so you know looking upright it is it automatically adjusts accordingly and i can't tell you if it's down four knits or five minutes just depends but you can take that and you can i think i'll answer your question you can alter that so that it's lower whenever you want it to be lower okay so if you can have different breeds on its own i set the variable of the highest and the lowest right and and so that it will still take into account yeah from being heard perfectly answers that question um i uh i did ride down there and take a look at the sign and what i noticed is the brightest periods are basically whenever they wanted it to be bright they selected certain photos that were backdrops and it was wide open but then there were other i watched it for about 10 minutes and there were other messages that were very subtle they weren't very bright and it was acceptable uh so i think really it's uh it's all in the in the hands of whoever is controlling it as to what it's going to look like it is and remember like i told you last meeting um i think it's once a week on a tuesday you can hook up into hilco and they have a period of time and you can answer ask questions you can get their tech service you can go through an actual kind of schooling process where they'll teach you how to schedule things and that's you can do that anytime you want so it's not like i gotta do this next month and then you're on your own you can do this whenever you feel the need thank you any other counsel questions [Music] that particular unit is three foot five by seven foot nine so that gives you a kind of difference it's three foot five to your 342 a little bit smaller there's a seven foot nine to your six foot a little bit narrower so it's gonna have to be smaller the font can be adjusted the font is not predetermined so you can adjust the font in other words if you want to say let's get any of these have it on there too let's say for instance 6 17 am you want that to be profit you can do that very large and then 78.4 you can do that smaller so you have the ability to change the font on anything you want you have the ability to add lines based on the size and font so if you have a lot of verbage you can change the size together all on one display what my question pertains to is how much can you put on that sign you're traveling 35 miles an hour you're going by the side that's 51 feet per second right because these people are seeing the speed limit so how much are you actually performing for resonance well it depends on how much you have on the side i mean obviously more verbage is smaller smaller copy and how long you have it on you know so you can vary that as well you can have it on three minutes if you want or whatever yeah all right any other council questions city manager any questions secretary attorney citizens questions only this is not for opinion question yes yeah come on up give them the name and then um and by the way the way i'm gonna do this is if you ask a question you can come back up for an opinion this is just to get questions right now it's information jules chandler hibiscus drive west um i think you would mention am i correct that there was a spotlight where you were going to illuminate the base of the sign yeah yeah impression or understanding that we were going to eliminate the base the stucco part and if that was the case i thought if there's nothing there why would we distract detract from the actual sign and uh the or two is does the sign face gulf boulevard or would you be able to see it at an angle coming down or as you're right in front of it do you have to look quickly so those are my two questions thank you thank you mike all right to answer the first question um it's not spotlight what's what's illuminated um i don't think you have probably the copy of the sign what's illuminated at the base is the copy that's illuminated because there's no there's no spotlights on the base whatsoever the illumination comes from the letter so you can read the lettering um to answer your second question we originally designed it at a triangle like a v shape but cost was a cost prohibited so we made it so that's perpendicular to to the causeway any other citizen questions john hansen john hansen 22nd street my question isn't to the vendors to the council in the event we lose power paying the power for emergency science when we don't even have generators for this building and this room that we're in right now is quote unquote a temporary shelter staff can't even work so that's the question for you all thank you and thank you mr anthony that question is going to be addressed just but i want does anybody have any other questions for mr vogel because he's up here no other citizen questions any last round of council questions we have before we debate this okay thank you can i respond to this question sure i'm going to look into that because that is a good question i'm going to see what hyogo has as far as a backup for that sign if i remember correctly there is something that will keep that sign on during the hurricane um and i will get back to you on that but i don't know right now as he correctly stated we have no generating capacity so right now i think my answer to him would be it will be going dark but if there's another alternative and i know about it i think there is an answer yeah i think there is and i'll get back to that all right now that everyone and you're not going to leave us right you're going to still be here because i have a feeling with the debate there may be more questions that get generated this is like the highlight item of the night okay so now i'm going to open it up to council debate starting with glenn gunn because he had the floor you don't have to sit up there if you don't want to you can okay whatever you want please feel free i'll save my comments again you can do that any other council comments yeah i just wanted to make a few um obviously the communications committee recommended having a sign for having this type of sign and we've had a number of citizens that have emailed against it a number that have been yelled for it but i would like to say that i have spoken with a number of people in our community especially over the holiday events and parties and et cetera and a lot of people are in favor of it but sadly they just did not want to take my advice to send an email because they honestly stated that they would put a target on their back so i think we should go with the communications committee's recommendation uh we have beat this can and kicked this can down the road for a while since at least october 2020 somewhere in there and i'm just ready to move forward with it johnson i have also heard from a lot of people i also read all the emails and responded and to kind of summarize some of the comments some people are saying we don't need it because if you're going to use it for emergencies we all have cell phones and you know tvs we know there's a hurricane coming so you don't really need it to tell you that the city website has all the informations on meetings and events like the parks and record person came here and saying all these events you want to keep at bellar beach residents only so the last thing we want to do is advertise jazz in the park on this blinking board while all non-residents go by and say hey i want to show up and then now we're kicking them out of our event and then that's going to look bad in the city the survey that they did prior to the communication board was strongly for email communication to the residents not signage and obviously this i'm just summarizing residents have said i've also heard that nobody knows what this building is because the sign is down so we have no idea that this is a community center so that's a pro for the sign to give us information on this building some people have said we need to move forward into the next century with technology such as digital sign as opposed to the old sign where somebody had to go out there and put it up my only comment is i'm kind of in the middle i don't know which way that's kind of what this debate is for to help me decide which way to go because i want to represent the residents if we do decide not to go with this sign then my suggestion would be for that four thousand since one of the big questions was what the heck is this building for is to use that four thousand dollars and put community center on this building like right in front on that little rounded area because that would solve a whole bunch of those problems honestly i see both sides so i'm having trouble with this one so nothing against you you're not as beautiful and i appreciate the adjustments you did and if money wasn't an issue you'd probably go for it but yeah guys help me decide so let me hear your opinions mr vogel and i i think i've been pretty consistent with this first off i thank you whether you get this or not you get a tremendous amount of work it's a beautiful sign okay it's engineering and look um it's just not something that's for me i just don't think it's for this community [Music] we pride ourselves when it's convenient sometimes would be this traditional 1950s you know aussie and area kind of community we don't have businesses we're you know all residential and then we're going to go and put a very modern sign and i got an email this morning i think all the council members got the same one which showed a whole bunch of cities bigger than us that communicate i think as well if not way better than us they don't have these kind of signs some have been a sign of all and i agree with robin hockey and memories had a proposal for this a monument sign similar to what we have when you enter the city that says welcome to bella beach you could say beverly beach community center i i really wonder if you don't know what this building is like maybe you're new to bellaire beach but i mean this is the community center i hope that people have figured that out but we certainly could put letters on the side of the building if that's the case i don't think it i just don't like the the digital aspect of this i don't think mr hansik's excellent point there is the lights go out first off when the lights go out there shouldn't be people here um so we're you know playing to the people who stayed that didn't follow instructions but beside that i mean i think they're you know the lights can be out for a long time too if you look at some you know panama city when it got devastated those lights didn't come back and you know you could put a honda generator outside but they're chained down because it may not be there when you come back you know that might go with the next guy going over the bridge um it's a nice sign but it's i just don't think it's for our community i do i do value the aesthetics of this community and i'm also worried on a slippery slope kind of argument that we put up a sign outside of this community center and then the condo association wants one because it'll help them advertise their rentals and then the motel wants one and then some resident living on causeway says i want one too because the governor just signed a thing that says you can have home-based businesses so why not have a little advertising business we're going to cheap in a city i remember dave yes i remember this quote well when we were talking about just the little campaign type signs that we were saying that um you know they would have to stay up longer than just election season and people have a right to put them in their front yard and he said well there goes the community and you know there's something to that i mean there's a law that says we have to let you do it but you know i gotta say that the community looks a lot prettier without those signs so i just don't think it fits in i think it sets a slippery slope for everyone and i'm not gonna be for it but i do thank you for all i was asked to present it so whether you want the electronics or not i understand i understand your viewpoint i appreciate it for the mentality of what you have here i understand that perfectly again i'm not trying to sell you electronics um so that being said the generator thing i would almost tell you right now it will work internally each january because i think one of the things my brother or michael robertson liked about it was that when there was a hurricane the sign was on and it showed people kind of the way to go uh but that's up to you guys that's totally your call um uh the other aspect of it but i'm just gonna put this out here uh either here or there but if the condo association wants to let me complete a different way you can generate revenue on that sign by other people wanting to put information on that sign and i understand it wouldn't necessarily be validated it would be i don't know but you could charge revenue for them to put messages on that so that's a way to get revenue to offset the possible sign so it happens all the time so that's something to keep in mind as well uh but aesthetically again i'm here to answer your questions to present what i was asked to present if you want me to come back and give you a quote for a set of letters on the building glad to do that we we're custom sign manufacturing because it's 45 years so we can do anything you ask us to do and obviously you know our costs are reasonable so you know i'm here to abide into do whatever you guys want me to do but i do think this is a beautiful sign and if you know i think there's a lot of value in it okay thank you um like did you want to go get your hand up first your passing okay i'll go ahead and speak then and frank gotta be next i'm not sure the comments about being stuck in the 1950s mentality is representative of this entire community if i drive around and i look at some of the signs for some of the other community centers bel air blossom they look like signs from my 1970s high school okay this this whole digital sign thing was recommended by the communications ad hoc committee comprised of residents and speaking for the residents it aligns with our vision and our strategic plan and our vision for what a premier city looks like it's been budgeted beforehand this wasn't a surprise thing we were planning on replacing the site long ago and started building the reserves for a long time and we also have the opportunity to leverage money from the insurance companies that will pass if we don't make a decision in a timely manner the useful life of this sign i would anticipate is going to be the 10 15 20 year time frame so i mean this is a statement we are making about what belair beach is all about it's the first thing you see when you drive into bellar beach it's the last thing you see is you exit the very beach and i think the original proposal and the alternatives are very tasteful artistic things and is in keeping with technology i would be willing to bet that everybody in this room has probably purchased a car in the last five to ten years and we embody cars to match our ideas and aesthetics and what we want to represent ourselves with we also go over the top to purchase technology and have the things that make make driving the car easiest and keeping us in touch with what's going on around us so i think you need to put some of that stuff into perspective i mean you buy a car you probably spend more on your car than your car is going to last five to ten years the average car in the road today is 11 to 20 years old this time for the last 15 to 20 years it has a lot to say about baylor beach i think it makes a statement that we are a premier city again if you go around and look at some of the other city halls you're looking at signs with slip-in letters that look like high school little boy showing hey we've got a game saturday night at 10. now we're a little bit more than that it's a means of leveraging technology the city staff can provide flexible reprogramming to send and change messages very quickly from wherever they may be sheltering i would anticipate that with led lights they probably run off data off batteries for days so i mean i don't even anticipate you need to look it up you don't it will be a backup and i'll check into that i don't believe we should sub optimize on this thing as we keep nickel and dime instead we keep self optimizing and we're going to get to a point where we've got a sign where we stick it in front of barrow beach and the naysayers are going to point at it and say see we told you it doesn't look good it doesn't fit what we're trying to say about our beach so what i'm saying is don't sub-optimize with this thing we've come a long ways from the initial proposal we've chiseled it down the the sign we've got if you were to take option b and the proposal to go with the illuminated routed letters and the electronic cabinetry put the swoosh back on it which provides some nice access lighting to this thing we're still way under the initial proposal and i think we've got the money for it and we've budgeted for it and i think we need to make an important statement about our premier city that's all i got to say thank you frank banker i think you missed yeah um i'm really against unnecessary respect when i see a sign like this you haven't had a sign here for about a year you've gone through two storms one a cat one one year early account july 4th i was over helping sandbaggie first of all that kyle thumbs up creating that new sandbag container great thing to fill like 60 bags in 35 minutes but then but but going forward all the residents most of them have these things okay just the tap of the button they can get all the information they want right off our city hall website i just don't see the necessity of this site do we have the money for it sure we do but do we waste our money do we waste your money on unnecessary things i don't think it's broken the other thing is not to climb on your mr mayor but i can buy a weatherproof 40 inch by 18 inch digital side i'm going to be alone put that in my front yard and who's going to tell me that it's too bright or are we going to be a city the same say as i do or not you know it's it's just unnecessary spending i too have gotten a lot of emails i too have talked to a lot of citizens on the streets i'm getting a four to one ratio against it um i'm not for it at all mr vanguard for counseling for event court let me just show something i showed this before i think okay i know i gave a copy to the city i don't know where i can see this this is a portable site portable digital site 4 500 and it is 38 by 25 you can put these all over the city temporarily put them up and take them down but to your point jumping on my point back to my point i can buy one of these two and i can stick this on a pole and i can rent an advertising if that's what you want in your premier city then open this door open this pandora's box because it's going to be a hard time for any planning board or any zoning board to say you can't have it but the city hall can you go tell the people who live on causeway that they can't have it sure they can and they can have it for four thousand five hundred dollars and yeah they can make a lot of advertising money because that's a really nice heavily traveled road this was the first one that i got now of course this sign isn't even close in terms of the looks to your side it gets the job done and if we're concerned about an emergency or quick information that's fine also council member bankers that committee that i keep hearing about first off their advisory committee were the people elected by the people those people were appointed by us they weren't elected by the people i've heard both sides of the story some citizens were very nice in the way they wrote others were not but i'm not convinced that this is something we need is a waste of money we have other things we can better spend our money on and i just don't see it and i don't think this means sign makes you a premier community if you're a premier community when other people start calling you from your community think about that other council open it up to the citizens um mr vogel i'm just going to have you if you you can stay up there but just step just a little bit aside like the sheriff did before and then come in absolutely another round so to your point about these little signs you put up you're going to put up the front lawn uh first of all you have to go out and remotely put them in just like you have to slide in a letter you have to go out there and type it in a cord the first one that comes down comes down the pipe it's going to be on the ground number two it won't last i guarantee you that these things are not built to last and not commercial uh the leds are not quality uh you're gonna have some more to go out before others so what you're looking at for five thousand dollars is exactly what you're gonna get for five thousand dollars and you're gonna have those all over the community talk about an eyesore that would be an eyesore plus when you start having them going down the road that's gonna be a problem so to your point i understand what you're saying it's a cheap way to do it but it's inefficient and i think it's going to jump up to community to have all these things that people want to grab plus how do you know if zombie we're allowed to have individuals put up these other keyboards and how you're going to run you know you stick an electronic cord out there i don't know so to your point i understand what you're saying it's a cost thing but you look at the big picture you've got little displays that people want to put up but they're gonna they're gonna fail they're gonna fall down they're gonna they're gonna have to be apparent replacement not efficient and to your point about people using their phones you're absolutely right we're in an agent technology people can go on google and look up whatever they want but they have to have the mindset to get on google to get on the website go through scroll what they want get what they want and remember it out here you have people going to publix all the time people going to to eat out to come back all they have to do is look at that sign they don't have to think about getting on your phone there it is and uh robin to your point you can only put on what you want to put on if people don't want the jazz festival on there don't forget about it put on what is comparable in a way that is good for the community so you have all these options do whatever you want illumination whatever you want it's going to have a standby battery so it's nothing about um there's just so many pluses instead it's it's really aesthetically it's beautiful and i think once people see it the republican agreement i'm now going to open this to city council that's a city citizen's comments um mr bogal i'm just going to have you step right here right about there and then you come up here if you spoke before and asked a question that doesn't count so certainly if you have three minutes of time here june vancouver in april 23 of 2019 you did a constant contact survey right into the mic please you did a constant contact survey which i have a copy of if anybody wants to see it and communications was only at 20.8 of a concern for the citizens this is a coffee that was given to me by the city manager when i was part okay we have this other forms this is dated february 18 2020 the community center is only used 25.6 of the time 25.6 and we're spending money to advertise it as a community center when it's only being used 25.6 of the time i remember of citizen steve marsh saying that after a storm that the power went out for some of the residents down to nada okay and they he wanted to bring him down here and let them sit in the air for a little while and they were denied community center i don't think so but the other thing is we do not have a generator i personally came here one time to bring up some forms and the power was out and the employees had to leave early even though the storm was gone we could not operate as a city because we didn't have a generator so how can we which is supposed to be our number one thing is the safety of our citizens in this community not have a generator and worry about a sign before a generator lastly i remember members on this council saying we had to fix the flooding on our streets that's why we could not take a matching part grant that was being given to this city that was awarded because we had to fix the flooding first but we're worrying about a sign i just i'm other citizens i see no other hand citizen comments are closed back to you glenn gunn with respect to the matching hard drives i mean it keeps surfacing especially when it comes up with budget discussions and the missing point or the point that's completely left out of the context of that thing was we were willing to match a 200 000 grant with no follow-on money and we were handcuffed to those changes for the next 25 years we did we had no clue on the demographics of who were going to use those changes to the park we had no clue on what the recurring costs were going to be for that 200 000 expenditure expenditure to change the cars and once again it's just because somebody was going to match funds well we were getting free money two hundred thousand dollars so we would want to take two hundred thousand dollars out of our budget not being able to ask questions about what does that cost us you know encouraging our use to support and maintain those facilities if we change our minds because certain things aren't being used by those changes in the park we're hand comfortable you can't just eliminate those things so at the time i think that was very sound responsible stewardship of the budget process uh getting on your phone just like he talked about that's the distinguishing difference between push-pull communications push communication to drive by sign it's in your face hey you have barrier islands are being forced to evaporate don't be fans at once unless you get a win to program and go on your phone or get a reverse 911 how many text messages did you get from pinellas county with the upcoming story i got okay that's my point is everybody on that women the other point is and i did a lot of signage in my career signs are great for about a week or two and then they fall into the landscape for the typical citizens they just drive by they ignore they don't even see what's going on so the sign that he proposes and he did put a lot of work into it but that's what sales are okay sometimes you make the sale sometimes i'm not complaining okay what i'm trying to say is i think it's going to look great for a week or two and then most of the citizens are going to say huh they'll just drive right by more people are interested in getting first to go over the causeway when that two lanes narrow down and when they're coming in they're more interested in whether they're going to go left and getting in which lane go left or right we have a great county that informs us all of emergencies i got noticed today for a thunderstorm okay phone call and text message we don't need a sign as you say which way do i go well any idiot that lives in this city that goes west during a storm they got bigger problems they have a sign all right you go that way all right hang on we have two people having congress let's see if anybody else wants to speak anyone else do you blame them two last things one is it was interesting you brought up the notice for the option so i mean you put the cabinet up there if there's no message to be signed the screen's blank and it's black and you have the flexibility of using it at a later time in the event of an emergency or you need to get some time and information now so i mean that is a flexible point there i think we're at the point where we could uh argue this thing and ignite them and i would like to just make a proposal no i mean i get what everybody's saying but if we're going to again part of me some of this talk seems um hypocritical because you're like we're talking about those signs get you information it's in your face about things going on but then we don't want people to know about things going on in the city because we don't want other people coming to our city we're not welcoming our people in our city if you're talking about putting thirty thousand dollars toward the sign for emergency uses only that we're going to use once hopefully never maybe once or twice a year about a storm i mean do we need thirty thousand dollars sign to warn people there's a hurricane coming in they should get out i mean if we were gonna be advertising events in all this stuff that we do because we're so active and we're so inviting and we want people we want people to know about what's going on in our city yeah i think the first one up here like yeah let's do it we need it we've got to get it out but you're talking about a premier city you want this respectful sophisticated city but then you're talking about color size in your face so again it's getting in here you've got your one moment you're over here the next one over here just the arguments are just confusing so if we're only going to use this mostly we're thinking emergencies and i think an idea of a temporary sign you put up saying hey warning your flood zone a everybody get out that would be more effective than this beautiful sign and i think something more like a monument sign or just community center written on the thing would suffice so again i'm still on the fence so um i just i plan on going back to you i'm going to say something about three times here uh and you have the last word because this was your emotion so um you know i look at some of the surrounding towns and i certainly consider them as quality as us that are bluffs they don't have a digital sign belair i don't think they have a sign at all um you don't get better ashore they don't have a sign they don't even know city hall so um you know assigned as a maker city again nice sign you know maybe in the right city this might be perfect you know maybe indian rocks look like they had an old-fashioned school kind of sign late time and that might fit in well over there for their type of environment i think it does but i just don't again i think it comes in here so go back to glendagon yeah two two couple of things i stood in front of the side of gradington shores i stood in front of the side of indian shores and it wasn't just about emergency evacuations or learning there was some public information messages on there beaches don't leave your stuff on the beach if you leave it on the beach it's going to be confiscated hey it's that time of year and you should get your emergency access tags for your car if you're if you haven't done that already so there's a lot of public information from artists not just head east if there's an evacuation instead of west okay so there are a lot of public information messages there and we are this is a arterial uh roadway here so it's not only our residents looking at it and being engaged with our our neighboring municipalities there are people coming down through clearwater water base there are people coming out from indian rock speech to access the causeway to and from work so we're getting out everywhere so i mean it's it's not just the resident thing i mean i'm thinking in kind of a broader scope but providing a public service to our neighboring communities as well so i don't know if there's any more comments um i'm on council i'm going to come back to you okay no i mean i i hear what you're saying and i agree but just you know this has nothing to do with my own personal opinion but i'm just going to base what all the majority of the residents have been saying in their fields and then just ever since i've been on council the feeling and the comments from residents about our communicating we're not welcoming we don't want to share the love i mean so and what are you gonna say you know don't leave your stuff on your breach but leave your umbrella in the car i mean i mean what are we gonna say you know we're not saying hey come to our beaches we should say beaches are for residents only all else stay away i mean that's not going to make us look premier that's going to make us look maybe maybe that's how we want to look i don't know that's not how i personally want to look but look a lot of people are thinking it i'm just that person when you're thinking i'll just say it because i'm not going to lose i'm just going to tell you like it is this this is the feeling i'm getting we don't want other people here we only want residents you can't bring your umbrella to the beach we don't want i mean i don't think a sign is going to be used for public announcements because i don't think we have anything to say do i want to be more technological yes if this when this first came up i was all for it i was like yeah this is great to look good blah blah blah but then all these citizens are coming to me and emailing me and i'm like that's obviously not the field that the citizens want and i'm up here to represent the citizens not my own personal even if it conflicts with the majority of the citizens so that's all i'm saying i'm not trying to pick up anybody i'm just saying it like it is of how the what the citizens have told me and i mean this even citizens that are my patients have talked to me on this in a professional capacity so they're talking about themselves they bring up the signs so i'm just saying right well if you live between 1st and 18th street you can't take anything to the beach anymore so there's no need to put anything on the side are we going to put on the sign and we do pass it no beach umbrella is allowed between 1st and 18th street are you going to put on the sign potential residence you know how to have each umbrella because i'll tell you one thing that would be a big drawback i believe to any potential buyer i mean we're going to inform the people [Music] i was on the communication committee and uh i'm aware that there was a survey that was sent out the sign was not the number one form of communication i'll admit that but i will say that there were there was a number of people that said yes that's what i want i drove past the old sun and that's where i got what was going on in city hall i saw it every time i would drive by that sign i would look at it and see okay am i missing anything what's going on tonight because that was that was a good place i didn't have to pick up my phone while i was driving down the street to try to figure out what was happening at city hall i know that there's many people that they are on their phone all the time driving around we know that's not safe they do it anyway i can think of some people in this room that i've seen doing but you know not gonna point anyone out i'm just saying that just because it's not the number one form of communication requested by the citizens the residents of bel air beach does not mean it's not going to be used it's just another form and whenever i was on that committee we were trying to creatively come up with as many ways possible of communicating with our residents if there's one form of communication that's leaving a few people out because maybe they don't use their phone maybe they're not computer savvy uh maybe they just don't understand the technology well why should we leave them out and that's all i've got to say so here's what i'm going to do if anybody else wants to make the last comment but that the last final comment was the person who brought the motion under our rules okay so one more round okay thank you first of all just to be clear i'm not here to sell you this sign that is totally your decision i'm here as a request to provide you with a design capable of communicating and i did that i think in a very conscientious beautiful sign and a good price that's all i'm going to say about that i'm not here to promote this sign necessarily secondly we're all talking about well you know what can't we we don't want to put a law in emergency we need that we need that but think about the community think about discussions of what you do want to promote to this community what do you want to reach out and have a positive influence on the community through what you put on the sign i mean there's a lot of positive things you can comment all think about but you're all talking about but we don't want this we don't want people to know that you know there's beach here well what do you want to promote this is your community so you should promote it as best you want to promote this community and you have a great tool to do around you have to do it all the time no you can you can go dark you can get to sleep for weeks something comes up put it on there but you have the ability to do it where now you don't so now you have to have somebody think about going on their phone i understand that i do the same thing but you have to be conscious of okay gosh now i gotta think about it now i gotta get on it now i'm gonna scroll down when you can just you know a couple times go past and the information you want is there you can put phone numbers call city council if you have any questions a call whatever any questions it's available instantaneous so that's first point secondly i i really wish i don't think anybody did this all the way offered many times to call michael robinson at ready for chores he and i have just the same discussion we can deal with the same problems with people in the community it's going to be true pride it's this and that you resolve that they have a beautiful son i wish you would have called him to get the questions and answers from him how he resolved it with this community i think you might feel a little differently perhaps unfortunately you did not but i wish you would thank you again mr coco i'm gonna start on my left here last round of comments you don't have to make any comment but anyone here [Music] to our citizens um since that since the old time went down you feel lost driving by here you know when's the next meeting for this when's the next meeting for that i think it's very valuable for that um and you know during storm season and stuff yes we can put um you know signs up get your enters your reentry permit and stuff like that but just to have information for the citizenship city hall is going to be closed on friday for this and such a date you know where they're closing at noon or something like that i think it's very valuable for information it's a very tasteful sign and i would be all [Music] so mr pass says now you'll only be clicking on the phone while you're driving so now we'll have a pen and paper in the car i'm totally against it it's unnecessary on that door you said take that money put it towards that generator that benefits a lot more people particularly if we inherited a hurricane this becomes an area where we can have people cool and and stay temporary at least during the daytime not that it's a shelter but it's a place where people can come too and they weren't able to come to here last time glenn that last word i'm going to call it yes i'd like to amend it okay to authorize the purchase of the monument sign of electronic message display specifically option b with the wave add-on total cost of 30 500 as specified on the international assigned proposal dating june 30 2021. good second for that second okay we'll open that up to discussion to you first [Music] do you want to pull the question yes or no let's go through the program let's go through the protocol okay so we're going to count some comments now give your amendment okay which i didn't even bother to break the whole thing down but we'll give it to you again um basically you're picking the most expensive option so for all the concerns about the money let's spend the most amount of money okay um if you want to make it if we're gonna have the amendment we have to vote on that proposal and we have to have discussion so anyone on council have any other comments besides myself before i open up for citizen comics on the amendment only i do yes i don't like that i don't like the waves i don't like that blue i think it looks too garish too in your face and i don't think that it matches the building well it means something more beef of a blue to say if you're calling details in this amendment let's talk another amendment we can have [Music] that four thousand dollars and i don't think we need the way and we're gonna start debating shape and sizes and i'm gonna go outside and get my bagging menu so i can entertain myself while we're doing this in my car we'll go good [Music] um [Music] well they they told us if we purchased a sign they would reopen it they paid us the 4 000 already so what they told me initially was somewhere around 10. my experience would be a little bit more my experience with insurance companies is they'll pay out [Music] so if that's not what you want but it's time to fish or cut date on this thing instead of argument and information so i've made a proposal initial line item 10 and i'm saying option b with the wave and the eliminated rounded letters and 3 500 which is significantly less than the initial proposal so we thought the initial proposal was very nice until we found that we saw the price tag well we've seen a huge adjustment on this and he's been budgeted for we're going to get leverage off of our insurance money and i'm just saying let's [Music] well no i guess what i'm saying is let's not sub optimize let's let's let's go over the cadillac version of this thing because i think it fits the idea of i know you're going from hey let's buy a new car to let's buy cadillac 2022 i guess my point is is that will all be decided we've been we've been arguing this for how many a year now and i'm just saying we've got information before us i've made a motion i'm ready to move forward now this is only on the amendment the amendment is right mr gum option b with the way that on 33 500 correct okay so that's the amendment that just means that we're going to amend what we vote on because right now this thing says 28 000 to 33 fifty so he's saying forget about twenty eight thousand thirty three nine fifty he wants option b with adam that's what i want your comments on if any citizens have any mr hansen come up if you have a question ask us and we'll straighten it out for you maybe john hayes at 22nd street so i can only talk about the motion is invented so my comment is this i've been following this whole scenario forever in recent meetings the city manager warned minimum period or we could get up to 14 000 if we place assignment so we've been playing with this little thing forever and now he just states city got four thousand dollars i would wager to say the chances of getting the other ten thousand if the council votes for a sign might be slipping them should have thought about that instead of dragging the anchor other citizen comments coming back to council on the amendment last word went on the amendment if you have one if the protocol is right here let me call the question it is right please correct me if i state this question wrong we're voting on the amendment the amendment does not mean you're voting for the sign it means you're voting for us to consider this amendment so the amendment before us right now is to not go with a range of twenty eight thousand to thirty three thousand nine fifty but instead to select by moving an international sign june 30th 2021 uh quote to kyle riefler uh option b as in boy and it is the wave at 33 500 before any offsets that wave is illuminated by the way i'm sorry the weight is illuminating you can you can literally make money on your photo so starting however you'd like this on the amendment only this is the amendment we're going to vote on and then i'm going to call the question right after that if this passes or if it doesn't pass either way council member no tara i'm councilmember swope councilmember aki no councilmember banker councilmember gunn [Music] no so the amendment passes four to three i think we were finished with debate on that when you call the amendment okay so now we're going to call the question unless anybody has any last words no okay good so what is before us right now is item 10 as amended it's an authorization to award purchase of monument sign with electronic message display and suspend bid requirements as amended to include option b item uh item weight add-on 33 500 that's from the june 30th 2021 quote from international signing yes vote gets that sign not a clerk same deal please call the black person this is where they pass the sign or reject the sign council member notaro i'm council member swope council member aki no council member banker no council member gunn aye vice mayor gaddis [Music] so that's that thank you very

beautification underground project motion pretty slow second second hockey i'll defer to the city manager yes mayor console this is a part of our underground project this is funding that the penny for canalis money is providing us to underground the buyers this is a area that we have some little pockets and you'll notice the majority of it is uh that the north end of town on the west side of the road we've got a couple of pockets of spectrum wires we need to eliminate and currently if you drive down boulevard the only thing that's left going across the road is spectrum wires and that'll help finish this project up we do have money from this this money for this actually is from the k320 that will expire in september so we need to expand it to move forward with the project i got a question for you when do we do the east side of gulf boulevard that's what uh we're in the process uh i have spectrum's numbers uh back already for the well actually the spectrum wires from first through 12th

been approved yes vote gets this done i'll take voice vote all in favor anyone opposed passes seven to zero this is like a record it's eight o'clock that we're getting into the unfinished business okay we have any unfinished business not hearing any city attorney any comments city attorney report today i sent the revised signed ordinance to city council members and it's my understanding in the not so distant future or workshop that will be discussed again there's a number of changes i made i tried to do my best to make it exceptionally clear what i have changed and made comments and i'll be certainly receptive to hearing the further comments that you have that's the first thing second thing is lynn and i have continued to talk and work on doing the changes to the city code that were recommended by the review committee and the third thing is i wanted to do an educational thing that will take about two minutes so this i had prepared for the last meeting but that meeting went late so i will tell you it now this is the progression of things that i consider when make doing an amendment to the ordinances and the code this is what the progression of things i would recommend that you all consider when you are uh looking at an issue again it will only take two minutes first thing is amendments and that evolutionary process there's typically a change in law uh that we have to comply with or there's a technology change those are the two things that lead to the evolution next point is what is the issue you should define it the better to find it is the less nebulous it is and the easier it is to discuss third thing that i always consider is does the city have jurisdiction to address this issue or is jurisdiction with the county state or federal government at times citizens are very interested in making a change in law and there ought to be a law to do something except it's not your law to change so that's that's something we always should consider next point is is there an existing legal standard in the city's code of ordinances if you're amending it there probably is a standard but that to me is a obvious starting point the next point is really getting down to the deliberative process how important is the proposed amendment and you know you can spend a tremendous amount of time demanding things and you all have to decide how important a certain issue is and some issues i would submit to you are things that you probably should consider another day compared to other things that may be a lot more pressing next thing is discuss the issue of the workshop and reach consensus on the proposed amendment that to me is the before better way of of doing it because i think you know with seven of you there's going to be several different points of view and it's good for you to get a workshop session be able to share your perspective on a very quantity a given topic next thing is once there's a consensus that's the staff which is primarily uh lynne patting and myself would review what other cities have done to address this type of issue so we are efficient and we don't reinvent the wheel there's a community code i can access and so can you anything or almost anything in the state of florida in municipal government and to me i think a common starting point is to look at least get an idea how other cities have addressed this issue the final point is to consider an ordinance which contingency amendment to the code and that would be that could be after you do a second workshop where you consider the actual document of the workshop so those are some things i would suggest would be prudent for you all to roughly follow that progression of events when considering an amendment to the city code and i'll stand for any questions council mr riley i had one thing that i brought you in passing the other day and um i'm throwing it out there because it's something that the city is going to have to do not necessarily you alone but um our governor and our legislature was quite busy this session and i believe we have close to 90 new bills some of which affect our city that affects our code and affects the way we've been doing business and we know while we're doing other things the tallahassee's doing other things too we have to make sure that our stuff is up to date i'm gonna give you one of them okay because i'm just gonna and i'm going to bring this so madam clerk i'm gonna tell you now i'm gonna bring this at some point in time okay we never had the right as a city to uh prohibit motorized bicycles on the beach because when they tried to in tallahassee encourage people to ride bicycles they said a bicycle's a bicycle and that includes a motorized bicycle well all the beach mayors that were screaming because people are whizzing by you know 40 miles an hour on the beach so they passed it or a ability for us to change that and prohibit that and we should take advantage of that before they change their minds again so stuff like that is in there it's for us as a council i mean we certainly can debate it just because i say do it doesn't matter everybody here wants motorized bicycles but most people don't and this would be our opportunity to change and some of the other stuff home-based businesses are now legal so we need to change our code we need to look at how we're going to be affecting stuff and how we're going to be affecting the community so i give this to you i know you're aware of it i you spoke about maybe using the league of cities for a summary i think that's a great starting point but i just want this council to be aware this is our job uh aided by our city attorney to bring this stuff up to date these codes need to be revised and of course all 90 don't necessarily affect us but they somehow do well i'll just add to what you've said there are periodically mandates from tallahassee that uh the legislature's determined that the cities have to do something and you're stuck with figuring it out and what's worse is you're often stuck [Music] how many of those are in the 90 i really don't know off the top of my head but the two examples that you have given are things that certainly will affect the city of bel air beach and it's it is the sort of thing that you you should take into account because one of the worst spots you can be is if there's a new state law that's applicable to the city and you uh don't do anything about it and you're in conflict with state law which is probably not the best place to be a lot of the laws give you an opportunity to phase things in but some of them don't so when you and i talked about it briefly the point i made was the florida league of cities has been active for you know since their inception in trying to be the liaison and i my expectation is that they have periodically up give updates of summary a summarized version of things i what i do not want to do is you know we dive in and read 90 different bills that's a complete waste of time before better application of time is to start with a summary and then you all do things methodically uh with your charter review and your code review that's the way i would suggest you do this although you don't need a committee for it you need a summary to start with and then decide which ones you're going to tackle does anyone on this council have a problem with mr riley's reaching out to the league of cities i like the idea of trying to see if there's a summary i'm sure there is um and they have a legislative update that they did at the end of the term so that's probably a good start but the governor didn't sign everything until sometimes june 30th he waited to the last second so if we can see what's you know what passes i mean i don't unless we're going to pay him to 390 bills which i know he doesn't want to do some of these things could be 100 pages to start yeah okay so minimal amount of time see what they have and then you get back to us we'll take it from there um mr reeves i mean i just mentioned a couple of the key ones be careful if you get into that area i mean you know you can't like run a funeral parlor from your house but you know guys running a accounting business i think that's going to be okay well let's say they signed on the very last day 30th of june i think it was 89 bills or something uh the ones that really affect us or the bicycle we can do that and that's probably just some ahead of the current ordinance we just disagree with it should be pretty simple uh the whole business there again we've got a prohibition against it so we need to just probably enter our ordinance at some point the big one though is the house bill 53 which in your budget you're going to see that where the state is requiring every municipality to do a 20-year needs analysis of their stormwater management system and that's due to the state by july 31st 2022 and then every five years thereafter and i put a copy in your thing and really you only go to you just go to line 191 you don't need to read all the godly good which for the city that estimate i got a revised estimate and it's about 130 000 it's to do the study to do this study there goes our star birth well you know i guess how i look at it [Music] we are at some point in time every like today they sent out a little message about that american rescue money uh that told someone to give to us but they sent out you know a stack of paper like this to read and so you know all the goodies about it but i think we'll be able to because we can use that for strong water so if we're fortunate we can kind of leverage that maybe with this money by doing a stormwater project with that money and use the stormwater so it doesn't hurt us in the end so hopefully in the very near future they'll actually give us the money it's going to be given by uh for the department of emergency management and they can't do any hold back and i do know that they gotta give us a portion of it this year and we died until 2024 to spend it so uh there are reports that we're going to have to make of course things to fill out but that's an example of a bill that's actually going to cost the city a lot of money most of the rest of them really code enforcement there was a bill signed that if you make a complaint you got to give me your name but we can't investigate it and that's that's already come to kind of fruition because people don't want to give you their name because it might be their neighbor and they don't want to do that actually we had a call today for i think it was landscaping or something so i called and as soon as you asked me for their name why don't i give you my name so technically so technically speaking we uh if we didn't find it technically speaking we're not supposed to pursue it by how the law reads so there's there's nuances through all those bills so we'll you know i'm sure fairly into the submarine and i'm kind of following what's going to affect us okay fred was still on you um so i think giving you you know go ahead and see what you have and if you report back to us we'll start this project i mean 90 bills it's a it's a lot to wade through but i don't even know about this one that you just said about this 20-year study i didn't know that i missed but i mean when you get 90 of them blowing by in one day it's hard to track them all so and there's 100 that didn't get passed so sometimes you follow them and they don't go anywhere so okay anything else okay thank you um city manager yes as i mentioned i gave you an updated budget based on a few things and i kind of highlighted the things that were changed we'll discuss this next week i put page numbers we have the page numbers in there and all the graphs so it's a little more easier to read we've also given you our financial statements for april of may and i gave you dep finally closed the co issue out and the sheriff finally closed it out that we maintained or turned the cos last year i just want to clarify that the station says you've been trimming the seals and the email i got from dp they're not going to do anything they're they're not going to tell us to do anything because the guidance is on the guidance from them that says you should trim them to 18 inches if you trim them so i spoke to the person that replaced mr tried to remember but nellie or manelo uh he retired but this jason spain here said basically it's guidance because the statue allows you to turn but the guidance is 18 inches so i just wanted to close that out it's gone it's time to move on to 18 inches we come to about 18 centimeters well the statue the statue doesn't dictate that this is just their guidance guidance in the statute says you confirm it doesn't say how will you trim them but when i had the conversation with him and he was well aware of what happened he said that we're not going to do anything with you because i've been trying to get him to respond since last october october yeah so that that is uh finished and i told you about house bill 53 the gentleman that does a lot of our engineering and cycling review has a medical situation and he's in the hospital and i'm going to be bringing something to you uh because he may be out of pocket for a month or two so we'll use one of our other contracted engineering firms which is duel and they've agreed to take over his 12th and 13th stream design because he was just starting on it for the cost that he proposed so it's not gonna cost us any more money but they're gonna send me a letter and i'll bring it to the council to transfer uh i have spoken to larry's wife and uh the prognosis is good but it's just a situation so uh and we have uh duel's gonna help us out with the cycling stuff that we need an engineer to look at so and that's part of the contract that we did a couple years ago okay uh next monday is the budget work session and then there will be a special meeting following that to and the tentative military i'm going to propose is what the military is right now 2.0394 that just means we can't go higher than that after we set the tentative we have the workshop prior to it and then we have to set the tenant of knowledge so we can turn that into the county it's it's normal process we're going to recommend 2.0394 which is the current village i will tell you that the second set of numbers that came from the county on july 1st instead of 6.03 our value is 7.6 increase which is about 18 000 more dollars in millage over the previous 69 so but we'll discuss that more next week but i just wanted to let you know that and mayor i may try to add if doom gets me that letter to that specialty approval to transfer to them to do 12-13 design okay the letter no no i so we could move forward with that i just want to clarify we have the budget workshop and then the setting lieutenant military but then after that we're going to do a work session right or we're not doing a work session no homework session so just budget okay and then uh i think try to see a little next next month then okay i thought it was i thought it was next week so i mean i'll read the sign ordinance much later if it's not going to be next week because that may take some time very well matt yeah so next month yeah so we'll we'll plan on that for you okay and that will be what's on the agenda discussion so let's there's a couple other minor things i like to you know fred's done it two or three times i have to get it resolved and moved on plus we've got other ordinances to work on and that's all i have okay see you clearly did anybody have any questions i only had one um did uh kyle get a response from an encore about the wiring changes and uh no we haven't we haven't got anything from them yet okay anyway else two things um that new build notifying when you have a complaint you have to include your name we don't have to give that name out to the person that we're investing we're uh we're going to do some research on that because that could be an issue whether we do or don't uh we're going to do a little more research but the bills basically states that if somebody wants to make a complaint they've got to give us their name before we could even uh if we're going to redact it then they didn't do a damn thing by doing it so i think you're going to have to give it out but i'm not your attorney but the whole point of it was no anonymity right that's what we have now people quality and then you redact it but you know what what i think it'll do one thing i i guess out of the goat enforcement that means city staff needs to be more cognizant of what's out there so that neighbor doesn't have to call in and to me that's more of a benefit well the other thing is this past week or whatever we have a great maintenance crew i mean those guys gave up their holiday weekend they're out there in the heat throwing up sandbags cobb did an excellent job coming up with that new system uh we're gonna make a couple more of them kudos actually they were telling me he's not taking the credit he found it on youtube a bunch of kids at like 10 or 12 years old came up with the id but it really saved a lot of time and it was definitely i was out there monday for quite a bit so it saved a lot of time ten bags at a time and i'll say it also as usual excellent responsibility crisis okay for the people in the city you know we have our differences and people fight but when it comes to a crisis the city never fails to deliver never okay excellent job do your steps anybody else okay uh city clerk no nothing no comments from the city clerk city council comments beginning with read a smoker uh yeah i just want to also come in and compliment the city staff for the job well done one of my concerns was this email that we received regarding you know pictures of different signs my main concern about that is people going by and taking pictures of other people's property back in february on february 19 2019 i received a phone call from actually this gentleman's wife of a vehicle that was spotted going down the nursery backing up and taking pictures of her property and she kind of freaked out thinking that she was being stalked and i just don't want these same property owners to feel that way too because she not only told me but she posted it all over social media as well as i think she put notices on the door at that time on the city community center but i just really want to caution people from going around taking pictures of other people's problems call the correct people the ones with the authority and have them go out and look if you have a concern or a complaint or a question or anything but just don't take it upon yourself because i just remember her phone call with me and reading her uh post she was extremely upset and felt stopped by this person so it was just somebody driving down her street taking pictures so no different than these pictures here of property owners problems and other than that i don't have anything else to add okay thank you leslie mataro no comments my gun right banker yeah last month i brought up the buoy issues and i did submit a resolution and i talked to um which hopefully the umbrella and the uh disney umbrella and the i've been communicating with fwc uh about the buoys i guess they get tired of me contacting their staff so they sent me to their attorney we try to claim that well since i raised this issue all the buoys are illegal and canelo's on the same key so she then threatened that she's going to remove them all because i informed her so then i said well fine you can do whatever you want but the blood will be on your hands and the first person that gets hit because for over 10 years the statute was changed you know buoys have to be inspected every three years so for over 10 years at least three inspections the fwcc approved illegal inspections so she kind of changed her attitude i guess it contacted lynn instead of me and hopefully we'd get this whole thing resolved but it's still an unsafe issue and it needs to be correct yeah just so you know that they're going to look at our permit so that's what they're going to start with and she told me she'd give back to me because our boys may well they probably don't they don't meet the guidelines so they are gonna and we'll have to change our an ordinance from what i understand so they are going to send someone out to evaluate our duties so until that's done uh i want to make sure ours are right as opposed to trying to put more buoys in that may not be right but we will still talk to bella short thank you frank anything else okay robin i'm good thanks good guys just before the storm came a gentleman's boat on a dilapidated lift collapsed and fell into the water nearby my house as tommy would have it the storm was approaching and the boat was not secured in the water the lines that were attached to it were very old the boat has not been moved in years the lift had not been used in years and uh it was an immediate hazard a neighbor called me and said hey you're not going to believe what's going on over there i looked in looked out into the water and he and his wife were trying to secure this boat so i grabbed some line went over there and helped him get it secure and eventually some more neighbors came over and assisted with it long story short we have addressed sea walls docks boat lifts the one thing that we've not addressed is the fact that there's a giant vehicle suspended up in the air that is sitting on this impending doom boat lift i think that we need to seriously consider something in an ordinance about this if we hadn't if the storm had been much worse than it was and we hadn't gone over there and secured his boat for him it would have broken loose and probably broke someone's boat left damaged property or even worse maybe cost someone in their life it's unacceptable and i look all around the water and there's just one here one there they're just kind of scattered about boats on rusted out plug vested you know they don't work and they've not been moved in years and they're just waiting to fall in so one of the work sessions i'm going to bring this back up and i would like to discuss it more uh because i think it's in the city's best interest uh safety wise that we did something about it so and that's all i thank you thank you just a couple items um first i'm just gonna touch uh briefly on the comments about photographing people's yards and stuff i'm not gonna be returning i'm not gonna give you legal advice check with your attorney before you do anything okay if you're taking a picture of a sign in someone's front yard i believe you're fine if you're taking pictures of their bedroom through their window you're not going to be fine you're going to be in jail so be careful what you're doing but taking a picture of a sign for documentation purposes should not lend anybody any problems i know it's uncomfortable we've had people take pictures of our license plates at my house where people take pictures of our house the people who walk on our property so a former guy before your city manager walked down my property that's how he met the first time i didn't know who he was he was taking a picture for female purposes i thought he was my white ex-wife's divorce investigator and got pretty upset we patched it up pretty quickly anyhow that's that um secondly i'm just going to say this out loud just so people know what's going on after last council session i got not one but two records requests one was a complete request for all of my emails going back eternally um patti gentry was able to call that down to all of them since march it's a voluminous request and i'm going to be writing you a letter this week i believe i have all the information i need legally to know exactly how to respond and i'll let you know what the you know what the arrangement will be for that the second one may be a very limited request or be even more voluminous and that he was going to check on that so we'll wait to see what the second request looks like and i think that one that second one affects mr banker also because it looked like it was directed to mr vanguard myself um but if it's just the communications as i read it between the three of us that's going to be a real quick response um because i don't believe there's anything so we'll see how it goes um but anyway i just wanted to let you know that so you can expect it if you don't see something this week let me know okay um i think that's everything that i had for this week thank you for a good meeting uh you know the sign thing is a good example of how you debate things i know so some people in the audience is upsetting we have to do amendments this is the way it goes this is the process florida doesn't allow us to talk behind the scenes so it would be great if i could pick up a phone and say glenn what do you think about this we can't do that it's illegal so we have to do it all here and it's time consuming and it's sometimes a little archaic because we have to do it in a certain certain fashion but those are the rules that we have to play about with that i'll entertain a motion to adjourn second second all in favor aye one post have a good night thank you for coming we'll see you next monday"
