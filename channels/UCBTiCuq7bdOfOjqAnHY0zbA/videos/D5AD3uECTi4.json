    "transcript": "good evening everyone welcome to the tuesday january 18 2022 special wild work session for the city of valor beach before we do the pledge of allegiance um we've got news today and our city attorney is going to be resigning due to a health situation and i think he's told us what the situation is he's got the answer so uh if you're praying in person say pray for do not just keep it in your thoughts okay people's really helped us out tremendously we'll talk a little bit more about him united um council member frank banker council member glenn gunn council member leslie otero councilmember rita swo vice mayor dave gattis mayor joseph manzo and city manager lynn reeves patty for the record uh vice mayor's joining us on the telephone um we have an agenda number eight i'm going to withdraw uh about fred's request to us uh anybody have any objection to the request that he'd be leaved out of his contract so i'd like to put that before number one any objections i'll call that item so the request that he made to the city managers and manager forwarded to us i believe he has a 60-day if not mistaken win 60-day 30-day 30-day notice given the circumstances he's um he's going to be undergoing treatment probably as early as this week from what i understand so he's asked if we would get him out of the contract early i've had a discussion with the city manager it doesn't cause any real problems for him i don't know that it causes any of us any individual problems but like to have that discussion we cannot give the official authorization as i told our city manager we can take a consensus tonight we can approve it he can go about taking a look at some of the other attorneys which he had done as recently as this summer get us some coverage um and if there's anything that's coming up at least we'll have some people who can cover it fred has volunteered if necessary to help us out so he's not leaving us at all and certainly this is not something you plan for any of that um so with that does anybody wish to discuss it because to me it seems like a very simple request and um so we have consensus that we could have the city manager number one give the author as well again consensus only that we'll let him out of the contract we'll do a consent agenda item for next meeting which will make it official but this is pretty much making it official so that libraries can move forward and then also designate libraries to start going forward speaking to the other attorneys about interests about replacement everybody look good with that plan anybody have the objections to that plan to the manager you're so authorized for that friend probably done item one is a long item i'm just gonna read the first sentence of it and then not the explanation that explanation i'm gonna turn it over to glenda for a further explanation but item number one is best practices discussion of ways to improve information sharing transparency management effectiveness it was brought by councilmember gunn i'm sure he had a public presentation for us okay thank you just an observation in the vein of uh continuous improvement trying to make our meetings more productive uh efficient i kind of watched and looked at some other meetings as well the existing protocol right now is at the head of our typical council sessions we have presentations and reports and that typically includes the sheriff report the code enforcement boards and committees and what i'd like to do is put out there and recommend that we expand those reports to basically the city staff as well that would include the city manager the city clerk and city attorney right now typically their inputs are saved to the end of the meeting it just comes in comments so the problem with that situation is sometimes that could be a long night and we have a tendency to maybe gloss over some things after a very long meeting that we might want to normally address but we gloss over because it's been a long night also what happens is a topic might come up where the council members have not had adequate time to think about it so they get home and they go oh i should ask this question or whatever so by moving into the front of the agenda hopefully what we do is we get a little better 360 degree view of the status of the city before the meeting starts and also allows the citizens to comment on it as well because typically what happens is as the night progresses more and more residents start to leave the council session as well so this this provides a lot more transparency to the residents it allows them to ask questions and just provides for a better flow of information along with that what i'd like to do is suggest we need to put our minds together and come up with a more of a structured format rather than just hey what's going on instead of bringing it let's have some very pointed questions for you what are the major projects that you're working on what's the status of them are there any key dates that are coming up has the schedule slipped what are some of the unforeseen circumstances that have come up where you need the council's assistance and or you've gotten figured out but we'd like some insight as to what your kid will plan is for this sort of thing these staff reports would also include a bulletized outline that they would submit with the normal background information package for the agenda so that we get some visibility and transparency on these things before we come to the council meeting so if you want to think about it beforehand if you've got some extra questions you want to ask we want to dig a little deeper for detail we have that available to us before the meeting rather than sitting to a listening to a a quick soundbite at the end of the meeting and just not having time to deal with it or the thought process behind it i think pretty much covered it that the next thing i kind of look at here is uh eventually all this stuff should align with a city scorecard we've talked about this over the years what are those handful of metrics maybe just five or six of them that are kind of aligned with our strategic plan that tells us whether we're getting better or getting worse i mean right now we don't know color enforcement is a great example he comes in for us he gives us a brief report at every council meeting and it's purely anecdotal i saw this and i got up in the morning i got dressed i went to school i came home you know that goes on and on and there's no uh objective measurement there to know our code enforcement program is getting traction if we're getting better and i would just throw a couple up how many open uh code violations do we have at any one given time and what's the average number of days to close at code kind of give me an indication of whether code enforcement is getting a little better people are starting to understand it and also uh maybe down the road we have to figure out how best to measure some of some of the other details on this since the change in the law with people having to identify themselves when they make a complaint to call and complain obviously things are going to fall off there and we had made some assumptions previously that those calling complaints were direct feedback from the citizens and that's how we measured some of those categories of what's what's getting the attention is it landscaping is it construction is it on-street parking is it trash now we don't really have a measurement for that because it's all the coding voicemail guy driving around so this this is where i think we're going eventually and i throw that out for consideration that's it council comments yeah um i think this is a good idea because if you move the especially the city manager up right after citizen comments and give them the opportunity to directly address the questions that come up as opposed to waiting to the end of the night and by then the citizens have left i will say to add on to that something else just as a potential you know he does all his comments in the beginning if you know the meaning he thinks of something maybe at the end when we do our comments it could be a quick recap or if you thought of something else or you forgot to add something else you can chime in at that point just so it's not only in the beginning and you're cut off so now i think this is a great idea i think the citizens would appreciate the instant feedback to their questions after citizen comments my intention was not to take away from comments at the end everybody still has comments and you know that's a perfect place to address things that came up later on in the meeting but he was reported early so everybody didn't hear what's going on he is our chief executive so he should get the top though i think if we do it after i mean we had a situation last meeting where before we had a citizen without a concern and he didn't get addressed till the end of the night which was a long haul sometimes but it was long enough so stuff like that right after citizen comments if the city manager can speak to his regular report plus anything that comes up in citizen comments i agree with robin though i think we do have to have an opportunity at the end because you know once we discuss five or six other items something else may come up that you know we want to address the city manager so just really be available for a question i think that's number one um in terms of bullet points or what we're looking for i think we can do better with some of these reports um vcso comes here every month and basically tells me what i already know i know i've already read the report when i came in here i've already compared it against last month i already know the series already you know where we stand they can add something they can tell us something else maybe information-wise i mean i just read that pinellas county was like probably one of the worst places in the state to get hit by bicycles and then it's pedestrian talk to us tell us what to look out for tell us about the problems that tcso is seeing because citizens get the same report that we do and they can read it and i i know that we had two large cities that's great you know great result what else can you tell us and i think we can expand that and try and get some more information from them same thing with code we you know we usually get the code report in advance like glenn is saying i mean what issues are they finding what problems are they finding where do they need our help or city manager's help yeah i would like to ask the city manager um for your opinion on moving you up to the front i mean obviously we're talking about you providing updates and your and different things that you know about new status so what is your thoughts on it i i don't have any problem doing it up front you just have to create some format that we'll go forward with just put in the packet how about you patty not that you usually have too many long reports for us but you have any problem with it up front too no okay to the attorney i'm sure we will not have a problem that'll be conditional on the contract i'll ask you first the thought of getting the um reports with the agenda package i think is helpful because then rather than you know having to guess at the end we can study it think about it or whatever and be prepared anything else no okay anyone else um we didn't ask about citizens we work sessions so citizen comments are not officially part of it but does anybody have any issues with calling on the citizens if they wish to speak hearing no objections would any citizen like to address us on this to leave issue hands i'll close citizen comments so uh glenn what would be the action item next to do here well i think the city manager can sit down with his staff and revise the format for the council agenda and then probably just city manager city clerk city attorney the next big step is for them just to bulletize what they're going to address and include it in the package there's no reason we can't implement this for february anybody have problem with that so that shall be implemented and then i guess just we'll have feedback if we if we need more we need less we'll give them the feedback that counts all work sessions in the future right yeah we can tweak the process all right that closes number one um that's item two review of safety standards it has me down that was actually a um comment from citizen i remember we put this on because there was some concerns with the installation of the signage and then um it wasn't even a crane it was a lift that was putting it in frame giving us some information that was the inappropriate thing yeah i need to digest because when there was an item under number one i'm sorry the council advisory committee just to discuss ways to better you know finish council advisory committee discussed ways to utilize this committee to their full potential you know this whole group was formed to provide some continuity to the council those people are come on board and they provide some stability because during the election process people are coming and going but they're always going to be up to speed on city issues and there are standing room to go to the special project we don't need to go through the selection process call the applications orient them and then get them up to speed these guys are already up and running and chomping at the bit obviously to take on a project and we saw that with the sign thing they want to review the sign words so i think you've got a lot of skilled people on this thing they're they're championing for something to do one thing i thought about better utilizing these people is to carbon copy them on any information that goes out to the council members that provides them a more base a better baseline what's going on within the city and i'm not aware of anything that would prohibit that sort of information and being disseminated so they they have the same visibility in the city and what's going on as we do i think we've been utilizing them and they've performed very well with what we've asked them to do so i mean i think we would continue that your suggestion about copying them these are i think almost everything we get as a public record so if it doesn't create too much i'm looking right at padding right now if it doesn't create too much extra work for her and for the for the office group i don't have a problem with it but ready yeah that's not extra work no problem okay no comments citizens any comments or comments you can implement okay thank you that was easy okay review of safety standards i started to introduce it this came out of a citizen's complaint couple citizens actually um i think he had a picture of it watching the sign being installed they were using a lift which is an appropriate piece of apparatus so the question was just what are we doing with safety standards and stuff so that was all this was it's not that i did a safety review i see the city manager did bring a safety review in um so i'm going to turn it over to you at this point because i don't have anything more to add than what's already been said from the citizens i didn't personally witness this by some pictures so the reason yeah as i mentioned previously this contractor safety declaration will start putting that with anything that we issue for the contractor and ask them to sign that we did recently have actually on the 11th of january we had our level 2 safety improvement assessment from florida cities they came in and did an inspection and went through the documents that kyle put together our safety meetings and things of that nature that we do every month which i'm sure you're not aware that we do that every month we have a safe community so at this point we are looking at doing some maybe a policy of some type to clarify it our bid documents have a lot of that information already in it one thing i do want to clarify about the when we did some research into that lift truck it was authorized to pick up a certain amount of weight and it did have a boost it was it can be used both as a band lift and limited capability of picking them certain ways per certain weighted items and uh and talking to them we did go check with the manufacturer and see if that is correct and the manufacturer told us yes that it could pick up not not something like a you know five ton piece of concrete or something like that but it hasn't had a moon lift on it that was part of the abundant truck so the problem i had is you had under cable mechanism where it should have been over the boom attachment which if there was a fault in any of the ships [Music] you know i i don't remember exactly what it was written for but we did talk to the sign company and we did talk to him reach out to a couple other people in case a lot one thing about florida it's like important in a while a lot less down here i think you already found well i i'm just walking my way walking over like one of my neighbors got beat out of six thousand dollars off the contract for christmas because there's really nobody but even though they're licensed and advocates still get beat are they following proper ansi guidelines are they following proper ocean because i've seen these companies rate cranes great lifting devices um what we just said that was boom left too was it fancy were the guys fancy certified to run that plume lift or truck these are all things that people should be going through before they come on our program that's mine well we can dig further into that but you know i'm sure they were trained uh actually in my previous life where i worked we had a bucket truck it had a boob lift on it and all the operators were trained now they were trained by the company that sold them to us but i don't know that we had you know the antsy stuff and maybe they're training qualified for that i have no idea but in the future we what we want to do is use the safety declaration and put it on them in our bid documents there's plenty of me in the good document talks about they have to beat safe workplaces and things of this nature and uh i saw the pictures i also saw the situation and i did after that incident there was a crane right across the bridge and i could stop and talk to them and their coding and everything they did it was the same as what was done here so here we have a friend that's lifted you know to that third or four-story condo over there and they're doing the same thing so but to protect the city will will ask them to sign the safety declaration in the future yeah i mean i i think that's the least you could do i'm still looking at this picture can't really tell for certain but i'm looking at this guy walking on the sun and i don't see a hard hat so the screwdriver falls from this it'll go right through the skull when we build my house it's two stars and we be more hardhatted you can step on the on the grounds when the crane was there that's the rules that's the oceans and so he's not following it and you know if one of their workers get hurt probably the city's not going to have too much liability but why have it at all you know and i think that's the thing is protect ourselves i'm more concerned if one of our citizens walks by or even if it's not our citizen somebody's just exercising on the bridge and you know there's nobody there that's blocking the sidewalk keeping you away from this thing they shouldn't have been inwards near this i see cones on on the front of this truck here but i don't see anything behind it here people should have been able to come you know on that side but they should have been pushed if necessary to the other side of the street if they had to but that sidewalk should have been closed while they were doing that work okay i'd into this thing i went in and i looked at the crane operating requirements there are no licensing requirements in forward and operated credit you're correct and and only 17 cities in the united states have any kind of licensing requirements they are all big metropolitan areas but if you look at ansi standards enforcing osha and nancy is not our responsibility to find out whether the contractor we don't have the staff to have review everybody's training records and documentation that's all up to the licensing requirements of the county so what we do is we kind of depend on those people to operate to those standards now are there some gaps in this thing i've reviewed all of our rfp requirements our permitting requirements for contractors that aren't working for the city but for private residents within there and all the smaller sub contractor like the art equipment and stuff like that i don't believe we need to get into that kind of detail there there are some gaps i agree with that are there better ways to do some of this yeah i think there is and i think we're trying to work out right now we have all these different things within the city we have a policy within our pers manual delineating safety responsibility of our workers we have some standards within the rfp and contracting requirements detailing the responsibilities of the contractor one of those things that's lacking in there is an onus on safety it tells them hey you've got to have somebody there monitoring and working in progress and stuff like that but it doesn't really specify and emphasize the requirements of safety i think you're right those gaps need to be plugged in with you 100 on that we're working to kind of coalesce all these things and come up with one general city policy to cover some of these things but whether or not the city manager needs to be the expert on ansi or osha or what i don't think that's a necessity i think there needs to be kind of a culture here to if you see something that doesn't look right then you you got to go to the city manager or you got to go to the supervisor on the job and call them out into this question those are some of the gaps there and we're going to try to plug some of those things with the city line policy i i agree there's some gaps here we're working to get there well if i could comment i'm not putting this on the city manager at it on the contract before he comes here and perform work they should have they even though there's only 17 states i think there's more than 17 states now ukraine licensing but that's immaterial florida doesn't have okay state inspection on cars okay i moved here guy comes in does my trees he says can you follow me to the checkpoint caching agency so we'll just give you the directions he says well my brakes don't work in my truck so i don't need you i mean these are laws that you know we don't want or you know what i'm saying it's bad behavior down here when it comes to contractors so i don't want him to have the burden we should just we should just put some stuff in this contract for safety safety like a simple emr ring what is is it below 1.0 if it is you get big work if it's 1.1 or higher you shouldn't even be entitled to work here you're working this comp is out of control well it's not our responsibility to get it to work in labor oh i think it is our responsibility to make sure a contractor is safely performing i don't i don't dispute that but you talk about emro stuff is that workers rights no no no no okay so i'll explain this modification okay i'm not familiar with that that's raining when you have accidents that you have to file forward at this time the other thing is what kind of workmans top insurance do you have are you properly classified are you classified as a construction or you're classified as in agriculture because these people play games they play games all over the united states but these are documents that they should have to submit the other thing is is there a history of doing this one is there a two-year issue just up just up the road 10 miles done okay they sucked out a shed for their golf club of course this is the best example i can use the iphone 10 says i could do the whole shed cart shed through shop 300 thousand dollars wow okay they give him the contract ends up costing him 1.3 million dollars because the guy just left all right and then he did damage to the underground and everything like that when they went back and well he had no experience he was he was a lawn guy all right but he came in with a great price and he looked it looked very attractive so i i really believe that you know you just said hard hats safety shoes it says we should have protectively with them all right all right you put up uh you they were doing welding out here with the flame retardant clothing all right there's nothing in here about following some standards these standards have been around longer than me all right and we should we should just enforce it you see part of the problem is like i said we have references to that kind of stuff personal protective equipment but it's in different places it's not all in one place that you can go to the club the miller beach safety program as it relates to contracting now the thing that really brought me to this thing was this hard rock cafe thing in new orleans and new orleans council went out and started up with this responsible contractor legislation but the problem in this thing is it only applies to city contract it doesn't apply to contractors working for private residents so that's part of the issue here but i think we're covered in some of the guidance we have there it's just a matter of putting it all together in one place because like you said if you go go through the uh recent survey that we had from the florida cities they caught all that stuff and said okay it's a good rating we just need to kind of put it all in one place if you want to push contractor's responsibility with ordinances up and break with you okay i don't want to get into that we're not in the individuals this is about the city now one thing that did come out of it was a lot of these cities are giving a questionnaire to contract when they come in because what happens is when a contractor does work and he has a problem or somebody disputes the quality of the work or safety violation or something like that guess what they just shut down that business they run down create a new business and that's what happens well the questionnaire may not necessarily prevent it but you might be able to change it during the contract review process and if something does go wrong you've got something to fall back on that is one of those things that we are probably going to look at adding to because that's probably one of those thin areas in our contract in the area that we check and follow up on so i'm going to agree with that as well i i think you know this is not to make the city manager the safety specialist for the contractor that's not it his job is to ensure our city safe and i like your idea i mean we've got stuff scattered right now we probably do have most of it we need to get that together in one book that you know when we run for election valley has a sign of this whole checklist you got this you got this book that book this thing when they take a contract over here they should be getting our handbook of safety and they're going to acknowledge that they got it you know they don't want to follow it i'm not going to say it's okay because if you witness it city manager one of your employees kyle or something like that witnesses it you should stop them okay but your job isn't to stand there 24 7 and make sure they're following every safety but with that said i mean are they named insured we could be named injured on their policy have we checked their policies you know all of this stuff should be our checklist to ensure that should something happen we're going to be covered as a city okay i'm not if they'll take it the wrong way one of their workers gets hurt they have workers comp they're going to be covered if one of our citizens get hurt you know what's gonna happen they're gonna go see those folks that advertise at 11 o'clock on television and you know they're for the people and they're gonna be suing us big time so we want to make sure we cover ourselves with every possibility when it comes to [Music] following our procedures if something happens despite all of that we're gonna be in a pretty good way so i think some of this does go back to our city to make sure that they're following this and that these people sign off when they get it and um you know like you said frank if their rating is so bad that's part of our due diligence before they even bid they shouldn't be on our properties we don't do that much of this kind of stuff so it's not like this happens every day and your safety record has been exemplary then i mean i don't even recall any safety problems in our city or anyone's gotten hurt so your your staff does a great job i've seen them wearing protective equipment they do great and that should continue but you know these outsiders like frank says some of these guys are the wild west here and they may not care as much about safety as your staff does well just just to kind of clarify the bid documents they have to give us references they have to give us insurance they have to give us work you know workman's comp the used vehicles that's got to be done all of that stuff is already part of a good document that's that's the requirement and the references are checked now do we drill down and say [Music] uh and you know that most people that give you references uh they're going to be good references let's be honest you know uh they're not but but that's a requirement even in our bid document that they tell us about projects they've done previously um you know where they worked what what the amount of the project was they of course have to have a bid bond so a lot of that stuff is already being done and what councilman done and i talked about was taking that one form and just adding it to it and let them fill it out as a is part of the bid document and get some more information from them but once they're awarded the bid then you know we have all the contract documents have them sign the safety declaration and a few other things that i think for the most part will be fine because we're making and provide us insurance things of that nature i mean we're even making the somebody comes and does something to your house frank is an example when you put the screamer on he has to come to city hall now three years ago he didn't but we had too many instances where johnny was coming into the city and building something he wasn't even a contractor we just found one instance on uh [Music] tower just recently guys got the inside of the house has no contractor's license or anything and we stopped work we got a whole pinellas licensing people and got a hold of the building department and there's a stop work order or stop work order on that property but now we have a pre-permit process that we don't care what you're doing if it's an exception in our ordinance for a requirement for a permit and the only exceptions are painting land tile floor work stuff like that wallpaper everything else has got to have a permit you get your air conditioner change you got to have a burner well now they have to come through the city so we know they're working here and we also make approaches to their business and get their license and their insurance and that all that stuff together now and it seems to work a lot better and we don't have as much non-permitted work in the city you're still going to catch some people it's it's just the way it is but a lot of that's on the homeowner i mean a lot of producers go out there for the cheapest bid and they don't even check to see if their registered business owner's license insured that mails when they followed to give them money i mean the guys should have been checked out you know when it pulls up you should have already known what his company's like and the all vendors should have to go through that they have been going through that process you just spoke about for quite some time and people that continue to try to do work around their property without permitting and getting permits to begin with are creating some of the problems it's just because they're letting in people to do all kinds of stuff they shouldn't here do and begin with it's crazy and a lot of that has stopped since we you know they can't go to the county and even get a permit without coming to city hall first and they have to get an approval letter it's helped us with our floodplain management that's that's an important thing you know but this is an example another house on the bay shore next to mr booth that he came to a consulate you can talk about a couple months ago uh that lady had some guy putting windows in and everything else never got a permit but he got caught well now it turns out because she got caught i guess to some degree the doc was unsafe and a few other things and it turns out that she sold the house and now the house is going to be torn down and now mississippi is happy yeah i'm going to try and i'm going to try and focus us back we're going to talk a lot about citizens here this was on the city this was strictly about city standards i mean that's a whole nother account work so i could just comment like what councilman said that contractor i actually got off of you and he was working in your yard sorry but when i first moved in but then they they were a real real clown act i'll tell you but what i'm saying is i don't want no more bird money okay i think you do enough i think you're overworking over the tax down all right but simple simple procedures on a checklist that your assistant secretary fine you know say okay this is him this is him i don't think that's i i don't think that's going to be a part of that's what i'm saying um you know there's there's three levels of uh interest here we've got work that the city puts our product on that's a contract and therefore city work okay so that's that's one permitting process there that we have to have some insight into there's another one where the private residents have to come to city hall or the county and get a permanent point so we have some visibility on that it's an interesting thing but there's a third outlier out here where the lawn care people are rolling through the sprinkler repair people there's any symbol all day long you're pulling up the streets and we're not quite sure how we're going to deal with all that some gaps here okay in the in the perfect belair beach the city manager would know at any minute what contractors are in bellar beach what they're doing and whether or not they're qualified to be doing that that's the perfect one well i'm not sure maybe there's a way to identify get a contractor's truck a sticker or a work permit a windshield i don't know if there's they're exploring these things and brainstorming them [Music] two areas where i think there's a gap one is code enforcement we've got a new code enforcement guy there and as a as a deputy sheriff i mean obviously he's got a background in safety and it kind of has a sixth sense for hey something is out of place here or unusual but i'm not quite sure that he's uh absorbed our safety culture or whatever so we need to sit down and make sure that he moves through all the policies and understands where our interests lie the second gap i see is there's only one guy one set of eyes robe in the city all day long all night long that's a city deputy right so that's the guy who we really need to depend on to make sure that when something's out of place or notice that our executive knows what's going on there now up to this point we've relied on duke energy to calls when there's an outage or the county utility to notify us we're not main breaks or something like that but we've also seen through experience that doesn't always happen right one of the things that's happening is our contract specifies the duties of the deputy to ensure that the city management and staff are in the loop when it comes to observing something completely abnormal but it's in the contract but we're not quite sure it's filtered down to his standing orders now those standing orders are in the process of being reviewed as i understand it and the city manager is going to ensure that there's a direct linkage between the city contract specification for hey you notify city management when you see something really unusual going on and the actual deputies cast on a blog and standing orders that he knows okay well at nine o'clock i close the gates to the access oh and if i see something unusual i need to pick up the phone and call the city manager the city manager may say yeah we're a word but thanks for keeping your eyes open and be safe out there but just to close those loops so i mean we're looking at this thing from all different aspects of trying to close the gaps are our field staff trained a little bit because they're all over the place and i think they're all underpaid to them but um what i'm saying is they're great people they'll take some more money well i'm going to give it but uh what i'm saying is are they trained to like reserves because you see them all day long what are they trying to like observe like some of the code stuff that's out of place to report back to you is what i'm saying i don't want to stop it at the house well if they see something they will come back one of the two is even authorized to write parking tickets she grinnell went and got trained uh and unfortunately when we got into the training the radio was off on uh it's some kind of surgery or something so we didn't get to go but there they observe if they see something that's very very kyle actually keeps there's a safety long so when one of those people see something they come back and report that kyle it goes in the log and kyle tracks in and kind of kind of investigates [Music] well i mean i'm surprised to hear that we have this notification program because then you know firsthand that it's not happening okay i remember going outside about a year ago seeing like every fire truck in the county going down to york street uh you couldn't get home that night and i said what happened does anybody know that they almost hit like the main gas like not the little one but the main one um i found out because i happen to know one of the firemen but how many other people in the city knew that many people in the city knew like you really shouldn't be over here right now there was no emergency notification and it happened again with the undergrounding not too recently it happened again when they were demolishing the house in belar shore onto 8th street 9th street in that area i found out because i walked outside of my house and i asked what was going on but nobody else did i saw people bicycling i mean we had a gas main that's been hit these were smaller names luckily but that should have been something that these people should have immediately reported to you and even if they didn't do it our police fire should be and then we should have an immediate blast out to everybody because um that was a little scary to find out that people are i mean i'm standing on 7th street but there's people going right past this thing because they want to go get a better look and you know at any point that thing could blow and they're driving right by them on their bikes so we don't get notified all the time they should police officers a lot of times you know i'll it'll be an after the fact thing that they'll come and tell me or what this happened or that happened or but that's more i think because all of those are county utilities and they're really the ones that should send out something but that they don't do good example i know glenn saw it i don't know if anybody else saw it read a song and i think dave saw free car wash last week out here monday night at the candidates tonight i called the county as an example the backflow pipe out here for the fire suppression system was leaking i called him it was probably 7 30 but he said oh we'll send somebody out next morning he's still was sleeping so we called him again it was still leaking when we left the building we called him again and then between the time we left the building the guys were started and they were called again and finally when the geyser started they did come out and turn it off but the next they did so it took three days to get that repaired so but that happened also when they had that gas leak from the home that was taken down it was a bellar beach resident actually that had filled that and recorded it and called the fire department in regards to it and when they came they did shut down that entire street as well as the bulk of the causeway you couldn't go either direction you could not get off the main street to go with that oval nor could you come south from the causeway so both sides of the sidewalks were blocked off the fire department was there everything was under control and there was several several sheriff's officers there to make sure that they informed people you can't come out of your homes you've got to go back you can't walk here you can't do this so they had that all under control that day and i can't speak for any other events but that was totally under control the other day for that one so what are we going to do under safety we have this under control at this point we don't need any yeah i mean i i do like this idea of kind of putting all of our stuff together in one book that we can hand people because there's six different places that's not fair to them it's in one place it's very fair that's and i would just say i mean this was taken by a citizen right so i mean they're seeing it so obviously if they complain to one of us then we're going to bring it up here so if they're seeing it i guess we should be seeing it too so you know if it's perception if it looks bad like this then maybe one of our guys has to go out and say what are you doing you know where's your hard hat i mean these are simple safety rules i some of this stuff frank's thrown by and i know construction pretty well he's well over past my pay scale here so he's you know you don't have to get that in depth but you don't have a hard hat so that we can we can take a little proactivity on that and you know our citizens shouldn't really be close to this it's in my opinion okay just avoid it before trouble happens i think we'd be fine i don't think i need any other action on him something anything else council that was just something i wanted to bring back up originally we did zoom in call meetings as a result of the pandemic and then we extended it and it seems to be used a lot so i just want to kind of bring it back up and see if it's something we're going to keep and keep doing or if it's something that we are going to scale back and so just just bring it up that's all for more discussion you don't mind i'm gonna combine number four with number three because i think that was the issue that i was bringing up was and i'm not i don't talk about any particular person because there's a couple people that are going to start and i want to hear it we're talking about what's the overall what constitutes attendance at a council meeting so people come in remotely whatever the reason good or bad when is enough too much what is the limit and i think it goes to this we before the pandemic we were never able to use zoom if you weren't here you were absent is that simple then the governor allowed us to use zoom and it worked very very well but now that there's been some continuation of telephone in and zoomed well not to really zoom in you tried that didn't work too well but telephoning in and the question is is how much do we want to allow that's well the question is and to robin's point are we going to allow you know continue to use this fred has already said that as long as we have a quorum present we cover the law so as long as we have four people present but if everybody just stays home then we're gonna have a quarter so again i throw out my point and i'll put it in conjunction with robinson no one has any problems what constitutes attendance at this meeting and how much is too much and are we going to continue to use voice and zoom and another reason why i'm bringing this up now is because we do have an election coming up so whoever is on the next council i just want to make sure that we set a good example we don't if we're developing bad habits now i don't want them to keep on so maybe now we need to critique ourselves and see if a is this a bad habit or b is this how it's going to be and just that way going forward for the new council you just do things more smoothly i'd like to also make a couple comments we are all adults and we all volunteer to do this and the hours that it takes is incredible sometimes but i think everybody in this room with the exception of one and you're the only one that i know that has not missed a meeting or called in now i could be wrong but everybody has done it so i don't see where it's being abused by anybody there's different reasons for different things and some of it is virtually instead of this counseling or the city's business as to why so that person should be able to call in i mean guys we're not back in grade school where we have to go to the principal's office with the parents permission slip i mean this attendance thing is just crazy in my opinion it's just too crazy let me correct you i've never missed a council meeting and the only time i ever phoned in was during covent which was that's number one in terms of it being crazy but it's crazy or not it's whether and how much we're going to permit if you have no rules then somebody could come on council and never show up you can mail it in you sit home every night and phone today is that acceptable obviously that's one continuum and you have the other continuum i never miss you never miss leslie okay so but nobody expects you to change your whole life this is a volunteer position sometimes you go away on vacation but you still want to be here so you phone it in i don't think that's a problem but we're between the never miss and miss all the time is acceptable that's all that's come up and you have two people that are concerned about it so i don't think it's crazy i think it's something this council is going to have to address and whether they choose to make rules or not make rules that's up to them i just want to say about the attendance we all agreed on the new attendance policy because the council previous to me to you and you rita um there was a council member who never showed up at a work session but then went to every maybe they went to every single meeting but one of the work sessions how can you vote on things if you were part of the participation so and that was why the attendance came up that is very important that you should come to these work questions into the meetings yes i know we're all adults i noticed a volunteer trust me i could be doing these meetings at home on you with my kids doing homework you know but i'm making the commitment to be here and you know i have this and obviously stuff like that is totally understandable we're allowed to have lives we're allowed [Music] going forward for the next council and like he said [Music] when i was thinking about getting involved with this this individual glenn and nick bavaros and joni shirley and mark bean instituted this whole idea of work sessions and the whole idea is because we're not allowed to talk outside here so this is the only time we're allowed to legally talk with each other this is top ten this person who never attended it never attended budget meetings never attended any of this stuff and yeah the vote comes up and they're voting i mean what the hell really you have not participated in any of the discussion and when i saw that i think i had the same reaction that you did i'm like this can't be right so that's why we put the attendance rules in but that person was actually not violating any rules at the time um you wouldn't be violating any rules to as you say mail it in you know i can go to new jersey for six months and mail it in if i want i don't think that's right and so i think we need to not that we have to come up with rules tonight but we need to think about this because it is it is an issue there are there are people that aren't having it in some cases and it's not because they're homesick it's because they're away for extended periods of time and again i don't want to make it personal i just want to say what's our tolerance limits if a month is okay then how much is okay if six months is okay then that's okay if six days is okay i mean just get a timeline i'd like to uh you know there's kind of a new world order here people conduct business meetings all the time internationally not necessarily being in the country or whatever i mean i know people who are on teams and that are comprised of members of different so you have the technology and communications available to participate okay and be engaged attendance is something from old school okay it has a legal application because we need to be able to have a quorum to continue right but for a member to participate and to be engaged doesn't necessarily mean he has to be physically in the room okay so i guess the point i'm trying to make is that just because you're in a room doesn't mean you're participating or engaged okay because i have witnessed i've sat in this room and attended meetings where i've looked around and seen participants not participating not engaged okay so that's that's the point i will bring up here and again what is their positive contribution to the city i mean to come in this room and breathe somebody else's air doesn't mean that they're a positive contributor to the welfare of the residents and to the city this isn't anybody and i agree with you you could be in antarctica and participate 100 you could be here and reading the newspaper so it's not about that you have the right after you get on council or any of these committees to sit there and never say a word if you want um i will suggest something which we do on a lot of the boards that are on okay i'm like four or five boards so what they do is before the meeting they find out because they all have quarantine responsibilities and they find out how many people are going to be president and they have a split meeting we've done it with the bayer's council we've done it with not what we're trying to do with the biggest council we deal with emergency services all the time but they make sure that there's x amount of members present so that they always have a quarter now we've never missed or we came close once but we've always made it okay but maybe that's something that we do and to glenn's point i mean it doesn't matter to me if you're away okay for a month i don't care and i saying you i'm not talking about you anybody but it's not fair you're quite robin you know maybe you want to be home with your kids tonight it's a little more comfortable to get dressed up come here and all that kind of stuff so maybe we need to kind of split that out and say okay you're allowed x amount of homes and x amount of coming to come into school here if you will but everybody can't just stay home okay i agree you can participate from anywhere our technology needs to improve a bit if we're going to use this because i think once we had two people i think i'm pretty sure we had once you had two people it didn't work too well um so you know we have to step it up if we're gonna permit it i'm not against it but you know the citizens should know what they're getting too if someone is not going to be here half of the time or a quarter of the time that should be known frank well what constitutes a mean is it the council meeting orders work session meeting is three three of them year out right council and work sessions are budget meetings are all considered meetings official meetings that's fine okay and i missed two work sessions i never missed a council meeting and i had horrible horrible phone service okay now mr paz is on the phone and i i'm hoping he hears this clear mr god you've been on the phone i don't know how well you heard i could hear you i couldn't hear you at all mr mayor i couldn't hear any of the council members our city manager was faint okay um we need a better service i believe the process right now has made the road [Music] microphone is what i'm saying um it's poor um i i think there should be two sets of standards a council meeting you should have to face the citizens i don't have a problem a work session with if you're traveling or you know what i'm saying we all know when a council meeting is all right work sessions can pop up like that right so but i think i think you need the old-school mentality i'm a citizen i want to talk to the council and i want to see the council there and i mean i'll throw more into it what constitutes attendance at a council meeting sometimes through again i'm not talking about any person sometimes you can be late okay i get caught in traffic once obviously sometimes people get caught at work they're late how late is too late i don't think 10 minutes is too late you know but what if you show up an hour like two hours late well you still get credit there are people sometimes that had to leave early i don't nobody asks what you're leaving for i assume if you have to leave you have something important to do and you're leaving but what point do you get credit for attendance at the meeting so i don't know these are old questions because you know you do have a four strikes and you're out rule so when did you not attend the meeting you know if it's a three-hour council meeting and you attend two and a half hours did you attend it you know or do you have to attend all three hours of it just throwing it out there because it's it's we've had some issues with some people who have gotten close on this attendance policy you know we haven't had to implement it but what do we do glenn interestingly this issue was discussed when i brought up the remote attendance policy and at that time we decided to just put it aside and say we're all adults here everybody's paid for it everybody's taking a huge chunk out of their private life their work life or whatever let's be adults about figuring this out and so i'll go back to the mentality back then which was is there a problem we're trying to fix that isn't really a problem and i think at the time it was we're all adults when we get to a situation where we think it actually is a problem we take action as a body then i think there was a reluctance at that time i was not quite sure what trump can fix here if there isn't a problem circumstances that there is a big problem there i have something to add [Music] so it's my understanding that we actually have two standards there's one that conforms to the state of florida which means we have we're required to have a quorum beyond that i think that this council came up with their own policy about attendance and it didn't involve whether you were virtual or whether you were in person it was more than you were participating so to satisfy florida we have to have a core before and then for personal attendance you just have to participate and and [Applause] [Music] i know that the equipment sucks right now uh it's it's being addressed but it takes time it's not one of those things that happens overnight and i i have to admit i've struggled since this meeting began uh especially at the very beginning it was terrible but i started adjusting the equipment here it's gotten better but i'm still participating and i am contributing uh or giving my time to the city just like everyone else does whenever they have to attend remotely i think someone else stated that we've all done it at one time or another and it has been difficult but i think going forward as we get the new equipment in we should be able to accommodate one or more people that have to be out again as long as we don't run into an issue where we don't make a quorum don't the consensus is that there's no issues if there's a consensus that there's no issue that we want to discuss right now that's fine i'm going to keep bringing this up as a comment did come up during the council meeting so that's why i took down this work session for addressing we're satisfied that everything is running well right now we don't want to make any of these changes you move on to the next step anybody citizens okay move on to the next item uh next items is withdrawn by me that's item five item six is the map of frank banker discuss map for proposed boat zones and swimsuits that jam sorry city manager reeves but i'm good friend who's also going to participate in focus yes ma'am on console [Music] at the last meeting i gave you what i'll call this option one and [Music] in the then i gave you what i call option two and looking at option one if we delineate the boat zones uh having some thought process and i had a discussion with a couple residents about it it makes sense to me don't delineate the motorcycles just delineate the swim zones and the buoys are going to end up going down the area and they're they're going to have you know the corners on it and the sides those would become the swim zones and that's all we're trying to accomplish and then if a boat would decide to go in they could technically go in between the areas in between the swimsuits one thing i would like to do is if the consultant has consensus with doing it this way then i would like to try to have a public meeting and get some feedback from condos see if we could send the letter out to the congo associations and see if we could get him to come into a meeting here just to throw this out to him because the swim zones probably impact them more than in fact the average person in the city that's the kind of people but i think we're better off just after more thought about it i think we're better off not delineating anything as a build zone other than the sections between the sphere zones and we tried to lay those out a little differently and the little boxes in between they're between two and 300 feet width so i don't think there's a boat that would come in that's gonna be 200 foot wide that couldn't turn around or long i should say most of them are probably 20 30 feet but what we would have to do will create an ordinance we don't have to go out into the gulf and get the gps coordinates we can use what we've delineated here like 80 foot south of 20th street to 25 foot south of 22nd street and build that into the ordinance for the permanent swim zones so we don't have to go out in gps any of this we would have some movies that we would have to move and based on this the option two map we'll probably have to buy a few more buoys but [Music] how much did we lose during this last few days on storms or not how much but how many do we spend at all because actually lost for the most part that were found [Music] refreshment memory if it's not a swim zone that needs a boat you come in there and but if you're not i guess what i'm telling you is if you're not advertising it just the location that's right i'm just thinking after a couple conversations i've had i don't know i've popped in my head just forget about old zones and they get swimsuits how many complaints have we ever had from 19th street down to howard or about boats coming in not that they've ever told us they did so why are we changing i mean i i admire everything you do okay and especially if i put this test on you i'm sorry the problem i have with this is i think it would be full okay like fwc and there's still an existing building in belarus shores fwc hasn't gone out and removed it so why why she spend a time until they approach us and say this has to be done within 30 days or else well they've told me it has to be done or we take our buoys out they've told me that well i understand it but they haven't addressed any other town that has the same situation so they just can't i believe under our constitution in the united states constitution put undue process on our town only when the other towns are the same have the same situation and this is this is like you want to fight let's fight okay that's that's where i'm at right now i mean why would he put any burden on the boat owners um it seems to be working for the past 18 years i was 20 some years 20 something that i know i would have been okay so why table the cost i mean i i think it's just i think from 19 streets north it's always been a safe area all right i have seen boats coming i think brazley you said something sometimes people anger yes but nobody's ever come in unsafely that's what i'm saying yeah and my whole complaint has been from first street to that 17th street building where they come in hard and they come in fixed so i would say we show this i appreciate all the work you do you might want to throw something well i mean at some point they're going to come back to us and say hey what are you doing i'm sure because it's been brought to their attention i doubt it because i email them under fictitious names and they only respond so i mean i think they're a paper tiger when it comes right down but i think they're listening to this well they're the ones that said we've got to correct the ordinance or take the buoys out that's what they said to me and i think they probably said that what would that mean what would be defined is there did they give you a monetary fine or no i've never asked him i'm not interested i'm just saying if you say we're not going to take them out you you could take them okay you'll stay home well i mean if that's what you want me to tell about be glad to tell them that so we bring up the issue to begin with and now and we want it fixed and now that they've told us what to do we don't want to do anything and we want to back them into a corner to see what they're going to do about finding them and stuff we've been told in my correct or incorrect city major language to get this stuff fixed now that now that our beach brought it to their attention nobody else did so if we continue to get it fixed we should get it fixed because now we need to acknowledge the fact we've been told it's wrong to fix our stuff and stay out of everybody else's business that's my opinion on melding [Music] sounds like one of those unexpected consequences we opened a can expecting an answer well we got an answer but it wasn't the answer you wanted so now i'm not against i'm against being told to do something when you let the whole other coast go untouched i just was talking to a person anne-marie and they had buoys there and i said well how do they mark i don't speak okay great never heard problems no but what i'm saying is they're bullying us because of their bed paperwork not following their own codes not following their own walls for the past 10 years i produced three emails where they asked the city manager what is going to be on the buoys when we renewed our permit back in 2020 and those three main males will say i will speed no way okay now that we bring up a safety issue because they left a big gap open okay they want to say oh we'll put the burn on you bellaire beach we're bringing this to our attention but we're not going to do anything about the other unsafe area so i i like opening pandora's box okay i don't have a problem with it all right but i'm not gonna i'm not gonna i've never succumbed to a bully all right i might have got beat the hell over but i mean at least you know i was slamming back i i guess the choice of words don't necessarily mesh with my observations here we asked the question we got an answer but when that agency comes down and gives us municipalities he doesn't have the choice of well i'm not going to listen to that i mean he's supposed to comply with those directors and it's not necessarily up to him to say well they don't do that so why'd you leave well he he is our mouthpiece and if fwc contacts on his disabled council hasn't made a decision or counts those tables i'm not putting any burden on him i just don't think we should have to throw out the money to do this well i think part of the situation is that this thing went in different directions he was trying to manage it with fwc or whatever and then other [Music] entities got involved in this thing why is that crossed people get pissed off well yeah directors come down this is how you do it now so we have that choice i don't think so i think when an agency comes down and gives a municipality a direction on what to do and that's a lawful so i think we want to keep our focus on safety which is what prompted you to make these calls to begin with right and um the agency has told us what to do okay and there's two things that work over here okay the argument you are making is an equal protection argument you're saying well you know you can't tell us what to do and then ignore everybody else and that's a battle if you want to fight and you can certainly fight they can try and find you you consume and we'll spend thousands and thousands of dollars what i'm saying is maybe we know it's a safety issue you know it's a safety issue let's spend the money and fix it okay i know the other cities aren't doing it but i don't really care so much about what another city is doing if they're not doing it right i care about our city and protecting our city and protecting our citizens so if this is going to protect our citizens then let's spend the money okay you've identified it and i'm proud that you identified it you're calling them out for not doing their job there's a surprise state government right that never happened before but let's fix it okay and if that means it's spending the money i know you're feeling and i agree with you there now there i think there's retaliation at work over here they're saying okay thanks a lot mr banker you brought this up well you're here to make you pay okay okay we're gonna fix it and by the way when we do fix it then we can look at every one of those other cities and say you you you and you you're not doing it right you're putting your citizens in jeopardy i'll spend money that's the best money we could ever spend in a city is keeping our people safe so i'm totally behind what you did i stand up for you you've broken your back for the city and the safety i'll support you to the ends of the earth so and i still vote right now because the weather isn't colder you don't have people in the water up until november i still would send in an appeal on the old i've just and i'll i'll do it until probably the day i die okay there's a public record of an unsafe act between 1st and 19th and believe me when somebody gets carved up by a prop from a motorboat all those complaints that you made are going to be with those attorneys that are for the people okay they're going to get every one of those things and they're going to say state you were aware of this and you did nothing about it i'm doing that exactly for that reason exactly so i'm i'll spend whatever you know reasonably whatever the money takes i mean i i do agree look i got you next i did see a citizen thing will come to the citizens as soon as we finish out here when um in terms of doing a public meeting i think that's a great idea because this does affect the whole group of people over here i mean to me it looks i like option one because it's not as much broken up and to your idea our honor option two option one because that you have a couple of boat zones and the boaters here will know where they can kind of bring their boat in and go out but the other people it's gonna look like one continuous swim zone plus you've got nice big swim zones not for nothing a block and a half i mean i'm 63 years old i can do a block and a half from my sleep so that's not a lot of swings this is pretty nice you have some nice swim zones here so um but you know let's hear what the condo owners have to say because they're going to see this day in and day out and there may be some stuff that we're not aware of when we look at this glenn i i'm kind of in favor of the option one just because i like the words swimming zones one thing i would ask is i mean if you were talking linear feet i mean have you measured out the differences between what you're dedicating to swim zones between two options there's a little more in option two as far as linear feed yeah because no what am i saying backwards there's more in option one the issue is where we put the boat access in but i still maintain that option one or option two you should take the boat zone off completely you know because i guess how i'm looking at it from uh if i see a row of buoys going down the water line the only people that are going to know that a boat can go in here is our residence so so i agree with that but here's here's the issue i see okay if you look at morgan and drive there that's morgan park right so those people are going to pull it to morgan park pull out their coolers pull up their beach chairs walk across the thing and where do you think they're going to park and swim they're not going to walk 50 yards up the beach into the identified swim zone they're not going to march south guess what they're going to park their beach chairs right there and hey i've seen you both going swimming and then you've kind of been defeated because of just a human behavioral aspect so i like the big swim zones i think that's great i i see a behavioral fishing board apart that one just kind of jumps off the page because people are going to walk across there sit down and watch the kids go in the water and swim right there and that's why we did this version to alleviate that i think you're spot on with the public hearing again [Music] i like option one but you could probably solve the morgan harping if you just maybe flip-flop that last one zone with the ozone flop so just make an extra long and if you look are each one of these white dots supposed to be buoys yes well if you look at that option one has two less boobies so you'll save money here because one has 23 the other one has 250 i think eager zone actually solves the problem the problem is is we've been placed on silma's radar and we have to change the way that we mark our buoys uh at the end of the day we want to allow our votes to come in but we want to have a perception to the outside world that those aren't allowed and in either case we're establishing a straight lot of buoys which would tell anyone that's only outside of those buoys stay away so i'm happy with either one so i think consensus we have it here is that we don't have to pick one tonight but let's bring a public hearing and maybe that should be separate from the council meeting we want to do it as a special counsel meeting or having no i'll just do a public meeting on those separate separate will the council be in attendance though for do you want to i would think you should be but it's up to you it's not a call if it's a called council meeting then no it's not a callback it would just be a public meeting to you know advertise something new well um i don't have our city attorney here but so now if let's say four or five of us show up um we can have a sunshine issue here well the meeting the public meeting is we'll announced that but okay if we have to call it as a special counseling we can call it special counsel meaning you're not required to attend so that would be fine but we will need four people i don't want to see the citizens come out and you know four of us not show up i saw bill lusk's hand down bill would like to speak i would please come up here thank you [Music] yeah you can use that that's fine thank you bill lusk 3010 hibiscus drive west uh first and foremost happy new year thank you for everyone's time thanks for letting me carve in some time on your last workshops and um love where you're going thanks lynn for the options i want to back up a little bit with some of the discussion and i just again put it from a local resident a voter perspective let's stop drawing attention to the fwc right or wrong how we feel expenses tied to it using the terms bullying etc um i don't like the idea of getting pulled over while i'm on my boat a guy sees my address and knows hey you're one of those bellar beach people you've been harassing us i don't need that second thing just from a local resident perspective going beyond the condos and you keep pushing the fwc you might see your buoys stripped on the bay side that's a much bigger amount of space that we're dealing with buoys right now that the more we draw attention to to what we created ourselves here the higher the probability is we're dealing with the bay side and no buoys and i can't even imagine the city without buoys on the bay side so it's time to take however we got to where we're at moving forward i think these are really amicable solutions i will just point out a couple things option one is if you are a voter it doesn't work real well if you're going to the north or south side of the city and neither were your destination you might live on x street and the family's on the beach and you want to hold you're having to do it north or south unfortunately in option one in the middle boat zone is the morgan street public beach so just from uh let's nip it in the butt make everyone happy see what the condos think i would maybe recommend residents outside of condos get a viewpoint but then option two solves everything and moves us away from this decision with the fwc should we fight them or not i don't is it can i ask what is it about option two that folks don't like is there something particular about that that's jumping out of you is it the wording of not having boat zone is it the amount of boat zones because there's only one more what is it about too that doesn't seem to be sitting well so i'm going to have you make your points of that council answer yesterday but that's what i see is time to move on thanks for the time putting into it let's move forward let's learn from the lessons of trying to do good and something else happens as a result other than that thanks very much time and volunteering i appreciate it thank you any other citizens i'll bring it back to council well i'm always going to try to do good i don't care what the outcome is but um again i think everyone knows my feelings um this doesn't solve anything that i brought to the attention okay um does it make bellar beach more safe yes i i totally agree and as a council member next to me uh i would change my vote on the docks because i'll go along with whatever the majority of the council wants to do in this issue i think for tonight i think we in again i'm not going to i don't have words in everyone's the consensus that i'm feeling here is that let's move this forward in terms of getting [Music] public behavior public comments on this and then i think it's going to come back to council for a final discussion as to really where we want to go right there has to be an ordinance written anyways maybe the special we can maybe have the i mean i don't know how to do this but maybe have the residents both on option one or two and see which one they like whether like even if it's just you know but just have them tell us the only thing i would say with option two i would say this the swim zone on option one you have to 19th street and option two it's at 20th and i was just thinking that 19th street parking lot a lot of people like go one house over to bellar beach to put their umbrellas so that might be nice to tax this also so just extend that one and then option two would be fine for me [Music] maybe they don't like one or two but we'll hear from them and the council can make a decision after that and move through the ordinance process just a couple of things frank i'm glad you did try to do good here if you did do good and keep up the good fight okay these are bureaucracies they're supposed to be helping us and sometimes all they're trying to do is help themselves so you can help anytime you want and i'll be standing right next to you if you ever need my support and a piggyback on that i mean i think regardless of all of that if we implement one of these and make donna beach safer than i don't think we gave into bullying i think to share some with you on the bullies um i think we went ahead and do what's best for our realtors and i think that's okay we didn't lose anything from the uh human factors aspect of this thing on the beach side how will you designate hey this is a boat zone swimming at your own risk and it's because here's what i'm saying unless there's a sign right at the water's edge saying hey boat zone you know you swim at your own risk just like hey we don't have no lifeguard signs every 50 feet or whatever i mean it's kind of like a personal responsibility thing people are going to come out i don't see boys it's water it's a beach i'm going to sleep [Music] i guess my question is is how do you identify that there's an increased risk in those areas that's a human behavior kind of thing and what's well i guess it's the same issue now right now how do you know where it saved this one well because the assumption is it's a beach right right yes but i think it's not so much my understanding it's not so much for the beach side as the swimmer it's more from the other side the boat side where you see all these buoys and you're like oh well this is a deterrent to go in and then if you do go in you see all these buoys and you're like okay look what's going on it's not like a free-for-all so i think it's more my understanding it's more from the water side as a deterrent for somebody not just gonna go you know the line of boobies between the buoys and the beach and going cruising all the way up they're gonna be like oh maybe that's a shallow area that's a not a safe area to be the people that are here that know okay this is the designated area and our residents are hopefully will have more common sense hey i'm not going to come in at 30 miles per hour and beach my boat and hit a few swimmers on the way so i think it's more of a deterrent not a oh it's safe to swim here but 10 feet over there not does that make sense but the hazard's not to the motor the hazards to the guy on the beach the swimmer so he comes out how does he distinguish where it's safe to swim or not and the the unexpected consequences by having just these two boats on this guess what all the boats are funneled into that one small area and now that swimmer has an increased risk of being hit by a boat right but i think right now the same risk is there with or without the booty buoys because there's always a risk to a swimmer no matter what so i don't think that having a 20 movies out there is going to protect a swimmer from a crazy boat driver it's supposed to just help deter responsible boaters from doing crazy things but it's not safe anywhere as long as you have access unless you have like a mesh fence that is a designated swim even on clearwater beach i mean a voter can go in there and plow all the beachgoers if they really wanted to or if they were drunk there's not going to be a solid love to deter it's just more of a visual hindrance and i understand the goal was to protect the swimmer not the boater so i understand you're trying to attack the problem from the boater's side but what you've done an unexpected consequence is you funnel all the boats into one area i'm asking how does the guy who goes to the beach understand that he's at an increased risk if he swims in that area i'm not just you know you're a valid concern because if you're if you're in this swim zone and you're swimming you know remember your head's in the water right you're not i mean i'm not talking about that if you're swimming and you know how do you know what it ends you know and that's your point and it's a valid one so how do you know when it ends because we're limited what we could put on buoys i understand that but like you know if you're looking at a swim zone here we have a buoy in the middle here that kind of demarks where the ending of it is does that say like i'll tell them after this because you're not going to know if you're swimming here you're not going to know that your swim zone just ended and voter [Music] i don't think you're ever going to eliminate that i understand well i i contacted the coast guard on something that you just brought up and i said told what we're looking to do i said i just didn't tell them you know exactly what i said we're looking to establish swim zone boat zone swim zone ozone so can i take my boat keep it out of the swim zone area come in full speed into the boat zone area and then leave again as long as i make sure i get it out of there before the x-wind zone and herby ply or his reply first place petty officer hudson said yes okay basically it's up to the town to establish an ordinance in the state so um it could be a mess that's what you see right and the only other thing i can think of is like you know there's brightly colored like crab trap movie things like having multiple on each side of the boat zone that was kind of like a well the other thing the other thing would be to establish a no weight zone but we had the boat job you know you haven't voted you're going to have married but you need to put an idle speed you know wait that's not so that's the only other loud i can think of to delineate that with a bunch of so then that's more obvious for swimmers don't go past the orange car i'm not trying to be perspective [Music] every time it seems like every time we have something that might work there's more questions but it's better to figure out the problems here then when we get out of the water and spend all this money so and that's kind of like option one would be nice because it's much longer swim zone so you have less chance of inadvertently going into a boat zone but still you can so i don't know you were you know the step away but you brought up the point that basically if you're swimming in a swim zone how do you know that the swim zone ends the safety of the swimmer so if you're swimming out of it how do you know that and i think it's a valid point and i don't know that we can change the color of the buoys because we're limited by fwc right well in looking at the map the swim zones are basically delineated by a box okay so if as an example i'll just use this middle one if you're in this swim zone here and you're swimming that way and you go past that buoy then you went out of that swim zone so and you know just to uh if we wanted to create bigger swim zones that's fine and have less boat zones that's fine but my belief is i don't think we need to get into delineating the boat zones because if you do then you're telling anybody and everybody oh you can come in here funny maybe maybe i wasn't clear my concern is the guy on the beach gary unloads his cooler in his beach chairs walks out pops and stuff and i'm not walking 50 yards up or down the beach to get to the swim zone kids have wall come in when they get burned or whatever how do we delineate to that person or to that parent that there's an increased risk in that boat zone i mean is there like a sign right at the waterfall she's saying hey you're swimming in a boat zone you are at an increased risk of getting kid i'm just asking well well see i i guess i'm i would interpret that if you put a sign up that this is a swim zone within the buoys then if you're in here these are signs on the beach yeah we could put a sign up or outline the swim zones okay because it's like you're creating a box so i would think that the average person now i'm not going to say that everybody's figured that out but you know you can't be 100 on anything i agree no that's a good idea every single public each access point put a sign that says there's something like yeah whatever the verbiage and then it's swim at your own risk like kind of like now when you go to the beaches i don't understand me you swim at your wrist you have a risk of being hit by a jellyfish a stingray or shark you swim into your breasts and my only reason that i kind of like option two more is to get rid of the bosom delineation because it makes it look now if we want to make as an example if we want to make this all a swim zone i mean that's why i'm just trying to to not create something that we're going to tell the world that this is a bow tie i'm going to make the same i'm still bored i'm still having a hard time getting over glenn's concern here because it's a valid one okay so when i look at option two it's hard maybe when you see this but if you know these these little blue lines don't appear in reality okay they appear on our map so right okay but here let's say i'm here this is a boat zone right i'm pointing right to the middle here yeah so i got a box too here's a box that says swim zone here's a box that says swimsuit here's a box that says swoop something here's a box that says i'm in a boat zone well and i may think that i'm good and i'm really not so i like your idea that you got to do something on the land because you're you're definitely you're not going to know if you're swimming you know right well option one will help with that because the swim zones will be so ridiculously big you're not going to be like oh there's a movie there's everything and we can enlarge these swim zones i can take [Music] what i'll call one two three four five okay i can take uh one or two and make it all one big one leave a space in between them and three and four make it a big one and a space entertainer so you know i we we don't currently have a problem it's just the issue is we've got to read and figure out movies and the concern was that if somebody wanted to come in with a boat or should they come in and that's really you know a concern so if we make them bigger so be it they could be as big as the what we've done here and just take the boats on and off the map why are we getting a little bit ahead of ourselves because don't we i think what you're going to hear this is just just my personal opinion if if you put boat zone in front of that area of this end this country is going to be upset because you put boats on in front of them if i put a boat zone in front of a my mark same thing if i put a boat zone in front of leslie's condo this might come after me uh well maybe put the boat down so it's between two so at least half of it's kind of in front of one so you still i'm just sorry a little compromise what we were trying to do with the second option is yes there are accesses but we want to keep the swim zone in those accesses that you walk in and realistically the only people that are walking across the street in the access like it right around 19th street like the hotel that's our residence they aren't it's not somebody's dropped off and they're going in there down the street at my park that's our residents that live maybe on 22nd or 23rd street they're walking across the street going to the beach the same down by harrison harrison might get a little outside from the marina parking but realistically the walking accesses other than harrison are really our residents that are walking in it's it's not you know johnny from marvel or somewhere so i think it's a good idea to let's see what the condos have to say and you know i throw these maps up there you may have a magic marker and it may change completely yeah i think it's good to present them with two maps based on like some of the issues we raised fix those and then of course there's gonna be new ones but try to give them the best two that we have right now they might come back and say we don't want any vote could be i mean because a good majority of these condos are for and i believe you're correct because i think it takes away from the around them right i believe you're 100 but i also know that we're not going to make if 100 citizens show up or not make all 100 happy so we just have to deal with we have to do something we just have to try to do it for them get a dart board we'll just get some cars and throw it all right that's where it's at i know we're talking about the citizens but there's a whole bunch of city streets up there too those citizens have voices right let's get it out for comment let's make sure the citizens understand that this is only at this point consideration i mean i don't want anybody in a panic um make sure that's clear to them yeah um so that you and i are not feeling 100 phone calls and let's see what they have to say because they may have ideas that we haven't even thought and make sure you say that we want their feedback like they have an input it's not our decision you guys have to deal with it it will of course posted on the constant contact that the condo associations will probably what what i would suggest is we'll send a letter to each of the management companies and this may be a good balloon to fold fast green heirs to get up there to get some exposure on this two residents of belarus said hey this is in play right now and we need some real feedback from the residents wayne might be interested in it since he lives in a condo [Music] why we're doing this yeah yeah what's changed why do we need to well i think once we start we'll give a little background of why they seem to pass these are some options and we're open for right yeah we're going to have to tell them that unfortunately the statutes have changed and we need to come in compliance with our our current buoys and these are our options we have this option what do you want okay so you know what we have to do yeah okay this will happen within the next month is that yeah that's that's my hope [Music] fair is that city event because i don't remember approving that so uh it's it's a fitness thing that's that's why we did it and we we just handle it like we do with fitness classes okay so it's like the yoga class [Music] uh i submitted 1116 next last year regarding boat martin which is supposed to be discussed tonight okay so we'll pick it up under general business okay it's yours you have the floor right well lynn you did you gave me my answer unless anybody has any other questions yes frank um in the november council meeting a resident address parking his boat in his driveway for less than 24 hours without a permit and his argument was and i believe he has a lot of neighbors and friends or whatever have boats that don't have docks on their house they have to park different area lots outside the city so what they like to do with the night before they sail bring them in there make sure the batteries in charge them etc not not doing any repair work or whatever so it seemed like there was at least four people counseling over to address 94 to 17 parking um by and i talked to the city manager that you could get a 24-hour permit emailed to you or not just notify the city manager i bring my vote in tonight you'll be out here tomorrow morning so i changed a number of things um section section uh 94-17 [Music] uh i changed 48 hours and 24 hours such things i would like to see on the council meeting for a vote next month so can we it has to be run less than attorney before we put it up there okay so we can get a comment from mr riley then well and as i told frank a couple weeks ago i said we are making 94 is the last section that we're doing from the planning board and there's no sense duplicating changes of an ordinance for 94 twice so what i would fred actually clear and i talked about that this morning that he got the email from frank and we'll just incorporate that in with the 94 section changes that that's the last section that's left to adjust instead of doing two different ordinances just for just one little thing let's do one of them can you incorporate it for the next meeting that's what frank is asking uh that's a question i'll have to talk to fred about i don't know if he can or not but he did tell me he would try to get that done and uh what was the other one patty i'm blanking the other ordinance fred said he would get both of those done and back to us [Music] we should try because this council has two more main meetings left i would rather not have something that is approved for first reading by this council and goes to another council i mean there's going to be change on this council one way or the other and um you know that a new council is considering what an old council had half done so it really should get if frank would like it on the next meeting i'd like to see it on the next meeting so it gets first reading for february 2nd reading for margin i'll speak to fred about it again but he even felt the same idea why why create two ordinances for the same section when there's a lot of other little things that need to be adjusted oh i guess you're looking at the entire section not even not just 217 right all 94. and there wasn't a lot of changes that they recommended but there were a few things and you know fred's been working through those periodically so we can get that all cleaned up also so i'll talk to her forever a long time ago we had an issue come up council member tries to generate revenues it goes directly to the city attorney and gets spun up and based on that there was some discussion hey you know sometimes it stuffs backwards because ideally the way it should work is an issue should come up before the council discuss it debate it come up with a consensus and then we direct the city attorney and the city manager and at one time we said this the city attorney takes its marching orders and direction from only two bodies one is the city manager and one is the council the council okay now because the president was set a long time ago that privilege of going directly to the city attorney by an english or council member was kind of granted as as a good faith gesture well we didn't once we'll extend that privilege to another council member in this issue but the [Music] the consensus at the time was again city attorney takes his direction from the city manager or from the council not from individual council members and i think we need to have a discussion whether or not that's the way we intend for things to operate henceforth this is suicide at the same sooner or later we've got to draw a line in the center we we do it the way it was intended because there are only two people who can obligate money in this city that is the city manager and the council not individual council members so when a city attorney gets an email saying hey take a look at this resolution or ordinance i wanted for the next council meeting that person is a de facto generating work for the city attorney so i guess what i'm looking for at this point is how are we going to do business i'm going to go ahead and agree with everything you just said um councilmember because also it's not helping us control attorney fees one of each individual council member just fires off stuff to attorney and have them look at it and we don't you've been discussing to see if the rest of the council member thinks it's an issue or a concern if the code group is already going to look at that section it should be just looked at then i don't know why we're making it into a special thing so i think we need to go back to where it's either the city manager directs the city attorney or the council as a whole not individual members that's my feeling on it always has been and always will be well for the record here we had a warf session 11 15 where i brought this up you took a a vote there was four members of council directed me and then you directed me to contact the city attorney um 8 am the following day i sent him this change of ordinance so i follow all the procedures but since i've been on casual i've seen resolutions pop up during the council meetings which i don't know if the city attorney addressed them they weren't addressed at a work session i plan to throw one at us next month i wanted to throw one at us last month but i missed it by day but uh yeah so so i must be yeah so the procedure that our city managers followed first off there was a change in who can directly um assign stuff to the city attorney that's been followed after that changed it was followed before it was changed it was followed to the contract and that changed that he said the council and the city manager however it's been the city manager's policy correct me if i'm wrong because i'll give you specific resolutions that if a council member brings a resolution to the city manager as long as he deems it even remotely you know appropriate he would have the city attorney drafted and sometimes we did see it for the first time at a council session no discussion one of them personally affected me i'm not going to get into that discussion was there a waste it might be it was okay i would have never let it out of council work session and i'm sure people may feel that about other things so we can come up with a policy if we want to say everything has to be brought up at a work session first that's fine we're not going to bring it up now so frank banker gets you know no opportunity to get his resolution out because i think for the rest of this council's term as far as i mean we bring whatever you want if you get the votes but um for the rest of this council which is two more sessions we should follow what we've been following which is it goes to the city manager and if he deems it again he's the gatekeeper he's exercised i think his authority within very good reason okay he's not he will not exclude it but if you bring up some crazy things that he goes what are you doing this for he can knock it down he'd have to justify that to council it's never happened so if he thinks it's reasonable frank hasn't i don't know what you're really students but he tells it to the city manager he thinks it's reasonable it goes to our city attorney we no longer have but it goes to our city attorney and you drop the resolution that's what we've been following if you want to institute a policy that says it has to go through section kind of like what they do in tallahassee or washington it has to go through committee first before it gets there it's not a bad policy but let's just pick one and follow right now the policy is you go through the city manager if you want any resolution and he thinks it's okay he proposes it to the city attorney and then you can have a resolution without discussion that is possible my opening statement was this issue yeah i have no problem with this but in all fairness what i think has been happening is the city manager has been working basically as a courtesy because we started off with wrongfoot for this thing and at a later point we kind of said wait a second now this doesn't make sense the debate and discussion should take place at the council level and then we decide to task a city attorney rather than a resolution ordinance appear for the first time at the council level only to be debated there and then guess what it goes back to the city turning another time because we didn't like it the first time so you know it's the cart before the horse kind of thing and all i'm saying is this is your sign i'm saying maybe it's time you kind of draw the line and say henceforth this is how the council does business we have an issue we want a resolution we want an ordinance let's bring it up put it on at a work session let's debate it discuss it come up with a consensus city attorney deal with it and we'll take a look at it for the next council i'm just saying i think we've been operating on it courtesy because we got up on the wrong put on this thing initially i'd like to weigh in on this yes dude the way that i see it is this the city manager is the ceo of the city and no council member has any more weight than the city manager does so it's as council members i believe that any one of us could lobby for the city manager to raise a concern to the city manager and then it's up to him to decide whether it warrants bringing attention to the to the city attorney however if that doesn't work the alternative is is that the council as a whole reaches the consensus then we we can order the city manager to uh to give that information over to the city attorney but i don't i don't think it i don't think you can just one way or the other uh sidestep those two processes one or the other so i'm going to disagree with you entirely um and i'm going to use the charter as our proof they'll do respect to the city manager he works for the city council that's our city charter so we don't take direction from him we certainly take his input but we don't have to convince him of anything he's the chief executive he's the he executes what this council decides i have no problem with glenn gunn's um proposal if we want to say everything goes through committee we're not going to do it on the fly tonight that should be passed at a council meeting if we're going to do it um again we have a council member who has a resolution pending so i would suggest since there's two more meetings of this council finish this council out and that could be the first thing that gets done on the next council but in terms of having to lobby the city manager with all due respect that's not what i got elected for if you take a look at the pyramid citizens are on top the council is next the city manager and the staff staffer below that that's the way it goes in our city and that's what we'll follow that's right and our city manager said that tonight how a foul direction council gives me i mean i agree he does yeah he does we just gave him authorization for 10 different things tonight so you know but we don't we don't micromanage it and tell him everything to do during the day he doesn't need to bring 90 of the items maybe 95 of the items to us but there are certain items that he does bring so so that's but you if you have consensus and you want to move that forward as a resolution you can move it forward to the next meeting if you'd like so i'm not knocking it down i'm just that's my opinion is we should finish this council out at this point anybody else have any ideas anybody else have any general business just i saw a piece of paper here then from dep is it no that's that's the thing you ask about and we got a responsibility that was the one that they told us we had to happen by february so you already got it in the back right yeah they they sent it back saying they got it so i just put that out for you i want the governor knocked it on my door he was pretty serious about his warning or anything else folks 803 thank you um we need a motion to adjourn absolutely okay and everyone in favor aye aye everyone have a good night next meeting is february 7th is it 7th okay"
