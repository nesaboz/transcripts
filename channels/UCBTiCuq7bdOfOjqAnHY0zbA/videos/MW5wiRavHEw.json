defensive so we can come back for us uh yes council um presidents i'd like to say it's been a pleasure serving the city and i'd like to compliment the people that have come on the council for taking so i should hopefully stick my nose thank you for all the time you spent with me and helped me through various [Applause] things i'll extend that invitation to the other council members to speak thank you just 90 seconds to express my gratitude to mark dean and jody shirley for their dedication and contributions to the city of the beach both of you leave behind your own individual legacy from rv underground you provided the city with a glimpse of what a premier city could look like a kind that left us a blueprint and a model for how that we're not doing and hopefully we'll keep moving in that direction and for jody shirley she was a guiding inspiration and gave us a lot of vision on how to keep the ship of state here miller beach our level keels and get ahead of this infrastructure issue with the storm water fees and a path forward for uh slowing down the burn rate on our reserves and keeping up with the [Applause] infrastructure [Music] thank you very much again and we'll see you at the next council okay mark okay so i want to welcome to my right leslie matera at the far end and frank banker leslie's returning to us i think it's the fourth time on council match fourth time on council something okay so the next item of business is the nomination election of vice mayor um by ballot we're gonna do voice ballot tonight on that it's okay with everyone right now we have one person you can nominate yourself so you can nominate someone else if you like or vice mayor now the vice mayor serves as the events that i'm unavailable or if something happens to me permanently they take over my spot so dave gaddis has expressed insist so far do we have anyone else who has interest on the vice president leslie mataro is raising her hand so she shall be considered anyone on the telephone we have two people there's leslie and tara and david at this point we go to the candidates themselves if they wish to say anything to us leslie's here [Music] [Music] thank you because dave goddess would just be heard [Applause] thank you would any of the citizens like to speak in support of any of the advantages of history please come up with a microphone here your name and address she is the best support she is most experienced she says before should anything happen to the mayor or he cannot attend she could be the best [Music] officials i think he's done a tremendous job and come a long ways in learning the ropes of municipal management he took a lead role with communications he's moving us forward at a very rapid pace to try to bring us up to speed on remote attendance and he comes from a very level-headed business background and i think we can really uh leverage that kind of intellect that is very level-handed common sense opposed to getting business jobs [Music] i i also want to speak in favor of leslie detero leslie sat here before i do she spent activity three full years as mayor and ran the city and i've seen her at the use and she handled them well um i also she was former president of the big c so she knows most of those mayors are still there there's a few changes but i don't think she would feel too um you know lost with the new mayors there's pretty much everyone that's there the last part of being in mayo too is going to these other events so uh lesbian you have nicer with that um patty would you please call voice vote councilmember goddess councilmember shirley i'm sorry i'm sorry council member shirley i'm sorry council member slope thank you councilmember swope hey yes vice mayor gunn depends mayor manzo let's leave the town council member bankerd council member notaro okay so it's four votes for dave gaddis and two votes for leslie and taro so dave gaddis will assume the dude's vice mayor okay for the final item of business tonight we have consideration of revolution 2021-02 it's a resolution of the city council of the city of delaware beach florida authorizing signatures which are to appear for all city check and draft writing and instructing any financial institution to accept the certified copy of this resolution as evidence of legal authority over city accounts and establishing an effective day the description is that this authorizes the city council members and the charter officers as signatures on our bank account the first [Music] what this is a great opportunity for council members by signing the checks it's a very quick glimpse into the finances of the city an opportunity to ask questions about where the monies go on what it's [Music] something we're doing slightly different i spoke with the city manager about this earlier is it used to just be vice mayor and myself who would sign these tests either he or i had to come in and counter sign every check and glenn said it is the opportunity for us to be a set of eyes and saying what's going on um however never no issues and that's the way it should be once in a while we found a little you know check that had to be changed minor but there's no problems but this is the way to see what's going on and see where the money's going see how things are being handled in the city this is being opened up out of all the council members so any council member could be called upon to do this and it's important to remember that once you sign the same manager has already signed that check so once you sign that check that's it for the last several eyes from lab so please make sure that you know when you get called upon for this that we do those like when governor is saying as closely as possible that's all i have to say let me open it up to the citizens i'm sorry i notice it says april 2021 yeah there was a revised copy yeah i'm sorry it must not it probably didn't get it or not signed and that's when you passed around afterwards when you prove this most likely will be correct no one on the phone citizens any comments back to council with frank banker having your last words okay so this is consideration of resolution 2020 102 a resolution of the city council in the city of bellarmine florida authorizing signatures which are to appear for all city checkings after writing and instructing any financial institution to accept any certified copy of this resolution as evidence of legal authority over city accounts and establishes an effective date but today it's going to be today uh a yes signature we'll get this that we all will do signatures on these bank accounts oh yes votes not in clerk you have to call this by person so if you'll follow the rule council member swope council member gattis council member banker councilmember notaro councilmember gunn hi mayor manzo hi so it passes six to zero the um original pocket is with the city manager now well that's the city clerk so before the four individuals here leave please go and see her to sign it and then she will get the remaining signatures as soon as possible that's all we have for today folks um good evening we'll see you beginning next month"
