    "transcript": "[Music] good evening everyone happy new year welcome to our first meeting of 2022 this is the regular city council meeting january 3rd for the city of valor beach please rise join me in the pledge of allegiance [Music] council member leslie otero yeah councilmember rita sloane here vice mayor dave goddess yeah mayor joseph manzo yeah city here thank you first item of business is the approval of the agenda motion please motion by leslie montero a second second section any discussion citizens anything back to council all in favor proving the agenda aye hi in one post 7-0 passes the agenda is approved as this next comes citizens comments citizens the way we do this if you've not been here before we have a podium up here please come up identify yourself your name and your address you have three minutes of time please address the council and um there's rules published for the rules of decor and i'll summarize it in one sentence just basically treat us the way you'd like us to treat you just everybody be nice and we'll have a nice meeting with that i'll open it up to the floor any citizens like to speak hancick john hansen 23rd street bellerin's mr mayor council members several months ago this body reviewed a bid to upgrade microphones for this room and this body rejected the bid because it didn't include visuals the ability to zoom and so on and so forth i believe it's been some three months now maybe a little bit longer not sure i'd like to know what the status of that is why it's driving on we're into a new year it was way back early 21 if i'm not mistaken that we brought this forth still no action other than some wiring done but we still have the same microphones we don't have this new device fitted second item i'd like to bring up the media on 22nd street is full and two weeds going to see i'm fighting losing battle with those weeds going to see and going in my yard i've lived here almost six or seven years now pride myself the fact that i have zero weeds in my yard now i've got to go around over my life and spray those weeds they're coming across the road i'm fixing to go over there and kill weeds myself because they've really gotten bad and whoever the long surface is that contract with you need to fire because they're ineffective so somebody from public works ought to take a look before you grasp the next time and see how mature these weeds have really gotten that's all god thank you mr hansen i'm going to bring both of your items up later on if you're not allowed to answer back right now so i'm going to bring one up to the city manager and the other is unfinished business any other comments by citizens seeing no other hands on closed citizen comments and move to the presentation from the pinellas county sheriff's office and code enforcement officer i'm not sure who wants to go first [Music] just to let you know in the last one didn't enable a couple of complaints as far as partnering was concerned and also had two cases where we had uh contractors reporting without purpose and if that's kind of important for any questions first i want to welcome you i've heard a lot of great things about you so i hope we bring that to bellarmine um we had a meeting not too long ago and it if you haven't seen it already if you haven't spoken with danny we kind of went over what our philosophy is of how we like to have code done and essentially it's an education process it's not to see how many summonses you could rack up or anything like that i think that's the way danny approached it he got rave reviews we didn't get very many complaints there's always going to be one or two people are going to complain just because but for the most part you know those complaints all went away so that's i certainly mine and i think that was the rest of the council's philosophy as to how we approach this and if you follow that i think you're going to do great thank you city manager okay great anything else before you go anything else with the council citizens any questions thank you again welcome do we have a presentation from the sheriff i see someone coming up checks conducting traffic stops and occasional issues with my issues but calls for service at the resort november was pretty pretty good month i think the big thing was december i only had the car chase that was december right [Music] yes [Music] i said last month that was great work and great work by our citizens too and one of our citizens gave him a real hard time he tried to carjack that's great so absolutely excellent job so again i i thanks you've done a wonderful job and a wonderful job to the citizens who are keeping an eye out because that's that's your partner basically on the way this works and looking forward to a great 2022. dave there was a motorcycle accident that happened apparently it was very serious and it shut down traffic in all directions had a causeway bill can you kind of give me some details on that well anytime you have a motor vehicle accident that involves anybody with a motorcycle depending upon it's called the mechanism of injury they take that very seriously and they'll call a trauma and when they do that it's basically just to make sure that the patient gets to the hospital as quickly as possible and that medical staff are at the hospital prepared to render aid as quickly as possible and when there's an accident like that traffic can be shut down for quite a while to make sure at least for our agency we have a major accident investigation team so if it was a situation where that person had like threatening injuries or then we would call in that specific team to continue the accident investigation and the roadways will stay shut down and we will protect the scene until we get word from the hospital you know we'll send the deputy to the hospital and once we find out that there are circumstances that do not require that team to come out then they can kind of start wrapping things up but anytime the motorcycle did it have anything to do with the new traffic pattern from my understanding it didn't um unfortunately sometimes people when they ride motorcycles they think they can fit in the spaces where they shouldn't or they will split the lane whereas they will ride in between two cars and unfortunately when they don't pay attention to the traffic laws and realize that they're on a very small vehicle with no protection and they make bad choices so the new traffic pattern actually really working quite well um i had the same question posed at eleanor shore and you know the days of traffic getting back up to sand healing they're all from maybe especially during the summer and it takes you 45 minutes to get from you know all the way down to here and it was it was quite hard now things are moving a lot smoother people are people are catching on um and it hasn't been as much of um issue as i think some people were expecting it to be that for the most part all the people who live here and either in any rocks beach or more and use the causeway to come across familiar with most other people who are in the area they are following suit you know we've had some minor fender vendors where people get confused because they're listening to gps because they're not around it so i guess the true test would probably become spring break something will have that influx of traffic that this is hopefully going to fix thank you very much absolutely any other council comments citizens any comments let's get your thank you very much okay next we have items four and five the consent agenda item four is approval of the december 6 2021 city council meeting minutes and i provide as approval of the city attorney monthly invoice for legal services i take them together in motion please motioned by frank van verde second second second by robin no discussion go right to a vote all in favor aye aye anyone opposed passes 7-0 that concludes the consent agenda move to the regular agenda one item request city council direction regarding requests for on-street parking passes for election canvassing this is made by the city manager motioned by the mayor second second by robin hockey i'll pass this was my request to the city manager for parking places uh parking passes for five election workers so that we could accomplish election canvassing i'm not going to recuse myself because this affects every single candidate and every single political issue that could possibly come before bellar beach so it's not just my issue the way i learned in emo is that if it affects everyone you don't have to recuse yourself you're not approving this for me you're proving this for everyone so what are we asking for what we're asking for is our parking policy right now says that you're not allowed to park on the street well you're allowed to park on the street insert with certain exceptions interesting city we have here we allow you to park on the street when you're having a party we allow your landscaping to park on the street we allowed your dog groomer to park on the street we allowed your [Music] i guess your roofer and your construction people to park on the street we allow you to host the party or and have a drink and spell and you're allowed to park on the street but if it comes to free speech for polit politicians we don't have a carve out in our law does it make the law good now it makes the law bad we've been talking for the last three or four meetings about first amendment first amendment and when you're going to stop or put obstacles to political free speech you're never going to pass scrutiny strict scrutiny of your law okay and that's exactly what this does this is not a law by the way that this council passed or the prior council this comes from before then it comes from before fred reilly was attorney i want you to know that um but it is a problem okay uh so i asked for these passes and mr riley reviewed the law of attorney riley reviewed it with mr reeves and he see and he said he needed a compelling reason so the compelling reason is first amendment political canvassing which is protected by the first amendment united states constitution if that's not good enough then take the equal protection clause um because you cannot we don't have a no parking policy we have a limited parking policy so you can't allow the dog room to park on the street or the landscaper to park on the street but you can't allow a politician to park on the street presents an insurmountable obstacle um so we need to change our law and in the meantime since there's an election on right now and it doesn't matter if there's an election or not there's political happenings every single day of the year you can go door-to-door and give any political views you want you could talk about washington you could talk about tallahassee you could talk about new jersey for all we care you have the right to knock on someone's door and pass out literature and engage in conversation they have the right to tell you they don't want to talk with you and you have to leave at that point so we need to change our law and we need to change immediately so that it doesn't interfere with this election and anyone else's rights it's really that simple there's really no no discussion on this um it's not there is no carve out right now parking at our public lots is absolutely not workable um you know harrison avenue avenues or uh i guess belle isle extreme of our city is well over a mile away from some of those lots and it's ridiculous to expect that when again the dog groomer gets to park in front of their house that is not a state interest it's not a constitutionally protected interest so mr riley's recommendation was that we can possibly change the law that's fine we don't have time to change law for this election uh running out the clock is not an option so that's what needs to happen it needs to be changed permanently but this council can give the relief right now that is necessary also in closing remind you that we relax this law and it's not in there for the city-wide yard sale multiple times in the city festival okay so that was all permitted with that i'll leave the floor council yeah i've got a couple things to say i'm going to be extremely consistent in my viewpoint as i have been in the past this center was filled with the residence when you wanted to go ahead and open up the parking for the festival by the sea and multiple other events to the point where the residents felt and even stated in the meeting that they felt like they were being threatened i went out and spoke with a number of people regarding this and they do not feel that we should open it back up again i agree with the attorney fred riley's comments that we should not change it that's what i got out of the mmo um you asked for fine parking permits i'm sure that there's five people in this community that you can reach out to that would voluntarily give you their driveways if that would help you you have the marina parking lot that can be used you've got a number of other opportunities to go and knock on people's doors so i'm not for this and i appreciate our city attorney's memo orbit so i'm going to be consistently going for what the citizens want and they have told me they do not want this they have never made this any other council i would agree with what um the slope just said i i'm not in favor of this there are plenty of driveways that you can park in a friend's driveway to do these um this political um politicizing um there are parking lots one's over the dollar shore up there city hall [Music] anyone else yes i i agree with the uh the two previous comments i mean the thing about casting aspersions on commercial vehicles and private gatherings the difference is those exceptions are in the existing ordinance so it's not just arbitrary people showed up at personal gatherings or whatever parking on the street commercial vehicles the dog groomer or the landscaper come under operating businesses during the proper times during the proper days so those are existing exceptions the other one that you bring up is not an existing exception and the other thing i i agree with is there should be enough open or parking spaces available in people's driveways who might support the candidates or whatever what i do take exception with this typically when there there's a personal gathering and a person comes in to apply for a permit there's a exact date there's an exact time there's an exact place and there's an exact person who's sponsoring that i don't see that i i don't agree with the option of just signing off on blank open-ended permits for parking on public streets it's been an issue all along and i think this community takes pride in the appearance that is presented in the community by open streets and not parking on the streets and that sort of thing thank you anyone else all right um are we going to be then consistent by enforcing you know no more party parkings and other things except this mr gun said that if you're doing the operational business absolutely you should be able to okay you know personal private gatherings is it is an exception that's within there is your permit well i understand it but um you could actually use that personal gatherings for campaigning and free speech and that's what i'm saying so are we going to eliminate everything except business opportunities i gotta get my lawn done roofer comes out he has to make it up cutters that are 30 feet long he needs to do that i have no problem but if we're gonna say you can't park here because you want to go around campaigning for somebody then i i don't know where you're trying to work no i think the difference for a personal gathering to fall within that context of thinking is that if you were having a gathering to introduce someone or some issue to your community or your neighborhood or something like that you would have a specific sponsor you would have a specific place at a specific time and you would issue purpose and say oh you just put one of these in your in your windshield it's not just hey i'm going to have uh people coming over wherever but i think wait wait wait wait let's let's give everyone else the opportunity to speak all right anyone else i don't think frank has finished he's been there okay it's been going back and forth and i just wanted to make sure i'm in agreement with a lot of mr dunn says but like a if we're going to go out campaigning um it will be a specific it should be a specific time okay i don't want people about you know my door at nine o'clock at night or six in the morning um so that would be you know specifics there um and what about when we're having the uh the yard sales you know we open up our streets for that so i i think all i'm looking for is consistency and i agree i mean with some other comments you know you do have the beat jack says lots of department i i walked i woke this whole i woke the whole city i didn't park in anybody's park i parked at the beach parking lots when i campaigned i knocked on all the doors i wanted to visualize the city and see what was wrong with the city what was great with the city okay um so i like um you'll see me on golfboard every other day up or down all right but um i just want consistency here i don't want this to be a political battle you're you know saying well i'm supporting this guy and i don't think i have enough people to not want to do it so i'm not going to support it i'm all about consistency and i think if we weren't allowing for the old sale then we should consider that because i know the next time there's a yard sale the first thing we're going to bring up is hey can we do on-site parking so you're saying no to this then you should say no to the yard sale which wouldn't be fair the citizen so again i sometimes i feel like we bring up issues and our opinions are made by the person bringing it up or who they think it's going to benefit instead of thinking about hey let's think of this from the perspective of the citizens which is why we all are supposed to be up here you know i have my own personal opinion about this but when i think about from talking to citizens and from their point of view to me it seems like this may be a reasonable request but maybe smaller parameters not a a free-for-all like oh anytime during the week any hours maybe a set number of hours set number of days maybe certain days of the week and do that and i think this would benefit any candidate three of us up here right it would benefit three of us so it's not like this is just to benefit one person it could benefit three of us up here as well as one of them i sees out here is running as well other candidates so this isn't going to benefit just one person and this going forward would solve issues next march and the next march after that every time we have an election this would help resolve that issue that's going to be brought up because i would hate to see somebody going door to door frank you're in excellent shape you're in better shape than i am and you can walk the whole city but not every candidate physically can and we have to take that into consideration they can't park at the marina or morgan park and walk all the way up and down bellow and tiffany and all those side streets so they aren't physically able so i'm thinking about that as well so i i support this because i could see this could be a big issue in the future and i think if we take care of this now but maybe close the parameters a little bit so it isn't a free-for-all like glenn said um so i i'm kind of agreeing with franklin what he's saying i'm gonna speak up on this um i put some thought into it and yes whenever you compare it to other events that occur in the city it does seem a little slanted however there is one big difference all of the other events these are people that want people parking in front of their homes that's the difference as far as campaigning i don't want the opponent parking in front of my house all day would you and that's uh that's pretty much all i've got to say about it anyone else how about i put a timer i'm sorry put a time limit on the parking permit that after one hour the car has to be moved like you said you don't want people when people want to have their friends and neighbors over or whatever and they're parked in front of your house they're not just parked in front of your house they're parked in front of a lot of houses and maybe those residents don't want those people there so put a timeline on this and with that being said like with the yard sale glenn may be having a yard sale in front of his house and now all the people go into his yard say oh parking in front of mine i don't necessarily like that but hey and the benefit of what's good for the city to benefit glenn and the other people around you know what i'll suck it up and deal with it and you know practice my backing up skills as i'm trying to get out of it so to my understanding we shut down the yard sales uh last time because of the potential threat of being sued i mean i was remember that entire council meeting so am i incorrect city manager that we did not shut down the yard sales because they can still personally get a permit for one on their own but we don't do city white ones anymore so that doesn't open up our streets to just everybody coming to park and is it that private property that they're parking up to go to that sale and as far as you know all of the other events and people parking in front of everybody's driveway it's done on the safe side the event is and to my knowledge most of the people that have events those people that are parking in front of their houses are there at the party as well so i don't know that that would ever be a concern but if it is we can certainly look at it but time frames you've got strangers coming in you're going to have five passes too that nobody knows nobody knows these cars if they're not strangers then they have potential outlets to park in the people's driveways that's what is so confusing for me is because what are we going to do go to largo and have five people come over here just park whenever we don't know these people what's going on in the neighborhood things happen in the neighborhoods that you know are very worrisome to people they don't need to be called a sheriff because somebody has a special parking permit there to do this so i mean i'm going with what the city attorney said as well his email said we should not make this change so i am right there with you well based on his email i'm reading he made the following recommendations to consider an amendment he didn't say under no circumstances changed this he gave us options so just for the citizens who don't have the copy of this email so there's no confusion about what the and maybe we can get the attorney to speak for himself and speak for his uh memo instead of putting words in his mouth mr geneva if we use that word consistency well the consistency is the ordinance the existing ordinance let's be consistent with the existing ordinance and there is no exemption for the item that we're discussing right now if we don't like the ordinance we've said it before let's change the ordinance well we don't have time to do that in some people's minds or whatever so i say you want to be consistent you apply the existing ordinance as it's stated and along the lines of the city tournament if you don't like it at a later date and just to make another um comment based on rita's on the whole stranger thing i mean i would like to think that any candidate would go find five people randomly off the street and say hey hand out my pamphlets hopefully it's these people you know that you trust that know your issues know your passions and can relay that i think all of the candidates up here would say they would pick five worthy people and as far as strangers i mean i don't know all my long guys and the guys who uh run the mower and the hedger and i don't know my pool guy and his assistant and i don't know glenn's long guy and pool assistant in front of my yard so there's strangers in our neighborhood all the time parking so i can't think we can make that argument because we have strangers every single day in our community and not one person that's an eye about that and that's very true that way you can ask those people or anybody that's running and i'm not even sure and maybe our city attorney can answer this for us that the people that are running should even be making comments because this does directly impact those politicians at the present time so i i'm kind of concerned about that as well but i don't know about your situation with your people being strangers i know all my people i know all my neighbors people i mean it's a very well known community so i just if you're not going to go to lifelong bring in strangers then ask the people if you can use their parking lots i mean it's from in the driveways it should be that simple that way you're not inconveniencing the entire community just to pass this and just go out and ask those people i mean gosh i could get five driveways in a heartbeat right now i mean it's just that simple i mean i i don't get why you guys want to change the ordinance that we've had in effect and i can certainly guarantee you that if it was for any other reason or a reason i brought into this council and i don't think you could deny it that it would not pass periods so it's not about what defends board or who's run it i think all the politicians that are running should stay out of the whole entire conversation in my opinion but you know we're doing it so let's do it anyone else oh god this is tougher than i thought folks we've been doing this now for the last five sessions talking about first amendment rights and we're just not getting anywhere i think this piece of wood in front of me understands it because we're just not getting anywhere okay let's dispel some of the garbage okay the letter that i wrote says the election activities will occur between 9 a.m and 6 p.m mondays through saturdays now when i did that i'll say i made a mistake because i was looking at the solicitor's rules for our city but we actually have campaign things that actually are a little bit more generous it's 10 a.m to 8 p.m daily including sundays for all your religious folks now you don't know the people you know that illegal guy caught on the lawn i bet you don't i bet you don't know where his city where he lives and by the way supreme court has already ruled you cannot ask people who are campaigning for a permit cannot make them tell you what they're gonna do i cannot believe the mentality sometimes that i hear and feel we always did it that way that makes it right yeah there was a lot of laws that this country had that we always did a certain way that didn't make it right and this law is not right and mr riley knows it because it will never pass strict scrutiny it's a restraint on expression and you will never convince anyone that it's okay to plant a dog groomer who you don't know for beings okay versus political candidate as for you don't want them did you hear that comment you don't want political freedom that's what you don't want look at john hansen right now a man who i admire tremendously his service to our country defending that exact right we're just ready to throw it away we don't care as long as you've got a nice flower bed that's okay but how dare you go door to door as for finding driveways to find driveways you gotta knock on doors i don't have to give the reasons and by the way as i said in the beginning you didn't listen carefully this isn't me does joe biden know people on belle isle with donald trump how about ron desantis does he know ashley moody does she know this is every political candidate plus it's every political pac if we want to recall certain people on this council you have to go and make an appointment with people i don't think so that's not what the supreme court says says you have the right to knock on doors and when you say you can't park on the street you gotta walk let me tell you something i used to be able to walk and run i ran seven consecutive new york marathons and i ripped up my knees and sometimes i'm lucky if i could walk 20 feet right now because i got bone on bone so i'm not walking to belle isle on a good day i could run to belle isle but i'm not walking there and you can't make me just because you passed the law years ago and do consistently wrong doesn't make it right we talked about this when we were talking about the right of anyone up here to speak about pending litigation another restraint on first amendment speech we talk about this when we talk about people making comments before other councils and having retaliation we talk about this when you try and stay the mayor can't say this or the vice mayor can't say this and i said it over and over again you don't lose your rights when you come through that door as an elected official you don't lose any rights we have a right to canvas without obstruction not just me every single person in this room you could go knocking on doors from 10 to 8 every day of the week the only thing says in here that says if a person doesn't want you on the property you have to leave you have every right to go up to their doorstep and i could use people inside the community where i could be like leslie matero did last time when i ran against and used people outside the community could use anyone i want and anyone could come into this city and knock on doors we don't make the constitution rules you swore to uphold the constitution ladies and gentlemen of this council you swore to uphold it that was that oath it wasn't just the photo op it was an oath you swore to uphold the constitution and now you're wiping your feet with it let's go to the citizens yes mr hanser i hope i do this in three minutes john hanson 22nd street i've heard compelling arguments from both sides of this issue but i disagree with those good or not in favor of it based on what i'm sorry i have to say this is what the mayor just said trashing and trampling unconstitutional i'm not the only one in this room sworn off upon the defendant and to sit there and say that because it affects a candidate or candidates that suppression of a constitutional right and that really really kicks me off and i don't care what you think about that but i defended it and i defended to my death what i haven't heard is compromise you can temporarily [Music] put an exception into this ordinance until such time as you have ample time to modify the ordinance and again to the mayor's benefit his time limit that he proposed was less than what's allowed by statute so what's wrong with compromised people and he clearly has stated on more than one occasion it wasn't just for his benefit and i read all of this the other day and words were put into the attorney's mouth he made a recommendation he didn't put it in stone this is what it's going to be but i'm suggesting that this council find a way to compromise because again it does not affect one candidate it affects all of them going forward and it's good until the election it can be done i don't see why i can't both sides get what they want i think to a point but don't trample on people's rights you've heard so many times the fact that we have the right to freedom of speech in this room i know with three attorneys but yet what i don't see and i don't hear is compromise it can be done anyone else miss vancouver i have time and time again had landscapers from bel air shore park on our street and do the landscape across i don't know them i don't i don't know who their lawn men are and they park on our street time and time again and do their lawn not only do i not know them they have repeatedly on several occasions through their palm fronds and stuff up in our neighbor's yard so how is that justified i don't know and as far as the festival by the sea okay we had a parking plan in place okay and it was addressed right away because we only allowed parking on one side of the street and as far as the garage sale goes i believe it was suspended because of coving okay because of coating so all these spins that are being put on things in this room are just horrible that that last garage sale was canceled because of copen okay why are we having a garage sale when we were in the mineral code that was the safety reason and the liability for this city and as far as your other events which were wonderful that the new park has gone on i didn't see any poop law about any kind of parking that might go on at their events none no no no worries about parking on the street so it's one group of people causing the same habit and the same problems because they're trying to play politics for things okay when is when is this city going to wake up and realize they keep violating people's rights over and over again this is not the republic of balor beach or is it thank you yes sir uh richard 119 high street i think my uh brother in the navy did another good job at the constitution i'll uh i'll forego that lecture but um i do want to reiterate can we see some compromise i mean i can't speak for all citizens but i'm so sick and tired of this binary alignment with one party or another and being completely obstructionist trembling on not just the constitutional rights but our sanity and our rights we live here we're so sick and tired of this crap of going against and over promising and politics that creeps into it where's the compromise why not four hours a day why not monday through thursday why not you can only park in front of someone's guard for 30 minutes i don't care but let's find some rational actual compromise and get things done stop saying well i'm not on that team so forget it it's no and it's no way let's just abandon the whole thing and i also want to reiterate this nonsense i don't care because you've done something to reiterate the mayor's comments for 20 years that doesn't make it right we've done dumb things forever let's just stop and use some common sense so please can we have some compromise and if we're going to sit here and if we're going to elect officials can we please have some intelligent discussion on how to get to yes if it's a timeline if it's a days of the week if they must have parking stickers from bellaire beach i don't know what those are i can come up with 50 of them on the top of my head and i'll run the damn commission to figure out a way to get to yes since our elected officials can't ever seem to get anything done but argue in these meetings we don't care about decorum what we care about our results and our taxes and our city and our rights and our access and all the reasons why we pay to live here so please please could we see you just get to yes and stop wasting all of our time thank you thank you anyone else yes jamie entrepreneur 332-0 and this was drive west had seen no discussion about the quantity of permits that would even should be considered is five the right number one the right number but it it is allowed to go through whatever it is decided if you somehow have permits that every candidate be issued the same number of permits immediately and not have to go through a real world what applies for one needs apply for all and we need to sit here to make sure that all candidates will get the same number of comments if that is what the council decides to do but is by the right number maybe it's only one thank you thank you anyone else back to the council vice mayor yes i'll make a few calls okay cool you're right okay um this matter came to limb as a city manager and he boarded it on to me and it was a request by joseph manzo as a as a candidate for five uh parking to be issued five working passes so the question that i address is does the city manager have authority to issue five passes for the purpose of political canvassing so i did what is you know absolutely typical is you look at the city code provision to see if there's a provision that addresses it the provision is a prohibition and i'll come back to probably why there's a prohibition but the prohibition is that you can't park on the city streets with exceptions so then i looked at the exceptions and to determine in my mind whether there's an exception that fits the purpose of political canvassing i did not find a an appropriate exception so my initial answer is there's not an appropriate exception and if the city council wants to amend the ordinance there's a a very uh direct way of doing that and that's the thing that should be done i encourage the council to consider that as adding a exception that would give political canvassing and you can set parameters on what that would be so that in the future this you know there that is a important uh right to to canvas but the to me that that's the first question is whether you should consider in the future enacting an amendment to the ordinance to add an exception okay i recommend you do that i think that would be reasonable i think it would clear up this issue for the future i want to step back a minute and it's my understanding that based on the history of the city you have narrow streets and there is the discussions i've ever been in on in the two years about parking have always been related to health and safety and whether where are you going to create situations where you have bottlenecks that lead to an ems vehicle or a fire truck not having access to an emergency that's that is a obviously a very important concern and i'm you know would feel fairly confident in saying that that is probably the underlying reason why the policy is that you do not work on the streets uh long ago when the code provision was made the council chose to make some exceptions to that so that that's my understanding of of where you are the i i struggle a little bit with the the argument that's being made in that the uh the prohibition against parking that is is not a prohibition against uh going and doing canvassing you can go do canvassing there's no prohibition against that the issue is whether uh not getting a permit is such a uh you know intrinsic part of canvassing that if you take away the permit for parking now you have effectively taken away the ability to canvas and you know i will tell the city council very honestly i like any of the other lawyers that are here could make a case going for for either side of that and you know this is one of many things that i think is you can make an arguable case either way so for for the time being i believe leave that there the listening to the the tone of the discussion that i have done today what i frequently do i have chosen to say nothing until later part of the discussion um the the several citizens that talked about compromise i i think have a lot of a lot of merit in the the suggestion that they make i will tell the council and you you all know it when the issue came up about the sign ordinance and it was specifically political signs the city council chose to [Music] lean in the direction of making sure that political speech was allowed and i thought that was a very appropriate measure that the city council took and that you you aired i don't want to say error but you leaned towards free speech and i would encourage you to do the same thing here this is a uh the thing that i don't like about this and i said this before with the sign ordinances i don't like when you have an ordinance and you are making an exception and you're not following your own law okay there's always an arc again a counter argument to be made you have a code provision and you're not following your code provision this issue came up and and since it this this letter came in in uh december um this was the next available time for it to be discussed at the council and lyndon lynn and i discussed it and said this is something if you all want to um consider a flexible choice then that's up to you you did that with the sign ordinance and i think i will say again you did it at that time so that you were leaning in favor of free speech rather than the other direction so really there to me there are two issues that you need to really focus on one issue is do you want to amend the ordinance so that you add an exception to for political speech if you're going to do that what i would recommend you do is do consistently like you've done in other with other things bring that up at a workshop and at a workshop you discuss it and fashion a you can give direction to to myself and city manager to fashion a provision and bring that to a workshop and then you'll address a specific provision that would basically be the exception so that's one thing i would recommend you do second thing i would recommend you do is consider whether you want to do like you did with the sign ordinance and say we're not going to enforce this no parking provision for this purpose and it's a very narrow purpose and it's a purpose that is aligned with um leaning towards free speech okay although i again will say free speech and parking permit to me are two different things but canvasing you again could make an argument that being able to to get access to people is is intrinsic and canvassing and you know like i will again say any of the lawyers here could could argue either side but i would encourage you to to really focus on the second issue which is do you want to um do some something that would compromise and that's really the question i would suggest you discuss yeah i want foreign say that um thank you for your very impassioned comments um and i agree with you guys i mean i think this council we have not been doing a good job of trying to compromise and see other people's point of view and come to the middle um and the effort of compromising i i would suggest we do what fred reilly is saying put in maybe using the wrong words and um a temporary exemption for this election season maybe and i agree you know maybe not bypasses three may do it or whatever number um maybe limit the hours so it's not as widespread so it's more contained and um get and then if we do go ahead with that then i would think that absolutely everybody would have it like i would say as soon as we said yes patty would call not tonight but called every candidate and say hey if you want them you're here come and get them and you know use them um so everybody has these same rights and it doesn't benefit just the people present at this meeting so i agree fred i'm all about compromise so we've got to figure this out so it benefits everybody not just for this election cycle because it's whether or not i'm running or not i like i said i'm not using my personal views i probably need a parking pass but i'm doing it for the next election the next election after that and maybe somebody who's running who is handicapped and can't walk the city and needs access so i don't think we should put any restrictions on anybody access to be able to do their first amendment right so what can we do as a council to make this work for not just the benefit of this election cycle but the future ones and come to a middle ground we can work together and make this work for everybody i'm going to go ahead and agree with the city attorney on the statement that we would be breaking our own rules and that we really probably should move this to a workshop and so that we could address it more clearly and more thoroughly rather than just all of a sudden tonight stop stopping to rule and put in the temporary exception i mean there's people that have first amendment rights all over even you know fellow shore indiana speech all of those have first amendment rights and sometimes those are you know compromised in taken away from them because of other people's opinions but with that said i just really think that we should look at this a little bit more thoroughly so that we don't open up the city to some kind of an issue and go with the city attorney's suggestion of moving it to a workshop and to in the meantime follow our own rules and our own open business mr gove i stand on the idea of consistency the audience is written it's there there's a protocol if you want to change it the city attorney is interested if we start examining inconsistencies every time something comes up that doesn't agree with the ordinance and we have to start making subjective decisions for everything that comes up that differs from the written existing ordinance then we are going to spend a lot of time because people are going to start pointing their fingers saying well you did it for him how come he can't do it for me or you didn't think of this so now you need to give me a temporary exemption while you go ahead and amend the organs i think it's a very slippery slope and i don't want to go there i think there's a process for dealing with it but i don't think it's it's in our best interest to start dealing with subjective changes whenever something crops up it's not not there is the council want to start making these subjective decisions every time somebody raises a question about an existing ordinance that makes these jobs very difficult especially the city manager because somebody comes in applying for a permit or says well hey it's written right here you can't do that well you did it for him i'm applying for a special exemption so does that mean the council is going to start doing this every session start looking at all the possible exceptions to the ordinance i don't believe that's where we want to go that's his job we do the ordinances if we want to change the ordinance there's a protocol for head let's do it makes his job easier and it allows us to strategically focus on the big issues we don't need to be managing both dogs we don't need to be managing parking permits that's his job and we've given them a way to do that and it's in the ordinances mr mansion so if it's his job how come he didn't do his job how come he referred it to this council now you can't have it both ways he knows how to do his job when he wants to he unilaterally approved those city-wide yard sales in fact i took him to task twice for approving it without counsel permission he knows how to do his job when he wants to and he knows how to kick the can into somebody else's yard when he wants to so it is in our belly whip right now to decide on this because the city manager didn't make this decision he was given a letter from me um december 7th was it december 20th no i'm sorry that's fred's letter my letter was what i think was december 5th right december 7th whatever it doesn't matter he was given that letter and to that point okay with regard to my letter okay i'm sorry my letter was december 17th talk about compromise okay i didn't ask for unlimited parking i'm not going to bring in 100 people but you know if i had the ability and i had the resources i had the ability if i wanted to bring in 100 people and canvas the entire city in one day and put cards on everybody's door in one day you can't tell me i can't do that i don't have that ability but it would be nice to be able to okay i asked and said this is a quote i would anticipate that these election related activities will all occur between 9 a.m and 6 p.m mondays through saturdays and we'll conclude with sign pick up the day after the march 15 election quote there will be no overnight parking and most street parking for the above purposes would probably be less than an hour or two on most city streets i know because i did this last time and i rarely spent more than an hour on the street but if i get in a conversation with somebody or one of my campaign people get in a conversation they shouldn't be limited by any time limit i can assure you no one's going to be parking in front of someone's house all day and having a conversation with them with there being 1500 registered voters in this city as for this specious argument that we do this for our safety well you don't do it for your safety if a landscaper can park a truck that fits up fills the entire property with of a 60-foot wide property then you can't have a problem with a car that takes up about 15 feet and we're not asking to park on both sides and i will remind the city manager that we have asked time and time again that that be codified for construction workers who continue to park on both sides of the street in construction zones and it's not on their permit that they can park only on one side now there's no limit on how long your party can go you want to hold a three-hour drinking binge three is fine five hours go ahead ten hours go right ahead because we like drinking in bellar beach we just don't like politics who called it the people's republic okay you're not going to put any time limits on it there'll be no compromise the law here says between 10 and 8. i will tell you as a candidate you will never find me or any of my people out after dark we come in when the sun goes down i don't want to go to people's houses at night it's a scary situation for both parties we were off the street i sat down and i tried to avoid sundays and if i didn't go out sundays it was sunday afternoon so this is nonsense that we're trying to do this for safety we're not going to park 100 cars on one street park one car on one street and spend an hour knocking on doors and then we're going to go to the next street and the next street and the next street and the reason why there's five it was a guest commit based on the staff that i know that i have and how many people can reasonably be expected to be on the road at any given time we might use one of those permits three of them five of them no one's saying that it only is for me as i said when i open this up it's for everybody everybody has the right to the same amount of permits and as long as you're doing the political stuff you're fine what we're also forgetting in here is that the freedom of religion is just as important as the freedom of political expression so when you're redoing this ordinance make sure you carve something out for the freedom of religion because those folks who knock on your door and want to spread the word of the lord have every right to do that even if you don't want them even if you don't know them even if you don't know the lord you have they have the right to knock on your door and you have the right to say please leave so you can't kick this can down the road the election is on now i'm a qualified candidate so is robin hockey so is dave gaddis i see two or three other candidates in this uh in this chambers right now and every person here can work for or against the candidate if they wish so everybody in the room has the right and every person in the city has it and people beyond the city have it so i would recommend or just exactly what this says issue the passes temporarily you can fix the law later but kicking this can down the road is akin to saying no political expression you are putting an insurmountable barrier in the leg so don't tell me i have a free free expression and i got to walk two miles to do it when the landscaper can pull right up to that house with his dually and gigantic ford f-350 i'd like to make a comment uh had we had this conversation six months ago i would say that it was a legitimate concern but now what we've got is we've got one candidate asking the city to change the rules of our election it's already started everyone's already had their uh they've got their strategies going we all know what we're up against and mid-stream we're being asked to change the rules it's not right i'm not voting for this um a couple of comments um i don't agree with kicking a can down the road and i don't agree with well this ordinance has been in effect for however many years therefore it can't be wrong and glenn i do believe that we need to have changes when changes come up otherwise we might as well be in the 1940s you know might as well be uh you know a woman who can't vote things change as issues come up we have to debate them we have to change them if an issue comes up that's important to one citizen we have to give that respect and right to that one citizen to talk about that one issue and take it seriously and if that means we need to make an ordinance change guess what we need to do it because the right thing to do is what's right for one citizen or for all and let's face it every issue is not going to be right for every citizen nor is every citizen going to agree with it so i don't agree with the whole kick in the can and every time something comes up we have to change the audience guess what that's our job that's what we're here for is to make changes to things as things evolve and going if this came back up six months ago you may not have an issue that to me i thought he was the first person who thought that it was an issue because you know honestly if i was going to go canvassing i probably would have parked my car and not even thought about getting in trouble because that wouldn't cross my mind and then the first time someone said something i'd be like oh crap you're right i do need a parking permit i didn't even think about that because i just don't think that way i guess so he's probably the first person who thought of it and honestly with the way our politics have been going lately i can see people chasing people down and saying oh look so-and-so parked there for more than five minutes let's call somebody and give him a ticket for illegal parking so i don't really trust anybody at this point not to do anything underhanded um you know and going back to bringing up some other issue we had you know there were people on this council that had no problem and even supported the idea of giving e-legal parking passes to bel-air shore for a televised whatever for tom brady over bellar shore had no problem with that but now has a problem with this and honestly i probably will not benefit from enemies parking i don't plan to go parking and go through her door you know um and walk the whole entire city because i just don't have time i'm sorry you guys can talk to me if you have anything um but so and this has nothing to benefit me i'm just thinking of the other candidates the other seven candidates that this would benefit them again if it benefits one citizen then i'm all for talking about it and figuring it out so and you know you know dave you're against it but you would probably benefit from this if we used it because then you'd be able to go canvassing as much as you wanted and you won't have to worry about walking and let's face it it's going to get really hot here before the election so nobody has to worry about walking and sweating and being all sweaty when you talk to candidates so this could benefit all of us so i think this could be an issue going forward with future candidates with current candidates so even though this may not benefit me as a candidate right now it may benefit somebody else and as a elected official i'm here to make changes that will help benefit our citizens so i think we should vote for this and do our part and making changes when changes are needed so i also agree with rita maybe this does need to be rude to her work session to be more effective because i don't know can we can we make any big changes tonight or do anything with this spread i don't know what the protocol is so if you were going to to do something i would suggest you do the same thing as you did with the sign ordinances very specifically do a resolution to my knowledge you'll have a workshop in mid-month and if you wanted to have a special meeting to address this in you know work or in a special meeting where a resolution would be in front of you that would be very specific then that's what i would recommend you do so then i agree with rita let's move this to a work session so we can well if you're going to decide to do something then to me the decision should be yes we want to do a resolution that temporarily authorizes this and puts in parameters and and i'm telling you again it i have some misgivings about it because you know you now do are doing a resolution that is arguably inconsistent with a code provision and that is not normally a good legal practice but you know i i'm trying to fashion a way that you could compromise if the council wanted to do that i need to make another comment too i i will take issue with the the point made about the city manager in the two years i've been here i have worked with him on many many things and almost every time the first question i ask him is is there a code provision that you're aware of that authorizes this to be done and that that is the first thing i'm going to go looking for and the the reason i wrote the email that i wrote is that unfortunately in the climate that has been here during the the time i've been sitting here he gets criticized if he does something and he gets criticized if he doesn't so the the question that he asked or given i discussed is are you currently authorized to do this and after looking at the code provision my answer was currently you are not authorized to do it and because you're not authorized to do it if the council wants to amend the ordinance then they should consider doing it and if the council wants to consider a interim measure then that's up to you all to discuss and decide that to me is infinitely reasonable so you're having the discussion and whatever you decide is the way you go my final point will again be like the sign ordinance i highly recommend leaning in favor of doing something that fosters free speech i don't see how far you can go too far wrong if you do do that else mr baker yeah um i i'm i guess i'm one of the weird candidates i believe we should listen to the citizens and you have three citizens come up here and say compromise compromise this is such an easy fix an easy thing to do and before you guys came up i said why don't we just compromise and do an hour or two maybe one candidate per street for two hours that's allowed all right i used to build bridges and buildings and roads for living this i go across this bridge and thank god i have the opportunity to live here all right and this pettiness is just deplorable in my opinion okay this is so easy to fix and say look you want to go out and canvas for somebody one car per stream two hours and you're off why can't we just do something like that anyone else [Music] can i correct what fred was saying we need to do it on a resolution i mean we can't just do it here and say go ahead and report um the reason i would suggest the resolution is that this is a place where without it being on paper then you you will have a dispute about what was specifically decided if you want if you want to do something tonight then give me a few minutes and i'll write up whatever you direct me to write up and in the form of a motion but i would still encourage you to follow up that with a resolution because it need it needs to be clear i'll go back to the point about whether lin's authorized to do something or not he he gets uh a rough ride if if he does something he gets a rough ride if he doesn't do something and you know that's the the question is is he authorized to do it or not my inclination then would be to do a resolution for the workshop which is in two weeks right um to a resolution for the workshop whatever you have a special counsel meeting at the workshop yeah i know you can't vote on anything but have a special counseling discuss it at the workshop and then have a special counsel meeting after that that would be my inclination well i'm going to make a motion that we let mr riley take 15 minutes and come up with a resolution tonight with a few basic ideas [Music] if you're going to do a resolution it wouldn't be a resolution it would be a but basically a motion and then it would it would be a specific motion okay and that would be legal and legit if you put some parameters yeah but it's it's just i did say that the problem i i've experienced since i've been here is unless you highly define things then you're going to have disputes over how you it should be interpreted well my question clearly is can we come up with a motion with a few basic simple procedures of parking on the street a time limit a number of cars on the street there's like three three items would that be a legitimate motion to make tonight past no legal ramifications you can certainly do it i i don't like it as much [Music] to be honest with you because it again this has been a place where no matter what you do it's disputed well i'm what i'm saying is riley's i'm not going to go against your advice all right um this council voted over a year and a half ago against your advice and now we're in the middle of a lawsuit all right so you're our legal counsel if you're saying we can do something let's do it if you're saying we can't do something i'm going to support that well my my suggestion would be authorize us to prepare a resolution and bring it up at the special meeting prior to the workshop that's imminent that's two weeks away and you i mean you can have a special meeting sooner than that if you want i mean if this is some something that's that's urgent you can have a special meeting uh you can't have it thursday this week because i know i won't be here but you can have it early next week if you so choose yes sir does anybody know how many days before the first ballot goes out 38 days so you want to sit around for 15 days while we pretend to put together a resolution and emotion the action item for tonight we could only do action items that was a resolution that david has passed it says request city council direction request for on-street parking i want to give the city manager direction we're either going to say issue passes or not issue passes it's that simple we're not going to wait 15 days when there's 38 days to the first ballot we don't have till march 15th very few people vote on march 15th most of the people in this city vote by mail and those things go out on february 10th and i believe the overseas ones go out for the folks that are in the military and there's a significant amount of people in the military in this city please go out i think february 3rd i could be wrong on that day so the clock is ticking every day we sit around and wait i'm ready to hit the road tomorrow so i know about the other candidates some said they may never hit the road but other people may want to hit the road yesterday um we already hit the road by the way we defied this law i'll tell you what happened last time this happened okay very smart deputy very smart deputy knew his con law and when paul moreno our former attorney said no you can't do it he said we're not enforcing that and somebody called the police on us and he laughed and he kept moving smart move smart move okay that's the way you protect first amendment they work on oath too it just means something to them so we can't kick the can down the road this says we have to give him direction tonight the direction is either issue the passes and i don't care who else applies from everybody in the room get five i don't care give five to everybody in the world send five to joe biden but i want my five now you want to tell me i need four all right we can argue one night but i want to give direction to our city manager he asked us for direction and we owe him an answer i'm going to give him the direction my vote will be issued passes to me and to anyone else who wants him your law is unconstitutional you know it it'll never survive scripture scrutiny it's a restraint on freedom of expression if you lose you lose the entire parking ordinance don't go there people don't go there just issue glasses and if tomorrow morning a religious organization shows up she passes to them too just like you do with julio the landscaper give them the pass and let them run and stuff and by the way for worrying about how many people are going to be on a stream my street one day was filled with tree cutters filled from beginning to end you know it was nice they were cutting the trees in bel-air shore i think we're going to have to take a voice vote on this patty to make a very clear motion that you would vote on the motion is to give the city count the city manager direction so the motion is to give him direction to issue the parking passes to political candidates direction i.e approval to go ahead yes he has direction so either you can vote yes or you can vote no direction regarding requests the direction could be yes do it or don't do it exactly yes do it or don't do it that's not clear enough yes you can do it or no you can't do it and it's not just demand so it's to anybody any person who claims political canvassing now if this if this passes i guess that's what the understanding that we would make it a resolution to make it official is that what i'm it's obviously i don't want to do anything that's going to go against our code but i want to do everything by the book and correct but it wasn't part of the motion that that's the emotion on the table that you stated is that you give you are making a motion to for the council to give him direction to to issue the passes that's the motion i heard it's it's not clear and it's opening us up for more problems in the future is what i see yeah i mean the current motion just stated it seems to me a little unclear and i'd like to have more of a finite down the road fix the rule not just i don't i don't want to get a position where we're just saying yep sure go ahead for everything i want to fix the problem if there's a problem i don't want to just on a whim say sure you can have this i'm sure you can have that i want to fix the problem below so if we do a motion to temporarily do it until we can do a work session to do a resolution i may be fine with that but i'm not fine with just this motion would anyone like to entertain a motion to table this yes i would like to make a motion to table this until the next city council with discussion if there weren't session about a resolution all right motion table passes and we will discuss this in the next work session i'll now pass the gavel back to the mayor item seven unfinished business um so we had a question from john i'll bring this i'll start this with regards to the microphones and pa system he said it goes back to council meetings it goes back to the beginning of time it goes back to this entire council this stuff is junk it's outlived it's a lot useful life we don't have proper video we sitting in the audience when i sat in the audience before i ran you couldn't read the numbers that were put up there used to be monitors in front of us here we don't have them we get all this paper and everything else up here and it's going and going and it's going and where is it well uh there evidently the some of the citizens that are either warned at the meeting and you don't remember but a couple months ago the console approved the purchase of it and the equipment is on order and it's expected to come in in february i remember us approving it but i was under the impression it was going to be getting a lot quicker than i think that that was going back to september or october that we approved that uh it was after the first of the fiscal year i don't remember exactly in october if we were able to get anything quickly any um and supply issues uh we're lucky if we get it back clear well they told us february so that's that's what the contractor did we awarded the bid to the other end was awarded several months ago i remember i remember i'm just surprised it hasn't come in yet but i guess that because um any other unfinished business city attorney any comments no report this evening city manager uh i gave you the we finally got our final uh payments in for last fiscal year so you've got september's financials october so november's right yet today that's what we're waiting on also i left at your chair a map that we'll discuss at the work session about the uh swim zone for our buoy situation and there was there was a resident at the last council meeting that uh brought up a comment that i thought was misrepresented in after running the numbers it was misrepresented so i gave you a copy of the capital expenditures for each street the resident made the statement that all the money was going to be ei and i broke it out my street and how much money has been spent for the last four years because there again someone gives misinformation let's get the facts out so i've provided you that and we'll probably we'll post this on the website so the residents can see it also you got the code report uh the the citizens advisory board at the last meeting uh offered after they were looking at the digital sign ordinance they offered to if the council wants to do this uh to go through the sign ordinance and do it as a committee to kind of bring something back to the council because we keep kicking the can down the road so i guess what i'm asking what's the consensus of the console would you like them to do that uh they're willing to do it and i mean that's part of what we brought them on for and so just need some feedback and if it's okay with the console then we'll just give them the signed ordinance and have them go through it and hopefully we'll get a final product that everybody will be happy with i'm good with you i i have opinion on that i've spoken to several attorneys recently about our sign ordinance and the problems we've been facing and uh this in no way is a poor reflection on fred riley but there are firms out there that that's what they specialize in they do this all the time we could probably farm it out and they could come back with something that absolutely would not fail the test it's just a thought i don't know what the council wants to do but it's something to consider because i at the end of the day if we we bring in the citizens advisory there's they're going to run into the same issues and most of them are not attorneys if not all of them would there be a way to get the cost on that first yeah to send out and ask them for at least a rough estimate what that would cost and how many hours i like the idea of giving it to the advisory committee first the advisory committee is made up of citizens here within miller beach they have opinions about why they live in belarus beach and what they want to see so why not give them the first cut on this thing to say this is what the citizens of bel air beach consider it important and then we give it to the experts to put it in the boilerplate that's enforceable and kevin problems but i i certainly see the wisdom and giving it to your advisor to me that's why we brought those people on board so we have some input from our residents into what this thing should look like and what's important to the residents i agree with glenn i think we should definitely do the advisory committee first before we go to the professionals it's a good idea but let's let's not jump the gun let's just sorry i didn't mean that expression sorry um let's not jump ahead um let's start with the citizens totally unplanned let's start with the citizens first see what they have to say because like you said they live here they're invested in this community and they actually have a say with what they want so i like that idea and i want to make it clear they asked to do this at their region there was no discussion about it it was brought up at the meeting and they asked me to ask the council so i think that's a positive thing oh you want uh you want feedback on that yes yeah i'm against it okay they're not lawyers we couldn't come to a decision with three lawyers on this board on the regular sign ordinance some people want to go back to the one that was illegal some people want to adopt the new one these guys aren't going to get to first base their way i appreciate the offer i made you an offer it was declined i respectfully declined their offer i offered by the way folks to give my own legal time to work with fred riley free of charge to fix the sign ordinance and four to three we lost so um no we're wasting our time and kicking that can down the road you need to get assigned organs and you need to get regulations i don't think we need an outside law firm to do it friend riley wrote a very good ordinance it had a few things that needed to be tweaked but it overall was in good condition i thought so so he can do the same for the digital piece glenn i respect your opinion sir but is that the direction of this entire council oh i said that was my opinion he's looking at me okay let's take a vote so um see this is how to give direction by the way it's what we should have done the last one how many people i show hands and i'll call the totals want to turn this over to get to tell the city manager hand this over to the uh citizen advisory committee one two three four five okay and two against frank and raise your hand okay so it's five to two it goes to the citizen advisory committee see how painless that was next anything else mr city manager no mayor that's it for you okay number one i got mail that was open so i assumed that maybe you guys looked at this um and it was from ron desantis our governor but it wasn't really like a big thing it was like from ray eubanks but we are supposed to do a evaluation appraisal notification by february 1st for florida department of economic opportunity are you aware of that yes you are so i don't you have this letter right i don't need to worry about this oh wonderful but i do want to talk to you about the citizen comment about the median on 22nd street the weeds that are turning to seeds and um why is our landscaper not cutting that stuff down i'll check on that with the public works people our own people cut the grass they do have a neutral line that provides uh weed control and i'll find out what they put on it and when their last thing was and i'll relay that to mr because he's going to go out there and take care of it in his own way you don't want that not yet all right anything else for the city manager council citizens yes citizen in fact robert 231 howard ride i see that we've got a candidate's form scheduled for the town i would like to know can we do a second forum some other time not everybody might be able to make it here on the 10th and just watching the video afterwards has live answer questions so i think we ought to have more than one for the candidates part of the election well what up to mr rusberg what i'm going to do is i'm going to hold that thought and we're going to give that to the city clerk because she's in charge of our election okay so she's coming up next not really for city manager mayor one thing i did forget i put the final letter from fema about our 20 percent it's online tab nine that's our final letter that says we're class six so we're going to get 20 off of the national flood insurance program so uh just wanted to make you aware of that so you've got to copy this on that's it of the um rates or is that the existing 20 percent that we're supposed to be getting since 1971 or is that another 20 that we don't know about it's a problem it's how it works is i'm not trying to bring those no no no no every five years they come in they do what they call a verification visit and we have to meet all the criteria that we had to meet previously to maintain and uh we were a little worried this year because i guess they gave us points for just as an example they said we had a stream well i don't know where the stream's at but they didn't see it when they came this time but we were able to get other points with the uh some of the advertising and stuff we did so we maintained our class six which is important but it's 20 off a reduction of 20 of whatever the premium is so the premium is ten dollars supposedly twenty percent off that and it's for the national flood insurance program not for private blood insurance it's for manager city clerk okay so i'm gonna forward mr reisberg's comment so he was asking if it's possible to do i don't know that it is but because i know what's involved in putting it together but i'd like to hear from you because you're the one who puts it together uh a second uh candidate's forum that's something that i would have to ask the women because we have never ever even been here for the forum we're not involved in it whatsoever this year the only reason we're going to be involved is because they can't get enough volunteers with the perfect so they ask us to help them um you know just do remedial things and uh so i really don't have that answer but i'll do that for you hey it's one hour i believe right do we know we can't go longer so that's something we're meeting with them uh lynn and i are meeting with them on the 6th that we're going to go over a lot of things at that time so if anyone has any questions or input that we can discuss you have six candidates for council two for mayor i mean there's a lot of issues and that leaves a couple of questions by time everybody speaks i think last time we had a whole minute to speak which is nothing so you know think i don't know i know there's restrictions like you said they can't even get the help that they need but um i have no problem with it going longer okay i have a question is there an ant question answer session like at the end for the citizens is that part of it i can't remember so i ask him for that and he's going to get that to me and that will be sent to the candidate and poster right because if we do have that opportunity where citizens can ask questions then a compromise if we can't get another one would be maybe to email questions beforehand and somebody mutual can read them off and we can address them just as an idea you can email them questions ahead of time and i can give them to the league it will be from us it would just be the questions submitted to them also they'll be cards at the forum that you just fill out your question and then they refuel that the forum and decide if they're appropriate as i recall robin last time they would accept citizens citizens questions but if they don't get enough or appropriate ones then they have their own you know so they come armed with standard questions but then remember a couple about windmills and yeah we should be asking about what we're going to do about sea level rise and our beach right i just want to make sure we get questions from our citizens because that's what matters yeah as patty said they will accept if somebody emails a question tell them to email it to patty and uh as she said because of short help i guess we're going to be the door breeders or something but they're the ones that's going to handle the questions and my understanding is what they do is they may be two similar questions that some two different people ask but they're similar then they'll try to put it in number one question can we maybe put something on our website that if you want to submit a question by email to put that on there that way our citizens that can't make it know that they can at least get their questions submitted and not guaranteed we're going to get to them but well i was hoping well my plan is to have paddy send out constant contact on thursday after we meet with the individual just a reminder that the candidate's night is january 10th that's two days you can send that out now i mean let them know that well we can send that out earlier but i'm saying i want to make sure that we tell the residents that candidates dive 6 30 it's not six o'clock and uh they're available to come and ask questions but that was our intent to make sure the public city clerk no other comments right right anybody have any questions for the city clerk okay go to city council comments we begin with read assault no i don't have anything leslie the tarot no comment no comment frank banker no comment on hockey happy new year everybody hey guys happy new year everyone thanks for coming out tonight happy new year everyone um i've got some comments uh actually an update for you uh and it covers a couple things that frank banker had been working on and then just some general information that i know citizens have been asking at the last council session um fred riley at the urging of this council wrote a letter to bel air shore objecting to their abuse of the parking lots parking cranes and other things that were against the usage and against their own ordinance and um in december december i believe 21st bellar sure met on that and i'll give you the answer your letter deserves no response was there exact quote council member bloom who's been behind a lot of this stuff said that we have fee simple ownership we could issue permits and do as we want um so that's what they said uh frank with regard to your buoy situation um councilmember bloom said he will not talk while there was pending litigation i guess that somehow supposed to scare me you're working on behalf of your own concerns and you were given the blessing of this council to go and speak with them has zero to do with any ongoing litigation but they're under some kind of mis impression and they've said it multiple times that um they will readdress all of this stuff after the bellar age election so i want the citizens to know and i want this council to know that the beller beach election has absolutely nothing to do with what happens with my personal lawsuit it will continue no matter what their counsel knows that i called him the next day and i generally don't give advice to my opposing counsel but i did give him the opportunity for the fifth time to settle this matter and they politely refused again so depositions begin in february and i'll tell them i'll tell you what i told them if they go as well as i expect them to i will be looking to settle this case trial is in july so that's where we're at so as for the safety you can wait till after the election mr banker that's what they said may i comment um not really you're not supposed to comment on one thing but i i said you brought my name yeah i i i'll do it when i finish okay if the council has no problem i can't break the rule um so that's that after april maybe they'll decide that they want to move on this um i also found quite uh interesting that they say they intend to redo some of their laws particularly the ones that are the subject of the lawsuit now we have a trial schedule a discovery schedule a deposition schedule a expert witness schedule a mediation schedule and what they're doing and i told this to their counsel is now you're going to make me have to ask at that count that that be extended if you're going to change your laws in the middle of the litigation absolutely amazing no no sir i can't you're the mayor why are we talking about private lawsuit i'll give you an update of what i heard at a meeting are you speaking as me or as personal are you speaking from the audience because if you want to speak you need to come to this podium and identify yourself excuse me i didn't call you up here okay okay sit down and i'll call you up in a second if i get permission to dispense with the rules have a seat we don't scream from the seats it's not the world wrestling federation so i'm getting an update because certain people you were the one who actually who came here and asked for an update on the uh the status and this affects the safety of all of our citizens i'm gonna go ahead and call point the border because um city attorney we did a resolution that we would not speak about that and as the mayor when he's sitting up here and he's speaking about it he's violating our resolution uh i'll do a point of order we never gave up our constitutional rights about speaking about it let me rule the first point of order okay i didn't give up any constitutional right there's nothing that says i can't speak what you said is that you are going to participate as a city some run towards trouble some run away y'all ran away frank banker your point of order is in order i find it well founded i didn't run away no you did not run away okay neither did robin hockey so that's your update now we have frank bankert is asked to speak with regards to but that concludes my comments um we typically that would be the end i would ask for the german we have a citizen who wishes to speak and we have frank banker who wishes to speak 7 45 this is one of the earlier meetings we've ever had i would need a um emotion to well i'll make the motion dispense with the rules and allow these two people to speak afterward we have only the second in a majority sir i i'd like to comment on the parking situation you open the door on that i'd like to make a comment okay so we have a third person who wants to speak let's dispense with the rules so we have to do that i have we have a motion we have a second all in favor to dispense with the rules aye okay we dispense with the rules i'm recognizing frank banker first i'm recognizing the citizen second clinton gun third frank banker you have the floor and this will be a discussion just so you know okay i i did attend at bellar shores meeting in november about the buoy situation um i was received very warmly there uh their mayor left me even speak longer than the three minutes i was allowed i explained the situation to him the legal situation uh i said that their attorney had some of the issues a little bit incorrect um i'm hearing now what you just said mr mayor they're waiting until april i don't know why safety needs to wait okay um in my opinion this is a bully tech and i dealt with bullies all my life i come from organized labor so i've done nothing but fight bullies all my entire life okay and i've also known two things there's a great abyss okay and it divides the second golf ball and if you cater to a bully they may give you something now just to make it look good okay but they're gonna come back after us tenfold with something else all right all your beach chairs gonna be eliminated next week right what's that i smell suntan lotion now you're not allowed to have that on there because that's a shade tone all right don't ever give in to a bully you got two people from the service with three people from the service okay my god we never cater to bullies and threats we wanted to just give up all our constitutional rights we did take an oath i took an oath okay to defend the united states constitution and the florida constitution i've been bullied by a neighboring town i've been bullied by the fwc with section 9 of the florida state constitution i don't even see where they get the permission or the authority to control those section i think it's um what is it 280 or 37 327 2046 clearly says if you have a boat launching ramp area doesn't have to have a ramp you're allowed to have a no exit okay i will speed zone 19th street i've seen people bring their boats in there i've seen people bring boats in it or industry and i'm talking about paddle boats or whatever so i believe their whole thing is unconstitutional because the state has never expanded section 9 article 5 section 9 of the state constitution i'm just telling you do not give in to police all right anybody that gets you i know your endorsement and i want to get political here but i know you're endorsed by belarus shores i think that's a bad endorsement right now i think you should denounce that endorsement mr gas and defend the people of this town that put you in office three years ago [Music] let me just correct one thing mr councilmember banker um they didn't say they were waiting till april on that point they said they're waiting to the end because there's litigation we tell you let me look the citizens of the odd and tell them okay this litigation doesn't end with trial if we lose i take it to the appellate division and i take it to the supreme court then it ends if i lose all of that i don't intend to lose at the trial level but if i do if we get a bad judge or we get a bad decision we go to the next level i do that all day long every day of the year so it's going to be a long haul and if you need to talk with someone you have my number you know how to reach me if you think it's a private issue you can work on just saying safety should always be the priority issue and we should never have to kowtow to anybody over safety skin cancer we when we get when we leave here the people that believe there's a life after how are you going to sit in front of your guide and say that little kid down here got skin cancer and i did nothing about it i mean that's that is so ridiculous citizen next [Music] and to your point you were the one who stood at that podium and asked for an update because you didn't know where it was in fact i called you the next day he gave you further information i did and i'm going to give the rest of these citizens here because not only does my litigation affect our citizens okay and if i could have i would have brought it on behalf of every citizen but the florida ethics committee said i couldn't do it so that's why i just brought it on my own behalf and 43 courageous people jumped in behind me to be interveners but it also now is affecting what frank bangart is killing himself trying to do which is to save someone from getting killed by a motorboat but nobody seems to give a damn we're worried about other things playing politics well i care i swore that oath as i said before and so did you captain okay and yeah exactly to protect it and i'm going to protect it as long as i'm in a political situation and by the way we also swear as attorneys to uphold the constitution i swore that three times so yeah i act on my own behalf we've already had a motion here that distanced the city and the city had the opportunity to join the suit and they didn't join it so i'm going this one alone along with 43 other people i'm going to keep going i'm going to keep going as long as i'm breathing until i get that final court that says no but i'm not going to get a court that says no because as frank bancard said this is absurd when i see that picture of his three-year-old granddaughter tossed down into the sun and i see a picture of council member bloom drinking a beer the council got copies of a press release from the florida state commission on ethics and this goes back to the middle of september there was a press release and although the council has filled it what i'll do is bring up some information that the residents may not be aware of in this press relation we talked about many of the accusations that were brought before the ethics commission of florida and there were two accusations brought up that uh involved local people mayor schmidt at bel air shore and the town clerk barbarous and they were accusations that they overreached or abused their positions of power with their township to issue parking permits for those parking access areas that are we are always disputing and discussing the finding by that commission in each case mayor schmidt and barb kaluti was they could find no reason in the information that was presented to him to proceed any further or direct any further action of regarding any abuse or overreach of uh their duties or power so uh i don't know that seems to me to be a data point in all this and i think it's something that is being lost in the context we keep saying that they've abused their powers our own region well the bottom line is a third set of eyes an impartial body has looked at this because some citizens made an ethics charge against these people but they stepped back and looked at it with a uh with a protocol and they came back and said no we don't see any reason to proceed or direct any further action on this thing and i don't know what all of that protocol involves maybe the city attorney can tell us how precise or or how introspective that is but that's the other side and that's the rest of the story on this which wasn't the uh finding that there was no reward on the charge now that you know all right there was nothing about money well i'm just saying that that they didn't gain financially or anything off of this no they i think based on what they said was there's no reason to proceed or direct further action because they don't see an abuse or an overreach of their position in issuing those parking permits in those specific areas so they they were represented by council they were there's obviously some proceeding and some q a proceeding where they look at all this and they walked away saying so what's your point my point was to just say the rest of the story that's the rest of the story we things seem to get lost in context here all the time where we only we only put out information that seems to fit the narrative and i'm just saying nobody here is from bel air shore saying yeah well okay we agree with what you're saying but the rest of the story is this okay just putting my question in the rest of the story is that i don't think there's one citizen in this town on this council would object to anybody from bel air shore allowing someone to park in their parking lots if they treated us in the same manner a friendly manner okay that wasn't the question put the form the question the question put before them was the citizens are upset okay because we're getting backhanded all the time okay so it goes to tallahassee which is what 200 miles away from the situation that looks at this legal aspect and they say hey all right there's no ethnic violation but the violation is they broke the contract no i think that the issue is the narrative we're trying to present is that they are overreaching and they are bullying us because they issue permits in those access areas and a third body the state commission on ethics looked at it and said there is no overreach or abuse by what they're doing what happens okay but frankly can i because you guys are having their own conversation and i didn't just read the press release i read the entire file which is about three inches may i ask for a point of clarification first since you represent the gentleman that filed the ethics i know you are representing him in some aspects to that would he be able to speak about it attorney reilly because he's actually represented hang on a second your point of order just gets directed to me okay okay and i can speak about it because i'm going to speak about what's in the report which is a public document you like to do public records requests make one of barbara kaluchi she'll give you the report okay so that report has a wealth of information in it which again is you know able to be read by anyone this is not a judicial body this is an ethics body and one of the key takeaways is that they weren't going to weigh in on this because it's subject to litigation now i've not said anything that's not public information okay it's not the be-all and end-all there was errors in the investigation but it's not even worth pursuing at this point because it gets nothing in terms of lawsuit i can read and so could fred reilly read what the ordinance says across the street and when it says you shall only issue permits to people in bel air beach and you're issuing to people who live in bel air and bel air shore and parties and you name it then you're not following the law a judge will decide that that is one of the subjects on my cake on my case so i'm not really too worried about what was in there if you think it's the be all that end all that's great have a scotch with robert schmidt and maybe he'll take some advice but quite frankly i don't think it gets them anything there should be permits to people that shouldn't have them and the way i read the deed along with five other attorneys who have way more real estate background than me they have no right to issue that we'll see what the judge says there's a gentleman in the back i saw him sorry i'm not involved in the case i have no idea i haven't read anything but interestingly enough i took a picture and since we all seemed so concerned tonight about parking and limiting the access of parking to a candidate running for our own city for a couple of hours let me just read you the the the picture of the parking permit that i saw took a picture of in the beach access as i was going to the beach that i paid to get access for it's for two vehicles seemingly at any time no time limit to park anywhere in the 12th street access between january 1st 2021 and september 30th 2021. now again right i just happened to take this when that topic came up i said hey you know what let me go back and look at that because it's been several times where i've gone and the parking lot's full of people who don't even live in bel air beach yet i seem to be paying for that so just also point of order from a citizen who's very confused how ultra concerned we are about giving a political candidate access for an hour on the side of a street but seemingly give non-bel air beach residents access to something we are financially and legally responsible for literally part blocks whenever they feel like it that just doesn't seem to be consistent to reiterate a term used often tonight consistent with the what we've been talking about so again just asking for a very confused friend where is the consistency from the council on parking because it seems like we care more about tom brady's parking than we do about our own political system or our own candidates or our own citizens again i anyone else i always seem to bring up tommy boys and i always talk hey maybe one day he'll be mad at me and come my first thought when you sent that out and now you just brought that up did my first thought i was like why is he defending belair shore like why are you why are you defending the mayor and i mean to me i'm thinking when i read that i was like okay that's a bunch of people could tell how to say thing about this little tiny beach town they're complaining about three four areas of parking like really we got bigger things to deal with so to me i just took it as whatever it doesn't maybe they ethically didn't violate anything but they still violated their rules maybe not their ethics and i guess a court will determine that but the point is hearing the other side of this story here what's the other narrative here i mean all we hear is one side of the story and it seems like open mic night in making the narrative all the time and all we hear is one side of the story that was information there's another data point a data person there's one more data point that maybe you should kind of sit back and say not black not white there's something in the middle here that's funny i don't see where it's one side of the story i mean it's right in your face i mean if i have a neighbor that takes his dog and craps in my yard every day and doesn't pick it up i'm going to say i got a problem i think we're getting crackling see you talk about open mics there's the city of bel air beach i'm the mayor of bel air beach not bell or shore that's an open mic anyone from bell or shore can come and talk any time they could have talked before they passed the umbrella ordinance they could have talked during it they could talk to me night and day they've got my private cell phone number which most people do not have so if they want to talk we can talk we almost had a settlement and somebody messed it up who lives in this city in terms of taking sides you're councilman from beller beach not bellar shore part of the ethics finding again this was in the report that city clerk was given authorization by their council go back and look at the date that the authorization was given fred reilly wouldn't let us do a resolution you know why because he knows what the rule is he sure as hell wouldn't let us amend an ordinance on the fly but they did it wasn't advertised it wasn't shown the division on ethics didn't have a problem with it hey for those of you who are going to tell bellar b beller short tell them i'll be asking those questions to them how they got away with passing a motion that amends an ordinance without advertising there you go open book test that's how confident i am that they have no answer they do a lot of things they just do because they feel like doing like putting paths in our easement putting accesses a lot of stuff i feel like doing and i'm gonna fight for our citizens as long as i'm up here i'm never gonna fight for them never else jim van's going june mansfield 7th street i agree with the mayor 100 that you all took oath office to this city to this city not other cities and i've repeatedly seen a couple members on this council and particularly somebody who's running for re-election but in a different office that has siding with the other city by trying to make it a motion to keep this city from being involved in this lawsuit now i don't know how many people have come to this mic i remember this city hall being filled with people we had people all the way out in the hallway during the middle of coven because of this umbrella issue because of this umbrella issue and yet today we still have members that sit up on that dance that will not defend this city when they have this room and this hallway filled with citizens wanting this umbrella issue to be tackled by the city and for them to protect the property rights of these citizens remember every time these people vote and they vote against your rights and those properties are part of your deeds people wake up and stop letting it be political do what's right for the city do what's right for your properties and and back somebody just alone on this issue and stop trying to play politics with it it's your property values too i don't understand it's ridiculous we're seeing no other hands no other comments close that and then we'll make a motion to return second all in favor aye approved 7-0 everyone have a good night"
