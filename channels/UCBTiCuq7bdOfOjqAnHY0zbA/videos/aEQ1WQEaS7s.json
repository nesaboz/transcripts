Deputy clacker for the record for the code enforcement for the month of August you'll notice that 44 of my time was spent dealing with construction nuisances um and I just want to clarify something in those nuisances what I was doing was checking for permits to see if people had permits they didn't stop work orders were in place also the big part was before the storm um a city manager gave me a list of all the houses that were under construction what I did was I went out and inspected each of one of those sites to make sure that they were safe we did have two that were not in compliance so prior to the storm I went out and I checked 12 residents I had two that were in violation during the storm one was cleared up and then one was cleared up after on Gulf Boulevard fortunately no damage was done from the materials that were left out there I spoke with the homeowner basically told them look you know you have to keep this this lot cleared he understands he lives in Georgia and he made the trip down here because he couldn't get a hold of his contractor to clean up the lot the other 32 percent dealt with Lawns weeds brush and then the rest of that dealt with traffic instances and those types of things an outstand for any questions okay any questions I do have one um there's a there's a lot it's Angie a lot to knock down I may never rebuilt and it's huge it's some places it's six feet high uh there's anything being done about that particular law which where is that law to act yeah I believe it's on Donato oh yes 2204 yes yes we did send out a notice of violations of the homeowner to get that taken care of thank you I just wanted to get that on the record but yes I received multiple multiple yes sir anything else thank you very much thank you you all have a great evening you too all right uh is Nellis Suncoast fire and rescue here tonight all right well let's just move on to item number five the presentation given by vice mayor Shirley on behalf of Florida Florida Legal cities foreign [Applause] city of Bellaire Beach announced today that Dave Gaddis our mayor has spent quite a bit of time studying over the last year to receive a gold certificate of excellence from the certificate program of the elected Municipal officials hosted by the Florida Liga cities University Dave received the level three there's level one two and three bronze silver and gold Dave received the gold certificate of excellence after committing the last year August 2022 to July 23 he spent earning points to receive the certificate so on behalf of the city Feller Beach Dave I'd like to to use the certificate of excellence thank you very much ocean thank you good job [Applause] all right we are on to item number six which is another presentation from Lindsey Johansen Florida League of cities to universities account executive for fmit properties and asset insurance policy all right well thank you all for having me tonight um my name is Lindsay Johansen I am the account executive for the West Coast of Florida and I do handle your insurance program that you all currently purchase through the fmit um so this year we have a significant increase in our renewals and I'm sure that you have been able to take a look at this a little bit and have kind of been aware of the market and the situation here in Florida on the property specifically so um what you have in front of you is the proposal the actual renewal quote which gives you kind of a line by line itemization for each coverage line and then the second page is the namestorm deductible options that we're offering this year so traditionally our coastal cities will take a two three or five percent this year every city whether it's Coastal or further inland will be out of five percent and that's kind of the standard property Trend so five percent is what this current program is quoted on and then you have additional options of a seven and a half and a ten percent deductible as well and then you have the corresponding premium on the property there so um that's that piece and then the second document you received is specifically highlighting the fmit and some of the strengths of our our program as a carrier we are now the only of the three major trusts in the state that are going to continue to offer dedicated limits which means you don't share in a large pot with all other cities you have dedicated limits so um you all went with a total insurable value on the property of a 3.8 valuation and this year you underwent an asset survey so that asset survey is basically an appraisal of all the city's assets after that was completed you all had about a 33 increase in those values bringing your total insured value to about a five million dollar number so you did have an increase just based on the appraisal the actual values and then the reinsurance market is the second kind of piece to that that increase on the property so you had about a 44 increase in the overall program and that's considering the general liability the workers comp the property the auto The Insider liability as well so that's kind of a recap um so I can open that up for questions you know it's not great news but this is what we're seeing across the state this is not specific to just Coastal communities um this is a pretty significant Market correction um correct me if I'm wrong you ensure our ability correct of wife ensure a building which you are ability mature or employees for workers comp correct who are employees who receive the five percent increase we're we're getting hit with a 44 increase on total things um but when you and with my property insurance should be about the same as what we're getting here you know any short the flood correct we have a flood supplement in the policy what does that cover um it covers any flood risks that are associated with them with the properties that we insure yeah I I I've been told that 100 times what does it ensure because when the flood comes in okay then you have to go to the nfip your flood insurance I'm going to get them so I know there's always a disclaimer on every homeowner's policy two percent hurricane damage and all that but what does it truly assure you so the definition of flood is rising water so it's from any local waterways it's also wind driven rain so if you have a catastrophic hurricane what happens with our program is we have Synergy which you all may be familiar with that is basically our mitigation team so that third party will come out and do their initial assessments and once that initial assessment is concluded they'll determine what percentage of that loss is flood related so if there's true surge like flood surge coming in from the ocean that's considered flood but you also have catastrophic property damage that is wind turbine so it's kind of hard to really know until you look at the loss but basically Rising water is what's considered flooding as opposed to fall and water which is your normal Windstorm deductible on property I understand I've been dealing with this flight for two years now and I understand the rising water but again when it comes to writing the check for damages you guys don't write it yet if he does or whoever the insurance that's covered in the flood correct thanks I believe or is our building 100 with many we need mitigated I don't know if it's a hundred percent um I do have what we pay for the flood insurance policy right yeah I understand it I I think we're being scanned this whole entire state is getting scanned here I hear all these percentage increases and these guys you guys that write these building insurance policies you're jumping on the bandwagon of winning insurance which would have a catastrophic loss okay and you would have the flood policy would have a catastrophic loss thank God not a lot of people claim this year but your your risks are so minimal in my opinion if there's if there's a fire yes we go to you okay if there's a you also some other type you know if you go to eBay what order your what are we really getting from you for 95 total percent increase before you go forward Mr ranker I would like you to uh carefully ask your questions in a respectful way or I guess the accusing using our guests of scamming at us it's okay refrain your so your your property policy covers catastrophic risk so when your building is damaged from storms that's including storm surge that's including the windows getting blown out all of the the mold that comes into the building a foot of water that's got to get sucked out and mitigated the drywall that we had to cut out and then remit you know basically stabilize that building until we have the initial assessment to rebuild the building so it's roof it's Plumbing electrical all of that that is goes into building rebuilding that building as well as content so all of the property that's inside the building so that's what the property insurance is and then you have a sub limit within that property that's dedicated to flood but you also purchase your own excess flood through the nfid so at claims time that initial assessment will determine how much property damage there is and how much it costs to repair along with the contents inside and then it will determine what flood is eligible what flood coverage will be eligible because sometimes if it's wind driven rain through the storm that it may be considered part of your property loss it just depends on that initial assessment so I mean it's it's kind of hard to tell it tell you anything about that I can definitely go through the property insurance policy and try to find specifics about defining Flood versus the rest of the policies coverage I would appreciate it yeah um I'd like to write other questions to the council if we have any more and then I'm gladly come back to you if you have others Council no I'll just stay I'm not surprised at the increases I own multiple commercial properties throughout the state and you're just seeing this throughout the state it's where we shouldn't be surprised at what we're seeing and I appreciate your health and your efforts that you put forward here um I know we're Limited in what we have to what you have to offer us because insurance companies have pulled out the state and I really appreciate everything yeah and I appreciate that and to that point I mean if you look at what happened in the homeowners Market you have kind of a flight from the state that's because there is you know competition is great but you kind of get what you pay for so if everyone's fighting for that cheaper price cheaper price cheaper price eventually what people are paying out with these insurance companies pay out in premiums or what they've had in claims they're not getting enough in premium so that that rubber has to hit the road at some point and with the severity and the frequency increasing and catastrophic risk especially in Florida especially with Ian we took the bulk of that risk it's going to be about 150 million dollar plane when it's all said and done insurance carriers can only reserve for so long and pull from reserves that have been sitting on the books for 10 years before we have to kind of get closer to actual rail pricing so you know that's kind of like the antivirus program phased out the subsidies that we're involved in that because they were being used all the time and they need to collect more premium to to get closer to the actual risk that they're going to the 100 Year storm is becoming a 50-year storm and because of that there has to be a correction in the market one other thing is that reinsurance which funds the entire insurance industry at the very top that has Capital injected into it and with interest rates rising and inflation the investors that are at the very top of that system are not getting original their investment so they're going to go and put their capital and other safer Avenues and vehicles than than insurance right now because insurance claims are all made up so all those things kind of came together this year um and again I can send you a great summary of reinsurance it's really lengthy but I think it might help put some of this in context so I have a couple of questions um I see that we have a thousand of our deductible problem so that's that's not a whole lot of money in the grand scheme of things especially whenever you're looking at this field um is there a different uh levels of deductible and do we have anything we can look at to compare certainly look at that music so um on the property that was another eruptible okay um so you have I'm not sure why that says a thousand dollars I need to check on that usually the base is twenty five thousand dollars as your aop deductible which is anything that's not winter storm so I'm not sure if that might be a thousand dollar there is for some other maybe like equipment something like that I will definitely confirm that but that I see what you're saying there I was actually hoping it was accurate right and you could save some money with that um I would say the name storm deductible taking the higher deductible amount is going to be the thing that removes the needle on pricing but I will confirm the property deductible for you the aop okay and then uh yesterday I attended an event and uh Jeff Ramos just spoke there and he said that we're this is a major correction that's going on right now and then next year it's going to correct some more but it's not going to be near as serious I mean the following year [Music] it will stay with us and ends have normal [Music] normal increases do you do you expect the same um yes I would say that this is not this will be the most severe year the biggest correction next year we'll still have kind of higher increases than normal but then it should start to kind of flatten out but it is kind of the market cycle we're in so I can't say for sure it kind of depends on the storms as well as soon thank you other questions or comments yes I think this is just a presentation an optional check over again yeah October 1st is the renewal so you still have you know almost a month to make that determination and let us know which way you wanted to select if you don't then it will default to the five percent anything else any other questions thank you very much all right we are up to item number seven let's see the attorney's report Mr Moore you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor we are now in September last month I attended the um Fleur de Lisa City's annual conference and presents it on the four hour Sunshine Olympics public records course as well as a presentation on public meetings and efficient operations of those meetings the conference was generally well attended and then I think a quick question registry Source from here was there as well in addition to that at present we continue to [Music] Advance a series of items we expect to see significant action items between the work session and next meeting in October including those the ballot language that we talked about which I hope to have for you and turning through Workshop so we can make sure we're all comfortable with with that content and a few other ordinances as we get into October 2023 please be mindful that as you start to see ordinances the process by which they're presented may change that is will start to include that economic impact cover memo that's been required by this legislature so the process might look just a little different in your materials I'm not terribly significant for this community especially because you do not have any real commercial District or that has to constantly be weighed against all these but that doesn't mean that exempts us all together from considering opinion on what commercial impacts there may be based on our ordinances otherwise continue to work closely with the my office is very closely with Ohio over the last few months on the solid waste issue on one of my one of my colleagues reproduction father has been helping Kyle with that and I know there'll be some discussion of that issue this evening otherwise I'm happy to answer any of the questions you have yeah from first to 19th Street um our residences in the town of bellary Shores from the beach it was importance past this I believe this year limiting our residents going to use umbrellas and the three beach access lines meanwhile in that same ordinance it shows states that Bel Air Shore residents are free to put umbrellas canopies whatever they like even on the wet sand which is the states land um is that a violation of equal protection for our citizens it's my understanding that there were some citizens or interested property owners who advanced such a claim I believe that matter resolved without a Judicial order on the matter at this stage I'm not in a position to opine on it I don't have you know I'm generally aware of the ordinance whether individual Property Owners wish to make it clean that's not really a claim of the city against the town as much as it is individual individuals against that town and its regulations yeah I was just concerned about equal protection I mean if I'm a resident I can do whatever I want but if I'm a non-resident I'm a wet sandwiches the stadiums they stayed up to cement I'm not I just I just feel it's an equal protection for us and I understand it wasn't there was a suit that was settled but with the beach now quarterly or each the original word is what's for Satan for umbrellas not to have any anger combining all these are relatives one little spy and at high tide where you only had 20 feet of each now um but again residents of colored Shores is allowed to do anything [Music] I just I just don't understand how that's not an evil protection violations of our residents for me there's not a question in that statement I understand your concern I'm not saying it's without narrator it's with Mary I haven't had the ordinance as something that I've analyzed there's no city of Bellaire Beach interest there and that's my client so that may well be the case and I think private property owners have attempted to or may continue to pursue that action but as far as as between City and town that's not something I'm going to find on and I don't know what their Town attorney has behind or otherwise articulated on that point I know I've written to Ashley Moody uh over a month ago and I still haven't received a response but I can feel like maybe I'm sorry I didn't catch that I actually written to Ashley Miller attorney general about this so I can see the response yet but I just wondering if you had any legal advice I'm not comfortable upon your audience just because it sounds something you know specifically analyzed anyone else okay I have a question across the bridge there is or was I think it's gone now there was a large yacht that same are you aware of it I saw this morning yes okay all right so um I've been speaking with several mayors about this they they all have major concerns I know that there are certain laws stipulating what we can and cannot do in the waters in our backyard but we're interested in possibly hosting a gathering here of officials I would wonder if he would be interested in being there in a legal capacity just to listen to everyone's ideas and ingredients sort of keep us from going down the wrong road I work for my client my client is the council if the council so desires me to attend something I'm happy to attend that I would the only hedging you'll get from me is I'm not sure if you're asking me to advise an intra-local assembly or justifies my client but I would of course be happy to listen to and receive any information monitor go in and then if this community has action and desires to take or have analyzed or proposed of course I'm fulfill my duties to this concert okay I just feel like if we are we're going down a road that we're never going to come back from and I see the last time I counted I believe there were six votes over here there may be more now I don't know but they're in Bel Air Beach's area and then that's always a challenge especially because things in the water are always static and those lines are um so I hear your concern and what what we're talking about doing is is finding a way to rather than waiting until the boat goes Airlift we should be able to prevent them from coming in staying for any any extended length of time because you know as well as I do as soon as they bring their junker boat in and they grow up anchor if it's really a jumper you don't know it until it's under water and it's spilling sewer and again or diesel fuel all up in our Waters so I'm going to speak with the city manager about maybe dates and as soon as that comes to fruition just so I understand are you talking about like a big sea meeting where it's discussed or a separate sort of idea this would be not necessarily a big c meeting but it would be anyone who has intercoastal uh direct intercoastal access from their municipality that wants to civilians in Bel Air as well even though they're not yeah and it may just turn into a giant band session I don't know but if you don't mind if you could kind of do a little bit of research and and maybe let us know who who how these laws are in place and what it is we're we're allowed to do and not allowed to do I think I've got some resources I can circulate that will require significant you know time and temperature in that regard to restart the dialogue and I can search this person all right I think I think um well I know at the last work session I brought this subject up um this is the second vessel in as many months that is sunk over there and so and I believe that at that time indicated that you would do some research I suggested that we look at what Key West is doing and I know that the city of Beller I mean the city of Madeira Beach just made some substantial changes to their code which is why we're seeing so many vessels up here but um it's definitely a code issue I think we did and we need to make some modifications to our code and talked about it at the work session so I think it's time to get serious about it understood thank you uh one last thing is uh he did a great job in his class if you've not seen this guy Peach trust me it's worth giving up four hours of your life anything else for Mr Moore yeah all right thank you very much thank you very much all right item number eight let's see manager's report is for me for Europe thank you America I'll start off with the budget we are doing our first public hearing tonight what we're going to propose in the military and also approve the first meeting of the budget related to the budget I had on here um that we our RFP for the collection services is being evaluated but I reached out to waste management and they provided kindly a another month's service it only uh bi increase and the disposal fee that they're occurring through the county that's on the agenda it's still like that for consideration because I believe that you know being the month of September right now we don't really want to rush the process so we can parade um we the one change I do have on this report is we did convene an evaluation committee on Tuesday yesterday but it was made up of myself our community services administrator and a community volunteer who's the chair of the citizens advisory committee we all reviewed the proposals I provided a tabulation sheet that I got off the man star which is where we hosted the RFP and you can see there's some differences in the pricing I ran some numbers on that if you compare the pricing are the lowest price came in from Waste Connections which was um 8.6 over what we're currently paying on a contract the second lowest price was Waste Pro and that was at 18.9 percent over we're currently paying in the last eight weeks of management are incumbent came in at 34.5 over with our current contract is I just want to lay that out for you so you can see the price because price is important um when we reviewed the rfps we considered all the requirements of the RFP and um when I went through at the meeting and kind of laid out how I saw an interpreted the proposals and um when I looked at it and scored each proposal which the ones that stood out to me most was Waste Pro so it was not the lowest price and um I determined that because when the price point was uh was a tab it was a past seven of RFP um so that was just one consideration when I when it came to the other tabs of the RFP which included well they included overall organization key players way to address the services of Bel Air Beach transition plan dates um our handy Outreach so multiple things are included and when when I went through them what separated Waste Pro um out from Waste Connections and waste management was the transition plan if we were to consider and not sticking with our common current contractor it's important that we have a good transition plan so we're confident in that we can make this solution not cause headache for all our residents and when I compare the plans I mean waste Race Pro really kind of laid out they timeline this is kind of what they've been doing over the last 20 years they've done in one of over 300 municipalities they have backup Vehicles right in the location um they talk about how they're going to communicate effectively up front with the residents to meet this transition they talk about how their drivers we'll do dry runs and pick up trucks before even our driving trash trucks they should go through their software talked about staging areas for the dumpster switchouts they talk about the customer service you know pretty much by the end of the day no customer will go on the unanswered they set up a high standard while their trucks are equipped with the latest technology on the board cameras so they can if there is an incident they can go back and pull the footage from the pickup and be able to tell you what happened that day so all the employees are held accountable they identify who who will lead the transition plan and they talk about that they their typical timeline for a transition plan is 30 to 45 g8s but they've done it as little as four days and they also say they have already started doing the legwork for the transition where at the time they submitted this proposal they were they were confident in taking over service October 2nd so um when it really comes down to it that was a that was a very key piece in comparing these proposals another thing is they were serving 61 out of 67 counties and just overall presentation so once I presented this to the evaluation committee there was an agreeance that nobody's probably the most proposal and we felt that that overload the lowest Banner so um the committee agreed that we recommend we go to negotiations contract negotiations with weights and parole all right Council any comments questions um I I will let you know I spoke with mayor will today and and ready to teach they use Waste Connections and I will say that he was adamant about the company just being so there I don't know what else to say other than another another mayor says a good thing for this company so I think I would feel good with either company I think that a year the committee was a happiest with Waste Pro and uh and you are too so I would be I thought I would start with we had a tackle where you're saying I spoke to other C's about both companies they all it's very competitive they all are spoke highly of I spoke to Derek Beach where police photos are recycling program and they took over there nothing but good things to say I heard it from city manager in the city of Seminole they they're significant because they do both their trash collection and their Recycling and again completely satisfied with their service so I think I think all these companies are great companies um on top of that I think I forgot to mention is waste probe something that stood out in their proposal is for the recycling they offer no charge uh these I think 58 or sorry 64 gallon recycling carts um they'll do our bidding service what we currently have they'll offer no charge you know like the medium-sized recycling carts the offer the residents more space and their their strategy is um they can automate it and at the same time they found that that reduces the amount of recyclables that just go into the trash anyways when you run out of space if they caught diversion so the diversion rates they Define decreased but our uh sorry diversion rates with the transition they lower by 30 so that's another thing it's something to consider you don't have to go to the cards but I know in the past RFP I reviewed the notes when we considered going to the large trash cars and the concern was that the elderly citizens would struggle with such a large car but these I think are workable um they're kind of a medium-sized card and you know if you use the recycling bins you can't really fit that much in there so I think that's a plus would they recycle my existing car you probably probably could take them back in the city I have a concern you mentioned they are automating so are they is that true for the canisters as well but because one benefit we have is that you know our current Defender nice guys on the ground right you know and they will provide excellent job it's like yeah they will they will pick up any container the residue uses um but they they will also transition to a trash Carter if we ever decide to inflated either way well let's find out what the council thinks Mr Baker um are they going to give the same type of service for um land skating like we have now like palm branches and everything like that most of our residents don't tie them up it was a big thing about four years ago here with Waste Management they weren't going to pick up anything it wasn't fun with that lasted about a week I think couldn't turn his phone off he got too many calls and then they went back too you know just picking up I guess some of these people just put piles and piles and piles out of all different types of Shrubbery it's not bound up will they give us the same type of service so when we did the RFP we didn't put any stipulations on how the yard Greece went out there there were some questions that we said that would be negotiated through the contract so Our intention is not anything just too limiting to the residents because we're aware of the way the yard waste is picked up and we talked about in the evaluation committee we believe that when it comes down to it they're going to want to serve the customers so I don't think it's going to hang on I think you shouldn't be able to do yeah no it will be thank you this living is coming it's the group and Kyle agree that voice from Florida is the way to go then mayor Shirley just another question regarding um the storm dumpsters and you know when the time comes that we have any more additional dumpsters and things like that is that digital charge is that part of the original contract what happens so in our last contract that was worked out during the negotiation so it was written in the 30-yard loss the Florida complimentary because they were included in the contract is that what you're saying they were included yes and when we negotiate the contract that we presented to the city council so you guys what the other people got it's a pretty big benefit um currently we have all the time goes along with west side note 4 right here [Music] are the ones for these other vendors the same size they proposed all the same size they were given a list in the RFB with every condominium what they used and they proposed all the same sizes and that they would use plastic I believe to try and reduce area how do you feel about utilizing Waste Pro before I am too yeah I think any company if they can provide a level of service that we're getting now with Waste Management I believe this Council will be satisfied with that all right so we're going to uh vote later on extending their contract for one month and what what does that do for us it gives us the enough time to vote in next month's meeting to approve the contract yes so if you approve me to go to negotiation I'll set up a meeting with Waste Pro and we'll go through each point of our proposed contract and see if there's any changes that want to be made or what we want to include or drop off and then I will share that with Attorney Morris firm and attorney Ashley Felder and come up with a contract that we feel will serve the residence in the mail will be put on a meeting agenda for your approval all right do we need a motion to that I just need the approval from Council to go to negotiations I'm just gonna let's do a motion right there would sort of like to make a motion to move forward with creating a contract I have another question before we go to that um and it's we with regard we went to bed I'm not hearing anything any reason why we wouldn't take a little bit other than we just have this Comfort level if we're looking at I think I need a better argument why we wouldn't look at a little bit um when the evaluation committee reviewed we thought it was a standout difference in what was presented what was proposed like I said the transition plan if you read one plan versus the other there's good about 10 times more information presented explained it gives you a lot of confidence in the other people pull off that are saying to better communicating [Music] overall proposal better order um less errors I mean okay go ahead okay so yes I'll move forward with the with uh um I would like to move forward with a motion to um to enter into the negotiations with voice Provo Florida do I have a second all in favor aye aye any opposed okay thank you all right so um three bar items on the report of Golf Boulevard undergrounding we had a slight Delay from the storm so the the UCF was going to finish up in the month of August but they're about a couple weeks back so we're extended September um there'll be probably one more invoice on that first phase one um Po and then what I'll do is submit it to the county because you know the whole deal for reimbursement from Penn for canals the stormwater Improvement projects I've been working back and forth with several septic because our camering and our cleaning of the pipes right now with our tide schedule I'm looking at getting them in hopefully to get a lot of the video footage of the pipes that we wanted to assess on September 18th so I'm going to get with Gemini engineering hopefully I can get those videos to them that they can still be able to evaluate them and make it so that at Exit meeting ridiculous with the answers that we wanted as far as the conditions were in place but that's just a Thai thing one thing I wanted to find out because it is a price point the there's pipe that doesn't have any uh particle build up oysters in it that could be just filmed with a camera truck no problem there's the pipe segments that go from the closest Inlet to the Sea walls out to the sea wall are going to need cleaning to be videoed the project proposed originally our thought was that we're going to have a line on a price for the Cure in place lining so that when we go through a project and clean and inspect the pipes that as needed if we found damage we would light it then it's not it doesn't have to be done that way um but it will increase what we spend right now on the budget so I wanted to know if if we felt it was permanent to move forward and start cleaning the pipes now and inspect them and doing them we'll be doing it later not sure how the council felt about that Council [Music] so just clean your video it might slow things down a little bit hopefully they can get it done with time schedule but I got a witness you want to see any surprises like we danced or in the last 12th and 13th okay all right I'll move forward with that resolution thank you very much any other questions or comments for the city manager um your your field crew work like dogs get the city ready sandbagging um equaling long hard hours in the Sun and I would thank this Council we should give them those three guys 250 statement bonus with their recognition for doing this they were out there for hours collecting their own homes and just some kind of appreciation so I'm making a motion I think it's appropriate for one-time 250 each stated Safari before we proceed on the motion I want to make sure we're just um and and Mr Vegas because I wasn't aware that making that motion I do want to add there is a statue that says that um in the Florida statute 215 not 425 no extra compensation that shall be made to any officer agent employer contractor after the service and render the contract made Marshall when you want to be appropriate or paid on the Acclaim the subject matter which has not been provided for by pre-existing laws um suffice to say there are there is some some Authority against extra compensation to employees for performing their duties I have an obligation to raise that as a concern I'm not saying this Falls squarely within it but I I wasn't aware we were going to be having that discussion or what the Personnel policies might otherwise say on the matter what I think I'm sorry we're not able to discuss

providing for an effective date as you uh this has been a first reading or this has been the the sole reading of resolution 2023-07 my title only as indicated earlier in tonight's hearing you've got you adopted the ordinance that provides you can adopt your personnel policy by resolution this is that resolution and behind it in the materials in the agenda are the Personnel policy that you will be adopting pursuant to the resolutions that's been reviewed by my office the manager and your carrier at various stages in this process to provide a unified Personnel policy rather than two or three separate documents that govern the employees that it's offered this evening for your proposal one of the benefits of where you can and not everything can be done this way or where you can have things that are not codified and done by resolution one of the benefits to that is if there are things we need to amend simple as a resolution at a later date if we need to change a number a figure a policy

report but we kind of came up on the time limit or the deadline for the postal submission it was requested that the contractors had more time first proposal submission and to make that possible I reached out to waste management our current waste collection contractor and the government affairs manager Tim Powers had you know gracefully uh worked with his uh superiors to expand to our contracts for the month of October and only at the increase of the four percent CPI and everyone else company selling waste disposal costs so it's a very good price it's actually a lower price than any of our RFP contract prices and I still think that we should take them up this uh Amendment to the agreement to provide service for the month of October citizens yes sir good evening mayor council members my name is Tim Bowers and I'm a governmental Affairs representative for Waste Management I'd just like to say that waste management is very appreciative of the relationship that we've had with Bellaire Beach and I realized that as we talked to the city manager reefler and going through the RFP process they were looking at an extension and we took everything into consideration the relationship that we have and we just basically applied a four percent increase which covered a CPI and the disposal rate again we realized the city was going through the process we wanted to put our best vote forward be a good partner and that's why we we kept we kept it at a reasonable rate for the one month extension because we wanted to make sure that you got the best deal and that you had the time you needed to take a look at everything you were looking at in solid ways we just really appreciate relationship with that thank you thank you very much any other comments from citizens oh my citizen comments

thousand dollars for like four streets but we also I've been addressing we should be raising some of these Sea Wolves I mean it greets the sea walls this past storm and um it was a mess down here is there going and thank God for that that's all I got to say thank you Mr Banker up next is Miss Livingstone I just wanted to thank you provided a lot of communication to US during the experience this morning I for one was not here and so I do appreciate your communication thank you very very much um thank you Mr Livingstone up next is vice mayor Shirley [Applause] I agree with what everyone said you guys did great job sitting in town did a wonderful job um I always wanted to bring a shout out to the Sheriff's Department they were unable to do it every day you know on the stage and now we're asking so I appreciate y'all's concerns and um all the hard work there was a lot of presidents coming to sheriff's department and our fire department um I want to just kind of reiterate with the question of whether or not we could get bonuses to staff and that sort of thing well I think it's a great idea I just want to remind residents that they will leave staff to a good job that nothing prevents you from getting them a gift card or something like that so to show your appreciation and the thinking part um even just kind words go a long way so just to add that to a thought for the day and thank you to the residents that attended and I appreciate everything thank you all right today I attended the mayor's council at Pinellas County where we met for lunch and a representative of the Florida League of cities was there to answer questions concerning current and future which I ask if there have been any consideration of overturning the full Financial disclosure law for municipalities in general and were they aware that of the impact it was having on small municipals and communist penalties like Miller Beach the expected answer was no but it kicked off a heated discussion um about counsel and commission members resigning as well as the quality of future members who could just walk in unopposed I will continue to have this conversation whenever I can but unfortunately it may require a judge to undo this damaging law also this Friday the big sea Mayors and County Commissioners will meet with the Army Corps of Engineers to discuss regular and emergency nourishment I'm confident there will be plenty of press coverage on this one so stay tuned also we went through 20 agenda items in less than an hour and a half I don't want anyone out there to think that we just gloss right through these every item is discussed unless it's just a standard housekeeping item we we do our own work and in the hard work during work sessions and if you'd like to would like to see more of how we reach our decisions I would invite you to attend our work sessions so as always I'd like to thank everyone for attending tonight either here or remotely we have a motion to adjourn motion motion made by Frank Baker do I have a second by Belinda Livingstone all in favor aye any opposed all right good night everyone"
