the case of the rest of the council topic not already on the agenda please raise your hand and wait to be called on we ask that you limit your comments to know more than three minutes big council members below respond to the citizens comments please hold your responses until we reach Council comments at the end of the meeting um before I followed anyone in the audience I already had one car from Vicky McGuire from 111 14th Street please step up to the podium and it's my understanding that uh Debbie Mall had to deal with her three minutes also good evening Marianas Council men and women thank you for serving our community my name is Vicki Dwyer and my husband Ross our marine son Peter and I live on 14th Street we moved here just one year ago and mostly love our community I'm here today to address a topic from the February 25th email will come where councilman Lloyd Roberts is looking for solutions to traffic on the gulf and Causeway two-way turns his proposed idea is to remove the two-lanes terrain left onto the causeway restore the blinking yellow light use the two right lanes to proceed straight the left outer Lane will be the only turn lane onto the causeway remove the existing Island and palm tree of the crosswalk would remain the existing Center merge will feed the left-hand turn lane supposedly ensuring that Northside traffic is not affected with the proposed changes 170 or more driving residents from the 85 houses on 12th 13th 14th and 15th streets will be affected after living here for a year I see these traffic patterns because I drive in and around them multiple times a day and I use the crop the crosswalk on a regular basis the amount of traffic turning left to the causeway always far outweighs the traffic going straight what would be the purpose of creating two lanes to go straight toward Indian Rocks when this is not a traffic problem and we're just quickly into one lane anyway as I dissect this proposal I will agree that blinking yellow light turning left is long overdue the rest I am completely in disagreement with with as a resident of that immediate area I can attest that there is always a backup of traffic turning left on the causeway during the heavier traffic times but cars are able to condense into the two turn lanes and then make the turn having a flashing yellow light will absolutely allow them to keep moving currently to turn left I have to sneak out into traffic and wait in the center lane until there is an opening or the traffic clears up with the proposed changes that center lane will not be available to any of us on those streets for this purpose making it very difficult to turn left because of the fact that there is still constant traffic coming set from the south whether it be Bridge traffic or Indian Rocks traffic cars that are coming from either direction rarely slowed down for cars pulling out it would be much more difficult to get into that turn lane because no one is going to let us cut in it will be even more difficult to cross through that single long Lane of cars to get to the far Lane to cross toward Indian Rocks removing the island and the Beautiful Palm we would definitely take away a part of the charm of Bel-Air Beach that would absolutely create a greater problem with pedestrian Crossing currently it is still not safe to cross toward the beach because cars in general do not pay attention and the flashing yellow lights aren't bright enough to stop the cars as evidenced by cars still running through flashing lights when we cross by removing the island and changing two lanes to three lanes of traffic will only make crossing a greater safety issue we can all predict that National the natural response for drivers to speed up in order to make that light since there's only one lane and they won't be paying attention to light flashing lights for The Pedestrian Crossing after talking with many neighbors within the community no one can understand why this change would be made moving forward with this proposal would be a mistake and a complete disservice to the surrounding residents and will highly restrict our ability to get out of our streets the only part I support is the left turn arrow to a flashing yellow as I close I would strongly encourage this Council to maintain a focus on our community to make improvements that centers on the needs and the conveniences for us the tax paying residents of Bel-Air Beach and to be careful of changing or fixing things to accommodate the traffic increases from visitors and tourists as long as we are a thoroughfare for tourists we will always have heavy traffic which can never be fixed with these proposed changes it will only a portion of our own Community thank you for your time thank you Mr Warner yes please come up and give us your name and your address my name is Catherine pleaser and I live on 21st Street 106. tonight I wish to engage the city council on two items and then surgery later both deal with disability accommodation I would like the city to relook The Reincarnation from Gulf Boulevard to the beach just north of the Miller Beach Hotel I brought this up to your accounts member last year member of Memphis perhaps together you can come up with [Music] a pie using this path to the beach this relatively new bridge structure does not mean for pharmacy with the same residence and its location slash therapy into the summer my son and my handicapped grandson took the bridge to the beach my grandson rides in a Kansas wagon as he is unable to walk and his motor skills on his right side or before my seven grandson reached the edge of the bridge where it meets the beach and because of the full design of the bridge the wagon tipped over my grandson and son of Natasha program my son said I'll tried to stop the wagon from further Journey soon after my son tried it again I didn't beat a different angle and once again wagons tell us to my handicap bracelet and discussed with his dad up into the beach my grandson is now friend hit somebody she's in this I walk the bridge to see what the problem was and as a disabled veteran I found it challenging to walk up the bridge and them especially when it's standing the handbag was two wines again and I was afraid I was doing this again the second disability accommodation I would like to read to is that that is going into office [Music] industry I would like to see if the city because of traffic signs and morning drivers to be aware of there's a small disabled child within 24 thank you Mr pleasure yes at 22nd Street I'd like to speak to councilman zabel's suggestion or thoughts on this traffic issue for historical purposes when we moved here in 2015 there was only one single left turn lane with a flashing yellow light um because how I've been involved in safety in my military career and I was looking at what we have there proximity of that crosswalk to this traffic light did not make sense only because there's a parking lot over there um councilman suggested that the item go away and leave the crosswalk you still irregardless when I have traffic jammed up no matter how many left turn Lanes you have and again previous administrations for historical purposes have attempted to work with the city of Clearwater Beach to know they open we are because of their problem and that rotary where the uh default to get to the beaches I don't know what the solution is but if I were in a position to help make decisions I take the crosswalk and the median out all together traffic being what it is I understand it can be backed up all the way to 22nd Street unfortunately we've learned in the time we've been here we get our stuff done Monday through Friday and a limited any vehicular movement on the weekends only because you can't get in or get up there down the Gulf Boulevard and even when my wife and I walked to the uh to the beach over there by the hotel it's next to impossible for traffic to yield to the free Lanes thank you thank you Mr Hampton hi everybody uh Roger Maul 115 Causeway Boulevard uh across the street I just learned about this island proposal to the management so I thought I like historic originally when I came it was over the years ago at that time basically anybody who tried to cross the Target because the same traffic that you see now was there without any kind of controls and especially since this first of each access is so close to the turn people take that turn and then just fire up and so when they put in the two items that basically helps solve that problem because of the flashing lights now the flashing lights I think they'd be more effective we'll change them color just because they're very construction truck in the area has a camera lights but you know for you guys I can see we're expressed right into the people who live for it we were North trying to hit that light whoever it was when they made the double turn lanes that came up with the idea that would be electron only that was I think a poor decision because the more people that are north of Causeway you have to wait forever because you can't turn when there's no traffic coming your way so doing with that flashing light would make a huge difference and I see that as really the only remedy for the people turning left because if you take out those islands what it happened before they had the islands in because not only were they rushing and not paying attention to our citizens but it backed all the way up even during spring break weekends it almost went all the way to Clearwater so that would affect everybody over and we're basically trapped inside our community because people will send in order to get out to pick up the boulevard so I would suggest that you rethink taking out of those islands just because I remember the headaches that we had before we put them and and the uh this downgradient of safety that was there by not having those islands so so I would thanks appreciate it thank you Mr Mall and what else yes good evening everyone Tammy lavender of 97 Harbor Drive I'm here tonight just to give a couple of save the dates for the new Bellaire Beach Community

I'd like to say a quick thank you to everyone who donated to our local animals in lead in generate they greatly appreciated it and so did we and then I'm going to switch ears real quick and put my parking record hat on and say um if you like the yoga classes that we're currently doing on Monday Wednesday and Saturday a Tuesday class was just added in the building and then if you've seen them we have the embroidered Belair Beach fanny packs we only have three left and we're probably not getting any more so if you're interested in one of those please make sure that you stop by city hall and we did get new embroidered hand towels in Nebraska anyway that's all I have thank you anyone else yes sir Randy's love is 13th Street I think the idea about removing the palm trees in the island between 12th and 13th is really a terrible idea there's non-stop traffic going northbound to Clearwater I live on 13th and we can't get out it's so bad for people in 12th that they loop around and come out on 13 just to give them a little bit better of a shot okay um I sent an email last week extensively detailing a lot of issues with this plan I don't know who saw the email or the video I took a video out on the street all the traffic I don't know if anybody saw that I saw the video either I can't ask here's the general model questions number of months ago I came here asking about three more benches at the 12th Street access like we used to have six another down to three or nicer now but they're down to three and cleaning up the real high wheat that were blocking one of the Southmost Edge and getting a bike rack so the bikers don't change their bikes to the benches that we have so at least we could sit there Kyle did a great job tripping those wings hitting those weed strips I I think I appreciate that I have no idea on status of getting more benches for a bike Greg and I can't ask now I'll reiterate again that this policy of not taking any questions from the public is I think is really messed up you can say why don't you email your questions if I did last week regarding my issues my concerns about this uh Crossway and taking that Island down no one responded but I have no idea where your head is with that if anybody even saw it before they care okay I can't always make it here during the day to meet with Mike table during his open Office hours so I get no answers I understand your concerns about things getting out of hands like they did but maybe in the past but there's better ways to deal with things that are refusing to answer questions from the constituents of the public that you're here to serve I I like to say Belair beach has implemented the Walla Walla management technique okay I go to Wawa time I used to go with my wife for breakfast and lunch and we they have table we just sit out there and enjoy our lunch and breakfast and whatever while I had a real big issue on Missouri Avenue and all the homeless homeless coming from all over the place picking up those Staples so the wall management decided they get rid of two-thirds of potatoes that that way almost whatever sit okay so I think there's other ways to deal with unruly people or people that are you know out of the line or asking crazy questions or doing something but just to say that you're not taking any questions where is the public to go to get answers to these questions other than trying to squeeze in a date with life that they were sending in an email that you don't know what you're going to get an answer thank you and have a nice day thank you Mr Logan anyone else would like to speak yes [Music] I actually for the first time just learned I can't ask questions so I do not have anything prepared but what I wanted to talk about is the ordinance that you are reading from science about I wanted to remind you about our understanding of why arbitrarily chosen pots and lands sure there is one of our agenda items and I'm going to let you continue but normally if there's an agenda Island we gave you the arc it was big while we're discussing okay so you can continue now or you can continue hearing medicine absolutely I definitely my machines that we were just going to read the title of a little discussion on it I'd be happy to wait yes any other yes sir yeah I can't believe she's a 1021 Palm Drive right over here on the causeway as far as uh removing the island I just wanted to bring up some more of the safety issues with that um that is my way of getting over to the beach because I live right here on the causeway so what I have found is that foil is taken away is that when I go across the street and I'm at the light and I go to walk across the street there all the people that are turning right there that have a right turn on red they're not paying any attention to the crosswalk they're not paying any attention to that little light that says I'm able to walk they're looking to the left to see if there's any cars coming I've almost got hit probably two three times after the late change walking out to cross the street at that light I'm talking the traffic away so if we remove the crosswalk it's you know that's crazy so removing the crosswalk I think should not even be on the agenda removing the island also I believe is a bad idea because the island actually triggers people to see that there is a crosswalk um and I almost got hit a few times even walking across the island with the light splashing um you know I I totally will sit and wait and make sure that the car is slowing down because the car is you know they they tend to not even slow down unless somebody's standing in the middle of the road so um just wanted to move that safety issue brought up you very much any other comments oh all right assistant comments are closed all right now we are along to item number three this is a presentation Pinellas County Sewer Rehabilitation project yes sir please come on up and introduce yourself mayor and council member of my name is Dennis Simpson I'm at Pinellas County Utilities engineering Division and I'm in charge of the horizontal assets the lining projects or on my Administration I have here he was in charge of inspection and also have in-liner contractors and his name is John Sutherland um cured in place um lining contract gravity sewer is a transless technology and it's basically for rehabilitating deteriorating gravity sewers and that is done by the lion and what is it they do it's basically they take aligning and put into the pipe and by um here Steam and ultraviolet light they expand the lining and stop the fields infiltration of water into the soil presently we have a contract which is and um from what I understand there were some issues and I'm here to basically respond to those issues sure what would you like to review the issues the complaints that our city manager regular would you like to explain what the issues to share computer yes there I welcome to Pinellas County Utilities because they got underway with the project he's referring to which is the sanitary sewer create location right um the contractors in minor Solutions in we did not have any knowledge a project which is you know it's going to be a couple months long spanning the city when I first thought I thought I didn't know I heard about it happening on Fifth Street and I was trying to protect the county if I'm not being spent on the project turns out it was it was pretty much the whole city so um since then I've been in contact with the county and they provided a continuing information to me which has been helpful I guess at some point um kind of drop the ball and notifying the city that this was coming up um and I just get I covered with the county you know how important it is for us to know um because this is to call us first but I know what's going on so um I I then just being in contact with the county has something to come up with a speeding I'm just kind of go over the project and address any concerns that um those citizens might have students over the project and I I guess the biggest concern was why weren't we notified and I understand that door tags went out the books that they put across and there were also some other workloads where they they just weren't aware of the project completely weren't at home and came home yeah yes we normally would notify that we have decided on a large projects like this because I think we're doing about 60 to 70 percent of the gravity sewers in Bel Air Beach so for a project this size I think from Airlines notify the city to let them know how we're coming normally what happens is that the project gets thin it gets awarded and then when the constructions start they will do cleaning at that time we wouldn't have notify a residence but before they keep aligning because we're aligning they're basically going to be locking because lateral flows into the line and that's usually for a segment say 400 feet you know if it takes about a day of work so they notify 24 hours before like looking door hangers on the lake on the residence to let them know that they want to be doing the lighting in that segment and as they progress they'll do more door hangers [Music] installed any lines yet in Miller Beach or are you only doing testing and uh yesterday as right now I'm sorry sir Joe box County Construction Administration but at this point so far we have roughly about 80 lines left to line through started out with a hundred and 132 I believe so we still have 80 more to go for trying I understand the um the fact that I apologize about that is from cleaning the line saying we're lying that's when the notices go out because your sewage is actually being backed up so the more water you use the ocean we've also learned that if you give out a notice a week ahead of time 7 2 hours of people [Music] Monday will do Tuesday Wednesday about 48 hours and you also Wednesday or Tuesday you'll do Thursday Friday again like on Thursday go back and do Friday's notice again because it'll be more than 28 hours we try to try to keep it around 48 hours I don't like 24 because that is a short Focus and some people are like oh I have big plans tomorrow my son's birthday party they don't work on the weekends but you never know who's doing what during the week especially if something goes wrong it could be a very late night thank you I'm just curious what's the maximum homes that are you've encountered here in one of these are like it's it's really hard to say because some of your runs might be a 200 foot line segment some of them might be a 400 foot depending on how many homes you know how big your lots are you know you might only have well some some of the runs here that we've we've done with the side street right over here try a bottle of water so you let's go on a shot if you are just curious about what's the time span for that one if this the one right next door right here uh what what is the name of the street here right right on the other side of the parking lot easier um that day there they was done by three o'clock they started they they started televising at 7am and they were completely done and gone by three o'clock okay so you came Second Street he didn't know if you know if you were in one hole over here for a while that was probably the cleaning for me and then we really just didn't know we had no deal as to what was going on other than papers don't run your water after 7 A.M but we really just had no information if we were a little afraid that we would come home to what punch Man Shirley came on [Music] or something like that because I'm sure there's some people that won't even know that tags on their door and that's one thing that we're going across to the the gentleman that's here now here's Johnny and today if you swarming up an inliner great they would have going over the liner goes in he will go to each house and say can I get your phone number so I can put you on a group text and let you know hey you know he does he does do that if we're only on a street that's you know here and see here it's only got five he'll just come out on the door and say you're free um hey you know but when you like a lot of times we they try to do double shots meaning 800 feet you might have 10 15 Services all together that's when he'll do a group of chat with the neighborhood and then you know he's on site walking back and forth the guys are on the site my inspectors on you guys have ever seen you know somebody on the street look for Pinellas County truck you know his name is Trevor Logan he'll be more than happy to answer anything Kyle Kyle had my contact information I was always on I always answer emails so if it was not even funny reach out to me I'll have your hand s great thank you very much so I have a question I just want to add a couple of things and that is I mean I think I voice my you know the day I came home you were had no idea this was happening there's no notices no no information provided to provide to an absolute Mass Ive and I was not the only person on the street I'm sure probably several others I called Al's family Phillies and was told that you guys were not providing any service out there with no construction going on there was nothing to be enough that cause and what they told me to do was talk to risk management that was their only answer they would not even research they talk they I made them check twice with their service technicians to see if they were doing anything after insisted nothing was me enough that concerned me I had called piles at this point now it's after five on a cell phone turn he's probably I know you own those utility lines but they run through our cities any work being done in our city needs to go through our city manager yeah and then all of us will get the call too and there was no communication with anyone that so that's got to be addressed voting board then as we move forward in this project you must know today where you're going to be tomorrow it would be nice to be able to just for packing to send an email at least to our residents to know hey we're working on you know whatever streets these three streets over the next three days and expect to see a door hanging or something so that we're aware of what's happened that on my street I guess we've only been our Line's been clean there's not it has not been lined so I don't know kind of have it that's going to cost really not happy with the house I apologize about that I was not aware of that day that the claiming I was not informed of that which then creates the other question is how safe are utilities if anyone can come into our city and tap into our lines how safe is that as a right not very safe it's causes concern to me and then it said I was not aware of the cleaning proof of human beings in Beller Vlogs why you understand me was embargo you know so I that's not my jurisdiction I um as far as getting the problem with giving you guys the schedule it's a schedule it's it says okay we might be um for instance today I can't remember what street for the guys on today because we had two mining groups here today one has a offset joint on the bike it wasn't able to work so I so I don't know when if I tell you that it was your street today and all of a sudden when you come home think oh gosh it's over with I want to go in my bathroom it's done but nothing happened so right here the point was I said maybe you hadn't even send an email and rejected in these streets watch for a door hangers all right you're not going to hang a door hanger unless you're doing a quarter right or no the door hanger was I was there when they went and created video this morning the Island so we cannot put a minor in today so you know and that's and sometimes you know when the truck comes the liner that you were supposed to do today might be on the very bottom those guys who aren't going to dig through 2000 feet of wire to get that one off I find it incredible that you're such a contractor can't do a better job communicating with my resume said meaning they're very long any other comments or questions from the council you're just like understand correct what you're just doing this main sewer line you're not doing the branches working houses right so how would that back up I mean of course in order for background but when you're cleaning and you're using like a sand glass of tool it's a Jeff nozzle on the other hose yes and if your why is on backwards and they they pull back and you won't push water up you will the pressure is too high the scaling which some of these older pipes you know they do have build up on them they do need to be these scale before we put a minor if not you're just you're sure sometimes you do have to use high impression and it does it happens you know I don't like when it happens but it Bridge tail plate coming off your house 15-20 25 so we've had extend I can't see how much was going back online Refresher 600 yeah if it's a straight you know hurry flat plywood council member Baker out of the home whatever they whatever whatever it was that they did of our life and in a Rolex model we heard things in sync it was very conserving I believe I believe they did our street over here completely agreement yes I believe the 8th Street has the money I don't know I I think he did marvelous show the crew was very professional out there we started three minutes before seven which isn't allowed [Music] one character Street and we can always stay outside you guys are very professional to have the codes out and everything any other questions or comments from the council coming out and answer some questions trying to figure things out no problem we look forward to a much broader outcome anything either all right out of four presentation from the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office law enforcement monthly report good evening I am Sergeant boy Swift and I was coming Sheriff's Office and tonight I'm presenting the activity for January of 2023. under the UCR property and person crimes I'm happy to report there were zero across the board so there was no criminal activity in the city that month however there were five people arrested and that resulted off the track activities of traffic stops DUIs Warner residents and Drug Care moving forward for Deputy activity there were a total of 683 events within the city leaving that as usual were the director controls and then traffic enforcement there were no crashes in the city so I think that should make everybody happy here in that and then lastly there were a combination of 174 citations and warnings issued for the month oh yeah thank you very much thank you and uh does not hear about this paper would you like to give us a summary on the code enforcement report yes sir happily so we did this our second time was going around with this new format so enforcement reporter um Steve's been working with the template that we've been together and this once we had 51 listings in our report some of them are closed down from our school ongoing again I did did some high charges to show the categories of the violations that are being covered um you know sort of the distribution of the city streets our outstanding code violations we've had some developments the the dangerous structure we had a hearing sort of a board of adjustments scheduled for Marshall 9th attorney has been in contact with the attorney representing the resident he was advised that we [Music] close from home to to attempt to make a reasonable accommodation for Destruction so intent to work forward to traffic onto some kind of something that's acceptable to the city within the line we'll give you a follow -ups the we had a hearing since the last meeting on February 23rd for the visit they had some some voted car variation overgrowth so that that was issued an order of fine and um some Works they've done on that property and uh if I got quite done yet I'm meeting with someone tomorrow to follow up on stuff used to be done the unaffirmative remodel construction so it was a roof on the old RV they've actually done work on the roof right now we discovered that they never a full apartment probably so we're continuing to follow up on that that's not closed yet um the I did talk his next house is under its standardized for sale there's a title company that's inquired and I haven't talked to them to give them an updated where we stand uh we have a sort of tournamental hearing that took place in early February um that was given in uh you know fine like we typically [Music] and um which was uh just recently on March 2nd for another overgrowth and uh invasive species so that was that was issued in order again to find out it would be starting right now controlled but it will be contracted and cleaned up Council any questions or comments yeah out of Kyle there was a hearing back into my beliefs September when I you know we're affected each Street um I mean there was a fine assessment of 150 a day I believe we file for an appeal I don't see anything in the circuit board or file I think there was an email sent to Patty things following interview but why isn't available I can explain that procedurally procedurally or correct that there were code enforcement [Music] the the decision of the master at the time was that the responding party had to submit a a permit application of the a I believe a preliminary permit application was received and rejected a second attempt was made and in that in response to that second attempt your city manager Founders insufficient and not did not form a special basis for the relief if you will requested apartment that is the decision that was appealed not the Magistrate's decision in the course of after informally declaring a desire to appeal that decision the party retained legal representation who is certainly well versed in the matter I've had a few conversations with their counselors and we are navigating the legal boundaries around that process and whether or not a permit is a possibility in that context understanding The Limited preemptions provided by federal law and otherwise so that process is being navigated into the city on the best footing or there to be the legal challenge to ensure that all administrative Avenues have been addressed sufficiently and that's where the process stands but to your narrow the question as to why there's nothing in the Circuit Court they did not meet the responding party did not appealous decision so the Magistrate's decision is okay the Magistrate's decision was that a permit application needs to be submitted and the parties are working to resolve the net submission professor but there was a hundred million dollar fine in each day and the magistrate found that the party had replied by making a submission of later in the fall but I I was told that permanent Easter made proficient this was an administrative decision but whether or not the master founded sufficient for the purposes of fulfilling the Master's requirement is a sort of a separate instinct let's start from the ground up before you put the tower up you had a fuller pattern which violated our setback so why are we not why are we catering to a hazardous condition now I guess this town is going up at least at least nine months and they were approaching another hurricane season he has done nothing to remove that Tower I get emails phone calls addresses every day working on that street from the neighbors surrounding that house how much longer are we going to give this guy another bite of the Apple before we do something thank you for your question I would say your question is praised presumes a few things but what I would say to answer your question is as to why are we still engaging in this process I would say because the law mandates or dictates that we should and my job is to mitigate the city's risks and in their totality not just from the perceived risks of the neighboring property progress but also the litigation exposure or people requirements as set forth by prb1 and the other unbelieval Provisions so we're navigating the process as we know you attended that code enforcement proceeding my my arguments and mastering on behalf of the city was that the the property owner was suggesting that a permitting process was fuged was a futility and was some kind of charade if you will and there was no point in applying to night automatically and my response to that point was give us an application give us an opportunity to evaluate it and we will evaluate it on its own merits and that's what the parties are going through his own legal counsel has stated that that permitting products submissions can be more detailed and robust and intends to make a more robust submission for the party specific parties in this case the city's consideration so while it may be um well the timing of it may be frustrating I would say that we are going through the process as addicted to my also my added understanding of that is that there's been Towers not necessarily precise on there over the past few decades in intervening periods so this is not the first um appearance of this structure and we are trying to make sure that as we deal with it we do it we do it well again there was no certain order file and what I can find out what we just said convert okay so the 30 days have collapsed six months he missed the boat to file on people of Masters decision yes sir Okay so that decision didn't just say he had a free filing a refile from the permit the way I read it and then he's fall in love second of all again that Tower is still there right all right and we're not doing anything about it disagree I don't I I detail what we're doing it may not be a solution to your satisfaction but as it relates to code enforcement I work in the direction of the executive of this city of city manager I'd advise the city manager on our legal Solutions options and resources and as your City attorney I'm taking the course of upon advice the manager is in agreement with I I don't submit with my but the current plan of action May satisfy every party but it is in keeping with the requirements of Florida Statutes Federal riding stands otherwise in resulting in some matter well you said you said in a case an iPhone in this case too versus Marion County and it clearly status in the occur the FCC has deterred that local governments do not have to make reasonable accommodations for ham radio the cabinet structures for discussion or prohibited by residential subdivision evidence conditions and Restorations which we restrict again why am I even pushing this issue I don't think that I can actually useful I don't think I can answer any more satisfaction I can remain calm because I don't live where it's well maybe you will find out but you have four residents that are very concerned about this and they all supported you Dave all right so why aren't we even forcing our laws or in the borders what's the point the point is is that you're [Music] to the presiding officer I would say only um I think I've answered your questions I understand you're not satisfied or the reason that those answers I think that holding this photo goes a little further than that and it's not specifically the well that quoted language is certainly in there it's also a couched in the Pro the other case line that's progeny uh governing this you look to these federal guidelines there's a limited field and case law on this side unit and I'm not coming just from a place of I don't want to get people upset I'm looking at the case law and trying to get like read the disposal this photo opinion I've read there's two two major opinions out of DCA there's an opinion there's a few other opinions that all speak to the notion that a government need not simply yield to any request or any application you can enforce your codes but that must be done on an analysis of the particular antennas at issue especially in amateur and radio which you cannot prohibit full stop you have to consider whether those things can be accommodated in keeping with the aesthetic safety and other mattress and I'm saying we can't consider that until we have a proper and complete submission that allows for the parties to evaluate that I'm trying to develop a factual record that the part that the city can stand on whether or not you think that's a proper course of action I understand but I as it relates to code enforcement I'm working with the official in the city responsibility sir I understand what you're saying that there's a proper procedure this is arachnid this is already there okay if he submitted a permit and it got bounced out and there was nothing done I'd be 100 agree with you but you're telling me I could go build a house okay the court building the house and then say well I'll send their department at my will no sir I would submit to you that a house that's quite different from the Nintendo it's still a violation and I I completely understand your position sir I'm working through all I can't change where we are at the end of the day she's going to be fine 150 for every day if he does not there's an outstanding fine now for 150 for roughly nine days that fine is outstanding whether or not that fine is resolved through the process of me working with his legal counsel to mitigate the city's risk and analyze the situation I can't just possibly say that more do I have the authority unilaterally to either compose or remove that line there is a finding place very factual stuff how that process resolves is ongoing I had a nearly 90-minute conversation and roughly almost 75 minute conversation attorney just last week had great length when we talked about the balance of the case law where the issues go and generally the parties were in agreement that a permit is necessary that the city needs to provide to provide its request as to what data is requested as this is not a common infrastructure I will tell you that my firm does this works for municipalities and nearly a dozen municipalities before Richie to home speech and in speaking with all of my colleagues ham radio antenna towers are not exactly the most combination uh and that you have community community we're navigating a very very Niche and area of Law and trying to make sure that we do so properly as good stewards of the public service thank you Mr Warren I appreciate it uh Mr Davis do you have a comment yeah well that's actually more commandment um city manager that's the dangerous structure I think number 105. yeah assistant here okay thank you any other comments or questions thank you together and it's so much easier to follow rescue District normally it's Chief Jeff Davidson but this month we complete game and it's uh assistant chief Higley but that's all right good evening council members vice mayor mayor Gaddis Chief Davidson does send his apologies that he's not here this evening to present to you however he is at in Tallahassee at the Florida Association of Special Districts annual meeting where he is taking some classes and learning some additional stuffs about Special Districts so that you can provide you know the highest level of service that he can to Our Community Partners including from Bella Beach um last month in Ballard Beach there were 17 calls for service there were three fire farms and um 14 or 13 medical calls and one other 78 6 percent of the time we met our call times for ALS and 90 of the time these calls were responded to and eight minutes are 31 seconds or with that being said last Monday we had the pleasure on February 27th of having a presentation here at the city hall where Chief Davidson presented The Proposal that we have submitted to Pinellas County Emergency Services to further improve the services that we provide to the residents of what we consider North Indian Rocks Beach Bellaire Beach and the residents of Bel Air Shore that proposal that we've provided to them look to be apply for an additional two paramedics in a ALS transport capable rescue that would we still have not decided if if the engine would move closer to here to our new plan station before we put a rescue out there many of your support folks here talk about the traffic issues and they have not gotten any better so when I read to you those times that only 76 76 percent that we were making our our City Times that is unacceptable for the district we want to make sure that um you know we can get those numbers up in the 90th percentile in the plan that we have come up with and we have presented will enable us to do so um if you have any questions we did a full presentation that is public records and all these regards here and we can give you that information to the residents or community so they can kind of be informed we are looking for Community feedback and I believe we have some avenues that we can do that and again we can provide you that other request that I will make those cards um following answers the process in place so the next step in that process is called the data during the focus group that meeting is on Friday and I will be and again presenting to the fire chiefs and some other interested in parties on this committee about our request and there's about 15 other requests around the county that have been before so we all kind of present our case so the next uh step in that is if they approve or recommend that it goes forward uh there will be What's called the msac committee the emergency medical service advisory Council which consists of some local political leaders and other interested parties those requests will go to that and they will vet them and again they'll move those forward of of the chain and hopefully within the next few months we'll have an idea of whether this idea of The Proposal will come to fruition and again we hope that the citizens of the Belair Beach would fully support that because our number one goal is to make sure that we're providing you these Fire EMS services that you wait for every year for us um over the last couple weeks uh the better weapon of our district we were able to obtain what we call a required structure so if any of it goes down to our painting Rock speech uh 404 about four which is called Health tower the two structures next to it are going to be well they are pretty much demolished and make Urban Pacific condos however we were fortunate enough to have the party representing the owners allow us to trade so how does that benefit you and in these real world trainings that we have um you know we we train like we do in real life so the amount of women got to flow water in these in this mid-rise high-rise structure we got to do some uh firefighter safety into Iowa and some rescue stuff in a building that's similar to many of data in your community obviously the bridge side is not necessarily residential but it's still it's great training for our folks as far as the district is concerned we try to hold agencies we've added treatment paramedics to the district one is a transfer from Seminole fire rescue who has approximately three years of service to Pinellas County he will be put on the truck and right away will be able to treat folks the other one is they transfer from Hillsborough County there's a several months process depending on when the classes can get in that he will be a fully accounting player paramedic so those folks will be starting by the end of this month and they will be providing services to again all of the residents in our fire district so we're welcome to have two paramedics and a very difficult thing right now hiring in firing EMS is a Hot Topic right now there's not really a lack of qualified candidates that we got over the last few hires we've obtained some Stellar banded displays we have a woman in the last one but that will be providing the top level of care that you folks come to expect um lastly Kyle and I had a small hurricane expo here in this room and we had gotten back together this year and started playing for what we hope to be a bigger and better and annual event within Belair Beach and I had suggested that actually since we have other Community Partners with the town of Indian shoulders and the City of hidden Rocks Beach that maybe we would make in a district-wide event in that everybody can rotate it you folks have been gracious enough to offer up for maybe our next first annual event so him and I have been working towards getting some speakers and providing a little bit more robust event within the community that everybody that we would like to invite you know whether they are in our own care stereo or anyone actually they need to show us so we appreciate you folks allowing us to do that as far as the fire district concerns that's all that I have for you this evening again I'm going to be some cars and if you have any questions please feel free to reach out thank you do you have any questions explain why break as possible and you know okay so briefly for folks here in the community when I started from Palestine Coast 17 plus years ago we always used to respond to our fire engine but our well investor right now the rest of but our engine down to the northernmost end of our district however that was a disservice to you folks because the amount of time that it takes for us to get Iranian Rock speech to the north and in excuse me Bel Air Beach finally we went to your closest unit dispatch so unfortunately for you folks I would say the majority of the time you're getting a unit from Clearwater Beach right at Sand Key or Station 43 um yeah you'll get a Largo or Clearwater aided because we do want to provide the highest level of care and the majority of time in an EMS call um Euro one closer is better so what we're planning on doing is regardless of what happens we're we're constructing a new fire station in hosts in Northern Indiana Rocks Beach with our projected date we'll be able to hit the benchmarks set by the county and we will once again be able to service the residents of the iron Beach that pair pay your tax money to us so your EMF as far as EMS goes you only pay our fire tax and we do as long as we're available we do come to those I just want to let you guys know that but EMS is put into the county but we feel as if since you are our residence you do support us you do pay our taxes we want to make sure that our women are responding down here to you mostly what we've done is again every year they open up what's called an enhancement you can put in for enhancement and chief Davis has been I feel a godsend to our fire district and he's been working hard to provide the you know a higher level of service that we have in the past so we put in for that enhancement again basically it's two paramedics but it actually turns into about seven folks because you have to have two every day and and the rest here so speaking of that the county is getting busier the traffic all this stuff so we just went uh the other day it's called 3M basically it's like the world is falling apart all of the fire department units that have transport capable units are transporting their own patients to the county this was not like that when I started it's so busy that the fire department has to take up the slack from the sun star units that you have going around the county and I can tell you the closest unit of Transport rescue is in Clearwater Beach Rescue 41 which is downtown Mario and then the other one on the only other one on the beach is in a Treasure Island so adding a transport rescue to our fire district We Believe will benefit not only the folks here but our other partners in Largo and you know down the South where we needed to be in it again it all comes back to being able to be uh you know as helpful as we can to everyone in their Community we're all neighbors regardless of whether you live in this town or or up in Clearwater over in Largo we want to make sure that we take care of everybody so again we have a lot more information that I can provide you again facts and figures and stuff and what we have future if I hear that stuff out but we would ask that you email one of us the only other comment that I have like really I'm looking for looking for plan [Music] you have does not include asking for any more money okay so no this is it this would be a completely counting funded uh unit that we were asking for so again this is an EMS unit we're asking for it's two paramedics and a transport capable Rescue all out of the existing fund that you folks already pay into so without getting into some additional specifics you folks paying a lot of money and you don't necessarily receive all that back and we just want a little bit of that back to make sure that we can provide and not only you folks but the rest of the county an elevated level of service thank you very much are you asking our residents to read so so we we have submitted the request however just like you can email your state senators and say I support this and I support that we do have the contact information for these um decision makers within the county that would be happy to provide to you I have to be careful when I say that the meeting I guess publicly but please by all means if you're interested we can email this information and give you a little bit more on that so we will look basically just just saying hey we really support what geek David said and the McDonalds Suncoast fire rescue District disaster report and we hope that you strongly consider it thank you thank you very much all right now we are all to item number council members so uh it's not uncommon for council members to uh to attend one of the courses offered by the Florida League cities every once in a while we get an overachiever so I have two awards for this in person tonight so the first one is a certificate of completion for the online orientation class for newly elected officials Stone council member City for Bel Air route congratulations okay [Applause] we also have a second one which is the certificate of completion for we affectionately call it emo but it's the Institute of elected Municipal officials and she completed that in St Augustine Florida January 20th and 21st 2023 presented to political Livingstone council member of city of Northern Beach thank you [Applause] all right we are on to agenda item number seven uh this is consideration of accepting the annual comprehensive financial report for the fiscal year in September 30th 2022 is presented by salt marsh Cleveland and gun certified Republican Council man sir if you uh live please give us your name and uh my name is Chuck Landers I'm going to sophomore's Cleveland gun I want to thank the mayor of the council for the outer case would once again serve as the audit firm for the city we're also thank Kyle for his assistance through the auto process and a special thanks to Heather and Andrew as well there's no way the audit process could be completed without all the work that they do you've been provided a draft presentation of the financial statements if you took the time to read through that draft you've never said there are some pages in there that say this information is not available it's mainly in the statistical section and it's also where the gfoa is certificate will call the statistical section information we have this the historical information from 2021 back to 2013 but we do not have the 2022 information yet Heather has requested that that is being held up by account so once that information is available we can put that in the report I point that out because the statistical section of the financial statements isn't covered by our audit opinions so Our obligation is to look at that and make sure that it certainly agrees with the financial statements the basic financial statements of the city and then if it doesn't agree then we have to modify our report I can't imagine that it's once it's there that it's not going to agree city is going to have to make the decision of how long they want to wait to receive that information before finalizing the audit there [Music] discussed when that time comes the the gfoa submission is not extend the due date is at the end of the month like you can request an application for extension which the city did do last year at our requests because we had staffing issues not able to read this year it is really just in the gfoace hands waiting on them and we do online to understand when they will issue that certificate certification I think it wouldn't be but again it's we don't have any time on there so um we have until the end of the month to really make a decision on how the city wants to proceed with that so that it's not super urgent at the moment but something that does need to be addressed in the next couple weeks so with that what I brought to present tonight is the anticipated opinion I would have expected to change so we have the anticipated opinion and the basic financial statements here the uh to like to take the time to just go through these in summary it's certain pages when you go through in detail but the the important parts I'll point out the most important part of the financial statements that I would say is on page one this is the our church report so you have to go through several Roman numerals before you actually get to page one 60 degrees of an inch into it so on page one the second paragraph We Do cut to the chase now there hasn't been changes in the auto search report passed down so we do get to the opinions here at the beginning instead of making three through four pages of model search reporting into the opinion but you'll see that in the second paragraph on page one in our opinion the financial statements referred to above present fairly and all material respects the respective financial position of the governmental activities the business type activities each major Fund in the respective budgetary comparison for the general fund of the city as of and for the year ended September 30th 2022 and the respective changes in financial position and where applicable cash flows thereof for the year then ended in accordance with the county of principles generally accepted States of America so this is the first opinion that you're concerned with in your financial savings there's going to be a few more opinions as we get to some more reports towards the back but before we get there I'll just point out a few of the financial statement highlights on page 17 this is the statement of that position is what's most comfortable to a balance sheet that you would see in a for-profit entity there are there is technical statements in here called balance sheet but they don't necessarily represent what you would see in the same so if you're in a form if you're used to looking at for-profit entity financial statements this is going to be the most comfortable we see that in the middle of the page and this is as of September 30th 2022 total assets of the city were 19 million 555 795 total liabilities of the city were two million 667 thousand dollars leaving net position of 16 million 888 000. so of that net position 6 million four hundred and fifty thousand of it is unrestricted and 10 million four hundred and thirty eight thousand is a healthy balance sheet the next page would be the comparable income statement for a for-profit entity but this is called the statement of activities it starts with the expenses on the left side and then goes to the program revenues but really I'd like to just focus on the bottom numbers let's just get to the bottom you see that the change in that position with the city was a net increase of just under one million dollars per year 994 000. so that is the second up from the or third up from the bottom line the bottom right corner begin about a million dollar increase year over year from the year before giving a net position at the end of the year the 16 million 888 000. I did mention that there are balance sheets in the statements the very next page would be considered the balance sheet of the governmental funds the city has two governmental funds the general fund and the capital project folks point that out that you understand so you understand what is there that the city has two more funds that would be considered proprietary funds or business type funds next page I would turn your attention to is Page 23. is that because most people are very concerned about the budget and budget actual and that's what this page is is the budget is actual for the general fund the middle of the page is the final budget the or the middle column on the page is the final budget the column next to the right is the actual and then the far right column is the difference between the two so you can see that total revenues were budgeted at about 2.5 million they came in at a little over 3 million for a favorable variance of just over a half a million dollars in the middle Pages our middle part of this page you can see that total expenditures were budgeted at just over 2 million they came in at just under 2 million for a favorable variance of 118 000 for a total thing with a favorable variance of 625 000 on the year when you have higher revenues and lower expenses the favorable variance there I'll point out that that line where the favorable variance of 625 has shown it currently says deficiency of revenues over expensive expenses that needs to be changed to excess of revenues under excess of revenues over expenses needed improvised that wording the I mentioned this the city has two additional funds on the next page that's this is the same in that position for proprietary funds that's the stormwater fund and the marina fund for those two funds combined for 2.1 million and the total net position is also 2.1 million roundings there's very few liabilities in those two funds and that's on page 24. the next page the 0.2 is the page 25 this the stakehold of revenues and expenses and changes in deposition for the proprietary funds it's basically the income statement equivalent for those two funds you see that's the charges for services and the stormwater fund 177 000 the marina fund 82 000 for total of 260 000 between the two proprietary funds the total operating income for those two funds netted out to 8 800 which is under nine thousand dollars between the two there were some transfers in so the total change in that position for those funds was an increase of 33 000 after the twenty five thousand dollars was transferred in for the insurance the next several pages are the notes for the financial statements there are a few that I would like to point out probably in your report your referencing the Hazardous structure and some legal correspondence that's going on with that I would like to draw the council's attention to page 44. in the middle of the section there is a no disclosure that currently reads accounts receivable for the general fund includes 196 915 from a resident of the city for code violations for failure to meet construction schedule timeline ordered just ordered by a special Magistrate on May 19th 2021 the city has no intention to forgive these fines and believes the balance will be fully collectible therefore the city has not reported an allowance as of September 30th 2022 that is our understanding of the city's position if that is not the case I would ask that you do share with us to see if there should be an allowance recorded there the reason and I allowance what I mean is if that's not going to be fully collectible and this is the number as of September 30th Thrones on a daily basis we need to considerably the collectibility of the realizability of this asset asset this is a concentration it is a material amount for the city both in every aspect of our material calculations so I want to on the government-wide basis for the for the city as a whole this is a material number he said that's the antenna this is not the antenna well they're not this is not the tall structure or every antenna this is a construction there's no concerned it's not does not have to do with the AM radio okay so anyway I will point out that paragraph because that is something that you have never seen in your financial statements before um it's new and we want to make sure that that is correct that that made to us so the week before before this is finalized we want to make sure that that's still the current intention on this same page page 44 and Note 5 this is the changes in capital assets as municipality the infrastructure is a big part of what you have and you see that this carries the beginning balance forward to the ending balance at the end of the year the total government I'm in the middle of the page or the middle of the table there there it started the total governmental Capital Assets in the beginning of the year were 12.4 million not a big increase there you can see that the assets continue to be depreciated so the government will net assets the start of the Year 10.8 million and the after depreciation was done they ended just under 10.5 million that 10 million 450 that's the governmental activity then the next two table or the next part of that table are the proprietary funds we see that they started at a net amount of 1.7 million and after depreciation they were 1 million 671 000. no additions as a municipality lots of times people are concerned about the debt that the the town was carrying or the city of Sperry on page 47 this is note 9. you'll see the schedule of the different loans that city has outstanding with it when I say loans off a dead blown or Bond and on the far right column you see that the total governmental activities had an outstanding debt at the end of the year of a million seven hundred thirty eight thousand the proprietary funds had outstanding debt of 23 000 for a total of a million 761 000. yeah now we're going to jump forward several pages quarter of an inch or more to page 85 let's get back to the opinions page 85 is the Independent Auto Church report on internal control over financial reporting and on compliance and other matters based on an audit the financial statements performed in accordance with government auditing standards the sentences you're looking for on this first page is the very last sentence the last two sentences where we say we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses however material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified again if that's what you're looking for on that page if you turn the page there's a paragraph titled compliance and other matters I mean the sentence there that you're looking for is the last one the results of our tests this was no instances of non-compliance or other matters that are required to be reported under government Audits and standards the phrases that you like to see there turning the page to page 87 this is the management letter it's a couple of pages long the important sentences that I'll point out here in the very last one on the first page there were no findings or recommendations made on internal control and compliance issues during the preceding annual Financial audit then turning the page to the section called Financial conditions and management the last paragraph in that section section 10.5441 and I2 rules of the auditor general requires that we communicate any recommendations to improve financial management in connection with our audit we did not have any such Communications the next section of additional matters last sentence in that paragraph in connection with our audit we did not note any such findings and then the very last page is the independent accomplish report on compliance with section 218.415 for a statute the important sentence in this page is the third one third paragraph in our opinion the city of Bellaire Beach Florida provided in all material respects with the aforementioned requirements of fiscal year ended September 30th 2022. 2 and that's through the audience report are you looking to us [Music] I mean you know made clear that that needs to be easy right precise it's my my search so from a financial statement reporting perspective we're concerned is so the asset exists there's no doubt about that the fines are being occurred um is there going to be any negotiation of that right now but if there is anticipated negotiation and that all of that isn't going to be collected we would need to take that into consideration to see if that asset value should be lowered yes yes would never again quantifying that large so I think there's probably some opportunity although none of us want to I think that that's the reality of this we and so therefore we are asking from the city of Houston Council what is the anticipated realizing the value of that this we need you all to give us a number and then we you need the number tonight no sir but but it is something that that would need to be finalized before we make the decision of is it is the report going to be submitted by the 331 deadline for gfoa will it be extended it is something that will have to be resolved for the audience finalized but no sir it does not have to be done tonight any other questions this was placed on the agenda as to accept this report it doesn't say anything about giraffe giraffe are we should be taking this or are you asking us to just accept the direct one for now in with the expectants that we're going to receive money file yes I should have included Corrections we wanted to get the salt marsh to come in and present with the automatic awareness now it still needs to go to the audit committee [Music] so I'm going to need a motion for the council member to modify this agenda item safe draft annual comprehensive I'm filming do I have a second all in favor all right all right so we're going to change that to uh direct and then what I'm going to need now is a motion to accept this draft report [Music] opposed [Music] uh you sure can see manager said was that we need to appoint council members in the audience [Music] for Jose can ton I have been here [Music] and with someone else would like to say about a second all in favor I think okay so um now we have thank you for stepping up try to make sure I gave my explosion on that I'll make a motion to uh let Council Sab vice mayor Shirley and the representative to the audit committee go ahead a second all right could we have a second all in favor aye aye any opposed all right congratulations thank you for stepping up here is that satisfying all of your requirements for that yes I will deal with the CAC to uh scheduled news and figure out our timeline complete pursuing expansion after you feel really good reviews okay do we have any other questions for uh Mr Landers before but thank you very much appreciate your efforts yes sir question sure products here 22 1985. it's not any material an acid of the city it's not a material asset to the operation to the ongoing operation of the city correct and then the audit of meeting my name is David otter we have an attorney materiality of a dollar amount we have to look at the different reporting opinion so there's the government applied and there are the different funds each one has their own materiality that this number does meet the materiality threshold of all of those materiality is that asset going to make or break the SE and you know but in financial reporting it is a material amount basically the only membership and it is a concentration of one individuality okay any other question for comments thank you very much Mr Landers thank you to uh all right we are on to number eight to the attorney's report Mr Moore I do have a report thank you Mr Mayor I continue to work with your manager on the array of issues who I was not in attendance at your last work session of producing the revisions to eliminate Provisions for the sign code discussed we have a resolution tonight concerning parking charges with my office and my colleagues have worked on the neighborhood partner mobile contract review and other similar issues otherwise continue to work through issues in the main contact with your manager I would say on a daily basis that's a really good time today but any issues that you folks have questions about that it's an extra process on 105 is that the same topic we were discussing research the last uh the last place where we left that I had a discussion a lengthy discussion on Thursday with his Council I committed with his legal council I can commit it to him to meet and discuss this matter with the manager this week and provide them we're going to understand we need to determine what the applicable restrictions are with code if any as it relates to permit it instead of what what questions we have substantively about this particular so there's not a currency except at the moment to answer your question in the near future no sir that's not true I've already told I was as I said I intend to speak with their attorney today if you're asking me if there's a code enforcement hearing schedule there's not if you're asking me if there's a board of adjustment here in schedule there is not what we need to determine is what best what procedure is most appropriate and the procedure will be determined by the work product that comes out of our out of our exchanges and not everything is predetermined and that'll be quite what I'm saying my aim is probably excited to have a path forward I've committed to get information as his counsel the process is not as fixed and concrete as your questions seem to desire today other questions or comments from the counselor tomorrow I thank you very much for your patience and if we are hearing [Music] right now we are moving on to uh City Manager for history mayor Karen Council we are wrapping up the 12th and 13th and day stormwater project the last thing we did was uh called out the contractor it's been subcontractor for review encouragement on that is complete the contractor has requested the containment paper advantage and closing that project this week once I get the confirmation of Halloween so at least the global of our underground projects are we have another progress meeting on March 1st Duke who keep pushing Duke to tell us and uh that I do represent our kids state that they do not have a game but they'll keep tracking so our permitting is right on um to be ready as soon as the Church the health of my smoking replacement I actually did find uh cheaper solution from American underwater contractors not actually vehicle anchors they've done it in the past course in talking to the contractor they felt confident that they would be able to locate the majority of the existing tankers from the fair experience and you know there would be a minimum charge over the years [Music] and I remember in 2018 when you're doing the diver team was the more expensive route of doing the concrete blocks but now it seems to has changed so that's positive the stormline Improvement projects we had a meeting on with this assistant advisory committee on February from where presentation of the following issue and some term sheets plus a positive negatives are very standard as a city and our ability to take on data the CAC and he had a actual assistant president meeting as well they were all in support of making the recommendation for the share myself to present in the marsh [Music] the code of enforcement analysis of analysis project had to continue to move forward uh continue with the change from the reporting on it and getting other community services administrator remember I'm involved with doing some of this day-to-day you know like making him familiar with the code enforcement process and the codes in general full-time job that you will assist in producing more efficient food equipment so looking forward to keep going with that uh I haven't heard any change on the April 14th Pacific day for the playground set a little closer for confirmation the [Music] Motor Park parking lot it was completed on February 16th I'm not planning on dropping that off of off of this list as well as the we finally come closed down all the POS for the Sea World project the I'm scheduling meetings with departments this week to uh go over propose budget changes I'm having to work on the budget I will turn that into a financial administrator or our Financial Consultant at the end of the month if we had a have their schedule with our Financial Consultant for the April meeting to present a an overall report on wherever we stand at the closest we should recommendations for certification should look forward to when we started just make sure you plug your process uh and then last uh the you're probably aware that we've been getting some more red tide in the area the health department of the State of Florida provided us with a flyer notice on Friday the noon afternoon Friday and um we posted that a further recommendation at that point there were very many fish on the on the beach on Saturday was reported that that the fish scale of an increase in their lower fish on the beach we went out there starting this morning to dinner us up with our staff to start cleaning the fish picking up anything I think they did in the road decide what others we actually have Administration I thought they fish in their own bags they pick up those bags and I think all of them on their own trash bags luckily when I went out and checked on it and worked hard about what 30 this afternoon the time to Flushing up it is definitely did decrease the amount of fish that were still laying on each other you don't see a large amount floating in the water but that all could change by tomorrow just depending on end up with more fish or or continue to stay fortunate the staff did work from one apartment down south so if the fish numbers do not increase we expect a fairly significant you know 95 paid up by tomorrow but we'll continue we're committed to continue to keep working on to get sufficient it's the fastest that we can make us I have been in contact with the county um they have not started the outside contractors to if you fish at this point and they have not started their rollout homester program that they did in the pastors for the election just as the precautionary action we did order a role intensors lines specifically the four fish from Waste Management just to have ready Council I'll take the council's attention that there's a disabled child around 31st Street and ever got four parties Street excuse me can we put up a sign air through the city notifying traffic there is a disabled child they didn't make the sign that I have seen so that it can be installed by our city but we hide the City outfits our entire discussions would have to be grown up in a recession um there's no major attraction maybe we get into reverse that's in just the earthquake discussion to see if there's any uh other opinions but yeah with a motion here you're welcome with the sign a two-size modifier disabled child handicapped child between them 19th to meet 23rd Street second about my table all in favor foreign uh because I don't think they can get in places [Music] yeah there's no question okay we were allowed to do it without full put it on our driving schools unless I get deleted I can't reach out and find out their fans but yeah and then I'll move the credit name so let's at least do that [Music] any other questions [Music] and then were they uh for their citizen out here about specifically what's wrong with them they handrails and the price of what we can do to you know making the accommodations they get the money now basically consists that it's work it enters the sand and the bridge but it goes out so you can actually take wheelchairs out on this kill our so I can check those out and then report back to the council that you're working with to support you canceled here and say well I will uh actually maybe with something completely there but I just want to keep keep that in mind what we'll look into it and we'll see what we can come on with it may not right I guess so kind of the city hall generator I mean I missed that did you did you bring that up I I left it on there I've done there's been a little change since I received the last quote for the where do you think I mean I think that's a great idea what was the original budget the original budget it was over two years we were sitting 250 000 and then when I when we first started looking into this I presented you in the PS3 about like it was 260 to 70. and that's their particularly for me that's great do we happen to know the specs on this particular one in regards to how long it will move on a full [Music] I do have the specs so that I can present that okay that's good and also I know we had discussed previously the lining of the device on the 12th and 13th Street project what's the status on that uh status on that is I'd like to build it into the next program that we do um so that'll be the one that we're going to call it the prime process yes okay thank you any other questions or comments to ride on to seek first reporter very important I have a brief question Patty I don't have the handouts for tonight around the table all the city council members received Hampton outside the pharmacy here okay thank you I stole the mines no problem now appreciate that thanks any questions from Miss Gentry okay uh now we're at your item number 11 this is our public hearing uh this is a consideration of coordinates 23-01 Mr Moore would you please materials this is a second reading of the Ormond says as David urinary within the hearings we are is the final hearing for purposes of the first civil body it says warnings 23-01 in Williams Beach Florida many section 94-220 pertaining to the table of decimated living areas and housing suffix providing considerability and providing for an effective date second final reading award is 23-01 thank you Mr Nora let's go to uh any councilman there my name is Mark Pope and the resident of 523 Belle Isle Avenue thank you Mrs Abel for the detailed notes from the last council meeting we were unable to attend three by title opening of this ordinance my comments are going to cut across a couple of points both quickly first of all after detailed analysis of the table I could not understand the kind of arbitrary nature of the setback by a lot of difference is then secondly I did not see any commentary that we had done any benchmarking of similar setbacks of other beach towns as well as in alignment with the setbacks recommended at the county level so as a personal note our lot I measured today based on the table and my house already is over the limit um my house was built in 1974 there's been no material changes um and I would just like to present the council that we take a pause on this ordinance have a more detailed study understand how these setbacks are actually calculated and again benchmarking and or supportive the foreign [Music] [Music] happier than some of the output because we have 20 feet between our neighbors but our moms are like big and so there was an opportunity for recently ones that have foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] so the motion made by a boxmaker second Ary you have reported well I'm um but I'm curious to know why this this isn't that thank you very much for the question you may address that the setback announced in each of the areas identified in the table remain the same we are not actually alternating the setback proposals by this ordinance what we are trying to resolve is confusion caused by the way out of the table and you scrim those errors concerning the sound of Bellevue on the states where it's spelled with a Vue versus b-i-e-w on formatted ordinance that's worth that in the form of the strikers and underlines given how much content is in that table is actually called out of red text additional which we know which we don't typically do but what we've done here is fix the spelling and fix the formatting to make it more clear so that the wave was reading previously Bellevue estates had different setbacks for Lots certain law numbers which is still the case and then further down within the table it said Belleview Estates Island it had something else and then there was another row at the very bottom of the table and that was leading to inconsistent results in engineering analysis and staff analysis of application is those inconsistent results in variances or other administrative solutions to to bring property and compliance as to individual properties that are constructed before these provisions it was dating back to the 60s and 70s as it's completely different analysis we are not proposing new setbacks being imposed or the definition of any existing structures this was really to clean up the table to avoid further confusion if you thank you commission Moore any other comments or questions I sort of clarify this is just language change it's what is commonly described in many ordinances as housekeeping it is an attempt to to clarify on the existing concept of the code how to impose new restrictions so I thought about a lot of sad facts about an encroach on that as it relates to somebody's structure that has been in place since the 70s no it does not have an impact however comma if they are applying for some kind of new structure on their property those setbacks as established would certainly apply so this does affect residents with intending to approach new development and the intended impact most directly is that they have a clearer understanding and expectation of what they should develop there was one instance in particular where a property a property owner sought development approval staff looked at it and reached the conclusion as to one step back the engineer looked at it reached another approved something and that approved item was not consistent was consistent with one part of the table but not the other So to avoid that kind of confusion is that this was again I was raised the last time somebody said which one of you suggested this was a good catch within the code and where did it come from and I came from your scene mandatory applications and saying we can't ask nothing prioritize it and uh again I'm not nice to catch up on that agree for it but no uh that's questions asked Patty to uh all the world council member Baker yes councilman of Livingstone yes council member Roberts hi councilman who's able Iowa vice mayor Shirley hi I'm Fair guys all right so a passage unanimously um put us 23-01 thank you for your uh right now we are on to the real champ agenda items 12 and 13. this is for approval of the February 6 2023 city council for meeting minutes and Proclamation for claiming the month of March 2023 as problem gambling awareness month do I have a motion to approvement [Music] group made by Frank Baker who I have a second attention second by Lloyd Roberts all in favor I opposed all right the consent is in the passes all right now we are to the regular agenda item number 14. a consideration of resolution 2023-01 parking rates at City Parts City parking laws Mr Laura thank you Mr Mayor this is resolution 2023-01 residency Council of the city of Bellaire Beach Florida many parking paid station hourly rates Bayside Park the community center city hall City Marine and Morgan Drive Park and establishing an effective date this is the person only reading resolution 2023-01 by title only this resolution as it's been booked before you is product resulting from your work session kind of late last month just a couple weeks ago and this memorializes the terms of those the walk hours the parking fees of 55 per hour on weekdays in the respective lots and then ten dollars per hour on weekends and holidays and then the intended maximum limits and free parking times I will note um during your work session with us as I understand some discussion concerning corresponding parking fines you already have language in your code in section 58-37 and 8-38 concerned fines on civil penalties a resolution cannot supersede an ordinance so we cannot do it that way if we are to change those we would do so via ordinance so that's why what you have here is just the parking rates not any um penal element to it on as to what happens if you're if you're not in compliance and I've spoken to the manager were we to do that and what would be done by coordinates one of the things that we're considering in the form of Staffing before you is is an informal rate study inquiries of other communities as to where they are so we can make sure we're in line with that of any due consideration thank you commission before we begin our discussion on this uh let's go for the citizens or comments or anyone would like to speak with us yes really uh very very one of the 12th Street as far as parking this a lot is this the consideration is this going to be included yes um I have a problem with on the weekends it's hard here you go over to the 12th Street beach access there's umbrellas and by the time we get out there for not running out there at 9 o'clock there's no place for us to go it's been taking over about people who's our trespassing so um closed off to any type of outside you're including us in having nowhere a beach is a great new purpose I'll never do thank you Mr Greg any other clients from the citizens yes 115 Causeway I I would agree uh with Barry gray with his with his comments I think I think I have to have parking here though I believe from Beach for nourishment is that correct so perhaps we can at least on the weekends make it more expensive so that we deter people from two different things they come here and they'll Park they'll take their umbrellas and things and they put them up there and then they will go for across the bridge one person will and then come back or they just leave them there the whole day and as Barry said if we're not down there by 10 o'clock you aren't getting an umbrella one week thank you any other comments from the citizens oh all right now we or canceled before we get started on this conversation I'm going through so we made a person quite a bit like [Music] okay uh just yeah absolutely addressing your comments it used to be four dollars and five dollars we moved it for excuse me uh five hour picture of the weekday Nintendo dollars so basically more than downloading um to basically try to find the main threshold if you have a parking detail you're good these are for the outside people and also we want to clear something after right here for everybody we're not stopping on the street parking the low exactly I can just call you know City Hall arrange it but again we more than doubled it to ten dollars an hour so that's parking charges for boys I just want to clarify so Mr smaller when he was saying that we're even visiting there let's say we made it a hundred dollars an hour so people wouldn't park there you're saying they would typically Thrive here drop off recruit go back across the bridge so so you're saying that even if we made it uncomfortable they're typically going to find another way to do that five drop them off the crew with the umbrellas brothers and going back across the bridge getting somebody a bicycle or getting a taxi or one of those other bringing back over and they're still going to steal responsibility and unfortunately there's really to uh you know as we writes us around you might disagree with that statement I don't think that we shouldn't be incentivizing people to park in our lives and use our accesses and by keeping our our parking fees are considerably less than the beaches through our beach by doing that we are incentivizing people to be able to cure instead of there so if we make it whatever the pain pressure this it will at least deter them I realize we probably can't stop everybody but I think we can reduce the problem to some extent thank you very much can I just add I think that's what we're trying to do is kind of deter people from the community because we have the same issue at where we just parking spot s where we have facilities at hardwood grandchildren with Russian facilities you can and trying to raise these race High Enough to hurt people from I mean it's too long to we're putting some some time limits on it as we talk about that do we need to have the limits on on Bayside Park and City Hall I was going to make that suggestion because we originally did we did the we weren't really aware that it was a problem more than you know 10 bucks an hour all day long I really being here all day long hundred bucks every workplace it's a foot is the counselor was the council thing on putting limits on it just like we have because that is additional learning their tents and coolers that seems to be a big issue I would say yes sir Mr Gray you're going to get there I think the solution is a very short as in their performance that they have they can ask these people who are sitting out behind their houses whether they're in the uh below whatever if they're residents now if these people from opinions where they come from set up in our lives are we able to call the policeman have been prove that their president is here I don't believe that's the case because we can it's not that that the public access in our areas it's not you're talking about 12 12 and maybe even Sixth Street 12th Street I think once they get onto the beach there's what if they're sitting on the area that is now been designated designate our area but if they're now sitting in what has been dentists I'm going to interrupt you right now I don't think that we're prepared to answer those questions discover some more research and maybe we will have this discussion on the work session and see if we can get more information from our City attorney and it's just not a topic we're here to discuss it um right now we're trying to focus on parking rates and securing any new metering system for the parking so I very much appreciate your comments and so we're back to the to the Limit the time limit on the um [Music] I'm going to make a motion if someone wants to produce this motion motion made by Frank Baker do I have a second I'm sorry Mr mirror what is the nature the motion is to amend the resolution I'm sorry I should have been more passionate patients three hours has to be a state park Mississippi I understood that's where you're going I just want to clear the record here we have a second second thing Judy Shirley Mr Baker do you have before um [Music] to address other problems degree we make our presidents paid for the city we have these electric points is the one resident says take a parking branches and everything like that it's the matter to be discussed more for the next station I think it's reality it will help I agree uh and also this will definitely be a good trial to looking for for their pain threshold a citizen said and also as Mike said if it could be a problem and we're just completely uh have no problem paying thirty dollars and then moving on you may raise it even higher we'll just see where that goes any other comments on the changing the limits of the hour limits of parking and Lakeside and see so I know we discussed this every Workshop so if I Divine modern Park in my three years [Music] okay you wouldn't come back because there's no physical machine we just open your app but where we've with this resolution we will be blocking the ability of him to renew their three hours so three hours and then it will Chuck think of the time to move it up before it's your luck exactly exactly with the current system that wouldn't matter if they just come back and put more money in correct but can they make their car to a different parking spot and no just your driveway okay so um okay so my my motion's still on there yeah so uh all in favor of amending resolution 202301 all right give me a post all right so uh you're making those changes and now we're back to we don't need any motion to for the amendment we're still it was already an emotion on the floor to without the ordinance you've now moved and approved to amend so you revert back to actually works and with the understanding that we approved estimated okay perfect okay any other discussion on approving this resolution has committed we're going to need a picture of a cold world today yes outside of religion Stone yes council member Robert um [Music] vice mayor Shirley I'm here again it was all right so the resolution passes unanimously and uh libraries all right now we are on to item number 15. to authorized city manager to execute a piggyback agreement Department of LLC because he's placed on the agenda by City take it away sir and this uh we're gonna follow up our discussion we had in the work session there we go it's uh I've been contacted Apart Mobile they were able to provide that opinion of that agreement from St Petersburg I worked diligent thing with uh Attorney Morris College and uh we uh we we provided the contracted to to the attorney's liking uh they were agreeable amount that's what we did so we're Republican with review of the contract to make sure that the new release of places for the city's needs um as a whole background uh We've we've had a I couldn't find the exact date of how long we've actually owned a parking and I know it's over 13 years of doing our financial assistance in the group we're out there though and one fact that far without searching through some of my records so we've had that we own all the meters we have four leaders we own we own and we've purchased them in the order of 87 Park the marina Morgan and City Halls and luxurious and I know that we're named in 2018 um so the uh the manual parking meters uh you know throughout my experience with them they uh they require freedom of maintenance on staff time do you have a little well probably be better in some environments that aren't so close to the saltwater area but we uh we constantly are spending time replacing parts and troubleshooting them so this is presented in the work session which is a recount and we did an analysis of the revenue and expenditures showing at least that we break even if not for a bit more we're quite certain that the process of the marginal increase now that we've approved increasing the department rates um and then yeah I just wanted to include uh if this is approved I will pursue selling the existing assets back to the vendor um so thank you a little we bring it back to the council let's go to the citizens training and Park mobile are existing parking Community right back to the council we're going to need a motion we managers who executed second I didn't know yeah I'm not the only one so it's a second was a Frank Baker who's able unit okay going back uh Park Mobile we at all voted unanimously that's what Kyle is a city manager how many he didn't know is that he was spending quite a bit of time doing the maintenance on these machines including running out finding cars trying to get repaired and we all said we want to give them all the tools available to make them successful and one of those was removing excess work that's what we're doing with this mobile plan he just alluded to yeah we did the spreadsheet a small product but that was based on four dollars an hour coupled with the essays as stood with four dollars and they were talking the increases to five during the weekday and 10 during the weekends pretty solid profit office building so again thank you Kyle for hitting us up learning again all the members and your diligence any of the college from the council Elementary yes yeah I just want to clarify I think this decision with Park Mobile is a great decision but I don't want to confuse people by the fact that Mr saber has talked about increasing the prices clearly we could have done the same thing with the existing systems so Republic would have been there as well but the park movement of mobile decision was a good decision this wow because of that part of Mobile we've introduced devices yeah you can increase both but under this system you can stop like we just said the Max hours you can't do that with the New York System yeah it's a fair client for us yeah thank you well we actually did have an accident it's maximum you can feed the meter yeah and may not have to go back and you know and and uh just so after the workout that was bathroom convenience that was birthday cake yeah any other comments before we take this council member Baker yes councilman relating sound yes that's what I'm Robert um [Music] Shirley bye bears so again passes unanimously River there before we proceed to the agenda I may ask your Indulgence on procedural matter respectfully requesting that we reopen the area on resolution 2023-01 on the parking fees as I review it I noticed that while it states in the title that it provides an effective date I believe somewhere in the draft and the transmission of that link which fell off and I would just like to indulge the commission or Council rather to amend the resolution further to State the resolution shall take effect immediately upon adoption so that there's no misunderstanding as to that so yeah I'd like to make a motion to uh place the effective age on the amended resolution made by Mike Davis seconded by Frank anger um [Music] we should specify clarify and disable your your suggesting that resolution 2023-01 has adopted the further amended tab language statement stating that it would take effect to me if you have a lot of adoptions that correct yeah that's great there's a motion and a second on the floor Mr Mayor we've just taken before which services back to the council I think we're going to do this by role model council member Baker yes yes council member Livingstone yes customer Roberts hi that's another table five five Shirley hi there guys all right and so the amended amended resolution I think you can finish fix this Hangar Finance business should I just add something that I think was created a result of this matter is creating a report or modifying the fine um is that something that we can have prepared for the quickly I mean vote on that in a nice meeting or is that something wanted and I think um in as much as there were representations about increased funds and specifically in our speech but I know that we've asked me totally accurate he provided some insight on some figures I think ultimately created some of that fee structure as part of how the parking discussion involved and participated but that said we can move as quickly as this body wishes to move what one we just could not supersede a little bit entire resolution and then two I want to make sure two folks have whatever information whether that takes a form of Staffing on the first reading I know this community likes to to work session I was a good work session we did have a work session on it I've had some discussions with the manager since that work session But ultimately also refer to his Direction and the staff on time which the product they want to snap I already had a discussion with my staff about collecting with the global grades that are being charged and not quickly that together we feel like the group of academics and finish business okay I will now time for Council of Commerce went to the computer looking up a randomizer program and this month council members say one of the Stars I love the brain advisor hey I want to fill out councilman Roberts the indication was going well so uh thank you for your recommendation and return it out all right next up is Council man first I want to thank everybody who stayed this late and early made comments about the the traffic issues that we have up there I know there's one thing that we can all agree on I hope which the current scenario that's going on there's no there's nothing we all know that we live through it if I asked the city council on one of our workshops because this has kind of been my swing plane as a civil engineer a professional engineer I'd like to pursue taking a look at what's going on out there today meet with the county and talk through some different options [Music] one of the things if you recommended that we're going to do and if I was just working on it is the study that was done a few years ago that we elbow left hand turn lane it's up for kind of a Arena they typically wait a couple of years to go back review it again fire another outside consultant doesn't cost us any money at all and their objective is to see how well is that current system working based on the original study so they're going to do that we talk about many things there's many many options available out there I can assure you the following typically County transportation departments will do this I'll make sure they do this that before any decisions are made they will come up here and have like an open house sometimes multiple open houses because they'll have the first one to say after the study after having input from the citizens and trust me when I talk about some of the options it was because citizens called and talk to me about what's going on here so those type of an open house will take place where the citizens have an opportunity to probably know right in here they'll have big white boards up and things like that to show you graphically what some of the options are where you will have input to say hey I like that or anything terrible and here's why and then they'll talk to it they'll typically come back with another one with updated data and information unless the first one everybody said that's perfect um so that so that's where we are that's where we are today I feel I feel bad that some of our citizens like you guys got uh rolled up into this because of some emails that went out five a council member that I kind of gave opinions and summaries it would have been better for them not to have now a council member says hey we're talking about these things and if you want to refer to some of the videos out there or the tapes I recommend you look at the minute 11 or something like that it may be in that's fine but what we're saying things out there that may or may not be completely accurate or completely um finished with regards of what's going on that causes problems and it causes citizens to get excited about things that they don't have to because nothing's going to happen I assure you until we've studied this thing and have come out with better ideas I know for example I promise me about everybody loves the blinking yellow light as do I and most citizens we see can't have that with two left-hand terminals did not happen it's against traffic rules the only way we can get back the blinking yellow germline is to have a single return plane so that's just one fact or so there's multiple ways to take a look at this and and we will do that and that's what I'm doing now I studied every day every day was when I admire through there but I left up coming from Saint Pete and heading north it's interesting to me in the last couple of times I've had that that was the first car to stop at the traffic light so I get to watch missing typically leaves out five or five five thirty lots of vehicles coming to the South both of them turn into the left nobody follows the white dashed line everybody's cutting this way my biggest concern is it's not even the potential scratch problem with the vehicles I'm thinking more of if somebody is on the right hand side as you're making a left you in turn somebody on the inside bumps them and God forbid there's somebody walking on that sidewalk [Music] so I I know there's a better solution now they're very capacity and that's what I'm working towards but again if you have my Assurance we're not we're not going to make this blindly I don't know how the parent scenario was a slave you know I asked the county I said well how did you guys do this before you met with the city manager and the mayor they discussed it in the system itself we're going to do better than that it's not we're going to make sure the citizens are involved they see pictures they know what's going to happen and they have an opportunity to tell us whether or not to meet you inside thank you thank you Mr Roberts and how we move on to council member Livingstone Roberts for that explanation thank you thank you thank you for coming Superior comments that's very seriously I want to say the banker for moving forward this week request for the disabled child thank you very much for that [Music] thank you and now we are to council member Baker for the record I was not attacking the mayor actually I noticed the impacted president fraction and it is a tower it's not a disgusting my toilet board appointment comes both can be massive but this is a nine month problem that can kill someone why I'm passionate there's no attacking you you've got nothing but the gentleman to me she's like you she laughed with action I really wanted to thank you foreign [Music] you know I don't want to be the Cockroach on the Christmas party here but anything that we do to offset this traffic problem tourists it's only going to make it worse have Taurus coming to Clearwater and they see an easy way now out of Bellaire Beach we're going to get more tourist Museum this is a this is about a 60-day problem you face every year come Mary you want to be talking about this until next march or with the next one leave it alone I think just leave it alone that island is beautiful frostwalk is very necessary I tried Crossing at that Causeway a number of times a great next to me she knows it's a hazard Causeway crossover s thank you all right now we are in the house here surely thank you um so I attended the mayor's luncheon this past week in the latest the quarterly legislative update as they enter into That season and it was they went through a number of bills they're [Music] discussed right now and then several things to kind of watch for and one once again is the SB 714 is sorted by the sigma later on so just kind of some things that you know mainly these bills just some for the residents and other council members to take a look at there was one thing talked about which really affects um every community in the state that is HP HB 617 excuse me 671 and SB 682 and it's the league is recommending opposing but it's regarding building performance in our aquarium that building the permits be approved in a very short amount of time really in in ever the city can't get it done and then there's consequence things to look at there um all sorts of things to Land Development development and I guess just for Council Members this is important that the the league is now offering Monday mornings 9 A.M a call in call their live update was happening really probably a good thing for all of us to take a look at and then this is something I would like for maybe patties you could have available to Residents and you can scan it but it's the league of cities has put together affordably this is put together um Citizens Voice information so you can go on here take a look at that [Music] governmental decisions at a local level to get to get cities more autonomy to make your own decisions rather than State model and there is a big push to take City rights away from cities and and put America so they can get these elements with your kind and then you know influences and now that's um I think oh I guess I just put more um other places with comments is um bike racks I know who there was a question about whether we can have bike racks I know we talked about this before getting more Sandy park benches of the beach accesses I don't know if the bike price I mean I know it sounds like a great idea maybe if we put them out towards the dates or something and not down where the park benches are because this this just gives those same umbrella users at that beach access or access to if you give them a place to tie their bike out very amount of cards they'll bring whatever they need for the beach for that day and then now they have full access so I don't know if any of the problems or not but we might want to look at bike racks and at the next work session [Music] I thought that we were moving this bike fraction with parking lot away from the movie would that would not have to remember that we were and more benches and according to the gentleman's here tonight I hope we have we have we have them located I remember us discussing I had never got approval from Dollar Shores while every child uh as far as ironing the benches there is live Minecraft there I know we talked about possible locations residents aren't used to see if you arrived by sometimes um so then the bench had absolutely right [Music] so [Music] okay all right Perfect all right so last month I uh problems we've been having where it looks like we're not going to give each person at least not [Music] the Fed so I have been working with with mayor from North craigington Beach to feel clean and also mayor from Indian Shores by accident and what we've been doing is we've been meeting with all of the county information say if you're collecting bad tax and it's preserved for us for each person so you're saving all this money so I need you to start coming up with Plan B because right now what they're doing is is sitting on the lake and I'm hoping that they don't have to spend it instead of a federal government truth is I don't think it's going to happen but uh anyway I met with the Dave Eggers today trying to deal with ourselves rather than ourselves so he's on board I spoke with Kathleen Peters uh mental her about a week ago she's on board Janet long she's slightly related but she is um also the day that vice mayor Shirley was Jeff the mayor's Council she was shoots at that time I was being able to Senator I had a Cooper to find out if what the appropriate path would be to get more State funds this week if you want to do this so as it stands right now we the FED would do 60 percent the county disappointed with the state personally and what I asked Senator Hoover for was to continue matching whatever it is we have to spend well obviously we brought that 13. actually get this project started instead of every five to seven years we may not need nourishment for maybe every 10 years so we'll see how that goes um but anyway I have a couple more meetings coming up with various people and we'll see if we can uh see if we can get them to to get some projects started also speaking of the tourist development uh the tourist Development Council it was recommended because I attended that meeting that The Big C actually has a delegate head coach would be going to that meeting before going back to the big scene we're not doing anything and so I believe they're going to put me in place to go and sit in on these meetings and stuff about that Sandy is care because normally the County Commission they're going to move on whatever recommendations are made Development Council and um discouragement I don't think that I have anything else to discuss at this time other than I'd like to thank everyone for coming out tonight and if there's anyone still watching on uh computers at home thank you for attending I would have been said do I have a motion no share motion made by Frank Baker and goodbye all right all in favor aye any opposed all right good night I want to bring up the point here Lloyd you me Julie feelings"
