with the pinellas county sheriff's office um regarding the contract review last time we were at uh council session we had postponed the approval of the contract because we had a few questions and some issues and concerns expressed by council members i see sheriff galtiaries with us i hope you're feeling okay i read about your your situation i hope you're feeling better and um we'll uh i guess we'll just turn this over to the council this is a work session so it's a little less formal we'll just kind of go one person at a time and um and speak with the sheriff sure thanks i'm here and happy to answer any questions council sheriff i guess all started i know there were some citizens that had reached out to me um and some of these uh issues i don't think are new we've had issues with people saying you know the speeding on gulf boulevard motorcycles not uh i guess a policy of a no chase policy but motorcyclists coming through the city at high speed um of course we have situations with the uh with the easements that has um bubbled over into an ordinance now that prohibits shade because the city of belarushore uh is trying to keep uh improper users away from those easements and most recently um we've had an issue with uh some protesters not they themselves doing anything improper but motorists beeping horns for an hour to an hour and a half on end hundreds of illegal horned beeps in support of their their poster um and uh just violating state statute and city statute and i don't see any enforcement on that so that's kind of what i know of there may be other stuff it's not all coming from me but i you know again i'm just giving you what some of the information is that has been discussed over the course of the year maybe we're asking too much from one sheriff officer i don't know but i wanted to bring it up to you well you got a lot there so i'm not sure exactly where to start unpacking it but i'll go with what comes to mind um you know i can tell you that you know and the city manager knows i'm not sure who was on the commission a couple years ago um you know i want to be honest with you there's a little bit of frustration on my part with you all because i was there two years ago and what was said then by the commission was is they're concerned about traffic and the lack of traffic enforcement on gulf war i offered solutions and i said that we would um and we'd give you off-duty details you all said you didn't want off-duty details for enhanced enforcement we gave you the decoy cars we've made a lot of effort to deal with it it just seems like that when i hear this that when and then what i heard back from the city manager and back from the commission was well some commissioners thought there were traffic problems but there's really not and so we want you more in the neighborhood so then we go into the neighborhoods and well now we're in the neighborhoods too much and now we're not enough on gulf boulevard i can tell you that we've been tracking it and um you know this year alone the deputies have done over 400 traffic stops on golf boulevard in the city we are enforcing the traffic laws as far as the neighborhoods are you concerned you have one deputy for the for the town i think it's more than enough uh is the the deputy going to be on every street at every moment no but the deputies are either on golf boulevard because that's the main drag on uh the causeway or they're in the neighborhoods and occasionally uh they're responding to calls so when you look at the number of calls in the call volume uh for the city which i looked at the uh statistics for that and uh i can tell you that you don't have a high volume of calls so um from january 1st of this year until august 16th uh there were 387 calls uh in bel air beach and we responded to 53 uh in bel air shore and those are everything from minor crimes to assistance to you know the gamut of everything so you know i said it before um i'm more than happy to give you options to increase traffic enforcement but there seems to be a mixed bag with the city and i get conflicting information because when i offered this two years ago you all didn't want it so you know i mean you have one deputy if you want you know the cost effective option that i offered you was to use an off-duty detail you can pay for two hours a week three hours a week saturdays and sundays were the big deal because people coming out of clearwater beach i actually did it for a weekend out there where we gave you a deputy for free on an off-duty detail to cover the the peak hours so you know i i you know tell me what you want we'll do it um you know and as far as the uh the issue that you all got with better shore that's between you and bel air shore now i'm gonna get involved in you know whether you have umbrellas on the beach or you don't that's not my issue uh right now we're not enforcing it bel air shore has told us not to enforce that it's their ordinance it's their beach we're not uh you all have threatened litigation that's for you all to work out as far as the horn beeping thing goes what i understand is that it's a situation and i've never heard uh that is for an extended period of time is is that it is somebody who is seeing a deputy and honking their horn in support of law enforcement that's what i've been told so if that's what you're talking about uh and it's going on for hours and never heard that um going out for hours probably a different situation but again i've never heard that um as far as uh you know other issues um i've heard about this the situation in the the parking lots the parking lots belong to belmar shore they don't belong to belarus beach uh we're enforcing uh in the parking lots um for everything that i've seen i think i've been told is that there's not a problem with access to the parking lots um we are enforcing it at the level at the direction of bel air shore which is theirs we do enforce and we have written parking tickets and i've got staffs on parking tickets uh we've written um here we've written 137 parking tickets and but again is that unless nobody can tell me otherwise is that it's not a situation where bel air beach residents with permits can't get access those those lots according to everything i see and what i'm told are never full if they are and people don't have access then we can look at that so this is the way i understand the situation um but again i'm more than happy to work with you as i was when we had this it seemed like the same discussion two years ago and you know tell me what you want but what i don't have happen is i don't want to offer solutions we implement those solutions and then you come back and say well we don't want your solutions and there's a disagreement uh about the about the solution so that's where i am on it if i missed anything in in the all the items that you laid out let me know and i'll address them sure if i do want to address something and i'm i'm actually surprised hearing from you which is complete disconnect with what i've had discussions with our city manager and our city attorney um regarding this horn honking if they're not honking at a deputy okay there's a group of protesters that have been out there since on the corner of sixth and gulf boulevard they have been out since july 22nd they're out every single day they have started at 8 30 in the morning and i have a track of it eight and i started tracking it on 8 4 8 37 a.m to 10 on 10 on 8 5 8 40 to 10 a.m eight six eight thirty five to ten eight ten oh six eight and i'll just go right down the list today they are out from eight fifty eight to ten o five they're waving a sign and it it says no matter what the sign says it happens to be supportive of the police and i support the police and i think everybody here supports them um i've said publicly what a great job the sheriff does in terms of controlling major crime and with your professionalism i think your professionalism of your unit is second to none okay you're excellent that has nothing to do with what the message is i don't care what the message would be what they're doing is they're violating the state ordinance by beeping and it's inc it's incessant i taped it and i sent a copy to fred reilly uh in a three-minute tape there were 39 honks of a horn every one of those violates the state statute 316 two seven three sixteen point two seventy one three and four and our city ordinance 22-61 it's the first thing in our noise ordinance i have seen the deputies out there i've seen the deputies honk i have seen the deputies drive by i'm seeing it because i live 100 yards from the not even 100 feet from where this is going on so they're well aware of what's happening and if it's not being communicated to you i'm sorry but now it is um and this is every single well there's only one deputy so how often can they be honking if unless he's parked in front of them i mean they're honking at the protesters the protesters are holding up a sign that says support blue they're wearing blue they're wearing they're having flags and they're not violating any law they have the right to protest on the sidewalk so but then support people honk their horn oh so people are okay so people are driving by and people are right unfortunately it's a residential neighborhood you know and it doesn't end it's not a one-day protest it's now a one-month protest with no signs of abating well i don't know that it's a it's a protest i mean it's they're they're obviously doing what you can awfully do you call it it's not a protest at this support um uh you know i'll take a look at it more and and see what it is and see if there's anybody talk to them and ask you know try and be a little bit more measured and you know it's it's during the day hours um but you know you know there's a lot of quote protesting going on in pinellas county that's not protesting i mean believe me what we've got um you know nobody's blocking intersections and taking over intersections and laying down in the middle of roads and all that kind of stuff so no but you would concede it's violating two laws our our city ordinance and our state ordinance right i don't know but again you know we still have to use i'll look into it okay is i will look into it and see you know um and you know what's going on with it i'll look into it i don't okay you know not every time anybody honks a horn one you know we're not going to run around issuing tickets to people going down the road if you got people out there that are um just going about their business and driving down the road and you got somebody who's out there with a sign and so what are we going to do tomorrow when everybody's out there honking horns because all the political side waving we're going to issue tickets to all of them too of course not so you know we have to be you know judicious in this we have to use good judgment uh i believe let's try and figure out what the issue exact issue is see if there's a way that we can get to some sort of uh you know happy medium with it but it's it's in the mornings um and so it's it besides besides you is is there anybody else that you've received information from yeah it's a residential neighborhood some people are away right now but you know and with the with the windows being closed in obviously it's a little softer than what it's going to be come the you know come before and by the way the city manager has been out he spoke to him and also the um deputy doherty our code enforcement officer and he was in full uniform when he did it right and they won't so no they don't care i look into it i was not aware that it was for like hours uh i can i can see where you know that would be you know if you're hearing you know cars talking from you know but but the is the problem that people are honking or the problem the people that are exercising their uh free speech rights and and putting their signs out the people are honking because they have no rightful reason to honk a horn and that's against state law and i have case law on that and i know you're an attorney i'll be happy to send it to you that actually went to the appellate division in pinellas so um you know it's that's not the issue no first amendment right to hong kong's at eight o'clock in the morning in support of anything what are we going to do tomorrow tomorrow when there's a campaign is one day this is every day for a month now it's not looking into it it was one off it wouldn't be a problem i wouldn't even bring it up it's law breaking hundreds of law breaking per day and when you have hundreds of law breaking per day then everything else slides with it so when one person gets away with that then you tell me how you're going to enforce the next guy who's playing his radio too loud because that's part of our noise ordinance too how do you do that you can't you can't do that under state law for traffic that's been held unconstitutional so right i would like to speak when it becomes my turn this is council members i thought robin's hand up first so i'm gonna go robin hockey first and then council member swope robin right first thank you thank you so much for coming and speaking with us um on something separate from what the mayor was talking about my only question is um the portion the six point five one one one percent that uh bellaire shore pays in this contract how is that calculated and my only thing is is because of this new umbrella ordinance and i know you guys aren't enforcing it but maybe at some point you will so there'll be more time that you guys will be devoting to that and i believe one of our last means i don't know if it was lynn who said he did the math roughly and it equates to about 45 minutes of a day you know that they should get your time so doesn't that mean the opening and closing and i just my whole thing is i think you guys are doing a great job i just want to make sure that belair shore pays their fair share for what they're getting i just want to make sure that that so so you know the cost of the deputy uh for the upcoming year is 99 500 it's based on a percentage and it's and i can tell you just by looking at the the volume and looking at the amount of calls um you know again um 88 percent of the calls that we handled were bellaire beach 12 percent were bel air shore uh there's no traffic other than the parking lots there's no i mean all the stuff that we would ordinarily do i'll call it ordinary policing we're not stopping people and doing uh field interviews we're not doing all because all this is residential and we have very few calls i mean so you're talking about in an eight month period we have 53 calls and when i talk about calls i'm talking about everything from uh maybe somebody had something stolen to an assist citizen to a variety of things i really think from everything i can tell from what all the numbers and i've spent time on this i wanted to prepare for this meeting just so we can have a good discussion about it um and i i think it's proportional i don't see that they're spending an inordinate amount of time um you know and your residents are also out on the beach we do go out on that beach sometimes and we do patrol out there uh but that's what everybody wants as well um same thing in the parking lot you know the parking lots do belong to bellaire shore but again we want to be in those parking lots because it's the bel air beach people with their permits and and some who are not i understand uh that are in there so we want to make sure that the cars are safe and those kinds of things uh so really when we're trolling those parking lots i'd suggest to you we're actually giving a benefit to the belair beach residents as much as anything else because we're making sure that your cars are safe uh when they're parked there so i don't see anything that's disproportionate but if you wanted to you know have a discussion about it and you know maybe kind of have some sort of a deeper dive analysis of it and have a discussion with belair shore uh to make sure uh that is proportional um you know the issue with that i i think that data is a good thing studies are a good thing and to be able to to make sure so if that was the will of the commission i i don't have any issue in probing this a little further just to make sure that again it is proportional and but it's it's such a small amount there it really is because what i would have you know i think was 64 residences in bel air shore and it's all residential so but uh you know i'm willing to do that if that's the will of the council member swope and then council member gunn hi this is councilmember swell first i want to just thank you so much i think your officers are amazing and you guys do an awesome job there are a couple things that i wanted to go uh go over i was reading the contract and there are several things that i'm concerned that you guys even have to deal with to begin with because you should be dealing with more major things uh one of them is i'm gonna name several uh enforcement of local ordinances such as contractors working before or after hours on holidays i think that should be assigned to our code person and not the sheriff's department enforcement of local ordinances such as contractors oh that one's on there twice sorry um the next one is verification of garage sale permits delivery of agenda packets mail and other items to the mayor and council and members of the boards i personally think if we remove some of these things at least your guys could focus more on the speeders that everybody has concerned about and the other issues i also did speak with the couple that are standing out at sixth in golf with their signs and i went over there and introduced myself and spoke to him and i granted can't dispute what the mayor said because he you know was videoing at a different time but when i was there there was probably 30 cars went by i was there for 15 minutes and there was like five people that hauled so i mean i don't know i don't live that close to it if that's an annoyance but i sure would not want to see the sheriff's department focus on pulling over people that are honking when i know you guys have so much more to do and we are stressing your uh sheriff's department as far as giving you direction because granted we don't have any control over belair shore and we really shouldn't even make that part of our discussion with you in my opinion but i just wanted to let you know you're doing a great job and those other items i don't quite understand why you're responsible for them to begin with because i feel like resources could be valued more in other areas and thank you again well you're welcome and i can tell you the history on that because i remember being involved in drafting that contract and back in 2006. uh a lot's changed since 2006 including the makeup of the commission um i can and the lawyer representing the city i can tell you that a lot of those things and i was personally involved in the drafting of that agreement a lot of those things were in there at the absolute insistence of the lawyer who represented the city at the time i think another thing that's in there is is that the deputies are supposed to make bank deposits i mean there's a lot of stuff in there and i can tell you in all the law enforcement contracts that we have the only one that has a lot of those i'll call them ancillary tasks in them uh are is the valar beach contract so i would agree with you wholeheartedly it's right for discussion and to uh clean it up and to remove some of those things from there so i would wholeheartedly support that but again you know we're here at your will and i you know and we agreed to it back then we got it in there if this is what you all want we'll do it and if you don't want the deputies making bank deposits you don't want them running commission packets and you don't want them doing you know then we'll take all that stuff out because i would agree with you their time is probably better well spent i don't know anymore that they're doing any of those things anyway uh but at one point uh they were um as far as you know the the the honking thing goes i don't know we'll see if we can come up with some sort of solution for it you know you know i don't know maybe a sign or something out there reminding people um you know but again i i it's a tough issue i get it but we also have to balance it but uh you know traffic enforcement is a problem uh every voice and we'll see if we can figure something out on that vice mayor gunn you were next yeah great job there support comes in a lot of different forms you know i think the vast majority of people that you're looking at right now support the uh the thin blue line and uh it's not quite the crisis that we think it is i know it for some people it's like figure nails on the chalkboard but i i think it's a kind of a tough one and yeah if you can't look into it maybe there's some balance that we can strike up or some innovative way i think the contract is very clear paragraph 11 talks about the discretion of the uh the officer to figure out how he's going to enforce this sort of thing and it's it's a tough call and obviously you get a a guy in uniform standing by the side of the road and people are going to haul get support of a guy right it's a tough one and if you can come up with an innovative way to look at it we sure appreciate it so far as the traffic enforcement goes i think two years ago when you heard from the council i think it was a pretty uh vast majority felt that traffic enforcement was a an issue for us and i don't know if there's a disconnect there but by the time it trickled down to the officer and how it was being enforced i'm not sure the the same emphasis was being placed on it there so maybe there's there's a disconnect from our council and the city manager and how we want to do that so we need to look at the entire uh line of communication there with respect to the budgeting aspect of this i'm with you i think we need to drill down and look at the data a little bit more because i think if you look at just the call situation alone in isolation you know it is going to be a small majority but i think there are some other things you need to take into context here gulf boulevard is a long strip of county road there and half of it is uh fronted by bel air shore so and and also if you're talking beach patrols and beaches and emphasis on the beach well bel air shores made it abundantly clear to bel air beach who owns the beach there so if there's beach patrols involved there then we need to think about all of those things in in this context you've got gulf boulevard that is fronted by bel air shore equally as much as bel air beach you've got beach and if you start looking at uh beach access again bella shores made it abundantly clear that they own that stuff well i mean if you take into consideration just the closing and opening and locking of that thing well that takes up quite a good chunk of that 45 48 minutes a day so i would be uh i would be in support of drilling down and looking at the data a little bit closer there also uh one aspect of the contract that i looked at was uh provision of the periodic beach patrol i spoke earlier to the city manager lynn reeves there and some of these paragraphs in their contract probably need to be uh tightened up a little bit uh provision for periodic beach patrol not quite sure what that is and i i am aware that the city manager is looking at uh the uh perhaps changing and striking some of the uh things that might be able to be handled more appropriately by our staff bank deposits and that sort of thing so the city manager is on top of some of that stuff so i look forward to hearing what dad we can come up with and maybe sitting down and reviewing some of this stuff at a later date thank you for your time sure no problem i mean like i said you and you were here two years ago when we had you know and and remember when i you know i offered you the off duty which i said provide we have a lot of cities that do that a lot of contract cities because it's an hourly rate and if you want two hours a week you can get two hours a week if you want ten hours a week you can get ten if you want to do ten for three weeks then don't do it at all and you're not committed to anything and it's a very very you know reasonable i think it's about a 55 an hour rate um and so and we did the deploy cars and we did it and then i'm telling you what i got back was no no no no no we don't want to do any of that so you know i'm willing uh and you know we'll make sure that the deputies are out there on golf boulevard um and you know that they are and i guess i can see the numbers there's a lot of traffic stops being done um but if during some hours you all want to consider that and do an off-duty detail again to try it and see if that gives you you know what you're looking for just tell me what you want and i'll work with you you know one good aspect of this i know is the city manager is uh is looking again at our code enforcement i mean we're using one of those off-duty officers to assist us with that and maybe if we bring some of that back into house then maybe it's time to reprogram some of that uh off-duty officer time to for patrol so i'm just tossing that out council member i'll work with you you know i'll get it you got to just just tell me what you want and we'll again we'll work with you mark beam sheriff marv looking back before uh the sheriff took over we had two officers on duty all the time out here and um they worked 12 hour shifts the last the last year or so but it was if anybody was going to let's see one of our officers with was almost near sand key at the north end of the city and the other one was on the south end well once they pass that one officer the other one would catch him on the other end that happened a lot and what i'm finding is even on the bridge i get passed on the right this has happened twice in the last six months now again you know there's no sheriff around this this is what happens a lot of these incidents happen when nobody's around and the other thing you find is on gulf boulevard you know between say 12th to 19th people are in a hurry and they'll pass you doing 40 50 60 miles an hour trying to get down the clearwater beach or wherever they're going so again they're isolated incidences i don't know how to can do it but maybe again this is what we have to do as a city is uh consider off-duty police officer to help us out during certain times yeah you know but if you heard you're right too i mean in all different respects twice in six months i mean on the passing i i don't you know that that okay i hear you about twice in six months is not you know it's happening you know five times a day so you know as far as before when you had two officers of course under state law you are required if you're a municipality of any type they have at least two officers on duty at any time so you were required by law to have too so um because you contract with the sheriff's office and we have uh you know in the south part of the county alone probably at least 100 is that what you're getting is you pay for one but i'm telling you as well and i hear it and see it is is that there's other deputies that work in other areas that are passing through the city that go into the city so when you get a call that comes out in bel air beach and it requires a two-deputy response you get somebody else that goes to back them up you're not paying for that um so you do get the whole you know full if you will force an effect of the sheriff's office you're getting a lot that you're not paying for and and so that's a good thing uh it's part of the economies of scale it's one of the reasons why this this works but if you you know feel like that you're not getting that presence i really think that the answer to this and try it i mean what do we got to lose and this is why i offered two years ago we did it for this one weekend and then it was no we don't want to do it so okay so you know if you if you want to see where you've got you know say you want two deputies out there from three to seven on monday wednesdays and fridays for two weeks and try it out and you'll see a lot of presents out there um but i also you know say to you this as well okay is that i say this every single time with every discussion i have about traffic we all okay you need to be careful we ask for because because people then say oh my god you're giving out too many tickets well you know if if people are violating the law and is they going to take it they're going to take it so yeah you know i mean maybe you try that for a while and try it for i mean a couple weeks and see if that works for you so that you do have that like you said i wanted to go wholehearted in the other and you do have a big presence i i'm more than willing to work with you i i there are some solutions there are some options you just need to tell me you know if you want to do it or not i know um the rumor was years ago that nobody was speeding in feller beach because they got nailed all the time and we had black police cars or blue police cars and uh two of them were undercover cars one was a repossessed car the ford taurus they had for a number of years and it worked well and the other one was an unmarked squad car so between those two there was a tremendous amount of stops that were made so people knew when they came into belair beach there was no speeding no horsing around and again as far as beach patrols we were up and down that beach sometimes twice a shift and during that time period they would tell the people that were out there horsing around or drinking or whatever the case may be they've worn them and with all that presence out on the beach you know between bellair shore and velar beach and the gulf boulevard there was minimal issues but you know again they know there's not a lot of police out here and they don't see him that often and it's unfortunate but that's just the way things are well there's you know again the other deputies are passing through the county cars do come into the city uh they do relieve um and you know they are out there i mean do you all want it again you know if you want to do it try it and see see what the feedback you get is i mean you know um you know you're talking about you know you could you could do a pretty good sample probably cost you a thousand dollars and i'll offer it again as i did last time if you want to try it i mean i'll even offer it for a week at no cost and we'll put a deputy out there during some peak times you know and do some traffic enforcement so you can see what it looks like remember we did this before but i did it at no cost i'll offer it to you again if you if you all want to try it for a week or even two weeks or something i'll put it in place and then then you can decide if it's um something that you you think is um appropriate for the city vice mayor gun i have you next but before i go to you i just want to make sure dave gaddis hasn't spoken i just want to make sure he has nothing to say because we go through the first round and then we'll come around for the second round sure uh first off i'd like to thank you for um uh for always being here uh and and listening to what we have to say i know it can be frustrating at times and uh and it is for us also um as far as uh dealing with bel air beach i think uh many times we get sidetracked with with little fringe aggravations and uh and and don't necessarily focus on the big picture uh which uh to me that's uh uh the bridge gulf boulevard and then feeder streets those those are the main really the main uh places where things happen where you're gonna see issues of course we've got the beach also but even that's not uh in my opinion uh not near the problem um i would be uh more than happy to entertain the uh the trial uh just to see what happens and uh and i uh certainly appreciate you off making that offer to us i i can't speak alone but i think it's something that we will discuss after this meeting and um uh and and try to maybe focus our attentions on what's most important for the city and not just these little aggravations other than that i hope you're feeling well and i appreciate you attending this meeting thank you vice mayor can i say something this is jody i've had like i'm sorry jody i'm sorry i don't see you and out of sight out of my my apologies jody shirley and then glenn gunn do you not you must not see where the hand raises where we're supposed no i i don't see any of that i think only the host sees that that would be patty i'm not i'm just a participant myself they don't even have my picture here okay well again thank you um for uh participating in our meeting and everything that the sheriff's department does for our city we've um i've been you know pretty pleased with uh the service we get um i am gonna just echo a few things which i brought it up in our last meeting that uh some of this directed control carrying our deposits to the bank you know things like that is just um i don't see that as something that should be included in this contract and i think we're all in agreeance that that you know that should get those sorts of things um you know garage sale permits things like that there's no need for the sheriff to be involved with that and we'll clean up the contract for those items i would ask that the sheriff's department look at reviewing the budget and how bellair shores and ballard beach's contracts fit together and are we being built appropriately i would ask that we take a look at that um as far as um you know the traffic goes it was a it is a hot button and it still is when we have holiday traffic and i think that that's um you know a lot of what you heard in the past was the the holiday traffic coming from clearwater beach is a problem we get bottlenecked there's all kinds of issues and we have done some things with the county with um controlling that traffic light a little better putting some arrows keeping traffic moving things like that so that's helped which may be why you haven't heard a lot of it but i do think we still need to talk about um bringing in additional uh an additional officer on the holiday weekends when we're you know again approaching labor day weekend i think it could be you know an ugly weekend and we'll have uh traffic issues and that might be a time for us to start thinking about it again and and i don't know why it we didn't continue with that because i think we were all pleased with um having an extra deputy on um on the street uh i think my only concern i have with uh services from the sheriff's department is really um the laugh you know not seeing the presence and when i start looking at some of the medial things we have you all doing that if we free up some time i think that we'll see more presents on the streets and that sort of thing i used to see them every morning when i left my house on golf boulevard i don't see them i don't see the sheriff i don't see them driving i don't see the deputies driving down our streets like we used to as much and i think there's just uh there's too many things that are bunny trails that they're chasing down and trying to please everyone you know i think uh we have a lot of house checks they're great i appreciate the service but you know when they do a house check they spend a lot of time and i think we as a city need to revisit how we you know how we do those house checks and things um so anyway that i just thank you for your time and for being here well you raise a good point you know and none of us right you have mastered being in two places at once so you know is that that's your point and it's valid is is that if you know we're doing uh the parking lots and we're doing the house checks and they do take time and we're doing them you know repeatedly and we're doing these other things then you're not going to have as much time in the neighborhoods which means then you've got to trade you're not going to be on golfball i can tell you though because we have uh the captain for this dental district take a look at this every one of the cruisers is equipped with gps and there's a mobile map and we can sit there and we can look at and we watch um where the deputies are and what they're doing and i can tell you that they are moving around they are doing their jobs um and they're not just sitting in one place and sitting there idling and loafing it's not that's not because when i heard about this i want to make sure you know that they're doing what they should be doing and they're they are i just think that they're moving around in different places and they are doing a lot of different things so um you know like you said you know you know in some cases maybe for what some people are looking for maybe it is a little bit thin and if we tweak some of that and then perhaps try the enhancements you mentioned something about you know the holidays and uh the traffic backing up and dealing with that i can tell you that there's no question that that happens and there's also no question that it can be dealt with during the especially the beach reopenings and i was out there during the you know the height of the safer home order in the lockdown and i was out there every day for months myself and we reopened clearwater beach um we put deputy an extra deputy in deputies uh in bel air beach and we manually controlled the intersection at gulf boulevard in the causeway uh because i told them i don't want traffic backing up i want to get people out of clearwater beach out of bel air beach and i want them out of there so that works when we manually control that intersection so those are things that with some of this you know we can have some communication about uh and you know we deal with those things especially like on sunday afternoons during the peak time during the summer that's when it backs up saturdays and sundays after afternoons as people are leaving the beach like you said labor day is coming up and these others so you know maybe you know part of this is let's just hand see communication and see what we can do and i i think there's some you know workable solutions to get everybody where uh they want to be anyone else on council have any com glenn gunn yeah i was just sitting here and it kind of struck me obviously we've got some competing demands uh the one of the biggest cost drivers in our budget is law and for this law enforcement contract and yet we want more presence and more coverage my question is and it just dawned on me is there some regulatory or policy requirement that the officer patrolling you always have to have a active on-duty officer well i mean you have to have you know you have to have a law enforcement officer in the city um so i'm not sure i'm following the question so yeah here's my point my point is your off-duty officers come at a rate of behalf of a duty officer so i mean if we went to some creative scheduling where we use off-duty officers more than an on-duty officer that would free up an on-duty officer for you and drive down yeah yeah you can't do that because yeah there are problems with that there's issues and there's union contracts and all kinds of different things and that's my question so i guess i'm throwing it to you because you're the expert in that is there some creative solution i mean obviously we're not dealing with the hood here and you don't have to have swat trained people patrolling baylor beach so could you spend 12 hours or one shift with an off-duty guy versus an on-duty guy no it has to be on duty i mean you have to have you have to have that law enforcement you know for the for the main for the calls and for that the only thing that we can use off-duty and it's really you know off-duty we call it secondary employment or off duty is the only thing that we can really lawfully use that for is for traffic enforcement um you know we can't use them to take calls we can't use them to do the other things that are the responsibilities of a law enforcement officer but we can use them for traffic enforcement so that okay that so that was my question yeah we can use it for traffic question asked question answered i got it yeah and i think that's that's the answer because you know if especially depends how much you want to use it and and i don't suggest that you certainly you don't need it in the middle of the night and you don't need it seven days a week and if you come up with some type of a rotation because if you're satisfied with the one person who's there for let's say from two to seven working traffic well when that person's two to seven working traffic the deputy who's assigned there under the contract could be spending more time back in the neighborhoods than doing other things right so you know they don't both need to be sitting on golf boulevard and they could depending upon you know what the need is um but i i think that you know dealing having somebody to deal a little bit more with some of the traffic issues would also free the deputy up to um have a presence more excuse the neighborhoods or some of the other things you're looking for at this point if there's no other council comments i'm going to ask well first let me ask council this is a work session we don't um we normally have opened up the floor to any questions from citizens i know there were some citizens that said they wanted the opportunity to speak with the sheriff i don't know if anyone is actually there or not patty is the host on this um but i would like to ask the council first if it's okay to open it up to the floor um if there's any citizens that have any questions and if that answer is yes then i'd like patty to see if there's anyone here so first we have any objection i have a thumbs up from rob at any objections it's thumbs up okay so it's open patty is there anyone out there who um who wishes to speak with sheriff galtiary we have attendees but oh okay america can hear me i can hear you yes okay we have attendees but we don't have any raised hands okay everybody said they wanted to speak to the sheriff we got him here and um under very difficult conditions for the sheriff and i i appreciate you coming out sheriff gold thierry um thank you so mayor i want to just up because i want to make sure we're leaving this and i have an understanding as to where we are is that i will have our fiscal director who manages the contracts as well work with the city manager and work with bel air shore we'll do an analysis um i would suggest since it's up to you we're in august now of course the contract expires on september 30th you know i would suggest that um you know so we can look at a lot of data we can look at this and explore it that you all consider signing the contract for this year and then we come back uh and spend some time making sure we've got this right as opposed to trying to rush that analysis that would be my recommendation but we will work to do that analysis the and then i'm going to wait to hear back from you all um on whether you want to take me up on the offer for let's say a two-week trial period for the off-duty um deputy to do that traffic detail and traffic enforcement and we would come up with a schedule so i haven't heard yes please do it um so i'm going to wait to hear back from you all if you want me to do it sheriff just let me just cut in one second the um we cannot give you we as a council this is a work session so we can't pass anything so we'll have to give you that come september 9th that's fine and i'm just recapping because i just want to make sure we're on the same page i think it's just important you know we make sure we are and i'm going to see what we can do um see if we can come up with some sort of a solution uh on the uh noise honking so that's i just wanted as far as takeaways um that i'm taking away what we all have the same expectations so if there's anything different let me know otherwise we'll use that as a plan and i'll wait to hear back from y'all great thank you okay anyone else thank you sheriff and okay well i hope you feel better thank you appreciate it thank you thank you so we'll go to item two next is review and discuss the city attorney contract i believe this is probably city manager because i don't see a name after it so is this yours lynn there's no name of a council member i cannot hear him can anyone hear him just raise your hand if you can hear him can you hear me now now we can yes okay uh this was raised at the budget session uh last month and uh you asked for this to be reviewed several of you just made comments and so it was added to this agenda okay it's open for discussion then i believe we just wanted to review this um as with all the contracts because that was one of the things we had talked about when we were all elected that we would review contracts annually um i'm just gonna i'm not certain i haven't really i have to tell you i was out of town received all this information and really just got it this afternoon to sit down for this meeting so um but uh um i think it's important for us all to take a look at every contract we have signed annually uh make sure that we don't find things such as directed patrols for taking our deposit slips you know things like that that we we can kind of cut out of services or sharpen our pencil a little bit on services um i think my only concern with this contract is not this contract but with legal services is that we're using our attorney far too much there's too many um in my opinion phone conversations with the city attorney or request for research on information and things that in my opinion maybe don't need to go the attorney right away maybe we could sort through some of these things on our own without spending a fortune on legal fees i think that everyone needs to be mindful that when we pick up the phone and talk to the attorney or send him an email that the clock's ticking i think we need to tighten down on maybe just having that go through lynn reeves would be my suggestion um but i'm just opening up the floor so with some ideas and thoughts i'm i think it's important to discuss it our bills are high for uh how little business we're getting done i see dave gaddis's hands and then glenn gunn then okay let me just we have dave gaddis glenn gunn and marv beam okay so that's the three next and dave you're muted now you're open okay okay uh first i would like to uh uh commend um uh mr riley for uh reaching out at least to me i'm assuming he's reached out to each and every one of you um whenever he first found out that we had concerns about his services uh we had a lengthy conversation i was not billed or the city was not built for that conversation as i'm assuming that uh the rest of you were treated the same way we discussed my concerns and uh uh obviously that the uh the bill uh the the cost of his services uh were one of my primary concerns but also um the way that his opinion is given to us in such a way that many times it's only an explanation that another attorney would understand uh so um he said that he would work on that and uh and try to be uh speak to us in more of layman's terms so we would we would better understand exactly what it was he was talking about and also to be a little more opinionated other than just giving us his research uh another uh issue that i have right now is uh is i personally have uh i have issues with with the way that this contract is written uh and that is specifically that uh the mayor has a privilege that the rest of us doesn't and so basically if we were all given the same privilege that the mayor has to just pick up the phone and start the clock running on our billing with every issue that came to mind that this this city would probably go broke so my question to everyone on the council is should the mayor be able to uh to spend money with the attorney at will or is this something that should only be filtered through the city manager glenn gunn on mark beam i'll i'll back up some of that i think the issues uh we've seen and the city manager kind of went through and reviewed the contracts and this was the only contract that came up and said you know maybe we ought to take a look at this and i don't think it's we're at any any possible stage where we want to put it back on the street for rfp or whatever but obviously there have been some rough spots with deadlines with rework and cost containment so with that in mind i'll also underscore what dave gatters just went through and i've been thinking about it a lot and i took a very good look at that paragraph three which was changed at some point and we all jumped on the bandwagon and signed for it at the time but now sitting back and looking at it through uh better lenses it doesn't make a lot of sense and i think there's a lot of disconnects i've gone back i looked at the chart and the ordinances and and what i see is when i look at section 4.06 a city attorney it specifically states they that he shall advise the city council and the city manager i look at section 2.045 powers of the city shall be invested in the city council i look at section 3.02 the city manager shall have the authority to execute all contracts i look at the finance articles city manager may authorize expenditures and i look at the the authorities and of the city attorney and basically he shall advise the city manager the city clerk and uh there's a disconnect here between the authority uh of uh you can't serve several masters and i think this the city manager needs to be the focal point of this part of the disconnect is the city manager is the only person who is authorized to obligate city finances and to obligate money and execute the contracts that's not vested in anybody else the council can do that but they do it through the city manager and the city manager works through the council i agree that it should probably that paragraph should be limited to the city manager and i think jody just echoed that i think gaddis just echoed that i think we could solve a lot of these uh these problems and uh concerns by uh narrowing that down to who manages the city attorney if there's a concern then it's brought before the council for advice and consent that the council tasked the city manager to test the city attorney and the city attorney reports back to the city manager and to the council and copy goes to the city clerk that's the way i read all this and that's the way i think that was the intent of the people who put together all of the the charter and the original ordinances here so uh i i stand with dave and jody in this and i think we should probably take a step back and reevaluate this for uh tighten and tighten up this contract that's all i have thank you mark beam as far as our costs yes they've gone up for um a couple of reasons and one of them we never could have anticipated in a hundred years uh but as far as um any questions that we have for the city attorney i think they should be directed first to the city manager and if he sees fit maybe he has an answer for some of the questions he can answer us that way if it's something that is a key issue he can maybe bring it to the council via email and say okay let's make a decision we've got something that needs to go to the attorney for uh discussion or clarification and then let him handle it that way i'll agree with the other three on that one but uh the thing that gets under my craw is and i could be wrong mentioning this but some of this um stuff that's going on in the city i believe is is personal and i discussed this with with the city attorney when he called and i don't know how we could filter it out before anything else comes up but if it's of a personal issue i think it should be handled outside the city unless it's brought into the city and the way it was brought in uh was kind of sad but it happened so a lot of our costs and i think we're all on edge because of that but if there's a way to filter a personal issue outside the city i think we ought to look into either a resolution ordinance or something to deter that from happening again that's it i'd like to go ahead i'll i'll go after you read a swope i just want to make sure that i go ahead and echo councilmember shirley gaddis gunn and mark beam's comments as well i really do feel like we need to review especially number three and then review the whole thing as well but number three we do need to in my opinion go through the city manager with all of our concerns and see if he can handle them and then he can take it to the city attorney and that should start saving us some costs i would think so i just i'm echoing everybody else's comments that were made earlier thank you okay i'll say my comments um number one fred reilly did call me and i'm going to clarify anything that i said that may have offended him i think any differences i have with mr riley is strictly an attorney-style difference the way he operates versus the way i operate i did hear some comments about a little bit more definitiveness he and i did go over that but i will tell you this and i've worked with many attorneys in my day fred riley's an excellent attorney he does a very good job about cost containment the fact that some people have taken the records request laws and bastardized them and and just turned this thing into a mess well we pay for that um i see fred reilly doing something that the only other attorney i know who does it is me which is giving free hours i've had people tell me what are you doing and fred reilly does that he does it all the time i think dave gaddis just said it was a free conversation that he had with them good luck finding another attorney who will do that i think mr riley's work is excellent his research is excellent he has a measured approach to things with regard to me speaking with them i'm not going to cry if you take this paragraph out and you're not going to hurt me i do think you'll hurt the city mr riley knows full well how things will go if if i spot an error and i choose to speak up on it and i think jody shirley said she had sympathy for my situation last time because i'm in a difficult situation i'm not the city attorney but yet i do see sometimes some errors and i don't want to see our city go down the wrong road i would hate like hell to have to bring that stuff up at a council meeting for the first time but i'll be more than happy to do it i've given fred and i hope fred will speak up about this more than one probably 50 heads-ups about things that are going to happen many of which never show up on a bill um but he's alerted to what's coming and he's able to do some preparation time if you take this away i will not make the phone call to them it's not a problem i will not go through the city manager i don't believe that you understand the reporting uh relationship here city manager works for the council we don't work for the city manager and in any corporation the legal function in any major corporation is separate and distinct from even the board of directors it is a safe harbor where anyone can go with any issue now some of you may never get a complaint like i've gotten many of these already where an allegation of wrongdoing is made i don't want to bring it up to the council the first person i bring it up to is our city attorney and we discuss it to see how it should be handled and you leave no avenue of recourse if the wrongdoing is within the city manager's bailiwick so i will abide by whatever you do if you want to scratch it out feel free to do so i won't lose a tear over it i can assure you but i do think it will come back i think it would be something that you'll see was not a good decision as we go down the road with that said mr reilly i think you're doing an excellent job and if there's any consideration about ever removing you you can count me right now and saying no i do not support that resolution robin aki you're muted please unmute yourself i was trying sorry um no thank you fred again for all your great work i think that you came into this and got a lot thrown at you and i think you've handled it well um i agree with marv i believe a lot of issues have been personal and taken too far um as far as what some others had said about um you know i agree maybe you know you can dumb down the language a little bit because for the legal illiterate like myself to make it a little bit more clear so we're all on the same page and then as far as giving more of a strong opinion um i would say no to that because or his opinion because we don't want another what an eighth council member or nine council member we want an attorney we don't want that's what we had problems in the past of an attorney giving too much of his own personal opinion and getting too much involved in the discussion we want hear the facts here is the objectives this is you know my legal opinion but as far as what you should do for this your city and your opinion about which way you would vote if you were um on here i don't think we need another council member so i think the way he handles it um is very well i think he's very calm when calm is needed in our meetings let's face it we need more calm so i think i think he's doing a great job so as far as the bills i agree too much time but i can honestly say and he can agree with me not one minute have i spent of his time so nor will i if i need don't need to so um yeah i think he's doing a great job and yeah if it came up to throw this out for rfp i would say no i i think fred's doing great that's it council mr riley would you like to say something all right you have to put your mic on i'd like to say several things independently and intently to what y'all had to say this evening i listened to the um tape from the workshop a month ago i will tell you i wasn't very thrilled with the tape from a month ago but i um tried to take it in stride and uh fast or accept it as as constructive criticism i'm going to respond to several of the points that y'all made this evening um mayor manzo is is correct he has given me a heads up on quite a few things and as i've told y'all before there have been times that him and i have discussed quite a few things and they were helpful to me because it's helpful to talk to another attorney at times about um things that are potentially sticky problems um nobody wants to be blindsided and i'm i'm not alone in that i will tell you i have go out of my way to try and make sure that the seven of you are not blindsided so um any if you'll make a change to the contract um that's fine but i i would really uh request that there be an effort so that you know i'm not blindsided the city manager and city clerk blindsided because it makes it harder for you to give a a responsive answer to a question or help uh provide guidance to the city council i in in the year that i've done this i i think i've been responsive to you i when you all interviewed me you made it clear you did not want an eighth council member and i assured you then that i would not be an eighth council member and i haven't done that the the biggest thing out of this discussion that i would like is i'd like clarity and the clarity is that i i have in front of you in front of me the contract and the contract uh as you've discussed says that the city manager city clerk or mayor can direct me and i will tell you looking looking you in the eye over the course of the last year those are the three people that have directed me to do things and so i'm a little bit dismayed when when i'm you know heavily criticized for doing things that i was directed to do by the people who were directed to authorize me to do things but i you know in in any relationship there's um growing and there's comes forks in the road where you need to make changes and if you all want to change a contract that's within your view to do and i i would like the clarity of knowing who's supposed to be directing me and then i i will if i absolutely abide by that um i want to say one other thing though and i think several of you have mentioned and i know robin did and mayor manzo did um and i think dave dave did as well i um have if i'm ever asked to do a a call off the clock i've done that and there have been a number of times i've offered that and you know i i will tell you there's plenty of time that only each monthly basis that i've never put even put down there's quite a few times i put down how much time i actually spent and what i charged was less so i'm you know i'm trying to be mindful of the the economics of what you're doing and i'm just we'll tell you if there's a time where you want me this to do an off-the-clock call my feelings aren't going to be hurt and if if it takes two hours at some point i'll say um hey we've been on the phone two hours but um that rarely has happened um but i'm i'm receptive to here accommodating that if there's a basis for doing it and the basis is one of you you simply ask me to do it so um i i would like to uh get the clarity that you've discussed and have you all decide on how to proceed in the in the future and take it from there and i'll certainly respond to any questions that you may have plain gun i think part of the issue is some of the direction has been given in a vacuum okay again if you go back and you look at all the references the city attorney performs such other professional duties as maybe required by law or by the council okay so the point and the issue is the council works through the executive which is the city manager so if there's an issue it should have the visibility of the entire council not something going on where you're getting direction on an issue that's taking place somewhere behind the curtain and then the first time we hear about it is is in the billing process or some resolution comes about or there's there's some some inflammatory comments made at a council session so i think if you go back and you review all of these references and connect the dots and wire it all together it's the city manager and it's the council the council should have visibility for all advice and consent on this thing and they work through the city manager to direct how it's supposed to be done and the city manager is the person who executes the contracts and as far as i know you're working on a contract or an agreement or whatever you might call it and the city manager can is the only person who can obligate city funds and the way that's done is through the city manager and ergo if if somebody is tasking you with a project that can result in billable hours then they are obligating city finances and city funds and the only person who can legally do that is the city manager and or the council so it seems pretty clear to me that we need to wire this thing together and illuminate these disconnects marvin i got you next i just want to say something to that point if you're going to do that then you should scratch out city clerk too because she's not has zero authority and makes plenty of requests in fact before i ever started here i heard citizen complaints of ongoing um repetitive requests of the city attorney former city attorney uh by the city clerk so you might as well just scratch that out and then it can be the city council and the city manager and again i totally disagree that you have to go through the city manager um the city council can direct the attorney it is a um i believe it's a charter position so i don't think we have to go through anyone you want to take me out again i've said i'm not going to say it again i'll be more than happy to do that mr riley i'm sorry if you get blindsided but that's the council's doing and not my own i tried okay so it'll be what it is okay i mean i don't always have to speak up so um and i may choose not to do that so um let's go to we have more of them i'm sorry yeah council member shirley had her hand up first okay i have all right i had well marv when i was speaking i had that all right so let's go council member shirley marv beam dave gad is back to glenn gunn i don't think mars had an opportunity to speak so please no i didn't think so either but i absolutely i went to first guys okay i'm trying to be black jody yeah fred i you know i don't want this to i don't want you to take this as that we're attacking you i i think that we all have just recognized that there's potential problem here it's not it's not necessarily your problem i think it's it's the city issue and we need to get control of it i think that there's and and maybe they are personal attacks and justified all the correspondence back and forth but there just appears to be a lot of correspondence and time spent on records requests and things that are not productive i get it when they're requested we have to handle them i'm uh i just would hope that as council members we would adhere to what our policy is that's now in place and that we would moving forward be able to work through these types of things without engaging the attorney every time we get a records request or something like that i agree city clerk probably doesn't need to have direct contact with an attorney as much as he has either i've had some emails that i've sent to city manager and city clerk and i saw that it somehow got forwarded to the city attorney and it was about beach cleanup that had no need for legal response i don't understand why my name appeared on a on a legal bill because that should have never been forwarded to uh to fred riley it had no legal question in it at all it's just clearly beach cleanup i don't understand that how that came about but to give you some example i mean that's just one of those things where i'm not sure if lynn did it or if patty did it but i think that everyone needs to be mindful of the fact that you know we're paying mr riley to do a job and if we contact him he needs to be paid and so therefore there's no need to have these big legal bills for such minor issues and i would just hope that everyone would be aware of that and just pay attention as council members as staff and be mindful of his time we're not his only client as well so um and i and i in reviewing the contract those are my only key points for reviewing it's not that i want to change attorneys or anything like that mr riley i think you're doing a great job there are always going to be growing pains i don't care if it's you or some big firm we're going to have those same growing pains and it's going to take a year or so before we get to know you and you get to know us so you know i completely support keeping your contract in place we just need to tweak and make sure that we're being efficient with the city's money sorry go ahead marv thank you no it was dave gaddis next then um then marv being dave gaddis um i will also echo that hey we're not we're not picking on our attorney at all it's more of uh we're just trying to get control of the spending and also just make sure that there is some openness as as glenn stated uh no vacuum also i as as far as everyone on this council i i don't understand why anyone would have a problem going directly to the city attorney with a concern i mean i'm sorry the city manager with a concern if that's the case well then that's a that's a personal issue that uh that those two need to work out um it's it seems to me the only way that they will be able to filter uh this this spending and also bring the rest of the council into the fold at the next meeting so beyond that i'm i'm uh i'm happy with your services and uh i again i don't want you to feel like we're picking on you uh and also i will uh say one more time that i do uh appreciate your legal opinion not your personal opinion and i appreciate it okay morph i think um this council has to realize i think we've done more than other councils so that naturally brings up more questions for the attorney to answer which has happened he's doing i think the best job that and exactly what we wanted we didn't want an eighth council member and there's so many things if we think back over the last two years of what we brought up and what's been done this past year when he's been here things that just had to be done from loss changes signages and everything else and there's not much we can do about some of the costs the only reason i brought up we should go to the city manager if there's something he knows about that can kind of uh eliminate some costs well then why not discuss it with him first before it goes any farther mayor i i have to bring this up i thank you very much for sticking your your legal sense in into things because i know for a fact it saved us uh some money and gave us a heads up a few times i'd hate for you not to do that i don't think the council really is intending for you to but there's got to be some i don't know clarity or a better way of letting everybody know what's going on i guess i don't know how we can do it but to feel that our expenses are justified totally the only expenses i think we've had that are out of hand are the personal ones and we all know what those are so if we didn't have that i don't think we'd be sitting here today discussing it but uh fred as far as what you've done i appreciate what you've done you're cantonese you're um talking to me [Music] and um your clarity and law you put it right in front of us and this is what the deal is and this is how we work around it thank you thank you marv glenn gunn i i will not just i will not wouldn't dispute that the city clerk is one of those up for review for possibly striking from this thing i i think we need to step back and see who should be the the property the proper chain there and i think what we're going to come up with is the city manager and the city council and in most cases the council is going to work through the city manager but that does not negate the possibility that at a council meeting the city council uh comes up with a consensus and tasks the city manager or task the city attorney to to deliver some results for us or to research something the city clerk i believe uh can be more assertive she should be the master of her craft and i think there's a lot of things that our city clerk has a lot of experience and knowledge on but i think we have a tendency to just send the email or forward it to the city attorney for a second opinion or whatever when our city clerk and our city manager have the experience and the knowledge in the background to say no this is the way it should be done and i think we need to rely on their expertise some more and i don't think there should be this uh hey you know the first thing we should do is uh copy this city attorney on this because i don't think that's necessary be the master of your craft and let's let's do that that sort of thing uh with respect to the uh the mayor he has a a an expertise that has served us well and all we're saying is requesting to bring it up to the council so that there's entire visibility and advice and consent on these issues and uh if if if expediency is the the major concern well we have a way of calling special meetings we can get word out through uh the city manager or through the city clerk or or whatever but there are ways of dealing with this and if there's some sensitivity that an issue doesn't want to be dealt through the city manager that doesn't mean that it can't be brought up in the presence of the entire council and we have ways of doing that work sessions we have special meetings we can we can do all of that so i'm just saying i i'm not disputing any of that i think it's time to step back take a look at paragraph three and make sure that it connects with everything else that we use for reference in in governance thank you mayor manzo yes can i speak yes sure thank you i just want to clarify that when it was said that the amount of time that i have spent as clerk sending uh things through this attorney and the previous attorney that during this city manager's tenure and the previous city manager's tenure i have never contacted the city attorney without consulting with them first and i just wanted to make that clear that i'm not abusing the city attorney's time just of my own volition or discretion thank you mayor okay and no one said you abused it that it just said it was being done um do we it looks like the mirror muted can anyone hello [Music] okay yeah it got muted by the host i don't know we have a bad storm maybe it blinked or something um i was going to ask the city clerk if there were any citizens that had any comments they wanted to make she's on mute also design now okay mayor i don't know if you heard me i asked if there was any citizens that had any comments to make on this it shows that your hand is raised but was that why i'm lowering it there you go there we go no there is no one no citizens okay uh council do we have anything else on this i i just i will say something to what glenn gunn just said i i'm not against bringing stuff up to the council there's just some situations that it's not appropriate um i don't know what we can do if i can't speak directly to the again you can vote on that um it puts me in a bind sometimes unfortunately even though i'm just one of the seven council members i'm the mayor and people call the mayor i think we heard a council member say they got three calls i got three calls in one day um and that's what happens and that goes with the territory but when people complain they complain to me and sometimes those complaints can be about the city manager or other people within our city and i found sometimes that there were some bad complaints that were unfounded and i worked that out with the city attorney um without even having to make it public and going through the embarrassment i think sometimes people were saying stuff maybe just to get at the city manager and we were able to filter that out in the future i won't do that i will take i'm obviously going to bring it to the council if you change it but it will be public then and um it'll be embarrassing and it's not me who's making the accusations it's people in the city so um you know i don't know what's going to happen down the road but um everything can come through the council and yes i know how to call an emergency session if we really need it um but sometimes things don't lend itself to going public first and that's why the circuit breaker here i don't sit and discuss baseball games with fred riley i discuss stuff that's necessary and try and head off problems and if fred thinks i'm abusing it um let me know but i i kind of take a little personally some of the comments and that i'm wasting in any way the city's money that's absolutely false i'm trying to actually save the city money in doing what i'm doing so um but if the council doesn't want it i won't do it again i don't really have to say anything if i don't want to legally i'm not obligated to i just happen to notice things sometimes so anybody else on this topic okay then um i want to uh introduce number three which is to discuss the marina rental rates and we have a presentation by one of our residents bill lusk um bill had asked oh fred reilly did you have a question yeah i have two questions one one is how long do you want me to stay um and i think i talked to lynn these were the first two things i was going to stay for and if you need me to stay the rest of the time i certainly can and and then the second thing is i wanted to comment make a one comment about a memo i put together yeah i think that memo is the only thing that i don't know if that's going to be it's not on our agenda tonight to discuss but i want to make sure that if there's any discussion on it since you authored the memo that you're here okay well let me give you if it's okay i'll make one or two comments about the memo and if you all don't need me counsel does anybody have a problem if we just um go to 2.5 here and just have discussed this memo that that the attorney wrote so we don't keep them waiting around everybody's good okay good mr riley okay um after the june july and august meeting i reflected a lot and i of my own volition decided to write a memo i i wrote the memo and i had long ago read the various rules that you have for your meeting and there's there's rules great basically broken into two categories rules for the debate among the council members and then there are several provisions that relate to discussions with citizens the one that i wrote primarily wrote the memo on was the debate among the citizens and that nobody asked me to do that i want you to be clear about that that was me looking at what you had and the conclusion i reached is that you have adequate rule rules existing that govern your your proceedings and your debate and i think at times you know every everybody loses sight of stuff that in the heat of battle and um i wrote the memo as a refresher and i always want to cite authority so i went in and cited several things i went included all the provisions that relates to your debating internally and with citizens and i highlighted several things that i thought would be so that was the purpose of it and i i think if those uh the principles that are outlined in those rules were prominent in your thoughts as you debated things i think you'd have fewer uh a little bit less friction and the meetings would go better and that was the purpose of me writing that so i'll answer any questions if yeah you have any one more comment one of the things that's in there is that the city attorney isn't supposed to jump in and uh interject himself into the debate unless he's asked so at times i have felt like over the course of the last year um y'all may at times want me to to you know referee the wrestling match and i'm not really supposed to be doing that my my job is to respond when y'all want me to so i've i've tried to adhere by that you know i'm trying to follow the rules too so that's all i wanted to say mr riley thank you for the memo um i'm glad you wrote it um i you know i routinely review the city ordinances and charter because i have to host these meetings um and i don't want to go back and relive past meetings i know there's some that may i don't okay um i do think we've lost sight of some of the rules of decorum when a point of order is called the presiding officer makes the decision it's not debatable you don't get to argue you don't get to call them a liar you don't get to cross talk you don't get to do any of that you don't get to interrupt you don't get to interrupt the person and call a question these are basics we've all been on council at a minimum of a year and a half at this point some of us two and a half years and i know in the heat of battle some people can get upset and it's understandable i don't take it personally if somebody gets upset but we're not going to have maybe past councils tolerated all the cross talking and stuff like that when we're in a work session we relax the rules and we've done that by consensus when i say relax we still work with the rules of order but we do allow people to say for instance maybe ask another council member a question in regular session that's inappropriate what's certainly inappropriate under any session is when a person has the floor to interrupt them that is never appropriate the only time it's appropriate is to call a point of order and it's simple as this point of order personal attack personal point of order whatever your thing is you make your statement the presiding officer makes the decision i have the option of bringing that decision out to the council if i so choose and that's it you don't get to debate it you don't get to keep talking while i'm talking i patiently listened during that exchange to every single person i went through i think two or three times before i said a word and i was interrupted no less than five or six times by two different council members that's unacceptable under any rules of order you cannot call a question before the general public speaks that's illegal under the state of florida i don't care what our rules say they can't the florida law takes precedence and we have to follow those rules you cannot interrupt a person to call a question you can't use it as a weapon to shut down a person's speech and i i just want us to focus on that i think things will be better under no circumstances can you ever call anyone a liar i don't care if they're lying through their teeth you just simply rebut it when it's your turn to rebut it i've never said that to anybody and i don't expect it to be said about me it's unacceptable so that's it those are the rules those are the rules we operate under they're all here as you very aptly pointed out i'm working off the same rules you are you don't even have to dig deep into robert's rules of order to find this stuff okay it's very simple so when a person has the floor they have the floor and then you relinquish it by the way there's no time limit on a council member's time on the floor i've heard people go for 40 minutes sometimes on presentations it's okay we try to limit it the general rule of thumb in robert's rules of order and this is even for the house of representatives is you try and keep it to 10 minutes we're not going to let somebody filibuster for four hours that we can stop but if you go 12 minutes no one's timing you patty doesn't time the council members so say what you have to say and that's it people listen to you and then we go through the council once and then we go a second time and everybody gets a chance to speak once and we'll do that as many times as necessary then we go out to the general public then we come back to the council and the person who makes the motion gets the last word that's the simplified rules of order and the person who makes the motion gets the first word sometimes we ask for a person to yield if somebody has particular information sometimes city manager or somebody else might have certain information we let them set the question out that's it okay so that's all i ask mr riley nice job on the memo i hope we can utilize it and um and have better meetings because of it thank you um mayor mayor and consul so what i understand here is i should work with the city attorney to modify that section of the contract and bring it back to the council is that correct i head shaking yes that is correct okay well i thought we're not allowed to make decisions tonight no you're gonna have to bring that up as a motion if you want to bring it as a motion on the next meeting you can you can't make a decision or a work session so no i wasn't asking for a decision i was asking if you want as a consensus do you want me to work with city attorney and revise the contract they've done it sure what i would like to see is a revised uh contract uh that we could vote on in the next meeting that's what i'm asking and is that what i hear okay i'll have a nay to that but go ahead yeah robin shaking her head i don't see jody or uh yeah man so jody has her hand up she has her hand up okay so i guess you have a majority um revise it and propose it as a motion well somebody has to propose it as a motion no we'll bring it there's not a motion i've got a consensus so i'll bring it to the next meeting in in september and then the council can vote on it but i will work with fred on that discussion yeah my hand's been up about something else though but i i agree that's fine bring us a draft let us review it let's talk about it the next session back to fred's memo we were talking about that did we have any comments on that that's what my hand was on yes okay jody shirley yes okay fred thank you yeah it was nice to have everything summarized and yes um something we should know but you know i think sometimes it gets lost in the heat of the moment sort of thing um i think it's helpful i will have it printed out and keep it handy so that i can review it often thank you fred for that a bit of information i think um but the one thing i i have to say is i think we're all cautious of trying to adhere to the rules but a lot of times what happens is that we have to be aware that we are dealing with people and that um tone leads a lot of the discussion and when someone's tone is i'm not even going to say authoritative but demeaning it's it triggers um discussion that is not productive so i'm just going to say that when we're discussing um issues it goes a long way to try to keep it even tone and not be demeaning when you're speaking to others especially the chair and i'll just leave it at that and and glenn i'm coming to you next thank you jody i heard what you had to say and i think everybody else has heard it um and again i think that that cuts both ways to um you know again i don't take it personally from people and don't always take things personally if i say something my tone sometimes belies my true feelings but i do get excited i'm all italian marv knows about that and um it's just the way it goes sometimes so you know again i'm not personally having agendas with anyone here okay and i would expect that no one has one against me although i'm not totally sure glenn gunn marv beam i i would uh second what jody just said i think you know you you've got a bunch of professionals on the screen here and we've all dealt in professional circles and meetings and that sort of thing and i think for the most part we all pretty much know how to conduct ourselves in public forums like this and with other professionals and i think when you see a breakdown like you you've seen it's because there's an overwhelming uh sense of concern here that it's getting a lot of purse personality involved it's getting heated it's getting very personal and just just as jody said tone condescension threatening sort of thing and yeah people jump in and try to intercede and interrupt that and that's that's exactly what you're seeing most of people here know how to conduct themselves at a public meeting and wouldn't ordinarily interrupt or try to stop something like that but it's not necessarily that they're trying to stop it because of their own personal agenda they're just trying to stop it because it's not looking good at all for anybody in this public forum so i'll leave it at that fred thank you for your memo i think a lot of it was just a uh a rediscussion of a lot of things that people are already aware of thank you morphe as far as strong personalities um hey glenn um you know we've and lynn we've been in the military and some the eye gets in your face and um or i had an italian boss he got onto my face a lot of people can't handle it um and that's obvious to me it just goes in one ear out the other you just take it if it's directed to you and the rest should just leave a leave slight off your shoulders again i think the biggest deal is some people can't handle strong personalities but mayor you cleared that up uh just now um i understand it a lot of people do but i think most of us are sensitive to the people that can't handle it and that's where the problem comes in at what do we do i don't know um try to try to tone it down a little bit or just don't say anything at all you know and that's not good either but um where do we go from here but fred thank you very much for your memo and i i would request one thing um if we get out of hand raise your hand and say okay remember the memo that's what i'd like you to say so uh maybe that'll help and let me just bring up to everybody remind it's in that memo i think it was but if it's not i'll state it the responsibility although it falls to presiding officer to call the points of order the responsibility actually lies with everyone on the council and we've all seen people misbehaving some citizens we've seen individuals you know when and again i'm not i'm not trying to single out one person if someone is called a liar six hands should go up calling points of order not just one six because that's wrong because nobody wants that said about them even if that person is lying okay maybe it's the worst lie ever told that's not the way you rebut it when you get the floor back you say i disagree with that person and here's why that's the way you handle it and so i just want to reiterate i heard what everyone had to say i'll do my best if everyone will do their best um i do respect everyone here and i don't have any personal agendas anyone who knows me knows i am not out for anything for myself i get nothing out of this other than just the gratification of helping out the city and that's always my first concern obviously the last couple of council meetings have been some very touchy subjects and sometimes that's what we have to do thanks to the state of florida we can't have private meetings everything has to be out in the open so it's you know what i say it's it's not pretty watching sausage being made and that's what's happening you know sometimes it gets a little ugly we don't want to have these discussions but florida mandates that's the only way we can do it and yes sometimes personalities bubble over um it's not just mine i think everyone on this on this council at one point or the other maybe with one or two exceptions have had some issues okay and let their personalities get maybe the better of them so what happens okay we move on i'm not upset by anyone um we just move on i think it was a good memo just keep it in mind please everyone and please i i've said this really now for a year and a half um other people can call points of order okay you know during that conversation dave gaddis called a point of order it actually wasn't even appropriate but you know what it was very well received by me because he said just take a deep breath and i felt it was more friendly advice than it was maybe an official point of order and i thank him for it because i said you know what i am going to take a deep breath but you know i had been interrupted five times before that so yeah i mean and you know show the same respect back and i think everybody will be fine when someone else has the floor you let them talk if you don't like what they're doing i don't know doodle on a pad or something or daydream about your next vacation or something but you know we have to let people speak we really do and that goes for the citizens too but they have to do it properly and if a citizen's misbehaving whether they're our friends or their our worst enemies we all need to call that okay it's not just my job to call it luckily we've been pretty good of late with citizen behavior but sometimes it gets a little out of hand we've seen it call it if you see it okay did anyone else have any comments fred riley thank you have a good night looks like you're in new orleans so have a good time there it's not new orleans that's just the backdrop huh okay all right go play some guitar all right let's move on to number three we have bill lusk patiently waiting um i was introducing this as saying um last council session one of our citizens bill lusk uh asked if he could um prepare a uh some documents and some information because i think i know jody shirley had brought up some questions regarding electricity on the docks and just a general marina discussion and bill knows quite a bit about it bill has a boat down there and i believe he reached out or tried to reach out to every council member to discuss this personally i know he discussed it with me and i think he did with others so um he prepared a really nice packet for us and he wanted like about 10-15 minutes to go through it with us so bill i'm gonna if you're there i'm gonna thank you first on behalf of the council and the city for that that took a lot of work what you did and i'm gonna turn the floor over to you with the council's okay everyone's nodding yes bill lusk has the floor can everybody hear me yes sir sure can wonder paul thank you um all right let's try and have a little bit of fun here first of all start with uh thank you all of you council city staff mayor just for everything you guys do it doesn't go unrecognized i don't know if you hear that often enough but i i think you've seen me around often enough and that's very sincere i also am aware that it's not easy to be an expert in every silo that you guys have to make decisions on and therefore during that last workshop when i heard some questions about fees and rates and convenience billing security public access to the docs and basically the marina overall i just wanted to offer some insight that i think will help simplify your research and you know therefore you guys can get to work and make a sound decision on what's next for the bellar beach marina if anything so i think it's important as a reminder that you know i personally or a resident or a slip renter currently didn't you know ask for any marina amenity changes or rate changes or fee changes yet i understand that this is one of our limited revenue streams that we have in the city so hopefully today's information will help you all i want to start just with a quick you know i've heard the term and i think it's just in the eye of the beholder the term premier and as it relates to marinas sometimes when i think of a premier marina what comes to mind for me is a place like marina del rey marina in marina del rey california i don't know if you've ever been there but it's awesome it's the best of the best right down to their views that certainly sets a high bar for us yet it's really not a fair comparison so at the very least i think we should look at what other local municipal marinas offer and charge in our area so i provided two documents hopefully everybody has them up uh or can just let me know if you did or didn't review them i i don't want to go through them in detail but i want to give you kind of a 30 000 foot view from above what i'd like to do is just talk maybe 10 minutes here and just help you with kind of what's current at our marina compared to some other like marinas or at least other municipal marinas answer a few questions i'll mute out i'll stay on the call and answer any follow-up questions as needed so let's just start with as your agenda packet looks to have it with the document that talks to slip renter or starts with slip renter lift pulls and electric hookup personal costs does everybody see that yes i'm getting thumbs up everybody's saying yes thank you mayor um i appreciate that and thanks for doing that mayor i actually opened the document myself so i can't see the screen i wanted to start with that one page there not go through that whole first set of detail of numbers but the first page is very important and the reason is i don't think a lot of residents or for that matter at times as we go through different councils know that the slip renter is the one that pays for the boat lift i think it's as you look at this exercise you you have to start there so when you're standing in that parking lot and you're looking at our marina you're looking at about 220 000 at any given time in assets at the marina that the city doesn't actually pay for and i'm referencing again those 14 boat lifts at this time so the slip runner doesn't just pay for it initially they also pay for the maintenance and they pay for the removal when they want to cancel their slip so this is a personal expense that i think as you look at that sheet you almost based on the time that someone's there need to look at it as well that that in itself is a slip rental fee if someone's there three or five years now i started with a 2005 example of 10 000 but i actually was talking to someone recently who is one of our slip runners they spent 15 in the last year i talked to another slip renter who spent 20 and obviously what matters there is current cost but also size of motors cable size etc so that expense is just getting larger and larger as we continue to have a marina that if you want to lift the renter pays for it and i'm not sure if you guys are aware of that but it's an important place to start i think what i even left out was the uh someone spending i think it was 20 000 and if they were there for let's say five years that's an extra 333 dollars a month or seven years is another 238 dollars a month now the remainder of that document has a lot of numbers for your convenience it gives you the page 67 that's in the draft budget just showing you this is our current slip configuration here's our revenues here's how it's made up but it's a moving target and then everything beyond that is really just for you guys just so so you're not sitting there calculating if you wanted to do something different i tried to take a lot of different scenarios and put them on a spreadsheet which turned into this document for you you can also create your own and that's why at the end of that document there's a blank one what i'm going to do is move over to the blue section that goes down to the actual marinas and everybody can you just let me know if you're there singing nodding heads and thumbs up yes i think so bill thank you i'm going to run through this quickly i'm not going to go through every bullet i think what i want you to walk away with though is starting with when i see a lift at the bellar beach marina someone has invested in that lift the second thing about our current marina and i'm on the bellar beach marina slips overview is that we do have a minimum and as you go through this exercise you'll learn i mean it is it's not wrong it's something we've been doing as long as i can remember and i'm sure lynn could add some insight to that whether it goes back 20 25 years i really don't know when it started i think from a business perspective if i looked at it outside the i'm a slip renter i have a certain size boat and i'm not comparing to other rates of marinas i i kind of get it i mean it it's you it at the least in the worst case scenario in any given month you know if you have all your slips rented you're going to get x dollars you can apply that to a lot of business models you know what the reoccurring revenue will be at the very least it's not a bad thing but what you'll see is you don't see other marinas doing that and it's simply based on they started differently they're doing things by size of the slip linear by the by the size of the boat we don't have that luxury to go backwards and just scratch out the whole marina get rid of all the lifts redo it and just start from scratch so but i think what you'll learn is it's a it's a slight disadvantage to the smaller boat it's a little more advantageous for the larger boat but you have to again include the cost of the lifts for those that have them over 15 years since i've been there i'll tell you that mourinho looks great at any time that we have brought something up to the city it's been done i mean we we started with some pavers ourselves the city finished it added shell the deck has been redacted the fence has been raised from four feet to a more secure six foot fence the new lights came with the penny for pinellas i believe no one down at the marina is complaining so let's move on and just look at some other scenarios what are other cities have no minimums uh when you start getting into this uh discussion around electric you will find yes clearwater marina saint pete they charge electric they have put in the equipment to do so you'll find the smaller marinas didn't put forth the capital to start that process it's up to you all marinas have security at different levels um you're already aware of this the lift situation and everyone kind of does a little bit of a variation on the larger size on on how they go about a utility fee or an electric fee but on the smaller size marinas you'll see that it's just included it's self-explanatory on the amenities we know what we have we know what we don't have so i won't drill down too much there i do know that it's convenient in a lot of people's eyes for residents to drive to the marina i think i as i get into these other marinas i i'm hopeful that you guys see that if i'm a resident of there's some sense of convenience to a madera beach person a clearwater person if i live in island estates it's nice to drive to the clearwater marina etc etc um i don't know if you've ever been down to clearwater but their rates are interesting it's it's pretty decent they add some tax for uh and a utility fee but their rates are decent for all that they offer i actually was a little surprised on the recent research now they have some other facilities they're off-site of where you might view clearwater marina there's one in island states and there's an area over coachman park a little different structure there but very similar dunedin what i find interesting about dunedin is that it's their approach is that they double the rates for non-residents now keep in mind putting the lift aside they don't have people do their rates are already really attractive every one of their rates that you see on this slide are below what ours are for those size boats i think that number two for a 30-foot boat is about a dollar higher when you add the tax to our rate other than that they simply offer more and they charge double or their non-residents lyndon asked me a question i got an answer they about out of the 193 slips 10 percent are non-residents let me move on gulfport marina i want everybody to try and keep with me just so you can see the slide i'm on gulfport city marina what i find interesting about gulfport and for those that vote and i've had a lot of different discussions it's not ideal boating over there but people choose to live in that area that's my personal perspective what i do find interesting is they've acclaimed a number one choice in a clean marina designation so if if we're premier why do they get the designations and we don't now they're full blown over that way they do have a marie a meter reading fee and they also charge electric separate their rates are right within ours in regards to size of boats now you'll see that they actually go by size of slip the larger they go they're actually a little bit more expensive than we are but the marine itself you can see all the amenities full-blown marina safety harbor i'll be brief on this again getting into the water and the areas a lot of people know that area i think what i'll start with though if i live in safety harbor it's a really cool setup i personally i'm not a fan of the water over that way they struggle with tides they have restrictions on getting through the bridges on the height of their boats but what they do they've restricted it to residents only because they actually have such a long waiting list of residents that they don't need to have non-residents come in they also have kind of their own little security the harbor master will tell you and that's just a group of residents that hang out down there on their boats that aren't always taking them out they also go through their waiting list every year and refresh it and make sure do these 96 people actually really want to slip so every year they're getting noticed sending a new application and they want to make sure it's fresh for so they're ready when something comes available in closure they did make some rate changes they did a four-year plan you can see that on the bottom but you can also see their rate sizes our rate sizes and rates it's it's we're much more expensive than them let me let me just put it that way all right going on to st petersburg i'll be brief on this this is your i mean if we had a marina del rey i guess it would be saint pete marina it's big it's beautiful it offers everything their rates are a little bit higher on the larger boats um they also have some options for the smaller boats that are very attractive uh they include everything it's to me this is a hard discussion to have when you're comparing to a municipal marina of this size and nature but i think everyone's familiar with it and for your for your education there are some rates they're very competitive the larger you go we're we're a little bit off on that but um to my surprise we're pretty competitive uh madera beach this is you know probably the the marina that you want to look at closest to us and i don't just mean distance i think what they've done over time at madeira is just simplify it they don't have difference between resident and non and they don't force individuals to invest in a lift which really kind of frees you up as a boater that you're not looking at something as if wow i'm putting down 20 000 and putting 15 down i hope i stay here for you know x amount of years so they've kind of done what i would look at as the opposite of what we would look at because they offer lifts they maintain them they're full-blown everything down there right down to ramp on site park your boat trailer lifted no lift options bait everything you see that the rates include the tax water and electric they kept it very simple but the difference is simply the lift now i can tell you personally for someone who's been at the left or have a lift for 15 years at our marina i'm already paying that with lift fee and have been for 15 years if you incorporate the minimum we have times the size of the boat i have with the investment into the lift just a little math for you on how i might look at it personally yet i'm here to speak to all the slip runners your future slip runners as well as speak for the city on just education on what's going on um bill can i interrupt you for one second glenn gunn had his hands up like three times i don't know if it's an emerging question but if it is i want to make sure he gets it in at the appropriate time i am so sorry no it's okay that's my job to monitor i didn't want to cut you off though and i saw he he raised it three times which tells me he wants to bring it in now so if it's okay with you you don't mind taking glenn gunn's question i'm almost done glenn if you want to hold on 30 seconds and go to this last slide he's nodding yes go ahead and help the video questions you know what thank you so the last slide you know so i was talking to lynn and and helping lin with an excel that i had put together i just sat down one night with the current configuration so well what if if i put aside this investment that lift renters have what what are the rates and where do they you know compare and i just started messing around with numbers and i started showing things the lynn and then we kind of looked at the safety harbor and all right well they're they're doing a few different things different uh they spread things out over some years well this is what lynn kind of thought he'd throw by and i think when i walk away from preparing this i want to emphasize i recommend doing nothing because of the expense i pay and others pay but these are some guides for you if you're just looking at rates those those are competitive rates if we didn't have the expense to the left and that's a smart way to go about it now what others may have done to transition is they started taking ownership of lifts or if you're just talking utility fees others have suggested maybe go by the size of the boat so there's a lot of different ways to look at this i just wanted to break down what was what i was seeing is somewhat a simple approach to looking at the marina and really bring to the council's attention there's a little bit more to it on how we how we view it as a line item versus what slip renters are actually paying and it's different for every boat size and every slip render i'm done with that um the other numbers on that page after the first document or just for your convenience i'm ready for some questions okay thank you glenn gunned his hand up so we're gonna go with glenn first and then we'll see who comes after that yeah bill help me understand this uh lift uh aspect to this thing do we have a mandatory policy that slip renters have to install a lyft no and i i have i think i'm sorry is that yes or no do we have a mandate no slip runners do not have to and lynn please jump in you can get a slip and put your boat in there okay so let me let me continue with this line of thought then so it's a discretionary expense it's called a wetland it's called a wet slip versus lift and that's what other marinas offer they actually okay bill let me finish my train of thought here for just a second here so sure a person wants to rent a slip at baylor beach we say okay slip number 13 is open if you want it so if the guy wants to put a lift in there to get his boat out of the water which probably most people who are going to invest in a high cost uh recreational vehicle like that might want to do it's at his expense is that correct yeah it is so if if that renter wants to install a lift to protect his high value asset and if the thought is well gee he has installed it at his discretionary cost for for his benefit to keep his vehicle high and dry i mean why should the city be test with considering that as a an additional cost that's a purely discretionary cost for the boat owner and then okay now let me finish that train guy decides to vacate his rented slip at some point well if the the next guy on the list has a big boat that's not going to fit in that slip because there's a lift installed then then he has taken away the option of the city to rent that slip to a larger vessel because previous owner installed a lift and then the city just gives them a free ride to just leave it there and and seeing the future maintenance costs operating that thing understand glenn so look glenn let me let me give you let me give you a quick response that i'll ask for lynn's input please keep in mind glenn i'm here to provide competitive research what you just explained doesn't exist competitively so everyone else has a what they call a wet slip and a lift option so that doesn't exist other than bellar beach so it's a little abnormal to just uh have those slips but that's hairner there so competitive no no that's not true because it's actually a competitive edge that biller beach has because if you go to another marina and all that's available is a wet slip and you say i want to put a lift in there what's that marina probably going to say he's going to say here's what i'll do here's what i'll reiterate uh council member glenn i'm not here to debate i'm here to offer council some guidance on here's what we do here's what other marinas do and provide you insight and therefore you can collaborate amongst yourself so i'm not here to debate you on points oh no i'm not i'm not trying to figure out the issue sure sure as far as the slip renter leaving i i think i want to defer to lynn just a little bit on that because it's my understanding when someone departs they spend to remove it and leave the space the way it was the city does not incur any maintenance or lift costs it's up to the next individual now have we done some things in a transfer where maybe the person wanted to buy it from someone i don't know i'll ask for lynn that that is correct we we asked them to remove their lift the person that may come in to rent the slip whoever's next on the list if if the lift is there that's between the existing renter and the new renter otherwise we tell the slip renter to remove his lift and they take it with them yeah how often have we that's a really that's a good scenario for that individual leaving to at least get a couple bucks maybe from a potential next slip uh person so that's a good thing lynn have we done that often uh patty could you answer that i don't know i know of one or two times but i don't know that we've done it a lot right we've done it a few times but it's very infrequent just because of the fact that like it was said earlier um the boat coming in usually doesn't fit the lift or they just don't want to pay that for a useless i mean there's a lot of different reasons so just a few times and mayor manzo uh council member shirley has had her hand up for quite a while okay okay so you know what i'm going to do i have as soon as glenn finishes i had robin ockey's hand up i have jody shirley's i don't know who was first so i think last time we went with jody this time i'm gonna go with rob and then jody next okay no i was just going to um say that yeah that i had heard that once you leave you have to take it with you or dismantle it but it would be a good idea to try to transfer that you know over to the next person have the maybe pay a partial fee to the previous renter and then also in the contract have it so that they incur any further maintenance because like let's say after they've been there for a year when the motor dies well they're not going to get that money from the previous person that them that's something they incur if they have a 15 year old lift they know that going in if they choose not to have a 15 year lift then the other people have to take it down and if they want to do a new one that's on them but no i'm in full agreement that we need to do something to change these rates i don't even know the last time it's been changed but i'm guessing it's been five ten maybe longer years and it does seem slightly unfair for those people who have a 20-foot boat they're having to pay 30-foot boat fee um but then also keep in mind that if we decided okay well let's make the minimum 20 feet that's really good for the 20-foot boat but that's really going to suck for the 40-foot boat so what i would say is try to do a like what i think was safety harbor did did a a five-year plan so you know if we're going to start with the minimum at you know go from 30 to 25 and then in two years maybe make it 25 to 20 or 22 or keep it there or whatever we decide but maybe if you're gonna make a big jump don't make it a big jump make it a little every two year increment until you get to the ultimate goal because i think that because we don't want to piss anybody off and all of a sudden we have half of them rented and then we totally lost revenue but i think it is a good opportunity to get more revenue into the city but with doing it a fiscally responsible way and try to keep the current renters happy would you consider the city starting to pay for the lifts you mean for future like if somebody else wants a lift just kind of curious when you're looking at rate changes and that's the purpose of that document one and just throwing it out there if you would consider that it's uh because that's part of the math even though council member gone that is a personal decision it's like uh buying a car cover for your car i have jody shirley next and then dave gaddis after jody okay um thank you for doing this work bill i think it's really helpful i think from what we're this can trigger a lot of discussion i don't know that this is necessarily um the best setting for it i think it would be wise because there's a lot of good issues brought up the lifts being won it's kind of like you know you can't there's no way the city could would i would be in support of the city supplying lifts i don't think own lifts i think um you know buying a lift is like buying a t-shirt right i'm gonna wear an extra small you're gonna wear a large you can't it doesn't work that way you can't it's not interchangeable i can't go i'm moving at my slip and moving my boat into yours and and right are so many options a slip might be ten thousand it might be fifty thousand depending on the options and the weight limitations and the motor size and you have automatic lift you know you have it where it's you know you can pull away and it's going to stop when when it hits its you know stopping point that sort of thing so um there's too many things to discuss here but i think it does lend itself and i think we had talked about um that the parks is going to kind of oversee parksport oversee kind of the um marina maybe we tasked them with this or maybe we start a separate um ad hoc committee that we just are doing the research coming back to the council with here's what we think here's all the research in a very you know readable maybe a couple council members are involved and come back to the entire council as a whole with here's how we think we should handle the marina going forward because there are too many variables and too many um and i think we need council members that are voters to participate in that because um there's it's got more value to someone who's a voter than it does to someone who is not so they're you're going to have you're going to look at it differently than someone who's not a regular boater and not going out and looking to rent slips and you know they're just different so many variables so my recommendation would be use this information to start spool up a group of people to come back to council with some recommendations on what to do with the marina dave gaddis yeah i think one of the issues that that our marina has compared to most of the others that you've presented to us is uh we don't have the number of slips so if let's just say that we did adopt uh the lifts and left them in place well number one we've shot ourselves in the foot for versatility uh all of a sudden we've got three people that don't want lifts they have larger boats and they'd rather leave them uh uh leave them wet and just do bottom paint whatever and that works great for them but uh now we've got two or three lifts that uh are useless to them so we've we've backed ourselves into a corner uh also on top of that we we have the maintenance and we also have the adjustments that are made whenever we we change boat you know renters someone has to go in there and make the adjustments yes bill you and i could probably do it but is this something that we want city employees to uh to manage i would say probably not um definitely i appreciate all the work you've done with this i think you've given us something good to start with and uh and i i agree with uh judy that we should take all of this information and hand it over to parks and let them make recommendations on everything you've presented us with including uh your recommendation uh you you obviously had two one was do nothing and the other one was this uh proposal at the end well i think i was clear about that from the start that my job was to provide your research and that was concluded by a city manager review um i'm very clear on where personally i stand my goal was to help you guys with some initial research yes and and it's greatly appreciated and uh uh i think that this is something that will need to be discussed further and um hopefully we will come up with something good uh but i think that this is probably uh because it's such a small little aspect of of our city that it's it's probably uh time is is better invested uh by allowing the uh parks and rec to take uh you know to do the analysis robin hockey i'm going to come to you i just want to get my two cents in real quickly because we're coming around second time here um may i speak after you do mayor absolutely so it's going to be myself rita swope and then back to you robin for the second go around okay um i i agree with jody dave and probably a couple other folks um and i'll just summarize i don't think the city should be getting involved in the boat lift maintenance buying anything like that we just have better stuff to do with our capital we're not marina runners in terms of you know being able to operate this i don't think the city staff should get involved with this i do bill there's so much information here good information i think it could you know really provide quite a bit of a foundation for parks and rec and i agree i don't think we need another committee i think this comes right in the wheelhouse of the parks and rec board that is their charge and right now since there's no events going on this would be a good time to actually have them take a look at this i think there's some very good suggestions and i'd like to see it acted on while the information is fresh bill did a lot of work here again our thanks and you know let's get this over to them maybe they can start the meeting i don't think there's and i like jody's suggestion i think it was jody's suggestion let's get a few boaters there's nothing stopping you from you know zooming in on one of those meetings for all the voters as long as we don't have two council members speaking together um about something you know it's going to come before us they can get their their opinions in there and let's get some voters information certainly bill lusk and and you know i think this will be some good stuff one thing i would like to see without it hurting any current renter so in other words i would be saying we grandfather any current renter because this is was given to the citizens of bel air beach and i i see a lot of times that it's it's outsiders that are using this i think there should be a priority to the extent that we aren't showing it to our residents and our residents on a waiting list i don't advocate that anybody be told to leave i don't certainly want to see anybody who's invested in a boat lift being held dismantle it and go someplace else but i think as that stuff starts to become available to the extent if we're not we may be doing this already i don't know i'm not on the list i don't have a boat but um we should give that priority i think to our citizens it gets us a little bit less money but i think it's in keeping with the true spirit of what that donation was all about that was supposed to go to the city so that's all i wanted to say i think rita swope is next and then um robin aki yes uh bill i would also like to thank you very much for all of the information very thorough very detailed certainly appreciated and i'm going to agree with council member shirley that and councilmember gaddis that we should go ahead and send this on over to our park and rec board and let them take a look at it so we can do some more detailed research on it with your help that would be great but i certainly understand if you can't you know help advise or do that but i just want to say thank you i mean it's great information i never realized how many of these other marinas had so many other um perks for lack of a better word to call it than the beller beach one and the fact that they had to put in their own lift so that's um very informational and help us it will help us make a decision later on so thank you bill and appreciate it you're welcome thank you robin um yeah no i i have no problem sending this to the park and rec board but i just don't want this to be another kick the can down the road because i guess this issue about the marina comes up every so many years and maybe a committee has been formed in the past and fast forward to now and we're still there so i just don't want this to be discussed in two years at the next council meeting when it comes back up and we just do it all over again so if we're going to send it to the parks and rec board and they're going to bring us something back then i think that we need to look it over and make a decision and go forth and then i would suggest my suggestion would be is you know like jody said there's a lot going on here there's a lot of big issues so i would say more i'm going more with like the baby steps like let's maybe not tackle the lifts you know they can do transaction between previous renter and future renter and deal with that and deal with the maintenance but maybe we'll just start with adjusting the costs per foot and you know some of these um ideas he came up with and go from there and then once that's done if we want to tackle the lifts in the future when physically we're able to or it makes sense at that time then we can so i don't want this to be uh all or none i think that we need to have an open mind and if we need to take half of the ideas and only implement half i think we need to do that but i definitely don't want to see this on you know august 2000 or 2021's uh agenda about it thank you i'm mark beam's hand up marv all right the only thing i would say is maybe on the larger boats see what they're doing as far as running their air conditioners that's an expensive issue and if they are on the larger boats maybe tack on about five bucks for the cost electricity and then see what where the rates are maybe by ticking them up a little bit to pay for the electricity maybe we could check down the 30 minimum to a 25 and see how that adjusts and then everybody in between make up the difference you know just raise the upper the larger boats up a little bit the middle ones a tad and keep the ones on the bottom a little bit less if we can just readjust it i don't know lyn oakland yeah mayor and console uh just just to kind of the the planning board did an analysis of the marina just a few months ago and you know i think that information we can also give to the park and rec board uh and you know they can look at this rate analysis and see where we want to go i i agree with all of you we don't want to get into a lift operation residents do have first priority if a lift comes open if there's a vacancy uh and at times there's more residents than uh right now i think it's uh four non-residents in the restaurant residents so we do we do do do that so uh going forward we'll try to schedule something with the park board and send this information and give them what the planning board did also okay did we have any um citizens patty that wanted to make comments or is there anybody out there still for citizens no she's muted i can't she's i there's no raised hands there's no raised hands okay all right um council did we have any other comments other than i just want to thank bill again um and i and bill i you know i'm not going to ask you to do any more work because you've done way more than than ever was expected but um to the extent if this goes over to parks and rec you know if you could just even be an advisor i'm sure they will find it very very useful you're the uh you know you're kind of the expert on this now so that would probably be real helpful thanks for listening all i'll stay involved thank you we appreciate it can i ask a little question please quick sure yes it's jody so how do we is this something we can assign to the parks and rec board before our next meeting so then we can figure out at the next meeting who with council will be involved in um giving them direction and so forth um we have consensus on that yeah we'll just schedule a meeting yeah it's everyone's nodding yes and and i rate a swope you can uh with this yes i'm good with it okay and jody i assume you're with it so yeah we have consensus it can just be scheduled in and um i i also liked lin's idea i mean the planning board did a lot of work on uh some other options and stuff and that should go there um also you know that information we might as well make use of it there's some good information in there also you lynn okay thanks it's a good time right now yes glenn yeah i just wanted i didn't mean to get up on this lift uh tension or trick or thread here but i i i think i was confused because it was uh you know a discretionary cost that wasn't really uh part of normalizing the data and i just want to be cautious about that i think there's a lot of soft issues that come into play as a competitive edge for billiard beach and i just want to make sure that we look at a lot of things and don't just seize on a couple shiny glossy things here so i can certainly help with lynn reeves come up with a charter if you want to do go that far for uh what you're looking for for results just let me know i think they're already chartered to look into it i think we just have to give them the direction but yeah i mean to the extent that we've everything we discussed tonight is something that can go to them and up for consideration come back to us with some recommendations and i'm with robin aki let's make it sooner than later it doesn't have to be september but you know it would be nice maybe if we had something by christmas maybe i'm just picking a date here but that seems nice you know so hopefully sooner okay that'd be great it'd be christmas present all right do we have anything else on the marina before we go on to number four anybody need a break over here i've been going for two and a half hours everybody good okay i'm good all right everybody's going so here we go more beam has asked that we discussed improvement or he discussed improvements to north south walking easement pathways with that i turn it over to council member beam okay everybody we've talked about this before probably two years ago or better and linden went ahead and did a survey on all the paths and we did find some encroachments but nothing has been brought up since and it's kind of been on the back burner for a while so i'd like to see us move ahead on this and at least put in the um shell and make these paths a little more user-friendly than what they are now i know it shows some additions going across where the pond is on a north end and it shows going through the park on the south but originally we didn't talk about any of that but it would be a great idea this is what kyle put together and there's a lot of trees in that pathway area that have overgrown and some areas are not as passable as what they should be but it's an asset that the city's had for years and it needs to be brought back to what it once was so can i have any ideas on this robin i'm going to come to you next i have a question though it's kind of a threshold question here mark i've heard about these encroachments now for quite some time and you know in law i wish fred riley was still here he could explain it also but in law you know there comes a point where if you let somebody encroach they wind up owning it and we keep kicking this can down the road we know about it and i mean somebody could actually go back to our meetings and say hey listen to council member beam listen to council member guy you guys have said this before so i'm going to ask at this point and i know we're spending money on legal but these are our easements this belongs to our city um maybe this is time where we start doing something about this encroachments i mean these fences have to be moved whatever these sheds whatever these people have on there i don't think when i spoke with lynn at one point i don't think it was that many that had them but they need to be cleaned up and i think you know i have no problem with putting the shell on and fixing them all up but let's reclaim what is ours as a city robin you're next and then we'll go to lynn oh robin glenn lynn i was going to say that a couple months ago i went for a walk and i was like well let me check out these easements and see and there's a couple areas where i was about to walk in but the way they looked i'm like am i on private property like i was nervous one like oh my god am i walking in someone's backyard am i gonna be like arrested and and so i think this is really important because i mean that walking path that i did was really cool and i think more people could get better use out of it and it's a lot safer than walking you know even on the sidewalk on golf because you don't have to worry about a car hitting you so i mean i think i think this has been kicked down the road for um many many times so let's let's go ahead and get this done so we can have a beautiful area to walk landon inland yeah yeah i agree with the encroachment issue it's like yeah hey we may sound mean but i mean it's something that municipality needs to address secondly what is the cost benefit of why do we pave these things i mean you go to other cities and they have nice walking trails and bicycling trails and what's the difference in the initial cost of paving these things and marking them and making it a nice thing where you don't have to worry about maintaining it or stepping in a hole or a washout or something down the road and make it a long-term thing rather than just something that is going to wash out at the next rain and we're gonna have to fix next year and keep doing it i think it's a much more pleasant thing and obviously user friendly and probably a safer means of getting around rather than shell and bumps and potholes and that kind of thing so that's all i have thank you glenn lynn yeah mayor and consul i would have to agree with vice mayor i i think we we could make this a capital project uh there would be some cost in it but we could come back with you some numbers and let the council decide if if you want them paved or not the pavement is going to make it a much nicer situation it would be like a sidewalk between the streets mainly and the encroachments there there's a couple but it's not there's one that's what i would consider it's like 12 inches we'll we need to address that one but uh the others are an inch or two and we will have to figure that out also but i i think going forward if the console has interest in this project beyond to make it a community type trail type whatever you want to call it that uh long term it would be uh much less costly and maintenance free if it was paved when a question for you what's the issue i i like the pavement idea takes care of robin's concern because i mean the first time i saw one of those easements i thought i was in somebody's backyard too and it was right down my block i didn't know where i was if there's a sign but it's not clear so what's my only concern is is there it may not be a concern is there any issue with runoff if we pave it well actually technically a trail would not fall into swift mud's thing as a permit requirement and realistically people are supposed to keep any runoff of their water on their property so we'd have to you know it would have to be designed in a way to make sure that we were keeping our runoff off their property also i would like to speak if it's okay certainly go ahead um i actually 100 agree with vice mayor glenn gunn and city manager lynn reeves i think those are excellent ideas and i'd like to see us talk about us more and get some numbers on it so that we can move forward on it mayor councilman shirley councilmember shirley okay certainly jody shirley yes um i i agree the encroachment issues gotta be addressed whether we you know start the process right away or not but we do need to address the gross encroachment issue and then i guess the other thing you know i made some notes prior to you talking lynn is do we have any cost estimates of what it would cost for you know paving versus crush crush shell and or just do it in phases and maybe put crushed concrete down and then at least you've got some of your base material in and then go into you know paving just kind of some kind of food for thought giving us a uh you know so maybe we could establish the path and get all of the encroachments taken care of put down the crushed concrete if you will and then work on paving so at least you have established because certainly you don't want to put shell down if the end goal is to pave it so just some you know kind of food for thought and um you know what kind of what kind of time do you need to get budget numbers together for that well we're working on this pavement idea you know we've got a a number i think it was like 12 or 13 000 for shell but it's run bank shell and what it does it compacts itself it's not like you would it's kind of a mixture of sand and shell uh that we looked at but paving it would make it a much nicer amenity and maybe it's a you know we do sections at a time you know we do uh i don't know uh 17 16 17th and 18th between them you know one year and then we just set up a project to get them all done uh that that may be uh an option but go ahead and get the encroachments cleared up absolutely on the encroachments i have dave gaddis then marv beam yep i like the idea too but i also think that it's important that we don't forget about our streets and if we're going to do some paving we need to alternate we need to spread this around to where we're we're working on our streets and showing we're making an honest effort to make those repairs and also working on those trails yeah and i would i would suggest just to comment i would suggest that when we do if if we go forward with this when we're doing a section of the stormwater project we're going to have paving right there then do it at that point in time perfect mark that's exactly what i was going to say as long as your work oh the first one you're working on now is what seventh and eighth so when you do seventh and eighth maybe you could take a look at that and i'll clean out the trees uh in that area and then paved that section between seventh and eighth lynn i know you're in it seems like we have consensus there's any no one disagrees here right so i mean we have we have to deal with encroachments there's no point in paving anything until we know what land is ours get that i mean maybe we have to talk you'll have to talk with the city attorney to see it sounds like you only have one maybe that's even a major issue the other one's for an inch it's not probably worth maybe even arguing about but that'll be a determination that you make over the council makes on a cost-benefit basis um but the other stuff if you can pull together some numbers i mean i don't see why we can't be talking about this now we have the budget that's out there still so i don't want to rush you to have to do this for september because i know we have our budget first coming up here but um is it something that we can get done in the next couple of months and i'd like to see this project move along yeah we we can get we'll have some numbers we've already started the process and and uh we're talking to the paving uh company that the contract that we already awarded for uh bellevue estates island uh and then october first we're gonna hopefully award the curb contract for in the new budget year so you'll get back to us within the next couple council meetings with some information okay yes and and you'll speak with fred reilly regarding any info i don't know the enforcement issues of how many but you can inform them what there is and see what you know it might just be a letter i mean i don't know you know it might be simple something simple it doesn't have to be a court battle necessarily so no no okay marv did you have anything else it's your topic no it's uh it's just something i've seen there for a while brought it up two years ago and i think it needs to be needs to move forward i would definitely raise property values on the south side as well as the north side and it would help help utilize the parks a little bit because they'll have easier access well thanks for sticking with it and it looks like it will move forward so that's great thank you item number five is discuss oh i'm sorry we didn't have any i don't think we had anybody in the audience who wanted to speak right patty no no okay um item five is discuss line of sight issues also brought up by council member beam mark all right drive driving driving through the city which i've done a couple of times you'll see some bushes that go all the way out to the curb and in a couple and on one in particular on elita it's actually the bushes between two homes are actually covering a fire hydrant so my main concern here is safety if you have somebody backing out of a driveway and it happens to be at dusk early in the morning and you don't see them and you're half asleep yourself doing whatever you're going to do in the morning or evening you may have an accident now there was an accident number years ago on 22nd and the bridge on the north side and again it was people backing out of driveway couldn't see the oncoming traffic and somebody from 22nd street on the end hit that person backing out so it's nothing new but it's a safety issue when you have kids on bicycles or people walking in your back in a car to driveway i know we have warning devices on the cars but sometimes the warning devices pick up trees or they pick up something on the lawn and you may not pay attention and hit somebody backing out of your driveway now i know the people on the end on the cul-de-sacs they would complain they want the bushes to the end but uh that i can understand but you can see those people backing out of your driveway so but the rest of them i think ought to be cut down we have an ordinance for it only we haven't really done anything adhering to that particular ordinance and cutting those bushes down from the lot line to the street and there's one other issue the home on causeway boulevard and gulf boulevard on the south side that corner house that's on the east every time you make a turn on gulf boulevard going north and you try to look south you got to creep out further and further into the walkway when people are crossing to look down for the traffic coming northbound on call boulevard those bushes are overgrown they need to be trimmed back a little bit just another safety issue so again this is code enforcement what do you think we should do about it i would like to speak if it's all right yes um i agree with councilmember beam but i do think uh rather than saying the cul-de-sacs are exempt from it we need to make it a consistent rule where everybody has to follow it um it is very difficult to see in some of these areas to pull out but i think it does need to be consistent with everyone otherwise we're going to have issues with that thank you yeah i'm going to agree with that it we have to be consistent if our if our if our law now doesn't put exception for cul-de-sac we either have to make that exception or we have to and it has to have a good reason obviously which was one was just given um but if not um everybody's subject to the same rules because then we're going to get a you know we're going to get people screaming mayor council member shirley yes jody shirley um yeah lynn what is the current code i know that we currently say what is it four or six feet from the curve that the bushes have to be cut back uh off the top of my head i'll have to look it up but i know it's somewhere in the four to six foot range that they have to be cut back and uh if we're gonna enforce this code then i i agree that we need to enforce it unilaterally we can't just enforce it because they live on a cul-de-sac or wherever it is and uh we just have to tell them you know it's time to trim your bushes but but here's as i recall we have from the curb back we've got that um yeah that's correct by the way he's meant i think it's four or six feet and then i think the bushes from that point can be six feet if i'm not mistaken um four feet four feet to the front four feet to the front of the house there there's that no from not from the front of the house from this from the front setback to the back yes it can be it's it's there's a limitation until you get to the front of the house okay well we need to be clear on that before we you know get too far into discussion on this but um and then and then the one on golf boulevard that he's speaking of i agree that is an issue that entire house is an issue and you know that leads to code enforcement and and i'm just going to bring up a topic that's not on the agenda but we really need to revisit code enforcement so that may be an item for our next um council meeting but uh um i i don't i we need to bring that back in house i don't believe this sheriff is doing what we intended them to do so i know it's a discussion for another time but something that needs to be discussed because clearly that intersection is a problem houses along gulf boulevard their bushes are always overgrown and that corner is a problem and and i would agree uh actually we're going to have a short discussion about that when we get to the budget item just to any other comments on this do we have any citizens nobody no citizens okay so going forward then um what i'll do is i'll i'll look at the code get you that and and uh i'll send it to patty and have her send it out to all of you so you know what it is okay dave gaddis had a question yes i did have a question uh while you're uh giving us a refresher on the code uh for the street would you also give us a refresher on the code for the seawall and for growth up to the sea walls well the up to the sea wall uh five feet from the sea wall it could that i know because it was recent and we've had a couple five foot up to the sea wall they can be at four foot the fence can be at four or six foot and then a hedge from that five feet back can be eight foot back to the to the front of the house which typically is the front set pack okay mark does this take care of all the issues that you have so the only thing i would like to say is if we do anything let's see if we can talk about the cul-de-sacs and the issue they have with privacy because you've got four homes that are jammed up in a cul-de-sac so i think they would complain if some of the bushes had to be cut back and i understand that so if we're going to do anything with the code let's come and have a discussion about what we should do and who should be affected before we go doing anything no so to be sure here no one's saying go forward and empower code right now to enforce we're information gathering at this point and seeing if we could work out a a workable solution that's going to be palatable for everyone affected exactly okay i mean maybe we you know maybe we want to let instead of going to the front of the house all the way to the curb and cutting everything down to four foot maybe you have a consensus maybe go back five feet or six feet as long as you can see a car or a kid on a bike backing out of a driveway you know let's let's not go too drastic or you're gonna have people shooting at us maybe can i just reiterate so what we're doing is lin's looking at the current code as it stands if we decide that the code needs to be altered we're back to we're going to try to spool up another code review and that would then be an item for that code review team to address not we're not going to take these individually are we we can but rather than if unless you want to delay it i think we should let the code review uh take a look at it we're advertising for that now they've got till uh patty correct me if i'm wrong it's like the 25th of september to apply that way hopefully we get some applications and they'll get appointed at the first meeting in october and then we'll start the code review committee and it'll look at more than just this code it's going to look at some other things that we really need to look at very good idea thanks just hold off on any enforcement again if you're going to force it you're going to have to go across the board and then if the chips fall where they may if we want to hold it it's on the radar and it'll be addressed but you may not be able to enforce it for a little while but enforce it against one and force it against all that's the rule basically right unless legal tells you otherwise but i can't imagine he will tell you that i know well well we will as an example if a house sells we're going to tell them what the code is and they need to do it because we don't want the new property owner coming in and saying you didn't do anything about this code no that's that's good that's a good idea that's a good idea okay we finished with that one so item six goes back to the city manager to discuss the fy 2020-21 budget editions and deletions lynn reeves yes uh i sent you out new pages again uh the updated budget message things that have changed in those pages uh we needed to put the the money that we spent this year it's just kind of a transfer back and forth we spent money in developing the stormwater fee which was about 66 000 in total we need to put that into the stormwater fee budget for next year so it will be transferred back to the to the capital projects because we've expensed it this year uh the other thing uh the communications committee has been talking uh about some funding for some of their projects and uh i'd like to recommend that we put five thousand dollars in the budget uh for the communications committee to do things like uh they may come to you and the council approves it if if you don't approve everything then we don't spend it but uh things that they've talked about and uh councilmember gas can echo what i'm talking about i think they've talked about doing a mailing possibly a newsletter trying to update the communications uh our list that we have and looking at other ways to communicate to the residents so there are some options that they're going to be bringing to the console uh they have one more meeting scheduled and uh hopefully they'll have a report for us in september that's correct yes well we're hoping to wrap it up by the end of the month uh to present it at the next council meeting right the other thing is uh tonight you talked with the sheriff and you know i i think we should bring the code enforcement back in uh i've talked to staff about that and uh take that code enforcement money and part of it we could use for possibly hiring a part-time person on the weekend to help with uh you know trash and they could follow around uh the other thing we could use some of that money if if console's desire is to uh use what the sheriff proposed it like on holiday weekends or something we could take some of that money for that and we wouldn't have to impact the budget we did put money for a security screener if we wanted to use it uh at the beach accesses but at this point i don't think we're there yet uh so other than that that's really the only budget changes other than what we've already discussed and uh if the console is okay with adding the 5000 for the communications then that will be the only other change we make and we'll leave the money sitting in code enforcement and go forward with our plan may i speak yes um yeah um city manager lynn reeves i totally agree with you we definitely need to have some money in there for the communications department as well as the other changes that all look good to me and i'm good with it so i just wanted to make sure i made a comment on it thank you for all your hard work anyone else any uh hang on a second any citizens patty no no one no citizens one other thing i'd like to mention mayor yeah uh after the discussion tonight those unless you tell me not to or others tell me not to do that what my intent is to do is uh modify the sheriff's contract take out those things we talked about that we can do ourselves bank deposit uh my suggestion for the console packets instead of delivering them we put a mailbox here if you come up each council member would have a key you get it anytime day or night and one thing going forward we are planning to do the ipads in uh the coming budget year for the council members so uh there might may not be as much paper for you so uh and uh so going forward if you don't have any problem with that uh we will make some adjustments to the contract and then put it on the september 9th meeting morph has a hand up thank glenn gunn mark uh lynn could we just quickly go through the ones that you eliminated yeah contract uh let me grab too many papers mayor manzo yes while lynn's looking jody shirley also has her hand up okay so i have glenn gunn then jody shirley okay the easy ones to get rid of posting at notices at city parks the bank deposits the agenda packets reword this thing about garage sale permits it's not verification of the permits what it is is we provide that to the sheriff if somebody's having a garage sale that way they know that that house has eligibility to park on the street so really it's just a temporary street parking thing but we'll we'll clarify that up with enforcement of the regulations uh i don't think it's a bad idea to leave the enforcement of local ordinances in there i i think the sheriff if he sees something out there especially on weekends and holidays and you know whatever if he sees johnny putting a roof on somebody's house then he should stop and take care of that the house and vacation checks right now we have 22 of them which if you did them every day that'd be 600 visits per month the sheriff only does about 300 a month uh and and maybe we think about it's not as often because they're not done daily i'd say they're done every other day at the most so i don't know what the console's thoughts on them that is either so those are my things that i would take out comments when yes the only thing i'd like to say is once this is signed and changed then give a copy of this to each deputy so that they know that they have to enforce parking and because i don't think half of them know yeah i i i i guess what i am saying we need to streamline the directed patrols too and and get out of you know uh jumping off the cliff before we need to i guess is what i'm saying it's more important to get specific directed patrols as a as opposed to you know shotgun splatter them all over the place i think lynn we i do remember there being some issues with the sheriff not knowing the codes on like enforcement on sundays and stuff like that so we're not trying to make them into a code officer i think now you know maybe that has to be curtailed to you know really the worst violations the stuff that we know about parking on on the grass and you know putting a new roof on on a sunday or something like that but we don't want him saying you know your hedges are too tall i mean i don't know i don't see that you know no no i think our biggest problem on sunday is uh somebody putting a roof or uh what was it a couple sundays ago down the street from jody there was a house that that the commercial painter was there or uh i saw him and i said i wish he would have disclosed up his van because he was inside painting i go back that's now that one was a tough one i'm like the sheriff was out there for an hour you know dealing with that and i'm going the guy's inside the house not disturbing anyone it's a tough one so yeah but but i mean you didn't call or anything but on another street somebody could have called so you know when you see a contractor uh actually uh the house just around the corner from where the mayor lives on a sunday i saw a contractor there one time well it's kind of silly to do it that close to my house because yeah that's not the brightest idea so so you know i stopped and told him i said hey you got to go buddy but yeah he didn't know he complete ignorance on that one lynn although i think jody makes a valid point though if you know if we have i mean i've seen this a couple times you have a person working inside on a sunday they're not bothering anybody maybe they're doing some stain work or some trim work i mean maybe when we go through this code you know a second go round to kind of fine tune it you know maybe we can we don't want i think the whole purpose was to give people a day of peace and and not have the heavy construction i think that was the idea but you know if you're painting inside you're not bothering anybody and and you know i'm with jody on that like i wouldn't i would never call on somebody like that if that's all you're doing you know so and i agree inside stuff forget it and you might have a situation where someone's ac went out yeah they had a water leak on a sunday and you have to you know we we got to define just right on the codes to make it fair for everybody yeah i'm i'm in the process of developing uh what i call a pre-permit application because we're we're struggling uh sometimes with the county about certain things that are supposed to come here so in the pre-permit application we're going to make everything come here to to look at it so we know who's in the city and who's doing the work uh so that that uh form which i'll once i get it finished i'll send it out to you just to show you what i'm talking about doing because uh we've had some issues with homes doing construction after hours at night inside and their their gut in the house and you don't see it until you see it every day i guess so we're we we need to tighten that up a little bit with the county any other comments so can can i make my comment on the sheriff oh i'm sorry jody yeah and then glenn raised his hand afterwards so we have jody shirley then glenn gunn okay so when i agree with your um things you want to remove i think we do need to tighten up the um house checks we talked about that but i noticed on the next page over um item f the marine unit patrol i never see them i i don't know if they actually patrol our waterways but i don't think they do i mean i would think that i'd see a sheriff boat behind my house every once in a while and i don't ever see anyone and then the other thing is item g we have this neighborhood watch you know they're going to work with our neighborhood watch do we have anyone that heads up neighborhood watch and if we don't can we put that position available on um the website so we can kind of look to spool that up and help the sheriff's department rather than always calling them with complaints well what i'll do i'll talk to uh deputy huey she's the neighborhood watch coordinator for the sheriff i know we did have someone i know martha vasquez was in it but she has since moved i don't know if anybody took it over from her and uh it's it's really up to uh what i want to call it i'll call it a street captain or something that you know they have to get the someone on the street has to get the residents together to do that so but holding the signs would have an interest in that pardon maybe the couple that are standing on the street holding the sign because that would be a great opportunity it would be more productive than what they're doing they're not doing anything right now but making a lot of noise well mayor i'm upset because i went out there and you didn't buy me breakfast uh yeah i saw you though i didn't give you a plug i told you that you i don't know what you did and i i know you no one has been successful yet but i don't know what you said so take credit for this even if you didn't do anything he whatever you did you got him to push it back about 15 minutes and that's good i saw you out there but they were beeping away while you were out there but yeah that's a good idea jody will i don't i mean i know there's got to be someone you know older in the community that has a lot of time that wouldn't mind you know organizing a group of people for neighborhood watch and so i'll vote for him for captain of sixth and seventh how's that okay that's all i've got with the contract right now that so you'll that's so we can't of course vote on this tonight it seems like there's no real disagreement um so i would say put it in for the ninth does everybody agree you put it in for the ninth and that's when our first uh official vote on the budget occurs correct right right okay so that's what we're going to do everybody in agreement with that that's what we want lin to do for us right got a thumbs up from marv yes dave yes glenn jodie and rita yes okay we're good and everything till october first right now is going to be virtual so the the governor at least this month did it earlier uh because i i was a little concerned when he said september 1st and we're trying to hold a budget meeting and he said we could hold those virtual but we couldn't hold a council meeting but i think we're good 24 cases in the city so yeah that's good glenn gunn is next i i did have one question uh regarding the budget and we touched upon bringing a code enforcement back in-house yes did we just give uh approval for that or is that a later discussion because i have i think it's a later discussion concerns about that well i have a later discussion well if we're going to use the the money in the code enforcement for possibly the the deputy my suggestion is to bring it back in house but leave that money in code enforcement and uh going forward let's do do a another trial and uh we'll get out and do it in the mornings and uh we'll have more daily coverage than we would currently do and uh i think the staff we we've had this discussion i think it it'll work itself out it doesn't mean that if the council thinks at some point in time we don't need to we need to do something else we can always come back to it but i think this gives us the opportunity to possibly take some of that money and use it for traffic enforcement you know at some point the council is going to have to say yeah let the sheriff give us this two weeks and we need to get some data there though uh because when he did it a year and a half ago there wasn't much data that really came of him spending his time here on that two days that he was here i just wanted to make sure we we've had the discussion on this code enforcement i know you've you've had some rough spots and you haven't been real pleased with where the current situation has been i mean we made this shift from using this off-duty deputy for this thing and we've had some issues with that and i don't think you've been thoroughly enamored with the results of this thing and i know you've looked at it and you think you can actually do the same thing cheaper and you've got some recommendations there i just want to make sure though that the issues we think we've seen or the rough spots isn't because of it just hasn't been structured well enough the accountability hasn't been set because that that's kind of what i'm i'm seeing is that the the lines of communication aren't necessarily there the accountability isn't specific enough the structure isn't enough and that's causing some issues of why we're not happy with it and i just want to make sure and give it a fair shake well right and and i i think we've given it a fair shake the other cons you know i'll be honest with you uh to do something uh then the third time it's time to do something not give them another courtesy warning or something of that nature and and that's where i think this uh deputy discretion has some things that kind of concern me and and that's why i think it's better to bring it back in-house i think we should debate this at a council session and i also think that the code officer should be present um i've spoken with danny um sometimes not a lot i think i've had about two conversations with them since he's been here um but you know like just to that issue that the city manager just mentioned about responding um i believe we had a hot situation that he was like within a couple hundred yards of in our city i mean they were sending cars with sirens and and you know and and lights and he happened to be the first responder uh we didn't pay for him to be a deputy that was actually the bonus that i thought we would have having a deputy going around because he is a uniformed deputy in a car so um i think we you know i don't think we well i don't think it's appropriate to actually make a decision today i hear the points and i think that you know i said we would debate these and i i think we should debate him though but i think this has to come up via either a proposal or a motion or something dual purpose maybe that's the other option because he is an off-duty deputy that's working for us or may i say something real quick jody had his hand up jody's ladies first let's go with jody first and then marv is that all right marv yeah it's fine okay there we go jody you're good sorry i just have on a baseball cap so i don't have my picture up there you guys sorry i can't see you on all it says is jody shirley is talking but that's what it says go ahead um i guess just so we can um when we get go into debate and discussion about that so we know what we're talking about lynn could you please put together like a plan who who would be code enforcement and what does that look like i know there have been a lot of things well this person can do part of it that person can do part of it we can hire someone to collect trash on the weekends that can do part can we really like pin it down who would have what duties so that we can look at it and and make a decision because it's really hard to do that when we don't know what the other side looks like you know what right right place for the other side right okay thank you um i'll i'll say this it's nice to have the extra squad car run around the city enough powers wasn't here as the days that something would happen and i think a lot of people watched who was who was here and when they were there and then worked around it so you know it's it's a kind of a toss you you lose the presence of a officer but you gain you gain more eyes with all the employees you have in the city watching as they meander through the city so it's kind of a toss-up what are you doing anyone else on that topic so lynn um for our september meeting i guess you'll have some information for us on this and if we and if we're gonna and if i think if we're going to debate it then i think it's only fair that that danny be invited he doesn't have to come but he's invited i think that's fair you know yeah i'll discuss that with the sheriff's department okay uh you know if they want danny to come or who who it is because it's really their contract okay all right that takes care of item six and then we go to general business if there's any um i'll just throw it open to the floor i have nothing personally right now so anyone else robin you are muted there you go i'm in the process um question do we have any updates about that sailboat that's randomly moored out in the water right there no and i did talk to uh the county about it and they can do that that that's okay what they consider is waters of the state there's bunches of them over around the uh i'll call it the basin by the boat ramp there's several of them uh so that's unfortunate because it's it's not ours to control okay just curious lynn i know madeira marv i got you next um lynn madeira beach i know passed a whole bunch of ordinances and i don't know if they're legal or not or what they did but i think they kind of sent them packing so how did how were they able to do that do you know no i don't i i can find out i know one community down south uh actually developed a mooring field so they could go there and they collect money off of them so uh i'm pretty sure it was madeira beach i seem to remember and i think that's what actually chased some of them away these may be the people who used to moor over there and now they're coming to us and obviously that's a problem um marv now i've talked to lynn about this our waters go all the way to the intercoastal waterway am i not correct lin our jurisdiction yes our jurisdiction so since we don't have any codes about that and if we put them in would it stick well you know that that's a discussion that we'd have to have further with the water navigation people because i'll give you an example uh uh a person that's building a sea wall the barge they've told me i you know i can't have the sheriff or anybody touch them you know as an example and i know all of you have seen those barges moored as long as they're not touching the sea wall they're they're free and clear but we can ask would the sheriff's marine division know anything about what laws they could use or not use i can ask them that because they're supposed to help us out and patrol our area anyway maybe they could give us some information on what codes we could put in place yeah now we've had a lot of partying going down on that one island i don't know who belongs to it it's ours you're talking about the one at the south end yeah yeah south end that's close to indian rocks beach yeah it's within our city jurisdiction there's a lot of um excitement there once in a while every weekend yeah absolutely that from you marv pardon me that from you yeah not now the boat's not running but good excuse right calm down calm down [Laughter] mayor manzo yes patty um council member shirley yes jody yeah just before we change topics or um just back on that uh the sailboat the city of um key west they have a big issue with votes being mourned and don't move and so yeah they moved a mooring field um off to a confined area and what they're doing to control that is the we the boats have to go to a pumping station weekly and they must have a receipt that they've pumped out so it's back to go into our code and adding some codes and code review and they must be able to move on their own they have to have a working engine doesn't matter if it's a sailboat it has to have an engine and it can operate on its own and so that's how they're they're getting rid of a lot of boats in key west and that's probably what they did in that madeira beach i think you mentioned yeah i think it was madeira yep yeah yeah and then i'll just tell you my general business my last item was um lynn you had mentioned uh paving um bellevue isle of states and i think that a couple of things that you've said a couple of times in in talking about that as you think there's going to be enough money for to do that little patch job on belle isle and pave harrison can you please confirm that before you put it on the agenda so we know what we're what we have for money and if that is a possibility well uh between what's left we've already awarded the contract for the paving for bellevue estates island we will have enough money to do the curb work in uh bellevue estates island uh we needed a little more but it's gonna be in the budget next year so we we already have that quote and it's off of a clearwater contract so we've got that there will be uh if i remember right at 60 plus i want to say another 30 or 40 000 that will have to do belle isle and harrison and those are kind of the those streets are the high priority areas and then as we do storm water projects we will do paving in those areas there's no sense tearing up streets for a stormwater project and then or paving it and then tearing up the street so that's the plan and we did 2021 is that i mean in this this budget yeah this next budget okay i'm looking to see where you landed uh yeah harrison ended up like 25. priority and so was that little section of belle isle that's i'm just and belle isle was the fourth worst uh the others that were above it are set up in stormwater projects so there's no sense paving them uh and uh we'll we'll do some of that you we still have the uh when i talk about stormwater we still have that loan uh to do for the stormwater fee and hopefully all that gets worked here in the next month or so because the attorney told me the bond validation is probably going to be in september okay okay thank you anyone else with any general business that we haven't done glen gunn two issues one is uh the sheriff's officer or his offer for the uh off-duty officer uh two three weeks i mean are we interested in moving in that direction and can we ask the city manager to kind of gather the info on that and see which direction we want to go so we can be prepared to take action at the september council meeting i thought that's what we were going to do is that was my impression at least is that everybody else's i'm getting a lot of nods yes is anybody under a different impression yes i'm good with it but i would like to see the data and the information from what they do during those two weeks and how well it performed if it's worth it or not yeah i agree let's use this as wisely as we can to hit some of these hot spot target things and you know let's see if it makes a difference because i'm i'm not against i think one of the recommendations from our finance committee was we have the money let's spend it if we have to for some of this quality of life issue enforcement so let's turn them loose on this and see what we actually get out of it you know um but i i really guess that's where i'm coming from i'm looking for some structure to this thing not just saying yeah we'll take them for a couple weeks and just turn them loose i mean are there specific areas that we want him to concentrate in and certain days of the week in certain areas i mean give him a a real structure this is what we want not just say okay thanks let us know when he comes aboard and let us know when he goes home yeah i i had in mind you're what you've the first you said which is give them structure give them detail yes and i and i think the other thing we have to watch too is since other people are watching this um we don't hate to lay the game plan out so um we want to be careful with this marv again glenn has the floor so i'm going back to glenn yeah i'm sorry just just one last thing was just an update on the belair shore ordinance issue what's what's the latest on that is there a status or is there progress are we in a holding pattern well i can tell you i've made several phone calls to the to the mayor uh i understand they received a notice of a lawsuit uh from some of our residents and i've gotten no response back from from the mayor uh i think i've already told you i spoke to one of the commissioners uh commissioner bloom and you know he at that point in time uh that was before i was told by the mayor that they received a lawsuit i'm talking the mayor of bellershore and uh i don't know if he went back out of town or what happened but i've left several voicemails and no contact and i i think from what i understand the thing was sent to their attorney so uh i still think there's a better way to do that than tell them you're going to assume but i think we've got a you know i'm going to keep trying to contact them uh and i intend to go to their zoom meeting and hopefully get to speak has there been any enforcement actions no none perfect i'm going to speak as a citizen if the council will recognize me as a citizen am i recognized sure anybody not recognizing me as a citizen okay um i was one of the persons that i told you was going to give him a notice of lawsuit i mean i only speak fact i've given him that notice of lawsuit there they did not respond to me my understanding is there are other citizens who gave him a notice of lawsuit and my understanding is they did not get responded to so at this point the um safe harbor time is over and now it proceeds to lawsuit um they did not even make an attempt to try and work anything out so um and i appreciate sheriff galtieri saying that they've been instructed not to enforce it the problem is it's still a law and it's still enforceable and um if anyone wants to know the history of bel air shore please when you have a chance go into the bell or b and google um mother and daughter arrested for drinking iced coffee on the beach they actually arrested people 15 years or so ago for drinking an iced coffee on the beach and they intended to prosecute it so a law is a law and it's enforceable until it is until it is uh is repealed and so that is a law right now and um you know where it goes from here everybody just have to kind of watch i don't have any anything with the other people the other people the only reason why i have that the other information is the other people that gave me a copy of the letter that they sent as mayor they copied me on it i have no official function with their lawsuit i don't know you know other than they got no response i heard that response that they got nothing back so that's it that's all i can tell you so lynn it sounds like you got the same so okay request to go back as mayor and and just for marv's and the rest of council's information because this is dear to marv's heart we've sent the seawall document to the seawall engineer to review and give us comments so thank you very much as far as the um officer if they come out here i'd like to see him in a regular car just snooping around with no billboard on the side if that's possible and then maybe they'll be able to figure out what's going on because every time they put the suv out there nobody does anything but if you have a plane closed car they might be able to find who's who the speeders are they had some heavy law enforcement going on friday morning at the corner of um causeway and gulf boulevard and i thought perhaps it was in reaction to councilman gattis's comment that he didn't see people on the causeway anymore because boy did they have it they had undercover they had several sheriffs they were pulling them over for well over an hour two hours i i had to go to the doctor i came back they were still hauling them in i don't know what was the trigger point i didn't aim to find out but they had quite a collection of customers dave gaddis they probably uh remembered how much money they used to make off yeah no they were they were doing they do that occasionally they they set up five or six cars here and do speed traffic so it was our side this time a couple months ago it was the other side well they had no shortage of customers i can tell you that anyone else folks well i thank you for mark make a motion that we call it a night i just wanted to thank everybody for a wonderful meeting and uh yes uh anybody second that second we're four hours under our record nobody wants to go for it huh okay no all right then in that everybody in favor say aye hi hi on the 9th of september have a nice safe labor day all right stay healthy everybody everybody"
