    "transcript": "i'm ready okay call the meeting to order thursday august 13th at 20 20 at 6 05 p.m patty will you call the roll please tony gatlas here dave gaddis here kathleen clayton leslie notaro rob risberg michael zable city manager lynn reeves and charlotte demolay hasn't arrived yet okay thank you patty um first item is the approval of the july 30th 2020 meeting minutes now patty and i talked today and there is one question um items four and five on the um meeting tony gatliff arrives at 7 42 and tony clef gatliff was excused at 6 49 which is half an hour before he got there that's on me i i will make a motion to uh amend the minutes and basically what i would like to do is remove uh the uh the part where he departed early that's where i copied uh the prior weeks and just got a hurry and left it on there and uh there was another discrepancy i don't have it in front of me at the moment but uh uh can you tell me what the other one was well there were two item number fours on it which was like that was the other one was the second number four needed to be number five that was the next meeting yes okay okay do we have a motion to approve with those changes uh well i'm making the motion and uh second any other discussion on favor all right opposed okay yes thank you so now that we've uh uh made the motion to a man do we need to uh approve go through with the uh the approval okay so we've amended it um on favor of approving the as amended motions minutes all right all right hi any other discussion on favor opposed okay amended and approved okay um next item in the meeting is our community discussion of committee deliverables and priorities um and i think we've talked about um you know our first step would be a mailing to the property owners to say okay how do you want how do you want to communicate do you want to be on email do you want to be text messages just use the website and so on i think we've got the an updated form of that mailing um and rob you the one who's been doing this mailing no that's tony i'm leaving yeah okay yeah um yeah i was um i um amended it made it larger for uh two couple of reasons to get more information on there but also i believe we're talking about putting that on the website and as opposed to people filling out a postcard and popping it back in the mail with their personal information possibly exposed would access it through the city website or command paul whatever but but but that's one of the reasons why we enlarged it to a full letter sized which it is now what we would maybe send out to the owners is hey guys check the website there's a formula here we're trying to approve this and then have the form on the website yeah i do believe we do need to notify obviously we need to notify the residents homeowners that um there's we're asking for them to do something okay yeah and say you know if you're not uncomfortable filling it out online feel free to either print it out and return it to city hall or stop by city hall and we'll have forums there so i think that you know that would be the first step that we need to do is that trying to figure out what we're going to tell the city council at the next meeting um this is how we how we're going to get them um aware that we're doing this and i think this it would have a minimal impact on city staff it's not like we're calling everybody um you know the only real cost for this is to send out the a postcard mailing saying hey check the website i would think that the the first thing that we would want to to provide to the council is the strategy here's the strategy that we came up with which includes the types of information that should be uh communicated to this residents of the city the frequency of commute of that communication and then the recommended means of communication and lay that all out first and then start getting into okay then the next step is the postcard and establishing a facebook page and making the website um you know whatever we want to add to the website the steps that would flow in order to execute the strategy okay there was the next on my list maybe we're just i'm just doing it backwards but and the strategy would be the the excel spreadsheet that we've got about safety issues city meetings status of infrastructure and so on right that would be the first set of deliverables which is the what and uh and and basically uh whenever this is presented to the council uh are what are we doing are we just presenting this in a paper format and then you're not a paper format but in a pdf or something of our report and then you will give the uh the summary uh in in the next council meeting because i'm trying to figure out how i i guess as secretary i'm supposed to compile this data so i'm going to need several pieces of data from uh from everyone that that has drawn up we have this uh uh what list which i may have the very latest but i may not so i need to confirm that um and then the how uh that that one we've we have several things that we've discussed but we haven't really made a formal list of how we're going to do it uh the the third piece of it is the metrics of how do we measure the effectiveness of what we're doing and that's where i'm really struggling is people generally don't give direct feedback on something lynn whenever you send out a letter or a postcard to the entire city how many replies do you get back just in general it's uh you hear me yes okay uh well we haven't really asked for a reply back on anything uh other than the undergrounding project and we got much less than 10 percent of return on that so we haven't really sent anything to ask for them to do something this is my struggle with that that last part of it is that okay i i don't want the council to come back and say that what we're doing is a waste of time if people don't respond and give feedback to every piece of information that we deliver to them i think it's our job to to decide what we should hand off to the community and how we're going to get it to them but you you can't force people to respond and that's the only way you can measure what you know whether they got the message or even if they if it's stuck with them sadly the people that respond to the people who are unhappy i mean you can you can measure some things if the city establishes a facebook page you can get stats reported how many people liked it and those kinds of things i'm sure there's a way to track how many people uh visit various parts of the city's website uh yeah it looks like that but you're right you know you're not going to get feedback uh except for usually the people who are very happy about something or very angry about something and yeah i usually get the outliers um one thing i'd caution is you have to manage their expectations by setting the ground rules for them in other words that touchstone specifically about the ten percent on basically a very divisive issue you know you state that going in it said historically for a divisive issue we faced 10 penetration and this is how it was measured um going forward we know we have to improve on it but you know keep in mind historical perspective that we don't anticipate overnight 100 penetration into the market that based on our uh previous attempt you know ten percent look an increase of two four or five percent is a welcome addition and keep in mind it's incremental over time as the service improves people will be more and more willing to participate and what the the three mediums that we can absolutely gauge as um whether they're whether they're actually reading it or not is whether they're receiving it is emails like constant contact uh text and then and then robocalls and those three things we can definitely see reports lynn right correct me if i'm wrong but you get reports back on the success of constant contact right i demonstrated uh a week or two ago whenever it was um with with the robo calls or the text messages you get a report of who's getting those also and in most cases if they don't want them they opt out or they they make a phone call an angry phone call and say i don't want these anymore get me off your list but at least with those three mediums we know that they are at least getting the message whether they actually do anything with it or not is another story yeah a good example would be we did a survey on constant contact a couple years ago out but we only received responses from about 110 people well there again that's less than 10 percent of the population even if we said you know it's only a thousand people it's still about ten percent and uh recently we had to send letters out to the uh repetitive loss homes in the city i got three responses back from 60 letters so it's like i said it's just uh the nature you know they get the information but you know they may not have any interest beyond getting the information yeah i think it's like mike said when you brief the council you just gotta set the expectations properly you're not going to get a lot of feedback on the vast majority of the information you share with the residents and you can't see that as a failure like lynn said 60 people got their letters you know they all got them but only three but you know felt motivated to write back our first indication is going to be when we send out this postcard saying you know never to improve and increase the communications do you want to be contacted by email text message whatever and we'll see how many people respond to that you know that's going to be our first some people you know they're very happy with what's going on they don't feel a need to compete be communicated with or otherwise to communicate so i think that will be our first indication of you know this the communication issue how successful is it that's still not a very realistic uh measure because of the fact that even though you're mailing out something it doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to respond because it's not easy uh it requires effort uh so we have to we have to provide them a link on the website uh with that with the identical form uh you know basically we already have an email list it's not the best in the world but it's functional and and so we can send the link out in that email requesting people i think the the more ways we can figure out initially to get people to sign up for this uh the more response we're gonna get but if you have to take a piece of paper and then go over and and and physically type in a url to get to an email form versus you're looking at facebook or something and there's a link right there well that's insta and that's the way people respond nowadays to things uh so uh if if we do you know we can't expect just the mailer to get to get enough response we're gonna have to attack it in every way possible on the first on the first attempt um i think it's going to be important to make the council understand that um they they want to improve communications i think everybody on the city council have made that very clear they definitely want to improve communications and so they're just going to have to do it and not worry about well we're only hearing back from 10 of the people because you're just not going to hear back from more than that but don't let that be the reason to not push communications out you're just gonna have to accept it yeah i think i think you'll see um some feedback will be on that important city topics stormwater issues stuff like that and that will where that will reveal itself is at meetings with you know they'll have a greater attendance perhaps it would be it virtual or in person that could be the type of feedback that they'll end up getting but you know if you send out something you know hey there's going to be a hot dog thing in the park well you're not no one's going to respond to that you know but for the important things people will come to meetings or sign in to them and i think we track that blind do we do we track those do you know when people have signed in to view a city meeting yeah we we we can get those statistics from the clicks on the the website we we get that information it's it's the same as we get the on constant contact we get the the click turn around how many people actually open the email uh but there again 300 could open the email and 100 said something so you can't i don't think you can base it on the response that's that's the really the problem you you have more avenues to put stuff out like click send we add the facebook page and attach it to the website uh we offer this we try to rebuild our uh constant contact list and you know that that may be in itself a way to clean that constant contact list up and say hey we're going to do away with this list if you want to still be contacted please you know go on the website update send us your email and that way it's more of a verification that they actually live in the city so i i think those we still do flood facts and you know maybe a couple times a year we do some type of paper newsletter i mean so those are you can communicate with everyone but responding to the communication you know as as i think all of you understand the only way to measure that is uh to me is the clicks on the website or the stuff that we send out with click click send how many people actually opened it that's you aren't going to be able to say because they didn't respond uh that you know going forward that's how you're going to have to measure it there's no other way yeah realistic to think that um we're going to get they're going to get the res some response more than that minimal um that we're talking about so it's it's a matter of you push that information out out there to them if we're if we're good at that that that's that's about all you you can do but i wouldn't agree with rob they shouldn't um this the council shouldn't decide well if we're not going to get a feedback why should we do it well i think you do it um because it is getting out there there it's it's going to be in front of them they're going to read it whether they choose to respond show up in a meeting whatever will be up to them but the city would have done their job in getting that information that important information to its residents well communication is one way or two way and it looks like we might have more success with one-way communication rather than two-way and that's still good sure well that's still i i kind of disagree with that i think actually um leaving a method on the website where you can drop off your comment is uh is much more convenient and and much uh more friendly for most people these days rather than picking up the phone and making a phone call and either leaving a voicemail or asking to speak to lynn i i think that that's that's the piece of uh that we've been missing is is a way that they can electronically send a message at their convenience it can be the middle of the night early in the morning whatever and and then lynn or whoever reads it at their uh at their convenience and uh and then they can decide whether they want to respond back or not but at least that way it's not hard it's not hard to leave a message with with the city and uh some something else i thought of also another way it seems to me right now the most popular uh communication method we have and the way that people are catching up is is after the fact on youtube videos and you know i'm wondering uh i don't know how we're how we're actually delivering the video to youtube now if it's edited at all or if we're just taking raw footage and and throwing it into youtube but there should be some way that during the entire length of every video and audio recording that we place on youtube we should have a link or or a blurb that says click the link below to join our email list and uh and and so you know it's another way i bet more people watch our youtube videos than they ever go to our website lynn do you have any insight on that well i don't know click-wise i i think probably more people go to the website than they could click with the the videos on youtube i know over the years and i'm just giving you history now but over the years uh that's part of the reason that we went away from the television and the tv and stuff like that because we weren't getting any viewership i guess or it was very minimalistic and uh i'm sure you know certain people have different ways to look at things they'll go to the website and that's not to say we can't put that link on the youtube thing at the bottom i don't know that we're with the zoom meetings right now we're recording them and then putting them up the next day so uh i know that victor when he records the meeting he does some editing to kind of clean it up so the voices and sound is is better uh but he he does that and it takes a few days to do that after the meeting but i don't think it's a problem in person meetings right right right this this is like you know immediate yeah and i have talked to victor about even streaming the meeting live and indian rocks is doing a test on that right now they've done it a couple times yeah it requires another piece of software to make it all work but it does work so we're we're basically going to to set some realistic expectations on the metrics uh that honestly i think the the best measurement is people not complaining about communications anymore because if we give them every method possible and it's out there all you have to do is join sign up uh we're posting things on youtube we've got forms on the website we've got a you know a delivery method on facebook and we offer texting and robo calls there is there should never be a complaint at least about communication but i think you're setting yourself up for disappointment if that's your measurement because people are going to complain no matter what well that's what you could hand deliver the message to the faith and you're still going to get people complaining i think your the other big thing of feedback is just going to be you know all the things we've already talked about but then it's just going to be lynn in his interactions with people around the city and each of the council members with their interactions with people around the city if they seem to know more if they have heard about an issue if they've done things you know even if they've never responded to anything you're going to get all that anecdotal type of feedback that's going to tell you about whether your message is going out or not yeah there are two kinds of communications i mean are they complaining about what we're communicating that we're not communicating with them or are they complaining about what we're communicating you know they don't like the message they did get the message but they don't like the message if you know what i mean the substance versus the fact that they got the communication i don't like the message sometimes if you understand the distinction [Laughter] one other thing i hope that that the committee needs to resolve we've been talking about a digital sign at city hall and uh that that was we talked about it at the first meeting and i have a a short video that kind of gives you what it would look like but it would fit in to the current sign the only difference was would be it would be digital which gives us more opportunity to put more messaging up there uh and people continually tell us that i can't read your sign right so uh and you know i know dave's heard it and i've heard it probably more than any of you but that's that's uh uh something you know it's it's been put in the budget and we need a recommendation from the committee to say do you want to do that or it's not a good idea just leave it as it is uh but if you patty can you this i'll just show you a picture and you're gonna see it basically all it has is text on it and uh let me see if i can get this back up here we played with it and uh come on what do i need to do then do you see it no no so minimize the video then go to your uh to the the us as a group and it says share screen yeah i did do that okay and so you're not sharing anything yet let's you see it now yeah i do now okay well this this is the type of digitization the waviness you see in it's because we they took a video of it for us uh darn it it's not very long but what what we're proposing to do is put this type of digital sign in the existing sign that's at city hall and basically take out the letters that are there because it would be more visible and at the same time i think people catch better eyesight with something moving as opposed to uh something that just sits there you know with a line but yeah we get we we get a lot of complaints uh so this is just a uh idea and going forward you know i don't know what your thoughts are lynn i think i mean i remember very well that council meeting where you know that was up and you had people came out of the woodwork to uh that was when it was on gulf boulevard right and i think that was the big fear everybody thought this was going to be on gulf boulevard or right there at the little park on the corner of the of the gulf boulevard and the causeway and it just turned everybody off that what video you just showed looks good to me i mean i i am in favor of a sign that is more easily readable which you can't do as you drive past that uh building very often so i think if you show that video you you'll allay a lot of the fears that people had yeah and most of the people at that meeting they didn't have a problem with it being at city hall they just didn't want it on gulf boulevard at that time i think we had a little design art in it too and they didn't like that either as opposed to just a very basic one that you've shown now how does that affect traffic going by i mean if you put like city council meeting such and such a time committee meetings such and such a time workshop such and such a time is it going to have any effect on traffic going over the causeway there there are signs out there this is just a way actually it's a way to put more information up there in in essence because you you can rotate it you know with okay today i think that sign said coveted and then it said something else and whatever so i don't think that's a you know those signs are out there everywhere i just think the number of issues we or we hear from people is i can't read your sign i can't read your sign well we changed a lot of the blue lettering instead of going out and trying to buy new signs we we went to you know it's a mixture of black and blue to give some contrast to it but it's still the same situation we still hear it i i have a recommendation uh that i'd like to make if everybody's okay with that um basically there there's two problems with the sign where it is right now number one the lettering is behind a glass and is recessed okay so that makes it makes it hard to read and uh as you get closer to it the the edge of the sign because it's sort of in a like in a box so as you get closer to it all of a sudden everything's flat and you can't see anything um you're going to if we went this route the glass would be gone is that correct lin yeah there there's no glass now there's no glass cover okay but it's it sits back yeah yeah so what would happen is this would basically sit on this frame uh because that's what we went to to look at but would it be further out than what it is currently oh yeah yeah it would it would be basically it would be attached to the frame the posts on both sides okay because the the the two problems that i have is is number one it's it's it's in it's set in right so it's sort of like a shadow box and then number two is it's uh way off the road uh so uh all along i have thought that really it needed to be a v-shape and in other words that whole that whole monument sign uh design should really have been a v or a triangle so that whenever people are riding by because it's it sets back off the road it's easier to read if it's facing people so what i'd like to propose is that we propose going with a sign with that sign and if it doesn't still is not readable after the fact will then we save the hardware and rebuild the actual base that that contains it so that it is more of a v-shape and it's you know as you're riding down the road it's more facing the car rather than you're sort of trying to look it's just really hard to read at the angle that it's at does anyone have any feedback i think it needs to be higher as well so we don't think fine is a good idea and i think you're right it'd be nice if it was angled out a little bit i didn't it didn't catch the v thing at first but not sure i'm saying now but yeah if it's pulled out a little bit it'll be easier to see um you know someone's still going to complain because they're going to you know complain that they they missed the change when it said told them something something else but at least it will be more visible that mobility site that lens showed us that's very readable i've been by that site and you know that's we've seen those signs all over the place um they are they're very you can you can glance at them and quickly see what's there um but yeah it's i mean if it needs to be adjusted for height because it is low right now it's it's set fairly low i don't know if it's at the driver's eye sight or not um kind of feels like it's down in to memory but we're let's go drive by tomorrow and see i think the v-shape will give you more time to read the sign too because the way it is now you've got a real short period of time where you can read that sign that's a good idea yeah i agree and lynn when you when you you know if it gets approved and you go to do it maybe you can even build some of the into it without major reconstruction of that that whole site right yeah we may be able to you know do something the the major cost is the the digital boards basically that's that's the cost and like i said we were trying to reuse what's there and maybe we can do some kind of angle off of that sign somehow that you could actually maybe it doesn't have to be a v-shape it could be built as a a v off of the sign you know kind of trying to swing it out and adjust the roof of the sign that might work you know as as far as maybe on the back side of the sign i'm just going to use this as simplistic maybe if we put some kind of block or build out at the back side you're pushing that backside out and it ends up in a v anyway that that may be a possibility i don't know for sure yeah i would imagine that the sign people this isn't the first this wouldn't be the first time they've heard they've heard this and they probably have something that fits that description yeah some kind of bracket that you can suggest well i'm in favor of your idea there dave so do we have to vote and put it on the list or what we reworked the sign by city hall whether we designed it to a v-shape put a v a video sign or whatever but we redesigned it and maybe reposition it a bit so that it is more um visible as you're driving by is that what we're looking at that's it thank you everybody in favor of that yep yep okay um do we want to uh if that is going to be one of our recommendations do we want to add that onto the spreadsheet in the how to communicate column where in for uh you know city meetings and some of those types of uh blocks of information we want to add the digital sign as well yes yeah we do matter of fact i'm surprised that we didn't already have it on there on the city meetings we put up on the city hall sign so i i don't know if if everyone had the chance to attend or or at least watch the video of the last council meeting but uh it was brought up in the meeting to to use some of our nastag to push this project forward i don't think an actual number was established but i think that overall it was a it was a unanimous decision to uh to to to spend some money on communications is that is that what you got out of this lynn yes yeah okay so um i i think it's it's uh a very realistic um you know a goal to to replace the sign that that's not an issue also they like the idea of the click send they didn't have a problem with that uh the facebook page even it's it's running now uh but it is yes there we have one that's it's online right now um the city city ran fake facebook or the uh it's a city ran facebook page yeah yeah it says official because there's bel air beach facebook pages and different people have them so uh and we've got the the uh add-on to the website where whatever we put on the website in announcements we can move it to facebook the only thing that and dave and i have talked about it and kyle and i have talked about it the only pro the only thing that is a little bit of a concern is we do not want to get into a response from facebook and people can put stuff on there and you can limit their uh what they put on there with you know filling up this this uh section and dave can probably explain it better to me but you know using words like the and this and that and what have you you say they can't post something like that but uh there is no way not to allow a person to post on there you can uh what do you want to call it dave um it's it's basically it's a work around and working what it is is um it's it's basically a filter mechanism so let's say that uh you have a list of naughty words uh that you don't allow so what happens is they're able to drop a comment but it's invisible to everyone so they drop it but no one can see it and and basically the city does not respond to any any responses whatsoever so it may show that we have three or four comments but nobody can see anything because every word possible is on the naughty list so unless you're writing in some strange gibberish code their comments are not publicly viewable uh i don't know if that was implemented or not but but i did review it yeah kyle about how it works yeah we we put a bunch of words in there and it's gonna you know you may add words to it over time but it's it's to start we've got a basic amount of words that put in there when you say the city can respond are we talking about the city staff no we we don't want to respond it's one-way communication and basically if we try to block it if we we just add enough words in there to where you can't make a sentence take words out like a and the him her mayor council you know the things that people are going to say about bel air beach and those types of comments and they're just dropped immediately uh they're they're they're there but because it's one-way communication it's just a comment and we're not doing anything with it uh and uh that's that's i mean honestly there's so many other city and county and state governments that have facebook pages i don't know what they're doing if they're just not responding and just allowing the comments to roll in i really don't know but this is the only way possible to uh to actually have that presence to where we can again uh drop a one-way message and if people wander up on this page or they go to it often they're gonna see the same content that we're pushing on our one one-way website also it's just another it's another form that they're probably already walking around with and because they live in bel air beach they're gonna see uh you know uh relative uh communication going at the top of their facebook page which they'll see on their phone they log in on their computer whatever whereas the website the city website they have to physically go there and go looking for it but most of the people that use facebook are already on facebook they're checking it all day long seeing what their friends are up to and bang we're at the top of the list because they live in bel air beach every time something's posted and my question is what i'm not sure i understand what a fate having a facebook page adds to what we have on our city website it's the same information well it gives a it's another avenue to communicate i mean people some people will go to the website you know me personally i'd probably go to the website because i'm i'm old and i don't really get into facebook but you know other people that are out there uh you know dave's young he probably got 10 facebook pages i don't know but i'm just saying you know he he probably post to facebook you know uh but that that's just a preference of people it's it's another way to communicate to someone and that's i thought that was the mission of this group was to find other avenues to communicate other than just what we've been doing was there any discussion of making it a a site where you have to private site where you have to request to join to try to limit the people on here to residents and owners as opposed to that because then it no longer be public okay yeah i think i'm sure a lot of you guys are on this call next door where we're getting all of these comments now most many of which are not all that nice you know i don't want to get it i'm afraid of getting into that arena yeah would you we absolutely should not get into that i think you know the idea of not having any sort of response is excellent having the ability to maybe the city's website send a note to lynn uh that when you do click send on that it's not posted on the website you know it goes right to land and it's a confidential message in essence is um just fine but yeah certainly no back and forth that's that's that's the recipe right that'll fall apart in a week well see the problem with responding and or offering a response at all is now you have to maintain the records this way if all you're doing is outputting information and it's a no reply no response then we're not required to maintain public record there you go yeah that that's an important part of it you know the not having to retain that you know we're just getting out information to someone we don't run into sunshine law issues no no um so going back to the what needs to be delivered i think the uh that matrix that rob set up is excellent yes yeah um i mean i think that's something you can definitely present to the council it's easy to understand it's it's it's complete i think it's completely the update of that sign we're gonna add the sign to it add the sign to it yeah well that was the that was the uh uh how that's that's different than the oh yeah correct it's under the helicopter right yeah yeah um do you want to add it to into every category of the information i think it really only fits into the priority two stuff the city council meetings type stuff right i would say no more than what we're currently doing um uh maybe the uh you know in in special cases where six feet distance on the beach you know those kind of things uh you know public service announcements and when are our next what's the next meetings pretty much exactly what we're doing now yeah okay so i'll i'll add that into that column um for city meetings right city hall sign for yeah and that may expand down the road depending on how the sign goes and people's response and the ease of it yeah now i i'm going to go ahead and say this at the last meeting um when leslie uh presented um you know what we were up to and where we were in in these discussions i will say that she didn't give facebook a fair shake and she she kind of voiced her opinion to the council that she didn't like that idea but i didn't think i didn't think that that's what this this committee had agreed upon and so i'm going to respectfully request that whatever this committee agrees upon that's the message that should be delivered and then during uh citizen comments that should be where you voice your own opinion but as it can if we reach a consensus on something or a majority that's really what needs to be presented i agree whatever and the same would go for the uh the written report that we're going to provide the city council in these documents i would hope that we all get to review them and make sure that we all agree that it's an accurately accurately captures what we discussed and what we recommend before it gets presented absolutely concur robert and dave uh absolutely 100 with you well if that's the case and we were trying to wrap this up by the next meeting uh the the next meeting is is postponed until the ninth is that right it's not not postponed that's just the first because it's because of a holiday and uh because it's our first public hearing for the budget that's why it's on a wednesday oh uh well what about our council meeting that's your council meeting at the same time on the ninth of september i will try to get together a report with you know all these things and get it out to everyone within the next week and get it to you before the um obviously before the night the meeting on september 9th well what we'll have to do is we will have if we're going to review this and then decide whether this is if there's anything we like or dislike we will have to have one more meeting uh there we can't we can't communicate about this individually even if we send it to patty that that'll be communicating our back you know we we have to right we can you can send it out and we'll all review it independently but we're going to have to have one more meeting just to say yeah we agree even if it's a five-minute meeting right when we we get the report uh you know we will patty will send it out to everyone and then if anyone wants to provide feedback back to patty or myself that's fine and then we can collect all that stuff and have it for the next meeting to make it i'll say simpler in the end so we would provide that at that meeting for everyone and then it would probably wouldn't be very long right okay so uh so rob you are you're basically maintaining the list of uh what and how is that right yeah it's got um what when and how the three big things they asked okay right all right well that makes our job easy yeah all right and then once we receive that list we also need to agree upon how we're going to present the lower your expectations for a measurement matrix i will i will try to write something up on this and uh and then i will submit it also to patty uh to to pass to everyone uh remember don't respond back directly to me and uh uh and then whenever we uh meet it at the next meeting then we'll we'll shore all this up and have it ready to go um for the city council purposes do you need me to to manipulate that that postcard letter to include the sign yeah go ahead yeah that would probably be you know just to add that to it just so all together yeah okay i had uh one suggestion on that postcard or may well now it's a piece of paper but down at the bottom you had name address phone number the phone number was optional uh and but above that we had would you rather have a a like a voicemail um and i noticed in text there was a phone number blank but in voicemail there wasn't and uh down underneath it says optional so what if they check that box but they don't put anything in the optional box uh it might not be a bad idea just to add a blank that goes along with the i would prefer to have a robo call okay just seem to see how many people actually vote for robo calls [Music] go with the 50 i got today i i don't know but i'm gonna have to renew my my car warranty because it's it's out it's oh have you done your last call perhaps i'll stop calling if you do renew it they'll get you on tv dave [Laughter] not in a good way so what date are we looking at for the next uh we're just looking for um thursday's 27th yeah does that work uh let me see here double checking yep that works for me august 27 yes yes yep when yeah patty patty won't be here but we'll work it out that's good i agree if we do it on on thursday the 27th then that would if for whatever reason we have more things we need to fix that would still give us another week yeah before the council meeting to do that right my goal is to wrap this up if we could wrap this up that would be awesome and uh uh honestly we should be able to agree on what amendments we make to the compiled data and uh vote on it and and be done with it and uh and is there a um a prescribed format for the report linda is the council you know do all these committees report in the same format no they just try to follow kind of what your charter is you know and you you've got that set up so that's that's fine okay i mean i just uh was scribbling some notes to myself here and so if if there is not a format that we must use and i would kind of see a report you know obviously it starts with an intro that recaps what the council asked us to do gives the you know we met x number of times on these dates type of thing so that's part of the record and then the next piece would be a summary of this the strategy we kind of summarize what's on the spreadsheet and reference the spreadsheet which would be attached to this report the third paragraph will be the list of the no kidding recommendations recommend you do this this this and this fourth paragraph just kind of closes it all up and this thanks for the opportunity and then the attachments to the report would be the the spreadsheet the postcard and then the information on the various systems and i'll give you you know you presented us info on it on the texting system and on an audio system um so any of that stuff i would think would just be attachments to the report so they could see those things that make sense yeah that sounds good are we gonna put monetary costs for these ideas as well to include the sign changes lin do you have a you have the quote on that right yeah we have the quote on the the digital portion of it and we uh you know to make minor adjustments i think based on our current budget that we're going into next year with we'll have enough funds to modify it in whatever way we need to this is all ballpark anyway it's the best guess not until you get right down into doing exactly what you want to do or you're going to get the best cost so i think that's perfect yeah i think outside of the sign anything that we've um are looking at is fairly cost conscious so i don't i don't see one of the things i think we have to put in there is impact on city staff you know is this going to double somebody's workload are we going to have to hire somebody else to do this you know that sort of thing right that that monetary impact well initially i think the the initial portion is kind of a moot point until we see where we're going in the end you know it it may be more of an impact but uh what we'll do we will maybe have to add of you know i don't know five thousand dollars if we want to do a couple mailings and this that and the other to the to the budget because really this really wouldn't start till probably after october first some of the things we could go ahead and you know we're doing already trying to get the facebook situated so it works uh you know we've gotta ask a question to the manager on the website already we might need to do some things with uh but those are things that are not going to cost us anything that's just some some time but if we're going to mail a newsletter a couple times a year then there is a cost associated with that because it has to be set up for a printer to print it and for us to mail it uh and click send i don't think that cost is a great amount uh from what dave's told me no it's it's relatively inexpensive yeah so so we'll just uh you know have that actually dave will since we're going to have our last budget work session i'll i'll just bring that stuff up in the work session that we need to put a little money aside for the committee what do you anticipate the the cost will be to i don't know how our website is maintained or or who who actually does the behind the scenes work i know that right now it's set up to where uh we can update content in the house but whenever it comes to something like adding a form to the web page that may be a little more in depth in what yeah but it's a it's a negligible cost yeah we i think to add the i forget what they call it but uh to add the thing with the contact to the facebook they call it something but i don't remember what it is off top of my head but uh i think that costs us like 15 or something it's it's not a great expense okay what uh what i was talking about is the database that we're going where we're going to be collecting names addresses phone numbers yeah that's uh we'll find that out for you i'll find out so so basically the way i see it is you're going to take the form that tony has is the mailer if you just handle that and say i want a digital version of this and i would like to be able to export the list at any given time uh i think that that would be sufficient uh does everyone agree yeah and it's gonna have like a thousand entries max you know that's it just give them some idea of what sort of size we're looking at yeah that they'll get i don't think they're going to tell us i think they're going to more tell us to create this and make it go to a spreadsheet it'll cost you 50 bucks or something i don't i don't know what that is okay yeah all right so i what i'm going to submit is i'm i'm going to uh submit to patty basically the technical things that we've discussed and and basically what the cost if if i know what that is and if there's any overhead or [Music] labor involved additional labor for the city and how it would be done just basically a brief summary of one of each one of the technical additions that we would like to to uh for the council to consider um is there let's see then there was something oh yeah and then i'm going to also write up the uh lower your expectations paragraph i just uh and i will send that information on is there anything else i'm supposed to send no in that line i will uh i'll update the spreadsheet and i will also uh type up this recommended um outline of the report and i will send that all out to you or through patty as well okay and what else is there anything else and tony you're going to update the form right yeah i'll update the form as we discussed so you're actually writing the summary report rob well what i was going to do first was send out the outline of that report so that we can agree and then we probably ought to do a little division of labor and who's going to put together the various pieces of it so we can bring it all together so the things that i'm going to give to you uh are basically what i i think should what i'd like to see is is i'm going to send you bits and pieces of information tony's going to send you something you have the spreadsheet i'm hoping that that between all of that we can come up with something that's close um does that is that asking too much or do you think that that uh or or would you rather divide it up somehow uh well i mean i'll give it a shot i'll send out the i can send out the outline pretty quickly but then as we start putting it back together if you want me to assemble it uh and massage it a little bit and produce a full draft for us to look at sure i'll give that shot okay because basically if you can hold that and let us just send you this stuff and then you send out your your rough draft well then we can beat it up at the next meeting and and then agree on maybe the final format but maybe we just hash it out line for line and be done with it okay my goal i'm hoping we can accomplish this is is have one more meeting and that's the next one and and then we're done and we can say high five each other and we've knocked it out and and uh then it's up to the council to to act upon it remember we're not we're not going to get feedback we're going to get a thank you and we appreciate your efforts and that's that's all we're going to get and it'll be up to the council the feedback will be whether they actually do anything with it or not any other comments issues yes no no i think i've got plenty to go on from here okay all right then um next meeting will be on the road down here somewhere 27 motion to adjourn second i can't second i'm sure okay all in favor you're not in favor have a nice time good night thanks see you guys"
