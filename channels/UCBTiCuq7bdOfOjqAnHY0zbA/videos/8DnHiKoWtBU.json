    "transcript": "[Music] good evening everyone welcome to the monday february 7th regular city council meeting with the city of bel air beach please join me in the pledge of allegiance please rods please call council member robin aki here councilmember frank banker council member glenn gunn councilmember leslie otero vice mayor dave gattis mayor joseph manzo city manager lynn reeves and council member rita smoke was unable to attend hey thank you madam court ladies and gentlemen i just want to i'm going to have him introduce himself a little bit later but the distinguished gentleman here sitting next to lynn reeves is andrew salzman he's our city attorney he's standing in right now and we appreciate you being here andrew in a couple seconds i'll just give you a chance to introduce yourself when we come to the city attorney's spot okay thank you okay so first uh item of business is the approval of the agenda may i have a motion please a second second second by leslie dontero any discussion yes yes from banker i think my mike's work my wife's been trying this out anyway i requested that our submitted resolution back in december i missed the uh day or two and i submitted it again before the court sessions what i'm saying is the resolution made at this point does it drive uh um i know that the city manager and uh city attorney riley did discuss that so city manager yeah fred and i met but we could go last friday and of course everyone knows he's going through he looked at it and he thought it needed to be an ordinance instead of a resolution because it's changing uh addressing city council so he what he he does have it it's just uh he's kind of been detained the last few days he's looking at that plus section 94. he's going to finish those things up for us he already told me that well the resolution was clearly just was for when our citizens and press council instead of the council have to vote whether we can address them back resolution would just give us the opportunity under our free speech to address the citizens lots of times these citizens have to stand here stay here all night long until council you know interacts with them or gives comments so i figured hey let's wait to the people now i've heard what some people say it might take all night we have to do it but if you serve on council then you should stick to them i don't know why it would have to be a resolution or i mean i don't know why we'd have to be i think it and i'm not haven't seen your resolution but i think if i understand what you just said correctly um right now in our ordinance it prohibits us to have a back and forth dialogue citizens so to change in work means you have to use a modification on the ordinance so it's in order to change which means one vote a publication one vote a publication a padding a newspaper and then a second vote and that's when essentially charges but what we can do i mean this should be addressed i you know i don't want it to just be tabled for you know or not forever so if we can get this addressed in the meantime um [Music] [Music] you know a reasonable discussion but we can't have you know suggestion rather than change the agenda why don't we just bring it up in comments or unfinished business right that's okay we will and then um [Music] test all right welcome robin 605 rabinaki's present now um all right so any other comments on the agenda citizens any comments counsel all in favor of approving the agenda as is i all right anyone of those this passes we have six people here six to zero next comes citizens comments each person may come up and address the council on any item that is not on our agenda if it's on our agenda i'll call you later to speak on that item when you come up please come right up here to the podium give us your name and address and please observe the rules of conduct they're on that podium and they're all around in a nutshell basically just speak in a nice civil manner and that's the kind of reception you get back with that does anybody [Music] debbie well i live at 115 causeway boulevard it's not really addressing council so to speak but i just wanted to commend patty on her handling of all of the paperwork for the election and things she's i think done a fabulous job and she just gets things out so quickly and i know that's part of her job but it's not part of her everyday job and so it's on top of what she has to do every day so i just on behalf of hopefully all the citizens of bellar beach i just wanted to say thank you to patty thank you thank you other citizen comments there being no others on the closest comments at this time we have the presentation by the pinellas county sheriff's office we have law enforcement and code enforcement i say we have two deputies here so deputy mayor law enforcement sergeant enforcement i'm sorry do you want law enforcement or code enforcement first they both were good for the month i think so i think they worked well county sheriff's office the analysis that i'm going to present is going to be for the month of december 2021. it looks like the ucr reporting crimes we only had one assault which through my research was a domestic related incident there were a total of nine people arrested in there for that month and most of those arrests came from traffic related stops of the deputy activity leading that were 195 traffic stops directed patrols throughout the city of 116 for the month and traffic control of 52. were five crashes in the city and the majority looked like they were right here at the intersection of gulf and causeway and somewhere on the bridge and then there were a total of 243 citations and warnings issued and i had to break down here i went ahead and took a look at that of the 243 two were boating citations there were 24 traffic citations issued 22 parking citations and the rest were warnings of a total of 195 markets and that's all i have for you sergeant um we've been speaking quite a bit and i know frank banker's personal interest on the whole safety issue do you know anything about those boating incidents i don't i was assigned to the marine unit back in the early 2000s and a lot of it is just traffic or boating safety enforcement out there usually the intracoastal waterway just looking for safety inspections whatnot obviously speed zone violations wake zone violations maybe fish and license violations etc well this is another excellent month and congratulations to the anyone who patrolled here and all the citizens who keep their eyes open i did know that today just came through the sheriff they have the county has reporting where you can sign up for any citizen you can i noticed there was two burglaries they were out in both boulevard areas so i'm just guessing it's probably the same old routine stuff where people are going in cars so i don't know if you're seeing any more of the you know lifts you know what they call the lift-ups or whatever where people are lifting up the handles and stuff but um i don't know if you have any tips for us over here but i did notice just two in one week here well brad i'm glad that you brought that up it actually happened on the same night and the deputy on this ship is the one that actually went and investigated the call as usual it's the doors that were left unlocked so the reason i'm glad you brought that up because i was going to and i was going to just see if we could remind everybody to make sure that they locked their doors i heard it from the sergeant folks lock your doors council any questions comments citizens any questions or comments thank you appreciate it vote enforcement good evening mr mayor council members staff citizens uh deputy clapton for the record just want to do a quick review of what's been going on for the last 30 days myself and the city manager have been working very diligently on uh a lot of contractors working in the city without permits and as of today when i came in i had 17. as of right now it's now 19 because i got two more this afternoon where people are actually not pulling permits they're hiring contractors that are not licensed coming in uh doing the work and then of course nothing's coming through the city so we we don't see anything where the city doesn't see anything the but we we did have one incident last thursday were a new resident our electrician come in replace a panel in a house and was not licensed was not a licensed contractor was not sure and uh at 9 30 this morning got a phone call from the resident and she told me that she had a house fire it was electrical thank god it was not because of what the electrician did but because of a couple squirrels i just decided to chew on an insulated wire but uh they were very appreciative that we are looking into these these uh these issues and again it's just mainly for the safety of the residents of the city and um like i said it's my second month doing this and as of like right now like i said we have 19 of them that we have caught and i want to thank the pinellas county building department licensing bureau because they have been working with me in finding these individuals in fact the individual on thursday got a 2500 fines for not having the proper permits so other than that just some other small little issues as far as um minor ordinances that were taken care of and doing the education over the enforcement part of it and everybody's pretty much declined i did notice a lot more of that um you know with the contract person and you finding that so that's excellent um two questions how's the reception that you're getting i know danny was quite popular and you're new how is things going out there i will tell you that everybody that i meet is just happy you know yeah they were sorry to see danny go but i haven't had any complaints from anybody yet so and we have been and it might be too new at this point to even say something but we had we have increased the enforcement hours to about 20 per week at the recommendation of the city manager how are you finding that 20 is it just right too much too little it is it's sufficient i mean there are some days again when i like i was out last sunday or this past sunday um did catch a couple people working that we're supposed to but during the week it's it does keep me busy because i do adjust the hours so i come out different times of the day but 20 hours is sufficient good counseling just like who goes to the new sheriff in town here i'll tell you within two months he's changed the face of cold enforcement in the city it brings a lot of experience in the parliament area and look forward to working with you and hopefully we can put a lot more uh spotlight on the after hours of the weekend as well thank you and again i i'm learning a lot from like i said from the county and uh i really i'm telling you i enjoy doing this this is a different aspect of law enforcement and i'm having a good time doing it citizens any comments or code enforcement keep up the good work thank you sir thank you have a good evening see you tomorrow okay adam four is our quarterly board reports um we're only going to have one tonight because the board of adjustment has no report the planning and zoning has no report park and recreation tammy lavender had a personal issue she's not going to be able to be here tonight i don't think there's any replacement person who came in in short notice right no so just citizen advisory committee do we have someone here ron thank you mayor council bronson chair of citizen advisory committee so we've had three meetings here beginning november 16th we met to discuss capital project budget items regarding the gold boulevard underground as well as the american rescue plan act funding and the recommendations for that on december 8th we met to review the digital sign ordinance and then we had a citizen raise a matter with concerns over the height of hedges walls and fences and we agreed to talk about that in our next meeting so then on january 20th we met to review [Music] the citizens concern and um we are in the process of making recommendations on that and that was uh this individual bodies home 20 years ago the height one that was four feet back to your setback which is 25 feet from the seawall on waterfront properties and then that code was changed um to where it can now be eight feet and it's only four feet high uh from five feet from the sea wall and so the panoramic vinst that this gentleman had one of the bottoms level is no longer there so we'll work on some recommendations there and then we also on that january 20th meeting began a review of the site ordinance that city council had tabled the night before and so we're working with the city manager to compare you know the primary issue is around how do we protect uh constitutional rights the first amendment around political science that was the main issue so those are the big topics that we know any questions you find out council any questions citizens we have any questions thank you thanks for the hard work on this we'll be looking forward to some of those reports at this point we would have the city at 9 and 5 to the city attorney's report and as i said i'm going to have um attorney solidsman here take some time and just introduce yourself to everyone we know you from the last time you were here but with some new folks here and quite a bit of citizens so you can just take the floor into you and tell us what you want to tell us thank you mayor council certainly sorry the circumstances said i'm here um i feel terrible to be in this situation for returning riley i'm happy to help and assist the city any way i can i have spoken to some of you before i've practiced law in pinellas county for 35 years the last 30 roughly in municipal labor of employment some of the issues that you've talked about signs changes in ordinances and resolutions i'm very familiar with and i've been doing it for a long time i certainly am happy to help the way i can i right now sit as the city attorney for gulfport so we have similar some similar issues that you all have but i had served her in the iraq speech for almost 18 years so i am very familiar with kind of the issues that you have and i'm happy to help you as the interim city attorney so you have somebody to know andre i just want to thank you thank you already when i saw you tonight but i think i can speak on behalf of the whole council and all of our citizens this was a unforeseen tragic circumstance here and i'm just so glad that you're able to do this on short notice for folks who don't know andrews he has an incredible background you're going to do just fine over here and really appreciate it and thank you that you're here for us thank you council on your comments very impressive resume thank you okay thank you uh now city manager yeah mayor console i put uh under uh tab six you've got the uh what is the first month of our kind of paper report that we started just highlighting it the drainage project we're in the final design review for 12th and 13th street [Music] the audio visual change out started today uh that's why you see all these lists and stuff floating around city hall and uh so they've started that project it'll get done during the month of february uh we've received the designs back for 16 city hall and 7th street in the program there were a couple things that the engineer missed on the boat ramp so we sent that back to him to update that get it corrected we submitted a hazard mitigation grant that's not on here for the generator we asked for 180 000 of the 240 we expect dallas county we've ranked 8 out of 12 projects but we hopefully will get some tier 2 funding so that could help us out with the generator and not cost us as much to kind of the sign i've heard so much about it and there's been a lot of misrepresented prices and this that and floated around well i'm happy to tell you that the city actually only spent a thousand dollars for the sign we got 34 000 back from the insurance we had a discussion with the adjuster and he's already paid us we were paid 30 30 289 and 30 cents and then we got four thousand forty dollars previously so the sign ended up costing us a thousand dollars our insurance covered it and our deductible was a thousand so it worked out great for the city uh i'm just going to interrupt you for a second i don't know what you did or what you said to him but that's absolutely outstanding i mean we were talking about getting 5 000 or 10 000 that basically got him to pay for almost the whole thing excellent whatever you did excellent he negotiated well he negotiated well so yes and i will say we've had a lot of positive uh comments about the sign and i think we've toned the lighting down i hope uh most of the residents satisfaction and uh so actually another city has contacted me to ask me about our sign so that's where we're at with the sign has our insurance premiums going up since we've had an insurance adjuster go after that money uh it may go up minorly but it's going to go up i mean we have lawsuits and things like that it's going to go up there too so it's it's negligible i think in the scheme of things i'm just saying i mean my experience is when you get the insurance adjusters in there yeah you do get the windfall and you pay it back over the years they're not in business as well not not at this point but we haven't had any claims for years either so that's a positive for the city they haven't had clients for years so and that's all i have counseling questions about this frank on the seventh street boat ramp um you said they had to go back out for um it was an engineering problem they missed some stuff is there gonna be a total project with the dock put back in with that boat grant was that gonna be fit separately that's done separately there there's we've got funding in the budget for new docks the boat ramp and the sea wall are separate and uh really the issue was he didn't extend it far enough out the water because he uh didn't realize it went as far out as we know it knows can we not do a combined bit on that it's really two different really two two different types of contractors and i think we'd be better served if we went to a doc person specifically and go to a sea wall specifically i think it would save us money in the big picture on that same topic does the person who's designing the ramp need to know what we ultimately desire for the dock so that it's coordinated you don't want to build the concrete ramp and do the changes and then find out you know oops we could have done some sort and such and made it better or better designed well the the dot dot person really the sea wall is going to be uh re filed in the front new cap and the boat ramp where it's at now it's going to stay we're just asking them to take all the broken concrete out and put a new ramp in so the dock design actually shouldn't happen until after that's finished to make sure that you know it's set out far enough because it is going to go between 12 and 18 inches further out than it is currently because of the sea wall replacement do you have any target dates for both projects at this point well we're as i said on the report we're going to get the bid out the first part of march for the seawall and shortly after that we can go go ahead and talk to the dock builders at the same time so i don't i don't think it's gonna delay much over april and may at the latest i think that was your original estimate yeah i've been getting feedback from residents about political signs appearing on county property see the manager uh yeah i've got a couple and what they're talking about is uh the signs on the stormwater pond across the street our ordinance does state that any sign it doesn't matter what it is political temporary or permanent is not to be placed on public property so you know i guess what i would ask is the candidates that have them there to stay within the code if they just put them on private property that's that's you know that that's in the code that says any sign and i i don't want to go pick up signs i just rather ask anyone who's got a sign to put them on private property i guess a great job on the sign i'm blown away i can't believe we got that sign for a brand great job thank you very much anyone else citizens we have any comments hey lynn thank you how did you generate city clerk report item well once again my projects are not as exciting as the city managers but right now i'm working on the municipal election documents scanning them and converting them and filing them digitally and then going through our last ordinances that were passed by council and codifying them to include them in the code and as far as public records at the time of this report i just have one outstanding and that's my report johnson citizens i thank you and i'll echo what said in terms of the election i know it comes around but there's a lot of extra work associated with it and you seem to knock it out as fast as it comes in so thank you thank you all right now we have the consent agenda you have items 8 9 10 11 and 12. i'm going to read them all we'll make a motion in a second and we'll pass it all as one unit there will not be any discussion there'll not be any citizen comments on it because it's consent agenda so out of 8 is approval of january 3rd 2022 city council meeting minutes at nine is approval of january 18 2022 city council work session minutes item 10 approval of city attorney monthly invoice for legal services item 11 city council acceptance of city attorney fred riley's resignation and item 12 authorized city manager to advertise for leading services for the city attorney you have motion second second by glenn gunn again there's no discussion on this so at this point [Music] so the procedure would have been to take this out of the consent agenda can i ask what the error is you've got frank banker coding twice patty let me ask you this i i i don't want to have an accurate minutes can we correct that after the fact if we approve this okay as you said i can't hear council member banker very well so page three page three he has him voting twice on an issue oh okay yes i'll fix that you can correct that after we approve this okay and yes i will does anyone on council have an objection to that correction so the documents are accurate i don't want clarification on which way you voted which prank january 3rd page three then tell us exactly the issue was motion a table for discussion of a resolution at the next city councilwood session and i opposed i remember you that you did do that but patty will double check it yes i will so with that correction does anybody have an objection as a corrective okay so then we're gonna have item eight nine ten eleven and twelve five eight will be corrected as as you just said council member frank banker is presently shown on page three in favor of the motion to table he should be opposed patty gentry will double check this back to the original tapes and if frank is correct which i believe he is he'll make that correction then with our approval correct yes okay so then all in favor aye hi does anyone opposed six to zero consent agenda passes with that one change okay we moved to the regular agenda item 13 to authorize the mayor to execute an agreement for interim legal services for the city attorney so mr salesman here will be able to continue and be paid which i think is kind of important yeah do we have a motion promotion mentioned by frank vancourt second second we're talking about dave gatt as frankie speaks for itself you need an attorney comes with a higher qualified resume he absolutely comes with a highly qualified resume so yes anyone else on council citizens any comments back to council and frank you'll get the last word so what we have on the table right now is to authorize the mayor to execute an agreement for interim legal services for the city attorney mr sullivan here um all in favor aye aye anyone opposed six to zero i will sign that this evening before we leave item 14 is unfinished business is there any i'm hearing none move to city council it's an even month so we begin with robin hockey i don't have any comments no comments frank bennett uh just to compliment patty as a citizen did you do an excellent job you're underpaid in my view but thank you you're blessed to have thank you so much just to recap on the uh the significance of this electronic song our old monument sign blows down i've got to replace a lot of recommendations on how to do this thing the communications committee gives a recommendation we go out for a bid and we get a bid back for 55 dollars and although all of the council members unanimously like the product we all believe that this price a little too high so we send them back to the drawing board and we get a scaled down version for a 000 never 65 000 as information has it out on the street never was that number ever considered 65 000. the bid comes back with for 35 000 with essentially all of the elements that we liked on the original side at the time that we were discussing the new price of 35 000 product we're getting some initial feedback from the insurance companies that we might get somewhere between eleven to fourteen thousand dollars for the sun that moved down and while we go through the throes of trying to decide whether or not we want an electronic sign we receive an insurance check for four thousand dollars and later on as this electronic sign debacle progresses we begin to think that we may not get any more than four thousand dollars well we send back our city manager to renegotiate that insurance thing and he comes back with an additional thirty thousand dollars on this electronic the city ends up paying 1 000 for state-of-the-art technology and a aesthetically pleasing sign that basically we've got other cities asking us about right now and basically falls into the vision that this council had the vision the wisdom and the curse so i would like to not only express my codes to uh kudos to city manager lynn reeves but all the council members who had the courage and wisdom to move forward thank you thank you leslie matero thank you okay i've got something i'm going to pass out everyone just so that you can read along with thank them so do all right i included a letter that was sent off to a senator and a representative and was carbon copied with other elected officials in our state asking that uh that they create a deal that in my opinion is pretty much an encroachment on our home rule i don't want to blast anyone for trying or anything like that but the purpose of this is just to make everyone aware that we need to be careful about what we're asking for so i'm just going to read this to you and i've i've given everyone here a copy whole world is the authority of a local government to prevent state government intervention with its operations over the course of all members of this council to carefully consider the possible repercussions of any request for new state regulations before asking for state intervention please ask yourself the following will this regulation have an impact on our home rule will this regulation affect our city today could there be a circumstance in the future where we would no longer want this type of regulation if created and passed this particular request would impact our home rule further it could plant the seeds for heavier regulation than the author originally intended everyone in this room has the freedom to make these requests before considering state regulation i ask that each of you consider every possible outcome not just what you intended you may get way more than expected please do whatever you can to protect our home [Music] thank you very much great thank you dave um so i'm gonna i didn't have any comments but after that comment i'm going to actually say something and add to it because i think it's important that you understand the full idea behind home rule home rule is local government making the rules for its locality there's generally the thought that people up here are in the best position to make the best choices for valor beach because you elected us we represent you you don't want someone from tallahassee doing that with that said we're under assault from tallahassee i've previously spoken out about tallahassees trying to ram down short-term rentals down our throat we don't want them but there's representatives every year they're doing it right now trying to ram that stuff down um so when i didn't i'm not the person who reached out but i will say that the person who reached out reached out over the issue of shade on the beach now home rule is a great thing but it's exercised properly but when it's abused then tallahassee steps in it takes away your ability to regulate yourself when you're going to trample someone's constitutional right and medical right to make a decision as to whether they protect themselves from skin cancer then yes you're going to get tallahassee involvement frank banker you're the person who did this and by the way okay uh well i'll see if we can if the count it's only 6 30. i'll see if the council will open this up to a little discussion here but frank bancard did it and i want you to know that three months before that june van scoye did it she lobbied nymph to sickly didn't get anywhere with it maybe if it was short-term rentals he would have done something for us but um we tried folks okay if you're going to abuse your power your power will be taken away so home rule is not to be protected at all costs it's to be used and used wisely and so that's what mr bancard did that's what june ben scoy did it's part of your right to lobby your elected representatives right now it's legislative week up in tallahassee the suncoast league cities which i'm a member sends a group every year to lobby the legislators for all the points of interest that we have um so unfortunately this didn't make the cut for bills this year but it will be tried again and again and again because no one in florida should ever be forced to suffer in the sun without protection it's your choice you make the call not some guy who's sitting in a 5 million mansion with that my comments conclude however um frankie i understand you might want to speak it's up to the council we have to dispense with the rules it's only 8 40. i have no problem having a brief discussion if you want to rebut this but if they don't give us the okay and these meetings do come to an end so we wish to dispense with the rule and have a brief discussion here all in favor aye i got two in favor three in favor anybody who's against i'm a guest one two i have two against how many are four two you're four four discussion for discussions with him frank you're in four and dad leslie you break the time four four okay we have four votes frank banker you have the flooring and we're going to keep this brief okay yeah um i received uh two a state senator state rep is trying to get a bill passed uh for cigarette they want to try paraphrases as quick as i can they're concerned about a lot of cigarette butts that are on the beach they're considering cigarette butts are one of the most hazard or bacteria trash items that are your own beach so you have a senator and a state rep that's very concerned about people's safety kids picking up cigarette butts so i wrote to him i said hey i think it's a great idea and i got this i got the email to my city account right so i wrote back and i said right now we're being under attack because we can't put up shape and i consider florida one of the highest probability for skin cancers that you can get because we are the sunshine state so i said why don't we look at creating a bill that would prohibit towns from prohibiting putting up a beach umbrellas on the sand now i am rarely sorry mr gaddis and i offended you by doing that okay but you're the guy that promoted a resolution after people stood there and cried or this is a personal attack frank um i'm going to find that somewhat well-founded so yeah just don't have to say that but there was a counselor just address it in general one of our councilmen presented a resolution okay then when women were up here almost crying for help okay and we said no we don't want to get involved in a lawsuit okay that would protect your yourselves your kids your grandkids all right and we probably would have this whole shade thing resigned by now but this council didn't this council decided to promote a sign okay whoa great we look like a car wash out front but when it came to your safety and your health all right they burned you down that's right you know it's funny we talked about this i i just as i'm looking over to frank to talk to him about point of order i don't know if you can get this victor this is the cover of our book it's taken from our city services is from our city website umbrellas they're legal in ballarat beach folks we protect you here but um some people don't do that so if that means you lose your home rule power then it means that and if we can succeed the legislative way that's fine we're going to try and succeed the um legal way because people don't want to talk they've had five opportunities they can talk to me anytime they want they've got my personal cell phone so they can call but they don't we've almost had a solution in the summer two of our residents tanked that our residents thanked it by putting up signs all over the city they ruined it for you he would probably have to settle last summer we're moving forward depositions start next 21st july city council any other comments anyone want to be heard okay okay can you hear me yes i guess i don't understand the point of this what was the point of bringing this up i think banger emailing our elected officials with the concern is valid i don't see this doing anything called rule this isn't talking about sign ordinances isn't talking about other legal mumbo-jungles is talking about a health crisis and being a physician being a surgeon who has done wide local excisions and removed big chunks of people muscle tissue bone for melanoma i can certainly be in support of shade because like it says in this email children my children's age right now having too much sun exposure they'll be almost guaranteed to have skin cancer by the time they're young adults so i don't really see this as sufficient justifiable something to bring up in a meeting i don't know if you're just trying to make yourself look good i don't know what this is i i don't i understand you for trying to bring up a health crisis that could be happening on our shores and um yeah i think this i understand yeah this is going exactly where i figured it would go but nobody is arguing the health benefits of this thing dr google nobody has ever argued this thing nothing yeah but nobody has ever argued the health positives or negatives of this aspect it is always been an issue about how best to address it and who is best at addressing it and how we go about addressing it and you know we started down one path as a consensus of the council which was directing our city manager to negotiate and where we heard that before tonight who came back negotiating the digital sign and walked away with us sitting up in the plus it's always been about how we do it how's the best way to do it it's never been about who's who's against skin cancer or who's foreskin kids it's never been that way so why try to make it an issue that way it's always been about what's the best way to solve this problem but the home but the email was about kids people getting skin cancer it's a pretty known fact five day at sunburn i think and that's what i'm saying look i have a lot of respect for our city match i think he does a great job but he did say an insurance adjuster gotten bob okay to get us to 35 grand every one of these go home tonight okay and try to get your your homeowner's insurance that nobody wants the right policies down here because the home because the insurance adjusters have ruined this state by replacing roofs that don't need them et cetera et cetera et cetera that's why your insurance rates are gone community and i believe our insurance will increase because of that so so um i want to address something glenn said negotiation is wonderful i do it all the time it takes two people to negotiate and when you send a team of people not just the city manager you yourself went virtually across the street along with me along with jody shirley we all spoke on our individual topics and spoke very nicely um there's copious notes in the minutes of bellar shore for july 21 2020. it's online you can go read it and it was a very accurate transcription and when we got done with that they not only voted to uphold the law of banning our umbrellas they said and i'll quote uh council member steve bloom said you wanted they wanted to talk with bellar beach and he said well i'll listen but i'm not changing my mind i have to take folks okay now on top of that okay the council did send the city manager over and perhaps you forgot the memo that i read into the record how the city manager went one week earlier and said he was going to help ellen sure said that they could make laws right up to the water which is legally incorrect and called the people who were complaining about it rabble-rousers that was not written by us folks that was written by their city clerk to their mayor and they had no idea that it would ever be discovered in litigation that is not negotiating for us that is negotiating against us eller shore was given by me and i'm looking at deborah maul and rick shock each of us sent letters they had upwards of well a month but they actually had two months to come back amicably and do something about this ordinance they did nothing then on september 28th i sued them and they still have done nothing so what you may have heard there are standoffs there's no standoff i've got an expert report that just says what robin aki just said about the dangers of skin cancer they produce no expert you go to depositions at the end of the month this case is moving forward to trial i'm going to get your umbrellas back okay they can negotiate any time they want they can negotiate with anyone they want negotiations in a lawsuit are privileged you can't use them as evidence in court of law so the law encourages negotiation i've tried five times i'm not going to keep asking them the next move is theirs if they want to negotiate but i am moving forward and the case is headed right now right where i want it to be going if they want to change their minds change it it's not just about umbrellas by the way folks it's about bicycles on the beach it's about parking lot abuse it's about food on the beach it's about breach of fiduciary duty this is no longer one issue they were warned if we went in we go in on all the issues we have i believe a 12 or 13 count lawsuit not one count it's not just umbrellas anymore and there's two years worth of damages for 43 people seem to be 45 people so the whole point of the letter was to warn everyone be careful of what you ask for it doesn't matter what you ask for it's about the way that you go about doing it and what the outcomes are has nothing to do with your lawsuit has nothing to do with skin cancer has nothing to do with frank banker's intentions what it is about what yeah it's about sharon wanted one okay so i told frank let's just direct it it's fine not individually it's not a personal attack it's just stating the fact okay anyway the whole point is is that we're worried about home rule and every time that a letter is fired off to congress we something could be changed because you're mad at another town and the outcome may not only be smacking us but every city in the state of florida and that's what i'm asking that's what i'm asking you to stop and think about before you get on your keyboard and start sending emails out to everybody asking for the state of florida to step in and control us and everyone around us because we do not want that that's all i have to say there was no place in my email asking the state to control everything my thing was the state's concern about cigarette butts which i'm not saying it shouldn't be all right why aren't why doesn't the state get involved with people kids the elderly myself my grandkids okay being exposed to the harmful rays of the sun by a town that we came controlling our home rule okay establishing or not establishing teaching levels and that's all i was saying this council did not do its job by protecting the citizens from 20th street south any other comments i know it's funny right glenn skin cancer is a funny topic [Music] okay i'd like to make a motion to adjourn well we're not doing comments so we can't break into the comments here we're having a discussion but then you can you'll be first up to make that motion to attorney we're not by the way our and uh so i'm not gonna find your point where now and i'll tell you why our rules say that you're not supposed to be making any noises or comments or disruptions when another person is talking i don't believe anything i said was funny but if skin cancer is funny to you by all means the export expert report was filed yesterday afternoon and bring it and learn how funny it really is or maybe have a little sidebar with robin any other council comments okay now leslie motion to adjourn second second all in favor all right hi zero good night everyone"
