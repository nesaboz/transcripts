monthly report deputy clacker good in here Mr mayor council members staff and citizens Deputy clacker for the record um for the code enforcement for the month of August uh you'll notice that 44 of my time was spent dealing with construction nuisances um and I just want to clarify something in those nuisances what I was doing was checking for permits see if people had permits they didn't stop work orders were in place also the big part was before the storm um a city manager gave me a list of all the houses that were under construction what I did was I went out and inspected each in one of those sites to make sure that they were safe we did have two that were not in compliance uh so prior to the storm uh I went out I checked uh 12 residents I had two that were in violation during the storm one was cleared up and then one was cleared up after on Gulf Boulevard fortunately no damage was done from the materials that were left out there I spoke with the homeowner basically told them look you know you have to keep this this lot cleared he understands he lives in Georgia and he made the trip down here because he couldn't get a hold of his contractor to clean up the lot um the other 32 percent dealt with Lawns weeds [Music] and then the rest of that dealt with uh traffic nuisances and those types of things I now stand for any questions Council any questions uh I I do have one um yes sir there's a uh there there's a lot it's an empty lot it was a knock down uh and they never rebuilt and it's huge it's some places it's six feet high uh is anything being done about that particular lot which where was that a lot at yeah I believe it's on Donato okay oh yes uh 2204 yes yes we did send out a notice of violation to the homeowner um to get that taken care of thank you I just wanted to get that on the record because I received multiple complaints about it yes sir anything else Council yeah thank you very much thank you you all have a great evening you too all right uh is Pinellas uh Suncoast fire and rescue here tonight nope all right well let's just move on to item number five a presentation uh given by vice mayor Shirley on behalf of the Florida Florida League of cities would you like to meet me at the podium I can do that good evening city of Bellaire Beach announced today that Dave Gaddis our mayor has spent quite a bit of time studying over the last year to receive a gold certificate of excellence um from the certificate program of the elected Municipal officials hosted by the Florida Liga cities University uh Dave received the level three there's level one two and three bronze silver and gold Dave received the gold certificate of excellence after um committing the last year August 2022 to July 23 he spent earning points to receive the certificate so on behalf of the city of Bellar Beach Dave I'd like to give you the certificate of excellence thank you very much good job babe thank you all right we are on to item number six which is another presentation from Lindsay Johansen Florida Legal cities speaking of Florida Legal cities uh account executive for fmit property and asset insurance policy all right well thank you all for having me tonight um my name is Lindsey Johansen I am the account executive for the West Coast of Florida and I do handle your insurance program that you don't currently purchase through the fmit so this year we have a significant increase in all renewals and I'm sure that you have been able to take a look at this a little bit and have kind of been aware of the market and the situation here in Florida and the property specifically so um what you have inside of you is the proposal the actual organ which gives you kind of a line by line itemization for each coverage lawyer and then the second page is the mainstream deductible options that we're offering this year so traditionally our coastal cities will take a two three or five percent this year every city um whether it's Coastal or further England will be out of five percent and that's kind of the standard property Trend so five percent is what this current program is quoted at and then you have additional options in a seven and a half and a ten percent deductible as well and then you have the corresponding premium on the property there so um that's that piece and then the second document we received is specifically highlighting the fmit and some of the strengths of our our program as a carrier we are now the owner of the three miniature trusts in the state that are going to continue to offer dedicated limits which means you don't share in a large pot with all other cities you have dedicated limits so um you all went from a total insurable value on the property of a 3.8 valuation and this year you underline an asset survey so that asset survey is basically an appraisal of all the city's assets after that was completed you all had about a 33 increase in these values but in the total initial value to about a five million dollar number so you did have an increase just based on what appraisal the actual values and then the new insurance Market is the second kind of piece to that that increase in the property so you had about a 44 increase in the overall program I mean that's considering the general liability the workers called the property the auto and cyber liability as well so that's kind of a recap um so I can open that up for questions you know it's not great news but this is what we're seeing across the state this is not specific to just Coastal communities um this is a pretty significant Market correction Mr Banker yeah um correct me if I'm wrong you ensure a building correct of wife Insurance building you ensure our employees for workman's comp right who are employees receive the five percent increase we're we're getting hit with a 44 increase on total things um but when you and my property insurance should be about the same as what we're getting here you don't insure for flood correct we have a flood supplement in the policy what does that cover um it covers any flood risks that are associated with them with the properties that we insure yeah I I I I've been told that 100 times but what does it ensure because when the flood comes in okay then you have to go to the nfip or your flight Insurance to mitigate damages so I know there's a disclaimer on every homeowner's policy two percent hurricane damage and all like that but what does it truly ensure so the definition of flood is rising water so it's from any local water wings it's also room driven rain so if you have a catastrophic hurricane that happens with our program is we have Synergy which you all may be familiar with that is basically our mitigation team so that third party will come out and do their initial assessments and once that initial assessment is concluded they'll determine what percentage of that loss is flood related so if there's true surge like flood surge coming in from the ocean that's considered flood you also have catastrophic property damage that is one trip and rain so it's kind of hard to really know until you look at the loss but physical advisor Waters what's considered flooding as opposed to fall in water which is your normal Windstorm deductible on property I understand that I've been dealing with this flood for two years now and I understand the rising border but again when it comes to writing the check for damages you guys don't write it the nfip does or whoever the insurance that is covered in the flood correct I believe or is right between 100 with many women mitigated I don't know if it's a hundred percent um I do have a little pain from a flood insurance policy right right I understand that but I I think we're being scanned this whole entire state is getting scammed here because I hear all those percentage increases and these guys you guys that wrote These building insurance policies you're jumping on the bandwagon of room insurance which would have a catastrophic loss okay and you would have the flood policy would have a catastrophic loss thank God not a lot of people claim this year but your your risks are so minimal in my opinion if there's if there's a buyer yes we go to you okay if there's a uh loss of some other type you know it will go to you but what are you what are you really getting from you for a 95 total percent increase before you go forward Mr bankert I would like for you to uh be careful ask your questions in a respectful way for our guests accusing and keeping our guests of scamming us I'm a little bit about me I'm sorry that you were referring your uh your property policy comes catastrophic risk so when your building is damaged from storms that's over the storm surge that's including the windows getting blown out all of the mold that comes into the building are full of water that's got to get sucked out and mitigated the drywall that we have to cut out and then we met you know basically stabilize that building until we have the initial assessment to rebuild the building so it's roof it's Plumbing electrical all of that that is goes into building rebuilding a building as well as content so all the property that's inside of the building so that's where the property insurance is and then we'll have a sub limit within that property that's dedicated to flood but you also purchase your own excess flood through the nfid so at claims time that initial assessment will determine how much property damage there is and how Contra Costa repair or with the contents inside and then it will determine what flood is eligible what flood coverage will be eligible because sometimes if it's one driven rain through the storm that it may be considered part of your property loss it just depends on that initial assessment so I mean it's it's kind of hard to tell you anything about that um I can definitely go through the property insurance policy and try to find specifics about defining Flood versus the rest of the policies coverage I would appreciate that yeah I'd like to direct other questions uh to the council if we have any more and then I will gladly come back to you if you have others Council no I'll just stay I'm not surprised at the increases I own multiple commercial properties throughout the state and you're just seeing this throughout the state it's where we shouldn't be surprised at what we're seeing and I appreciate your help and your efforts that you've put forth here um sure I know we're Limited in what we have to what you have to offer us because most insurance companies have pulled out of the state and I I really appreciate everything you've done yeah and I appreciate that into that point I mean if you look at what happened in the homeowners Market you have kind of a flight from the state that's because there is you know competition is great but you kind of get what you pay for so if everyone's fighting for that cheaper price cheaper price cheaper price eventually what people are paying out with these insurance companies pay out in premiums or what they pay out in claims they're not getting enough in premium so that that represents to hit the road at some point and with the severity and the frequency increasing and catastrophic risk especially in Florida um especially with Ian we took the bulk of that risk it's going to be about 150 million dollar coin but it's all said and done um insurance carriers can only reserve for so long from reserves that have been sitting on the books for 10 years before we have to kind of get closer to actual real pricing so you know that's kind of like the nfip program phased out the subsidies that we're involved in that because they were being used all the time and they need to collect more premium to to get closer to the actual risk that they're going to the 100 Year storm is becoming a 50-year storm and because of that there has to be a correction in the market one other thing is that reinsurance which funds the entire insurance industry at the very top that has Capital injected into it and with interest rates Rising um and inflation the investors that are at the very top of that system are not going to return on their investment so they're going to go and put their capital and other safer Avenues and vehicles than than insurance right now because insurance claims are already up so all those things kind of came together this year um and again I can send you a great summary of reinsurance it's really lengthy but I think it might help some of this in context so um I see that we have about on on our property well that's that's not a whole lot of money in the grand scheme of things especially whenever you're looking at this bill um is there a different uh levels of deductible and is do we have anything we can look at to compare so let me look at that really quick so um pretty that was another deductible okay um so you have I'm not sure why that says a thousand dollars I need to check on that usually the business is 25 000 as your aop deductible which is anything that's not winter storm so I'm not sure if that might be a thousand dollar there is for some other maybe like equipment or something like that um I will definitely confirm that but I see what you're saying there I was actually hoping it was accurate right and we could save someone with that um I would say the Moonstone deductible taking a higher deductible amount is going to be the food that removes the meter on pricing but I will confirm the property deductible okay and then uh yesterday I attended an event and uh Jeff Brandis spoke there and uh and he said that when this is a major correction that's going on right now and that next year it it's going to correct some more but it's not going to be near as serious uh and then possibly the following year uh it would be yeah it was stabilized and and we'll just have normal uh normal increases uh do you do you expect the same um yes I would say that this is not this will be the most severe year um the biggest correction next year we'll still have kind of higher increases than normal um but then it should start to kind of flatten out but it is kind of the market cycle we're in so I can't say for sure it kind of depends on the storms as well this you know thank you uh other questions or comments yes Mr Livingstone are we voting on page two I think this is just a presentation tonight all right I just wasn't sure because it had an option to check or reject yeah October 1st doesn't remove so you still have you know almost a month to make that determination and let us know which deductible you want to select if you don't then it will default to the five percent all right anything else any other questions no thank you very much I appreciate thank you for coming out tonight all right we are up to item number seven the city attorney's report Mr Moore you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor uh we are now in in September uh last month I attended the um totaling your city's annual conference and presented on the four-hour Sunshine Law ethics public records course as well as a presentation on public meetings and efficient operations of those meetings the conference was generally well attended and I think a tremendous resource your mayor um was there as well in addition to that uh at present we continue to advance a series of items we expect to see significant action items between the work session and next meeting in October including those um the the ballot language that we talked about which I hope to have for you in time for the workshop so we can make sure we're all comfortable with with that content um and a few other ordinances as we get into October 2023 please be mindful that as you start to see ordinances the process by which they're presented may change that is will start to include that economic impact cover memo that's been required by this legislature so the process might look just a little different in your materials I'm not terribly significant for this community especially because you do not have any real commercial District or um that has to constantly be weighed against all these but that doesn't mean that exempts us all together from considering you know pining on what commercial impacts there may be based on our ordinances otherwise continue to work closely with the um my offices work very closely with Kyle over the last few months on the solid waste issue um one of my one of my colleagues Robert eschenfelder has been helping Kyle with that and I know there'll be some discussion of that issue this evening otherwise I'm happy to answer any other questions you have Council yeah um from first in 19th Street um our residents use the town of Bel Air Shores for the beach there was an ordinance past this I believe this year limiting our residents owing to use umbrellas in the three beach access Lots meanwhile in that same ordinance it shows states that Bel Air sure residents are free to put umbrellas canopies whatever they like even on the wet sand which is States land um is that a violation of equal protection for our citizens it's my understanding that there were some citizens or interested property owners who advanced such a claim um I believe that matter resolved without a Judicial order on the matter at this stage I'm not in a position to opine on it I don't have um you know I'm generally aware of the ordinance whether individual Property Owners wish to make a claim that's not really a claim of the city against the the town as much as it is individual um individuals against that town and its regulations yeah I was just concerned about equal protection I mean if I'm a resident I can do whatever I want but if I'm a non-resident on the wet sand which is the state owns is the state owns the seabeds I'm not I I just I I just feel that's an equal protection clause and I understand it wasn't there was a suit that was settled um but um with the beach now hardly a beach um the original ordinance was for safety for umbrellas not to have any how you're combining all these umbrellas in this one little spot and at high tide you may only have 20 feet of beach now um but again uh the residents of Bel Air Shores is allowed to do anything they want when it comes to shade covering and we're not I just I just don't understand how that's it's not an equal protection violation to our residents okay I I don't for me there's not a question in that statement um I understand your concern I'm not saying it's without Merit or it's with Merit I haven't had the ordinance um as something that I've analyzed um there's no city of Bellaire Beach um interest there and that's my client so um that may well be the case and I think private property owners have attempted to or may continue to pursue that that action but as far as as between City and town that's not something I've opined on and I don't know what their Town attorney has opined or otherwise articulated on that point I know I've written to Ashley mood uh over a month ago and I still haven't received a response but I just thought maybe I'm sorry I didn't catch that actually remember attorney general about this and I don't received a response yet but I was wondering if you had any legal advice I'm not comfortable applying on it just because it's not something I've specifically analyzed that's fine anyone else okay I have a question across the bridge there is or was I think it's gone now there was a large yacht that sank are you aware of it I saw it this morning yes okay all right so um I've been speaking with several Mayors uh about this and they uh they all have major concerns I know that there are certain laws uh stipulating what we can and cannot do in the waters in our backyard uh but uh we're interested in possibly hosting a gathering here of uh local officials uh I would I'm wondering if you would be interested in being there uh in a legal capacity just to listen to uh everyone's ideas and um and maybe sort of keep us from going down uh the wrong road uh I work for my client my client is the council if the if the council so desires me to attend something I'm happy to attend that I would only hedging you'll get from me is I'm not sure if you're asking me to advise an intra local assembly or just advise my client but I would of course um be happy to listen to and receive any information monitor go in and then if this community has action it desires to take or have analyzed or proposed of course I would fulfill my duties to this Council okay I just feel like that we're we're going down a road that we're never going to come back from and I see last time I counted I believe there were six boats over here there may be more now I don't know but they're in Bel Air Beach's area that you know it was a challenge especially because things in the water line always static and those lines are um so I hear you're concerned yeah and what we're talking about doing is is finding a way to uh rather than waiting until the boat goes derelict we should be able to prevent them from coming in and staying for any any extended length of time because you know as well as I do as soon as they bring their junker boat in and they drop anchor if it's really a junker you don't know it until it's under water and it's spilling sewer and uh gas or diesel fuel all up in our Waters so uh I'm gonna speak with the city manager about maybe some dates and as soon as that comes to fruition I'll I'll let you know so I understand are you talking about like a big c meeting where it's discussed or a separate sort of entity this will be not necessarily a big c meeting but it would be anyone who has intercoastal uh uh direct intercoastal access from their municipality that wants to so then we ask in Bel Air as well even though they're not yeah and it may just turn into a giant event session I don't know but uh if you don't mind if you could kind of do a little bit of research and and and maybe let us know who who uh how these laws are in place and what it is we're we're allowed to do and not allowed to do I think I've got some resources I can circulate that won't require significant you know time and expenditure in that regard to at least start the dialogue and I can circulate those resources all right all right thank you thank you very much just add to that I think um well I know on the left at the last work session I brought this subject up um this is the second vessel in as many months that has sunk over there uh and so and I believe that at that time you had indicated that you would do some research I suggested that we look at what Key West is doing and I know that the city of Bellaire I mean the city of Madeira Beach just made some uh substantial changes to their code which is why we're seeing so many vessels up here but um it's definitely a code issue I think we needed and we need to make some modifications to our code we talked about it at the work session so I think it's time to get serious about it understood thank you uh and one last thing is uh he did a great job in his class if you've not seen this guy teach uh trust me it's worth giving up four hours of your life to uh to see it so anything else for Mr Miller no all right thank you very much thank you all right item number eight city managers report Mr reefer Europe thank you mayor all right I'll start off with the budget of we are doing our first public hearing tonight where we're going to propose uh and set the military and also uh approve the the first uh reading of the budget um relating to the budget I had on here um that we are RFP uh for the new collection Services um is being evaluated uh I reached out to waste management and they provided kindly a another month's service it only uh the CPI increase and the disposal fee that that they're incurring through the county um that's on the agenda it's still like um that for consideration because I believe that um you know being in the month of September right now um we don't really want to rush the process so we take them up on the rate we the one change I do have on this report is we did convene an evaluation community on Tuesday yesterday it was made up of myself our community services administrator and a community volunteer who's the chair of the citizens advisory committee uh we all reviewed the proposals I provided a tabulation sheet that I got off demandstar which is where we hosted the RFP um and you can see there's some differences in the pricing I ran some numbers on that if you compare the pricing or the lowest price can mean from these connections which was um 8.6 over what we're currently paying on the contract the second lowest price was Waste Pro and that was at 18.9 percent over current repairing and honestly Waste Management incumbent came in with 34.5 over what a current contract is is important um when we reviewed uh the rfps we considered all the requirements of the RFP and um when I went through at the meeting kind of laid out how I saw and interpreted the proposals and um when I looked at it and scored each proposal which the one that stood out to me most was Waste Pro so it was not the lowest price and um I determined that because the price point was uh it was a tab which was tab seven of RFP um so that was just one uh consideration but when I when it came to um the other tabs of the RFP which included organization um key players um way to address the services of the of Bellaire Beach transition plan dates um uh community outreach certain multiple things were included and when we when I went through them would separating wasteful um I had some um Waste Connections and waste management um was the transition plan if if we were to consider not sticking with our uncommon current contractor it's important that we have a good transition plan um so that we're confident in that we can make this switch and not cause headache for all our residents um and when I compare the plans I mean waste Waste Pro really kind of laid out um a timeline um big this is kind of what we've been doing over the last uh 20 years they've done it with over 300 municipalities um they have backup Vehicles right in the location [Music] um they talk about how they're going to communicate effectively upset with the residents to make this transition they talk about how their drivers will will do dry runs and pickup trucks before they even are driving the trash trucks um they should go through their software um talk about staging areas for the dumpster switch outs uh they talk about their customer service um you know pretty much by the end of the day no customer will go on the unanswered they set a high standard um all their trucks are equipped with the latest technology around board uh cameras so they can if there is an incident they can go back they can pull the footage from the pickup and be able to tell you what happened that day um so all the employees are half accountable um they identified who who will lead the transition plan and um they talk about it that they've their typical timeline for transition plan is 30 to 45 days but they've done it as little as four days and they also say um they've already started doing the legwork for the transition where at the time they said submitted this proposal they were they were confident in taking over service October 2nd so um when it really comes down to it that was a very key piece and in comparing these proposals um another thing is they were serving 61 out of 67 counties um and just overall presentations so once I presented with some evaluation committee um there was an agreeance that that Waste Pro was the best proposal and we felt that that overload the lowest bidder so um the committee is going to recommend we go to negotiations contract negotiations with Waste Pro all right Council any comments questions um I I will let you know I spoke with mayor will today and uh in Redington Beach they use Waste Connections and I will say that uh he was adamant about uh the company just being Stellar so uh there I I don't know what else to say other than another another mayor says good things about this company so I think I would feel good with either company it seems that uh uh the the committee was happiest with Waste Pro and uh and you are too so I would be uh I would side with you uh yeah tacklemore you're saying I spoke to other students about both companies they all it's very competitive they all are spoke highly of um I spoke to Madeira Beach uh where Bruce Proto is a recycling program and they took over there um nothing but good things to say um I heard from city manager in the city of Seminole they they're significant because they do both their trash collection and their Recycling and again she's completely satisfied with their service so I think I think all those companies are great companies um I forgot to mention it was waste programs that stood out in their proposal is for the recycling they offered it had no charge uh these I think it was 58 or sorry 64 gallon recycling carts um they'll do what I've been in service what we currently have but they're offer no charge these the you know like the medium-sized recycling carts but often they're residents more space and very very strategy is um they can automate and at the same time they found that that reduces the amount of recyclables that just go into the trash anyways when you run out of space if they caught diversion so the diversion rates they find decreased but or uh sorry the development rates with the transition they lowered by uh 30 so that's another thing it's something to consider we don't have to go to the carts but I know in the past RFP I reviewed the notes when we considered going to the large trash cars and the concern was that the elderly citizens about our beach would I would struggle with such a large cart but these I think are workable um they're kind of a medium-sized car and and you know if you use the recycling bins you can't really fit that much in there so I think that's a that's a plus would they recycle my existing cart um all right maybe we probably could take them back at the city but yeah I have a concern you mentioned they're automating so are they is that true for the the canisters as well that right because one benefit we have is that you know our current vendor has guys on the ground right you know and they will provide but they do an excellent job I just want to make sure so yeah they were they will pick up any container the resident uses um but they they will also transition to a trash cart if we ever decide to so they did either way well let's find out what the council thinks Mr Banker um are they going to give the same type of service for um Landscaping like we have now like palm branches and everything like that most of our residents don't tie them up there was a big thing about four years ago here with Waste Management they weren't going to pick up anything it wasn't bundled that lasted about a week and I think Lynn couldn't turn his phone off he got so many calls and then they went back to you know just picking up because some of these people just put piles and piles and piles out of all different types of Shrubbery it's not bound up well they give us the same type of service so when we did the RFP we didn't put any stipulations on how the yard waste went out there um there was some questions um that we said that would be negotiated through the contract so Our intention is not to have any anything just too limiting to the residents because we're aware of the way the yard waste is picked up and we talked about in the evaluation committee we believe that when it comes down to it they're going to want to serve the customers so I don't think it's going to be the hang up um yeah no it will be gan Miss Livingstone if the group and Kyle agree that um Waste Pro Florida is the way to go then I'm in agreement as well Mr Mayor Shirley just another question regarding um the storm dumpsters when you know when time comes that we have um a need for additional dumpsters and things like that is that an additional charge is that part of the original contract what happens so in our last contract that was worked out during the negotiation so it was written in the 30-yard roll-offs before complementary they were included in the contract is that what you're saying they're included yes and when we negotiate the contract they'll be presented to the city council so you guys will review it and vote on it yeah that's a pretty big benefit Miss Notaro um currently we have all the condos along the west side of Gulf Boulevard have um fence fenced in little things where they have their garbage dumpster and then another one where they have their recycled dumpster are the ones for these other vendors the same size they proposed all the same size they were given a list in the RFP with every condominium what they used um and they proposed all the same sizes and that they would uh use plastic I believe to try and reduce noise I don't know if you currently have plastic they were they proposed plastic dumpsters because they thought it cut down on noise in the residential area okay how do you feel about uh utilizing Waste Pro of Florida all right I'm very happy with Waste Management yeah yeah I am too yeah I I think any company if they can provide a level of service that we're getting now with Waste Management I think I I believe this Council would be satisfied with that all right so we're going to uh vote later on extending their contract for one month and what what does that do for us that gives us the enough time to vote in next month's meeting to approve the contract yes um so if you approved me to go to negotiation I'll set up a meeting with Waste Pro and we'll go through each point of our proposed contract and uh see if there's any changes that want to be made or what we want to include or drop off and then I will share that with Attorney Morris firm and uh attorney ashenfelder and come up with a contract that that we feel will serve the residents and then that will be put on a meeting agenda for your approval all right do we need a motion for that um I just need uh the approval from Council to go to negotiations let's just uh let's do a motion right quick would someone like to make a motion to uh move forward with creating a contract I have another question before we move to that um and it's with regard we went to bed took this out to bed I'm not hearing anything any reason why we wouldn't take the low bid other than we just have this Comfort level and if we're looking at I think I need a better argument why we wouldn't look at the low bid um when the evaluation committee reviewed we thought it was a standout difference in what was presented what was proposed like I said the transition plan if you read one plan versus the other you're looking at about 10 times more information presented and just explained uh it gives you a lot more confidence in that they're going to be able to pull off what they're saying so better communicating the the entire process overall proposal better order um less errors I mean okay got it okay so yes I'll move forward with a with um uh I guess what are we trying to say what am I doing um would you like to make a motion Florida I would like to move forward with a motion to uh to enter into negotiations with Waste Pro of Florida on behalf of the city of Bellaire Beach do I have a second a second second all in favor aye aye any opposed okay thank you all right so um three bar items on the report I've got there about underground a slight Delay from the storm so the the uh UCF was going to finish up in the month of August but they're about a couple weeks back so we're expecting September um there'll be prior in the invoice on that first phase one um Po and then what I'll do is submit it to the county is you know the whole PL for reimbursement from uh penny for Pinellas the stormwater Improvement projects um I've been working back and forth with several septic who does a Camry and our cleaning over the place um right now with our tide schedule I'm looking at getting them in hopefully to get a lot of other footage of the pipes that we wanted to assess on um September 18th so I'm going to get with Gemini engineering hopefully I can get those videos to them but they can still be able to evaluate them and make it so that that night's meeting to give us the answers that we wanted as far as the conditions of the pipes um but that's just a tied thing um one thing I wanted to find out oysters in it that could be just uh filmed with a camera truck no problem there's the pipe segments that go from the closest Inlet to the Sea walls out to the sea level are going to need cleaning to be videoed um the project proposed rudely I thought was that we're going to have a line on a price for the Cure in place lining so that when we go through on the project and clean and inspect the pipes that as needed if we found damage we would line it then it's not it doesn't have to be done that way um but it will increase what we spend right now on the budget so I wanted to know if if it was uh pertinent to move forward and start cleaning the pipes now and inspect them and no one won't be doing it later I'm not sure how the council felt about that Council big guy clean them I mean we're in this we're not even at the height of hurricane season yet I think they should be cleaned so just cleaning video it might slow things down a little bit hopefully they can get it done with Thai schedule but I want to see any surprises like we did in the last uh on 12th and 13th okay all right I'll do a new favor of that in the resolution to adopt okay thank you very much any other questions or comments for the city manager um your your field crew work like dogs um getting this city ready um sandbagging um they put in long hard hours in the Sun and heat and I think this Council we should give them those three guys at 250 dollar stipend bonus for their recognition for doing this they were out there for hours neglecting their own homes and that and just some kind of appreciation so I'm making a motion I think it's appropriate for one time 250 each stipend do I have a second a five percent on the motion I want to make sure we're just um and and Mr Bainbridge just because I wasn't aware that we're gonna be making that motion I do want to add there is a statute it says that um on the Florida statute 215.425 no extra compensation that shall be named to any officer Asian employer contractor after the service has been rendering the contract made nor selling money be appropriate or paid on any claim the subject matter of which has not been provided for their pre-existing laws um suffice to say that there is some some Authority against extra compensation to employees for uh performing their duties I I have an obligation to raise that as a concern I'm not saying this Falls squarely within it um but I I wasn't aware we were going to be having that discussion or what the Personnel policies might otherwise say on the matter but I think um under 215 I don't have in front of you so we're not able to discuss this because the motion has not been secondary uh was there a second at all no I'm sorry the motion dies thank you for the advice Mr Moore all right we are on to item number nine which is the city clerk's report Miss

relationship that we've had with uh Bayern Beach uh and I realized that as we talked to the city managers or uh and going through the RFP process they were looking at an extension uh and we took everything into consideration and relationship that we have uh and we've basically applied a focus and increased which covered up a CPI and uh the disposal rate we realized this video was going through the process we went with our best foot forward vehicle partner uh and that's why we we kept it uh for the one month extension because we're running to make sure that you got the best movement

representative from the Florida League of cities uh was there to answer questions concerning Uh current and future legislation uh I asked if there have been any consideration of overturning the full Financial disclosure law for municipalities in general and were they arrested of the impact it was having on small Municipal uh municipalities like Bellaire Beach the expected answer was no but it kicked off a heated discussion um about Council and commission members resigning as well as the quality of future members who could just walk in unopposed I will continue to have this conversation whenever I can but unfortunately it may require a judge to undo his damaging law also this Friday The Big C Mayors and County Commissioners will meet with the Army Corps of Engineers to discuss regular and emergency Beach nourishment I'm confident there will be plenty of press coverage on this one so stay tuned uh also we went through 20 agenda items in less than an hour and a half I don't want anyone out there to think that we just gloss right through these um every item is is discussed unless it's just a standard housekeeping item we we do our homework and uh and the hard work uh
