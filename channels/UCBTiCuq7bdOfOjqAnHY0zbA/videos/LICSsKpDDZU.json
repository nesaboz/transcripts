    "transcript": "good evening everyone please come to order and welcome to the valley of beach special regular work session for january 20th 2021 please rise and join me the pledges council member dave gattis council member jody shirley vice mayor glenn gunn mayor joseph manzo city manager lynn reeves city attorney fred riley and council member rita swope was unable to attend okay thank you so we have uh eight items on the agenda for tonight along with the general business first item is to discuss creating a city of miller beach policy to specifically address remote attendance as well as a qualm physical presence for the rapidly changing manner of conducting business electronically this was brought by vice mayor gunn the description says to develop a concept for remote attendance by city council and the residents in alignment with florida's government in the sunshine law and budgeting acquisition and implementation of the necessary equipment uh senate attorney riley to provide case law which he did today i just want to mention to everyone in the audience that's attending this is a work session so we're going to discuss stuff amongst our ourselves here is the only time we're able to discuss this and at some point i'm going to ask for the citizens comments it's not as formal as a regular meeting but we will have one opportunity for citizens comments and that's what the council allows us to do then does anyone have any objection to us opening the meeting to citizen comments on these items there'll be no objection we will open it up at some point in time so i will call for it you don't have to raise your hand then that natana call for it that raise your hand you'll come to this podium here and speak okay vice mayor this is your topic at the last meeting we talked about the possibility of institutionalizing remote attendance basically institutionalizing the lessons and technology that we are doing and recent shutdowns benchmarking shows that these policies aren't really anything new it just seemed like very reaches late in the game experience showing that we had greater resident attendance when we were using the electronic zone format and uh does it now that we can't capitalize and build on that experience that we had during those electronic meetings at this point i think it's probably best to move to the city manager because he's kind of investigated the technology side of this thing and also the city tournament [Music] [Music] still doing some investigation but as you all know we're going to convert to ipads probably sometime in march april timeframe and what i'm looking to do is you will actually be here but you'll be on a zoom meeting or something of that nature so what that does that allows the public to participate in that meeting so we're looking into how we can accomplish that we've been doing some testing with the ipads we have against the computer system so what will what it looks like just as a generic all of you will have an ipad at your desk city clerk will have one i'll have one then we will connect something to the overhead projector so the zoom meeting will actually be going on which will still be here and then that gives the opportunity for the residents to call in and speak to you just like we did when we were sitting in at home or in our office so uh bel air has done some of that technology already with um they used surfaces instead of ipads but we're going to give a little more detail from them so we did some testing kyle and i and it appears it will work we just have to uh get rid of a few notes that we've got so that's that's the direction and really that's what i was going to talk to you about the hybrid zooms in [Music] in theory it sounds like a great idea um i'm not 100 sure that it'll work and the reason why is because each one of these ipads is going to have a listening microphone they're not in sync they never will be in sync there's always a second or two delay from whatever your media is so let's just say we all used our phones and started a zoom session what you would start picking up first off if there's anyone here they have to have to listen on this microphone they're not going to be able to hear through the ipad every microphone in this room is going to pick up that voice and it's going to be over and over and over until they all catch up i've kind of put some thought into it and if you wanted to do that you could but you could not do the sound so without sound let's say that you wanted to get your sound source from one source so we had this killer microphone that picked up everything in the room well now you've lost control over the video so you have this you have to use the same video and audio source every time kind of the way that i see it is that we we do have a an all-encompassing microphone for this room and we have to have one person who's monitoring a camera and literally pointing it right to person i know that that creates an expense but i've thought about it every way possible and i cannot think of any other way to do it not only that but then you also have to have someone to steer the zoom meeting so most people would think that it would be padded but i i ran one of those meetings that you recall whenever we were having technical difficulties you can't take notes and run them even you just can't do it so it's it's going to be one of those things where we really need two people to have this virtual meeting where it works for everyone the people outside the building are not a problem the the citizens are not a problem it's us whenever we're in a room together and we're trying to to merge it all together into this hybrid virtual meeting it's it's the only way possible that i [Music] we kind of have two topics together here and i think if there's no objection here we can put them both together and deal with it because this is marking into number four which is discussing the hybrid zoom meetings for council boards and committees so if you want we can put this all together but i said that we have an objection to that first of all i know victor is here he wanted to say some words because he's done this before but maybe we can deal with this as one thing but before we get into too long of discussion i'm going to keep it with this group here i've already read fred riley's memo but in case somebody didn't see it i want to know the legalities of this and whether we actually can even legally do what we're talking about doing so but first off does anybody have an objection to combining one and four line one and four and then um mr riley when you know when mr dallas is finished if you'll just uh just i think i've pretty much shared my thoughts in fact i had a just conversation with she agrees as far as the [Music] based on the tone of the discussion when the council last addressed this to me there were two questions that it really needed a legal answer for so that that's why i wrote the memo that addressed two different questions the first question is about quorum and being physically present and based on state statutes and two city code provisions the requirement as it stands now is that you have to have this council has to have four council members present in order to have physically present in order to have a a forum and that that's the standards that you have to meet the second question was related to uh can you utilize communications media technology and i've given some analysis of that the basic concept that i would focus on is that anything that increases the ability of citizens to participate is generally going to be a positive thing and if you if you're going to use the technology i don't see any legal reason why you can't do that i am aware from talking to victor and others that it's being done in other municipalities so the but the the thing that lynn and i had a couple conversations about the thing you have to segregate in my opinion are the quorum issue and the the media communications technology those are two separate things although they they are intertwined in some way as far as when we last were discussed this i told you i would look into the statutes and to see what case law there was i really did not find something that i felt that was on point that would give us a great recent case to point to and part of the reason i wanted to look at the case law is that as you'll remember the uh one of the backup documents was a article that summarized a whole series of attorney general opinions and the attorney general opinions were to be quite honest all over the place and they were also over a period of about 20 years so the different attorney generals have expressed different views but i'm telling you at this point based on this this city's existing code provisions at florida law you do have to have four people present physically present for there to be a form and certainly we'll stand for the questions that you have my question is can i let you find it in here maybe i'm not reading it right look it says on page six item number four talks about the majority vote of the quorum pricing my question is what do you do with the folks that are not present we've had some situations where people have not been present here you know for whatever reason and this is before the governor or after the governor's uh dispensation expired if you will what do we do do they vote are they permitted to vote because it talks about having a majority president to vote we have a stricter rule that requires actually four votes to pass any ordinance or resolution so what do we do the people who are on the telephone get to vote do they not get to vote do they get to listen and speak what do we do with that well they if a city council member is on the phone or on a zoom conference call and is participating in the meeting remotely and there are four city council members physically present then they can participate and they can be one of the you know they they have to vote under florida there's a different statute that requires you to vote but the quorum requirement is for physically present and in order to pass an ordinance or resolution you have to have a majority of the council vote in favor of it so indeed there would be four people that voted in favor of it whether they were physically present or they were present remotely i guess i'm getting hung up on go page six item four is number four it says the majority of the members of the governing body shall constitute foreign agree that's four okay and a vote of the majority of a poor president even highlighted that is necessary to enact any ordinance or adopt any resolution except particulars of membership is required to enact emergency ordinance so so it's talking about the majority present okay if we have four people present and three people on the phone the majority doesn't cut it we need four votes so you would need all four of the members present to vote on that the way i read this or the statute i hope you ran through the framing system clarification why we're here okay because what brought this to a head was we had been operating under the precedence of you can call in but you must have a core present for people okay you can vote that was the present was if you call in you cannot be counted as part of the court because you must be present but your vote counts as part of majority and and that's why i brought this hope is i just want to institutionalize that precedent before it gets lost or misinterpreted or the interpretation changed further down the road there was never any consideration to change the presence of the four quarantine because my takeaway from that article that i handed out was a guy said he advocated having four people present to consist of the quorum because if florida does change that thing it would invalidate anything that we might have done up until then so i am still in favor four people constitute a court that quorum must be present if only the quorum is there the majority of the quorum can enact a vote but if you have other people who are participating in meeting online my interpretation and the interpretation has been via that precedent that i'm bringing on raising before this council right now was they then their votes count towards the majority that's how we've always done it since i've i think all of us most of us have been out at least once and we've voted before but i'm i hear i i know what we've done whether it was right or wrong i'm not saying anyone had anything attention this statute that fred just gave us here talks about a majority of the poor and present you need four that's not our rule our rule is we must have four votes to pass any work is okay if we only have four people let's say three of us were all set we only have four people here something comes on it's three to one that does not pass that fails okay we were deadlocked one time three to three that would fail okay we have to call you you were you were out that time and he had to pull you into he'd break this deadlock with the city manager had to get something to the uh tax office like the next day we need more so i we're i'm just trying to straighten this out i'm not challenging and i'm just trying to challenge you in the light of what this statute says because it's talking about a majority of the quorum present which means 301 31 doesn't pass it for us you need four and then somebody else would have to be able to vote you know and bring it in with four if you have people four people on the line i'm confused at this point because our other rules say the poor pass i'll go back keep fred and then mark dean and then back to council the way i would analyze it is what what a two-step function what do you need in order to have a core and i think it's very clear you need four council members present and physically present in order to have a quarrel once a quorum has been established then you need four votes of the seven city council members in order to pass a ordinance or resolution so you you i understand where you're coming from with your the angle and ankles not meant in a negative way i understand the uh interpretation that you're trying to clarify but the my my feeling is first establish the quorum and if you don't have four people present then you you can't pass anything anyway the a lot of the stuff i looked at and a lot of the uh attorney general opinions addressed this is that it the allowing somebody to call in is normally done when there's exigent circumstances such as an illness or somebody's traveling for their job or something like that it's you know typically not applied when somebody wants to you know stay home and kind of watch or participate but also watch the baseball game that's that's not really what the tone of anything that i've looked at at all it's it's there's exit circumstances and you're accommodating a council member when they have exited exigent circumstances and need to participate remotely okay but that's different than i think what we're i mean it's exiting circumstances yes but we don't require any explanation from a council member we have a council member tonight that's out i think it might be health related that's what i heard last time linda's not that could be extreme circumstances to me but you know yeah like you said if you're home watching the baseball game that's really not an exciting circumstance you're not going to say what's why we're not here so how do we know that i mean we happen to know it tonight because that information is volunteered but we normally don't know why you're out well i'll give you the example of one one end of the spectrum that i i know the outcome of if all seven of you were here physically present and all seven of you vote which is what you're required to do then if four of you pass something then four or more then it's adopted if you don't get the four it is simply not adopted that that's the best case scenario and i you know all the stuff i've looked at under florida law is oriented towards there being people physically present for sunshine meetings is it your recommendation that if we're going to review this ordinance that there would be something about the acceptable reasons and there's many reasons people can be out vacation extended trains sickness surgery i mean people on and on and on some of those are better than others you know so are you well my question i'm just asking if it's not a rhetorical question i think it's a very meaningful question is in the last couple years has this been a significant problem and if it has not been a significant problem then do you really need to do something to address it i i know when talking to vice mayor gunn on several occasions he is or his thought process and i think rightfully so is oriented towards tech what can you do from a technology standpoint and how can we fashion policy that will take into account the potential uh advances in technology since this last year the city council lived through the using the technology in order to hold its meetings the one thing that was different though is that the governor issued a series of executive orders that simply made it uh substantially easier to you for the city to have flexibility in doing these kind of meetings so my recommendation is i really don't think you need a policy in my opinion but if you all decide that you do i'm certainly ready willing and able to help you drop the policy mark fred just addressed exactly what i wanted to talk about i see absence in other words you have two members of the council that decided to be on my vote every time there's a council meeting or be in my pool and at the laptop like they had to pull and we just addressed that right now we don't have an issue it's something that we could do if it's necessary and we just passed new rules in our charter just for that so let's just say i decided to go vote in two or three week meetings there's several things that you have to take into account number one the uh the way that we wrote the charter i don't think it addressed remotely it was you had to be here number two we've got that we have to have a court we have to have a minimum of four people here to have a meeting and then number three if you happen to not be able to be here but you're able to phone in or zoom in or whatever then you have to vote i don't really see where there's much of a problem because if we keep doing that over and over and over eventually the council will step up and save [Music] as far as voting goes as long as we don't interpret it where you have to be part of the present quorum to be a valid vote [Music] i think we need definition of present because if you're present on the phone you're present right so so i don't know that that work was splitting hairs there but i completely agree with what you're saying and i may have known before fred said it is you know we're discussing this as a as if it's a problem and there's not a problem there is not an issue and never has been an issue there was a time when we had someone very ill who passed away that was on council that probably went a little long before they appointed someone new but you know there's this just is not an issue uh the attendance situation and i don't see a problem with calming in or zooming in if you zoom in clearly you're present you're sitting in front of your computer you've got your camera on your your microphone on it's very clear that you're present i i just don't i don't see i don't see an issue at all a lot of you would remember this but we had a council member when i was on council on 406. never made a budget for them and that's that's an issue and that's one of one thing we try to prevent but the thing we haven't addressed is abuse of the system and right now we don't have a problem but i think if there's something to put on the back burner if that happens we'll have to address it and then if you remember mark back then those budget meetings were at three in the afternoon or something and you know we finally got up so that people that work and attend can actually be on council and attend meetings there were so many meetings over daytime it was impossible a lot of people were earlier in the day you know starting at five o'clock that was an issue but you know this was a long time ago but you don't want to history the charter of many you know if we go back and think about the intent for that charter amendment attendant it was under the old paradigm the tenants was you were there at the meeting right it didn't reflect the new paradigm of hey i can call in on a zoom meeting i can still participate i can engage on this thing and i can take part in the critical discussion or debate and a vote so the original intent for that charter amendment was to address people not showing up at work sessions or even participating or making an attempt to participate and engage in those things and then coming to a council meeting and voting on something that they had no background on or weren't adequately prepared to uh to engage on so that was the original intent on this thing so if you think about this in in light of how business is done today if you can call in and stay engaged and participate again what's the issue here i mean do we need to i think we're all adults here everybody came to this job we're not getting paid for this thing we're dedicating a lot of time a lot of resources to this thing because we're all adults here and we're here to serve and do the best job we can i have confidence that nobody's here to gain this thing i think that whatever the cause you can still participate you can still engage and if that becomes an issue then you need to address that issue but other than that i don't think we're at the point where you need to bring a note from mom or you need to bring a note from your doctor or whatever to say you can't so along the same lines is i'm trying to fix something that's not really broken at this point i think i'm trying to harness this technology thing for the better of our residents and the city business but i mean there are some other aspects i agree with what you said i mean we i was you know i think i was wondering people pushed this through i witnessed it before i was on council and not mentioned the person's name but missed every single work session and yet when the vote came up that night well passed the item that was discussed at like six workstations to me i was just like cringing i was like how could you possibly do that you're not you haven't participated in any of this but he had to vote because he was on counseling so it just was wrong and that takes care of people who just get elected and just don't show up we've not had that problem um i agree with you i would hope that no one tries to game it i think if someone does then we're going to have to come up with a policy because it's just not often right back to you just not fair to the four people who are here i mean hey i'd like to get i'll have a pool but i'd like to get poolside or you know be home in my slippers and i'd have to get dressed up and you know ready and shaved and everything else and come down here it's a lot easier to do at the moment if you want to once in a while yeah but i mean if somebody takes you know six or eight meetings i mean you know come on that that to me i think is playing for whatever reason i'd be more inclined if they were sick to say hey listen i'm sick i can't get in that's fine but you know if they're playing tennis then you're not sick so [Music] several of you have mentioned something that made me look back at what you have passed related to the forfeiture of office it includes the language or at the council's discretion fails to attend any four council meetings budget sessions or work sessions during a rolling 12 month period during the term of office with the exception of special or emergency meetings so the the point is the at council's discretions gives you some flexibility if someone's um you know going to the raised game four months in a row and they they call in from center field and you know they're obviously not taking their commitment to being a city council member seriously then you know it's obvious they're the raised team and you just heard the pa announcer then you have a basis to to look at what their performance has then and uh basically say as a council we're not going to give you a excuse absence and you know we we now are going to move forward with a forfeiture of office because you've missed four weeks before meetings in a row so that that's the to me that's a good safety valve because it gives the council as a whole some level of discretion if there's ever a situation where there is something that is akin to abuse so if i summarize trump heard from you i think to me this just seems like not a problem that we don't need to really address this now until it becomes a problem so i mean i feel like we've been talking about it for 31 minutes without really trying to fix a problem because there is no problem so i think like like let's say we're all adults we show up when we need to when we don't make every effort to do zoom or phone calls sometimes the audio is not the best but that's the price you pay when you call in so you just have to expect that and i'd say just let's keep going until the problem develops so to summarize what we've all discussed and i think we're all in agreement on qualm constitutes four people pressing that's what our rules and our laws say so we need four people still pressing if we have that poor council members president we can have the other three members can phone it in zoom it in whatever technology we have instituted here to get into the meeting you'll have full voting rights and full participation rates on that we will not put any policies in place right now to some you know whether how many times you can do that we'll let people be adults i agree with that um that's what everybody has pretty much said if it becomes abusive if somebody's phoning it in from tahiti for six months in a row we're going to have to deal with that then and we'll deal with that as a council when that comes up at this point in time i think that takes care of everything i don't know that we have to change anything that we have right now is there anything that requires a legal changes i want to go into the second part of this which is the technology aspect of it no to the first part there's nothing further okay so are we all in consensus on that okay now the next part is the technology dave started to talk a little bit about the echo and i've experienced that myself but if you get the echo you can hear everything going so let's get back to the technology and at some point i want to hear from victor because he's done this already for indian rocks i just wanted to mention you know there's obviously a design spiral here and a learning curve and i'm wondering if there's some trial and error trying some things one thing i saw about the zoomie that i thought was actually kind of a positive was it kind of knocked down a lot of the side bar discussions or people touching this because there was a moderator basically controlling the discussion there so is it possible that everybody's like is muted and uh one of the things that we addressed was there has to be training on this thing there has to be a staffing because i from the outset i've always believed that look patty shouldn't be settled with his is too much if you were to go to something like a zoom format because it's immediately recorded and can be uploaded you know for the next morning really you know our existing video guy can become something like a moderator and that becomes his new job with it and all this sort of thing so you know yeah there's it's kind of a conceptualization of how this thing's gonna work and then maybe can we make some uh easy stuff off the shelf stuff can make it work if not then yeah i would like to hear what victor has to say i do like the suggestions and um victor's our uh av specialist he's going towards all of our meetings and he's already done something similar can you tell us what he's done and what the technology is at hi council how are you um so as um as vice mayor gunn was saying there is a lot of trial and error with it and it's um there's no easy system but because i've done it before um i've experienced a lot of the issues and whatnot i can implement that um to figure out how to do it seamlessly and um the the problems are with the zoom meeting you have to have a strong moderator and have strong settings because you don't want somebody joining the meeting in their underwear or or start screening profanities so you have to have a setting where they join muted and they you know they don't have video access only the council members so it can't be moderated properly but it has to be done carefully there's always the flukes of hacking which we can't get around anyways but you have to do your best and i can help with that it might be eventually i can probably serve both roles once it starts to once the trial and error period is over but i probably have to have somebody helping me i can have someone from my team to do the zoom part of it while i'm doing the video part of it because the video is a little bit complicated i have um about twenty to thirty thousand dollars of equipment um of robotic cameras that are controlled by a computer um so usually i have four cameras they're all 4k uh high definition um it looks great uh but what i usually bring out to indian rocks is only two cameras because that's all you need um it looks very good you don't have any it's a professional production because i'm uh editing while filming it basically got the preview window and then the live shot window so it looks i don't know if any of you had a chance to look at the link that i sent out i would also invite you to check out the meeting but unfortunately their next meeting is the second tuesday of next month so it's a bit out but as far as the trial and error maybe i was just thinking listening into all your thoughts and opinions i wouldn't be opposed to it's about two hours of my time to set up all this equipment it's a lot of wires and a lot of stuff that i have to make sure that's run correctly so that it's not in anybody's way so that it looks good um and but i i would um not be opposed to offering you guys to maybe do a trial run so maybe we can have a quick meeting for about five minutes um i can set everything up um and then just to see how you guys like it maybe you can have your family watch it from home and then see and maybe you can have some participants and then they'll be on the zoom part of it as well and then we can mix and mesh and um and then if you guys like it then why not go ahead but um that's an offer uh you guys are such great customers to find for many many years that i'd be willing to offer that at no cost just to see if you guys like it so as far as audio goes council member gaddis i agree with you it's difficult to make some mesh the ideal situation is if i can tap into the soundboard and then i've got straight feet i don't have background noises or anything sometimes you run into the issue i they mean rocks they don't have an input for me so i have a very good noise cancelling microphone that i set up right on their microphone and i get great audio i don't know if any of you if any of you saw the video but um it works well it's not perfect but i figure out the problems and how to go around it so i've got a great microphone or i can get a mixture and do my own audio line in so a lot of the stuff that you guys are worried about with sound problems with video problems i can help with that it's just you have to tell me what you want as the client and then me as the professional i can make it work and like i said i have no problems with uh demonstrating that so um that's my steel i guess i don't know if you guys have any questions for me or let's let me just say thank you for the free offer to council that you want to do i i don't have a problem with that i don't i would not want to try this out at an official meeting i would just like to have a dry run where it's just us we've got a few people out in internet land and we see how it goes now do you have some sort of a screen or do we have a screen now that we can use just to see you know what's coming in from the outside because you also test this properly a couple of us are going to have to be at home so that we can prove it out in all you know the hybrid the full hybrid so a couple people at home the group here that's another user and then we've got the call-ins and the listeners i'm not sure what technology you guys would have but i don't think it would be very difficult to plug into the projector and have whatever the zoom view is that's what we do at indian rocks they have their own projector it's a little bit different because they have it behind the council so you can see and it's easier for me because then i get a shot of that behind the people but they also have like screens turned around towards them so they can see but i'm sure we can figure out i can come up with some logistics to to give you guys a view of the zoom uh attendees as well uh we have one screen that we can kind of all see it doesn't have to be anything massive but just you to prove proof of concept anything can be done and there might be one or two little bugs but i can work it out always especially if we do a test run you know so so but i think it should be seamless and i really do believe like i said it's about two hours of my time to set everything up um and then probably just as much time to tear everything down so i wouldn't offer that at no charge if i didn't believe in it you know i really think that you guys would love it so that's why i'm saying that it's a good option so so are you proposing that you would um do the live feed like you do with indian rocks and simultaneously do a zoom meeting yes yeah i can it depends on what you guys want if you guys want to have your own staff do that that's possible but um i would recommend having someone on my team do it i probably won't do both at first maybe eventually when i get the flow of it but it is a lot of work as mr gaddis was saying too to make sure everything flows smoothly so i would recommend having someone anyone that knows how to set up a meeting properly and how to manage it so that you don't have yahoos entering the chat right so i wonder if um just kind of taking a step back right now we don't have a live feed at all so i think maybe offering live feed to the public is helpful but maybe limiting a zoom call to if a council member's on because that's a big problem is we don't have good communication if someone has to be out so it's very difficult to hear on the phone with the microphone next to it both on both ends so if we could like maybe take one one problem at a time right let's let's do the live feed let's look at doing the live feed maybe i'm speaking at turn and let's look at maybe just having zoom available for staff and council members initially i don't know that i don't i mean that could get crazy having public calling in on a zoo meeting maybe i'm wrong but yeah it's never foolproof that's i think that's a good suggestion to start off because you can you can vet people and you can try but once you let them start speaking and maybe you let a video i think in your rocks we don't even let video we just play audio but then you still don't know if they're gonna start talking normally and then all of a sudden slip something in there and then you have to meet them quickly you know um so it would be i think much better if you just let staff in there but that's up to you guys i just make stuff happen you guys make i the rules we had what almost six months of this and i can't recall a single problem that we had with anybody you know violating uh you know protocol in terms of fact actually people who agree with the vice mayor it actually worked very orderly i mean somebody's gonna have to be by the mute button because you never know anyone can dial in at any point in time but i thought the whole purpose of why we're doing this was to get the public kind of be able to come in remotely so i'm in favor if that's the reason this is all being done just to set up for council members i'm not as in favor of it like i think i will mention one other thing i've said this before it wasn't an indian rocks um one of your meetings it was the indian rock's big c i don't think you do that one right but at that last big c meeting we had hybrid i was at home trying to listen in i mean i was straining to hear them okay yes i think they use the same kind of equipment we do and unless you're talking like this you can't hear the person and so the hybrid was very very difficult for the people who were out on the other side and i just want to put that point on the record maybe we need to replace these this microphone system i mean there are better mics that can pick up almost spot pick up your voice because these you have to speak into and people just have a natural tendency if i'm going to speak to jodie shirley i'm going to turn like this that's just nature and as soon as i do that no one's hearing me maybe she'll hear me but no one else will and that stems from the production value um so you guys have a pretty decent mixer here it's all digital so it's not perfect everything's run through a computer but ideally if you guys had someone monitoring the levels if someone's speaking over here to the left you can boost that microphone up live if someone's watching that because they should see the levels that are going up and down and that can be addressed um i don't know if your system's set up for that or if you would need an upgrade but there's weights around that everything can be fixed it's just how much you guys uh are bothered by it and what you want to do about it but that's uh the easiest is just to get people to talk into the microphone you know but the masks don't help because you can't hear through them and even you can't see the the mouth movement so it's it's difficult times that we're dealing with now but um i i know you guys are doing the best you can to make do and i'm trying to help so so the microphones have been a problem yes since day one it's old technology we could do better and i say we shop around for my upgrades because it has always been about even where you're standing right now you're you're projecting your voice you're doing a pretty good job i don't really hear you through the va because you've got to be right and if we solve that that's that's part of the road to fixing this and so uh maybe that's where we started and then once we've got good microphones then he can come here and plug in and let's try some things um [Music] the zoo meetings worked really well for us i was really pleased with that and i think everybody kind of started hitting the stride there and i thought they were very productive meetings so i mean it was a very simple system to work i mean there's a little bit of a learning curve here or any you know my multimedia or whatever i mean coming up with a protocol maybe we start with something simplistic and work our way up rather than try to fit our meetings to the hardware and technology that we had start with something simple that we you know have a familiarity where they could work and the comments that i got from the outside was the zoo meetings were people were able to hear this people who only watched these things on tape or you know remotely and they said the difference is because everybody get here i'm just not doing it right now i'm pretty good with this i'm talking to you and i'm talking outside the mic they said everybody spoke to their mic because your computer was right in front of you so the audio was much easier to hear so if we can overcome that either through i would date i mean this was great 15 years ago or whatever there's better so it's not that expensive to replace 10 microphones let's get the proper ones and give people a little bit of latitude because i'm sorry people are going to turn their heads to face the person they're talking to you i've told people speaking to the mic 100 times and they just they get it through the topic and they forget they're not doing it intentionally and you could help us figure that before tell us what the right microphones are to get and definitely i do it for my own equipment all the time so i'm always upgrading um like i said i've got a very good universal microphone uh that probably wouldn't do great for like such a big room but if you got a couple of those you wouldn't have to then you have to figure out feedback issues and whatnot but there's much better technology that's digital now i think these are still xlr analog microphones so so it's it's definitely upgradable just someone straight we're talking about this only right now for council right we're not because this is this is going to cost extra obviously and we're not talking about doing this for all the other meetings that we do here at the city right not now i mean maybe someday right right i mean it's once it's up and running i mean how how big it leap is to just turn the system on and that's how you do business unless you your pain and moderator and for that kind of stuff you know and i think dave may have a point there maybe at some point and i mean the technology is there where everybody wears their little microphone little boob like in front of their mouth and or you clip it on and get rid of these things and no matter how you turn on [Music] [Music] that's what we all want you to do but we can't give you official authorization tonight this is a work session we're just able to discuss it but you kind of come to a consensus if we're all in agreement so we all agree with them hey i i still think we need to look at both technologies i understand pictures but i also think since we are going to spend the money for ipads i think we you know that there is another possibility that we can do this and connect it together and i agree with you dave patty can't do it it's going to take two people regardless of what we do and even indian rocks uses two people in my understanding so i think what we need to do is kind of get victor to put something together on paper that we can look at and then go back and do the same thing with this other possibility and just come back to you and take baby steps i don't want to go out to spend a bunch of money for something that won't doesn't finish like this and i think the zoo meetings uh for the most part you had a lot larger participation if you had that opportunity and if there's a way to get rid of that feedback we had it when we had a phone in the room when we did it this test the last couple days kyle and i but we did not have it when the phone was gone so the little bit of feedback that you're talking about there so that there again we've just got to figure out what the problem is we ended up and you're right these months are 10 years right 10 years old approximately yes yeah i mean some of them have been replaced but they're 10 years old so it's not current technology that's that's for sure and it's not the rest of our system i've seen these same microphones in other facilities and they're just this important i mean it's not that they're poor they were good at the time they're just it's not what we expect now like what glenn just said i mean you can put a little clip mic and that's the way they do tv interviews you have a little tiny thing that looks like a button it's not give you all a camera okay so do we want victor is is a can you get work on yours this month can you work on yours lynn can we get back on this in next month for a work session because that's we can't deal with this at a regular meeting maybe by the middle of the month yeah okay victory next month yeah sure sure you all good with that okay the only question i have is budget um you know uh you have to have something to work with and that's that's part of making getting how do i say the components together to figure out what that's going to cost us we don't have the components at this point we don't have that maybe we i don't know if you do victor or not because we print that room out with the old stuff we we may have to go buy something that you can plug into or whatever so we need to get that that cost together before you spend thousands of dollars on it there's victor mentioned to me about the covent grants is that exhausted at this point we have any more options under that we uh and and i will talk to gray to find out what they did because we we got a law enforcement grant for our open stuff so we were not eligible to go to the county for the same stuff because we didn't spend over that grant you know it was a 25 000 grant and we haven't exhausted all that so you can't do a duplicate brand it you can't collect twice i guess if i'm saying so it may be that we can take some of this law enforcement brand and we've got to buy some stuff and purchase it because we are doing it for uh it's out the bid right now the video cameras for the doors uh that's something that we're using with that clothing but we got from law enforcement so you can look into that and get back to us does anybody else have anything i think that takes care of two items one more thing maybe to add maybe if you guys can come up with a figure that you'd like to see also because i can make it like a five dollar cost but if you guys don't even have five dollars to spend on it it's not you know it's not um we're not winning but if you guys say hey we've got this grant and we expect to you know i can come up with my own figures but also i want to make it work for you guys that it's beneficial as well so um if you guys give me some guidelines that'll help me as well but uh but if not i can i can definitely work on a proposal um so this is something that's not in our budget yeah um but it's not something that can be in next year's budget and so in fact i just see that they give us our schedule so it means we're starting to think about it already um you know this this could easily be in there next time and this isn't going to be implemented tomorrow i don't think some things can i mean like you're saying you have zoom running well so if we can get a camera on the group here it's an option and i mean i wouldn't advertise it to the public as it's a fully functional zoom thing it's like hey it's in trial if you must hear that meeting that night that we're first testing it best to come to city hall that night you know it may have some hiccups we don't want to be responsible if it blinks the first night but you know we by the end that we had some issues in the beginning but by the end zuma's going great it's a shame you weren't allowed to continue with it i'm just going to say with relation to the budget i don't know that any of us have the expertise to even guess at a number right so you're gonna have to just take inventory and give us some numbers so we can budget it sure absolutely yeah yeah well we require once we have a proposal right now yes right now uh we can do up to i think it's ten thousand dollars and that's some things that we're even talking about in the code review because those those numbers were for 20 plus years ago it's a little different world you buy a lot of audio equipment i mean there's it's all over the place it's it's sometimes at auctions and so if you know what you're looking for you can buy it so yeah i was going to say for meeting you're never even going to come close to that anyways so it's not [Music] it would look weird at first but you know there's people who work in big offices with cubes and stuff on the phone you know they're on headsets anyway and people fly airplanes and the person sitting right next to you and talking to them on the headset because it's easier you can hear better right it's just that whatever we get we have to make sure that number one our speakers aren't doing anything and number two her microphone doesn't hear me at all so yeah it would have to be real close a little pedal type collar or whatever and it may work but the problem goes back to [Music] now you've got video you know you've got the video also so basically i guess we would i'll just have them right in front of us with our plug-in things and it would just be like we weren't here the last part of that is if you're talking through that your your sound is now going to come out of the audio system here and it will be a delay so that does create a little bit of a problem other than that that might work but the only people who'd really been listening to that screen are the audience we've been listening to each other on the headset and yeah i mean i think it's a trial and error kind of thing you're going to try a couple things even worse but definitely what you want to try something else kiss principles all right so everybody's good 7th seven o'clock uh moving forward item two discuss methods to mitigate costs of damage to city roadways and kurds by contractors working in the city this is proposed by vice mayor governor councilmember shirley and the issue is possible impact fees builder bonds etcetera uh i'll open it up to uh joey she's got a lot more experience yeah i did some um searches um some local municipalities and impact fees are very vague don't really know what they um what our local cities do i did find in the city of benitez springs they charge an impact fee they call it road impact fee they have a transportation impact fee too which is a separate condo but this is strictly for road repair maintenance for a single family of residents new construction they charge 12 350 and impact fees i'm not suggesting i'm just given some background here um not suggesting that we charge that sort of fee but that's what they do when we talk about bonding something typically your bonding and repair that you know already needs to be done so that's a tough one because you can't really have like a performance bond i don't know how we how we look at a bond i think it would have to be an impact fee of some sort talk to lynn and we don't we currently do not charge impact fees um we do need to hire someone to help us with um planning and zoning board has some things coming up and the person that would help with with the work that needs to be done there could possibly give us some guidance as well but i'm not going to say that every house that's built there's damage done but there's a lot of wear and tear on roads there's a lot of wear and tear on gutter systems and it's something to consider when you see you know loads of block load loads of concrete coming constantly especially over 22nd street bridge harrison avenue bridge you know the smaller bridges i don't think that they're engineered to accommodate that load it might be something as a pass through to the larger commercial traffic in here there's our disposal i mean whatever big trucks are coming through here and all that stuff the bridge repairs are an issue for us and we don't typically have a lot of control over this thing i mean just the surfacing going on down there on 20-second stuff i imagine some of that equipment is kind of pushing the limits of them so you know i i don't know no it it's the weight limit is buying going across the bridge the the issue we'll have as an example of johnny's having something delivered to his house well we don't have a person on every street to know that that person did some damage to the road uh mainly where we see a lot of the damages if we have some and it hasn't been a big problem uh is where we've got new construction and usually when you talk to the contractor about it because they're signing a form that says they'll repair them you know any damage they do they're signing our right away permit or sign their permit application that they're responsible for uh but as far as trying to find to catch we'll say a truck displays a garbage truck going down the street if somebody did some damage to something we aren't going to know that because you you are typically going to have a person that sees them doing it yeah i'm not talking about specific instances of damage as much as you know these guys are going through every street here twice a week and it's a large vehicle between the wheels on it and as those guys turn corners i mean there's a lot more friction on a tandem rig than whatever and it's kind of like coming up with some assumptions you know this size weight truck going down the street twice a week is going to cause accelerated wear and tear on the and it's kind of a leap of faith and an engineering assumption here that this damage is occurring and we're not going to point to any specific example unless we just happen to see it but we come up with some sort of impact we charge them up front or take it out of whatever service charges they have and it's just kind of a smart engineering map and an engineer could probably sit down and figure out or some smart highway engineer or those guys a team that that stuff all the time could probably say yeah there's accelerating blurry terror this is how we factor it into the budget [Music] but i don't think you're going to find many if any cities that charge a fee for a truck to drive down their street seems to me that the impact fee the only way you could actually charge being backed would be a fee tacked on top of permitted work that would be the only way possible to track what was going on and then the city engineer would have to look at every job that was getting permitted anyway and could come up with some sort of an assessment that's tacked on to the cost of the permit right that that's really what impact fee is development is a little different because they're talking about you know big developments and i know jody's totally familiar with that i did do some research too and you know as an example in and we're talking orlando but in orange county if it's a new construction house they charge a transportation impact fee and it varies based on the square footage of the house but as an example it's 3761 that's that's what they're charging a couple hundred more if it's uh outside of i guess somewhere outside of the main urban area but uh are our issue and i think we do need to do that with the planner we're going to retain a planner here very shortly start with complain have that discussion with them because they're very familiar with how the impact b system works i understand it to the point that as an example mainly developments it's not typically in a lot of places it's not single family homes it's a bunch of homes they're a bunch of condos and they pay an impact fee based on the acreage or they give you land or something for it so and there are credits but i think that what joey's saying about the bond i think i think you're kind of restricted with that bond uh because those line companies are going to come out and look you're you could end up in what you might call a leading dispute of some type but this isn't mine this is yours this is it wasn't caused by this person or that person so uh i think getting if you're going to get a fee you need to get it from the apartment i think can i add that i don't think necessarily only new construction because i'll i think i've shared this with you somewhere along the line i've got a huge chunk out of my valley gutter and and i believe it was the dock guy i have no way of knowing for sure but i think it was the dump guy dropped a piece of equipment on it or something and so um you know i think any permit issue maybe there should be a fee you know i don't know what that looks like but that's maybe where the planner can give us a fee schedule for things like that because if they have heavy equipment in there chances are they're going to break somewhere so that's the quick and simple solution this thing is tied to a permanent and specific job right right when chris wrote have any insight into something like this you know i could ask him i don't know you know he did the underground stuff i could ask that question but i think it would be tied to our comp plan like you said and i was looking through our code i think we did have some provisions for impact fees we just don't have any right it's it's uh and and in that section of the code it you know a person could say development okay a development well is the development one house or is it developed you know it's how the road is used so and we don't really have well we don't we don't have any developments we had unless they tore down a condo we built it we have a single family house that's been built so i think that's how we've got to tie it to the department system and can you do what councilmember shirley said could you do it for other permits that that may be possible i would think it would be any permit it's based upon basically we have a fee structure and it's also based on the size of the job so a little dock may not cost as much as a big dog if you're looking at the amount of weight the number of piles that are brought in and things like that it's it would be a calculation system that's not going to be very easy to come up with uh and it would take some time and perfect and i'm sure yeah it's it's you know like i mentioned here over in the orlando area if the house was less than 1200 square feet they're paying 3 700 okay more it's a little elevated but uh this one doesn't talk about any dogs or anything so that's a question i think you know we need to ask you know a planner would know all that typically so i think to the right of his point i mean i would not want to see us putting fees on garbage trucks because you know where that's going to wind up right back on that waterfall i mean they're not going to pay that they're just going to pay it and kill us um i do like the idea of some type of thing when you start the construction but tied to all permits i mean if i replace my front door and i buy it at home depot the impact to your road is zero um i've already paid registration fees and taxes for the city i don't think there should be any cap any impact fee on small projects you know when you start to bring in the heavy artillery you're doing an addition you're putting in you know bigger things that's when they start kicking in but you do something simple i mean that you need a permit for you know you change a water tank out i mean there's no impact i mean that's just another opportunity to get money out of people i don't like that part of it i do like the idea of protecting our streets though yeah impact fees aren't for that right now if you know again it was we were happy to get help during the hurricane but those guys tore the hell out of our roads they they ripped up two or three roads and you were aware of it i think you got some recovery they're finally getting it fixed now but a brand new paint job on my street and these guys used a backhoe uh bucket loader with the teeth and they were just digging up the asphalt as they were picking up the leaves so they should be paying for that kind of stuff too i mean in some cases we can get damages from people i agree with joey i see a piece missing out of my valley curb yeah you did it no i didn't and now you're in the litigation because no one's gonna unless you have witnesses you're not gonna get you're not gonna get it from them so i think if you're building a house it's almost inevitable you're gonna do some damage to the road so put a little charge on that um if you're putting up a fence not really right well there's some sliding scale on the purpose are are there is there's moving equipment involved i mean is there are there materials over 20 000 pounds involved is are there concrete trucks coming in i mean it's a it's a spectrum you know and there's a question here that will be attached to the program okay you have the materials delivered what is it how much are you having worth moving your brought in and that kind of stuff okay each one has there is a code provision that addresses this it's section 58-32-g and that provision says any person or contractor causing damage to any city road or street while loading or unloading materials tools or equipment shall be responsible for the repairs to the damaged road or street so that does exist as everybody has noted the complication comes in identifying who caused the damage and if there's a construction site and you at least have some basis to narrow it down lynn and i discussed this briefly and one of the things that i think you could do is based on that code provision if a contractor who is working a site does damage things you can send them a bill and if they don't pay it then you have the basis to go to code enforcement and bring a code enforcement case against them for not complying with the city's code so i just we we talked it through from the standpoint of how do you practically address the situation and that's that's one of the ways that you could do it all right what you can do i think it would take a little bit on the city's part but take a photograph of the curves and the street for the firm you know right around the permit issue time have the contractor sign it that he saw that there was no damage go back there again to the project take another photograph he's free and clarifying if not he pays mark that's a good point i mean you know you rent a car they walk you around they say show me all the scratches and dents and we'll mark them off for you now they even photograph them and stuff you can do the same thing i mean it takes a little bit effort from our city sport but basically the gc whoever's running that job it's your problem now you know i don't you can fight it out with all your whether it was your brick delivery guy or your wood delivery guy that's not our problem the problem is you started with a good road you started with a good valley curb it got broken it was before here's afterward you know you want to find it fight it but maybe you know an alternative if we don't want to go the impact fee is to have them either put a deposit or post some type of a bond and then you know just deduct from it i don't know but it seems like a simple way of doing it and then for the person who is good they're not paying any extra so there is a person who's going to be very careful about not scoring up the street and messing things up so maybe they shouldn't i think it's too hard though i think it's the uh roadway curb in front of the house and the wear and tear on the road down the road not not just everything that happens directly in front of the home that's being repaired and the damage is not noticed immediately it builds up over time i think an impact fee provided that we guarantee that it is used for maintenance of our curves gutters and streets a win it's a win it's a win for everyone except for the person who's got to pay a little bit more but if you're bringing big heavy equipment in absolutely i believe you should have to am 18 because it does do damage it may not be visible at the time but you have 10 of them and suddenly you do have physical damage well maybe maybe it's a good point both minimum depending upon the job and also photograph the curves in front of the home you're both we'll collect some more data for you and i'll check a little probe with the flanders she's going to be sending us a contract for the top plan and i'll talk to her and i'll make a call wrong consensus that can move forward with this at least all right item three discuss reducing speed limit on volta well we've talked about this for a while i know marv has talked about this um it just kind of makes sense to me that the speed would be consistent with indian rock speech if you have the speed decrease that kind of lowers the threshold for the sheriff to give a ticket like right now it's 35 if someone's going 44 or 45 they won't get a ticket but if it's 30 that same person will get a ticket after a few tickets are given work gets around people won't speed through there um if the traffic is going more controlled slower it's easier for people to pull out on to golf until the left like from 22nd 21st you know nursing any of those roads to be able to get out um hopefully it will decrease traffic as in the sense of keep it going slower around the big houses where they like to stop it won't be such a drastic going from 40 to 25 to look at the house maybe going from 30 to 25 won't be so noticeable so the traffic would still flow because we all know around the 18th 19th the big houses that's where all the slowdown is but creepy and that's not going to go away so i just i just wanted to talk about it and stop kicking it down the road and let's see what steps we need to take to get it done if that's what we all feel needs to be done from 35 to 30. [Music] i think that would help on the causeway because i know a lot of people you know you have the whole slow down of and the they start speeding up because they see that you can if it stays at 30 then there's it eliminates that problem i'll just finish my fault we talked about this a long time let's do it okay we can't do it unilaterally i think the best we can do i'll look over to lynn because he'll know i think the best we can do probably as a resolution and tell the county that we want this done because they're both counting roads um whatever procedure they have that to actually make it go down i don't think it's going to be simple but um i agree you know we take these surveys and we say 85 percent of the people don't break the law right 85 of the real people in the real world don't break the law but we still have a police force for the 15 that do and it's those 15 that are speeding at crazy rates you come out of indian rocks it's all lit up and there's businesses you get to bellar beach it looks like we're asleep at night and i could hear it where i live they met it was and then it's a straight away it's a drag strip and sooner or later you know we're going to wake there's no reason you don't gain anything in our two-mile city by going five extra miles an hour it's just too small of an area so it's not like we're picking up anything and the road is no different here it's all residential so i say drop it mark i'll agree we're still going to be able to do 35 so all the people have been doing 35 for the last 30 years are still going to do 35 because of the latitude bellar bluffs side of the bridge is 30. and if you take your foot off the accelerator coming over the hump by the time you hit the bob you're doing 38 or 40 just coasting so if you're doing 35 coming down at the bellar beach you're doing 45 coasting down and to get out time to go goldar you know five they're doing 45 out there there's no question about it they're doing 10 over everybody's rule of thumb i think i've put new intent over my whole life so especially when you when you started in clearwater you can't wait to get off the beach at night so they're pushing it right to the limit and you know police have been very kind and they've been letting that 10 mile an hour over the speed limit just the way it is and we've all come accustomed to it so i think the only way to curtail some of this stuff is drop at the third be consistent with dollar gloves be consistent with indian rock speech i mean hey there's people crossing the streets not too much now because of it but when this stuff clears up our residents are going to be crossing and it'd be nice to drop it 10 miles an hour just for the safety safety that's all what's your proposal for side streets i haven't changed anything i talked about once upon a time but side streets are the same streets you want to leave it alone because everybody has been saying don't mess with the side streets so they won't yes you have well obviously in the perfect world we would drop the side streets too but i'm wearing the baby steps let's do the 30 miles per hour let's not throw too many things and get crazy let's do 30 miles per hour on golf and then see how it goes six months whatever and then if side streets are still an issue then you can address those but let's take the main big problem and address that first what i have some concerns about unexpected consequences i i don't know and congestion is a problem what's the impact going to be the normal speed limit five miles per hour during easter break or something i can't even imagine but i think there's going to be some unexpected consequences to that the indian rocks uh example the narrows those roads are down there are super narrow it's down to two lanes there it's a huge condo community down there they have a lot more commercial businesses the condos are on one side of the street the businesses are on the opposite side of the street and guess what people and pedestrians are crossing all day long you know they don't use crosswalks you know so all of the road hazard lights don't make any difference down there so you've got narrow roads you've got flooding issues down there you've got high pedestrian traffic 30 miles per hour makes a huge amount of sense down there we've got a very wide boulevard there's a center lane there for people turning out i think it's different now i will also say that the new speed limit sign i think is a great addition here and i would i would hardly support getting a couple more of those out there because i think and i've stood out there for like 15 minutes at a time and watched traffic going past there and literally the traffic was going 30 miles an hour or less already so i think those signs are making that one size making an impact and i think if you had a couple of them on each side maybe that's the biggest step you should try that sign was put in by the county now i know those traffic signs come with the capability to capture the bet i'd be traffic speed bet the sign does it does this sign captured in a speed data i i can't answer that question yeah i i know like from a city's job that i went to you know there was like three or four of these guys all trying to sell their uh speed uh traffic calming stuff and they have options that go into these signs and they can act you can actually go in on a weekly basis or something and download the speed there so i mean it captures you know the average speed the time of day and that kind of stuff and maybe that's the kind of discovery should be looking at before we just make a jump here i i understand where you're going with this and i support the signage doesn't try that maybe and see that but i think indian rocks isn't a great example because their situation is a lot different than what we have and i'm concerned about the unexpected consequences so uh i would need more in favor put some more signs up and see [Music] i wouldn't get out of that before we just automatically do that time to that sign um that actually that sign came out of the discussions that the city manager and i had with tom washburn and the folks with the county only about two years i mean it actually took two years to get that signed because i had noticed and i was told by law enforcement people that people were things were slowing down around um around 18 to 19 street here because you could only guess that people were looking at the nice houses and stuff um and i actually put myself in a couple traffic jams a couple days and that was the case it broke after that after heading north we thought that there was traffic all the way to clear water that wasn't the case not at least when i drove it uh people were slowing down so that's what that sign was for i mean if it's getting people to maintain the speed limit then that's terrific i don't know though the guy who's going to unleash the motorcycle at 70 miles an hour if anything's going to make him stop and you know we do have i just don't see what the big urgency in our city to get through that extra five miles per person i just don't see it it's 30 miles on one side of the bridge that somebody told me was the only bridge in the country that has two different speed limits on it and it's probably right because i've never seen that one side has one speed limit one side has another if i can't go through belair gloves at 35 then why are you coming through bellar beach i mean we're all residential it's all houses outside there and of course condos up in northern city but for the most part it's all houses mark you know we've got a similar situation in iraq's beach on the north end of indiana beach there's a lot less congestion a lot less residents and i've been going through there for over 20 years i have no problem making it through any rock speeds at 30 miles an hour the thing that we have more up on this end is on the weekends and right over this past year the traffic collapsed but when things are in full swing we have a lot of bicycles that go between here and so and you know unfortunately they do not follow the rules and when it comes up to the causeway area and people are flying at 45 miles an hour and you come to all of our islands we got it gets a little risky when they're two and three oppressed but glenn i understand your data driven guy i appreciate that and but but still in all sense of the word safety has always been my thing and i still feel that pulling out of there when these cars are going by at 40 is not safe pulling out when you've got cars down both ways at 40 miles an hour you're trying to get in the middle of lane i can't tell you how many times it got close where i get almost clipped that's just the nature of the beast um what makes you sure that slowing traffic down is not going to make them get closer together i'm just hear me out for a minute okay 35 going across belair causeway i understand coming back that's a problem and i think that we actually discussed putting one of those felony signs at the bottom of the bridge and is is that actually going to happen or yeah tom uh put a box out here and i've got to call it to him about because dad will come out of those boxes or just come you know they're flashing lights and i asked you for an update on that and um that's the plan so when you're coming down the bridge and what we're looking at is uh it'll be a little bit across past this uh hylene sound and that way you can see that flashing coming down just like you do on the other side and we started with one going north because that was the biggest issue with people thinking we were speeding and going that way for the public uh the county pays for those so it's not going to prosper anything it's just okay so anyway the point i was making if we put a sign up coming down the hill going past city hall and entering gulf boulevard don't really know what that's going to do we don't know if that's going to help or not but i would at least like to see if it would help before we went lowering our speed limit and going the other direction this is what i've noticed if i'm coming from indian rocks beach that is from indian rocks beach and i'm going through the narrows it's bumper to bomber it's 30 miles per hour as soon as we hit 35 i've noticed that suddenly there's distance between the cars and and people aren't they're not on each other's tail the whole time then whenever you get back you make the right turn you go over the bridge everybody's faced out pretty well as soon as you get down to the hill boom everybody's backed up again and i'm the reason why i'm asking for the council to at least try adding that one more sign and let's see what we get before we completely change it is because i'm not sure if it's really going to help you know i understand the safety issue but at the same time if everybody's bumper to bumper because you've slowed everybody down from somewhere else and it starts as soon as you're entering bel air bluff down west bay the speed limit changes and everybody you have a traffic light and then you have bumper to bumper traffic until it speeds up to 35 again and so you know i'm just i'm not 100 sold on slowing us down without some sort of proof that that's the way to go because once we do it i don't think there's going back my fear again is the unexpected consequences numerous conversations we've had about traffic problems here at villarreal beach the resounding problem i always hear is and it comes from our is getting out of the side streets there's no breaks in the traffic so it's a it's a time speed distance problem if you slow down the traffic they got to get closer together and you get my mom driving down the road and if it's 30 miles well she's going to drive at 20. and guess what all those other spring breakers behind her are dragging i'm just concerned of the unexpected consequences we solved one problem by letting them turn on the red that's what created all the cars coming over and you can't get out so now that they can turn on red that created a problem getting out in the truck we used to have a break nobody could make a turn you could get out every so long every time that light changes now it's a continuous flow so that's where the problem occurs again in front of those big houses we just proved it if i can address what dave and glenn were saying to me the 30 to 35 if you're going 30 and then the next area is 30 nothing changes you just you keep going it's like a consistent flow of traffic the problem with the stop and go comes is when the hot rod's like now you know 45 and grandma's like oh now i'm going to go 25 and that's the difference but if it's a consistent thing there's no reason to up down up down your speed to get that variable it's a constant obviously grandma and hot rod are always going to be there but for the most part it's a con it's kind of like on the highway when it's 70 miles per hour there's a steady flow as soon as you get to that 60 it slows down you get the 70 goes up and down because of the some people might in the speed limit and some people not see to me it's more of a constant flow and yeah right like that did hurt us coming out but it helped the bridge so it's kind of like one of those things you have to deal with but they were going slower maybe there were opportunities to squeeze out without somebody going faster so i think it's worth a shot um yeah i'm gonna go with you or and or lynn because i mentioned it before we can debate this all night and we don't have to we just put this up as a resolution and you can get a number down yes or no vote on it but the question is how is that the right way to do this because the county we can't tell the county what to do we could only tell them what our council agrees with so what's the right procedure if we wanted to go forward with this well i think i think you probably have to adopt a resolution to ask them and i'll i'll clarify that with them also to make sure that that's the process i know when the bridge was built there was that discussion back and forth and at the time the city council didn't want to speak lower to what the other side did there was a discussion with the other side to try to raise theirs and they didn't want to do it either clearwater since 35 and then rocks was 30. so they're kind of all over the place everywhere you go you go block past publix and it's 35 so you know you've got places that are 200 feet long so i asked a quick question just regarding the county um golf boulevard is also occupied by fellow shores so i don't think we can unilaterally ask beller who asked pinellas county to change the speed limit without participation from relationships that's true on that section with their museum i wanted to address section 58-4 which is a provision in the city code related to speed limits subsection d states uh amendment all speed zone all speed limit zones established by this section shall be lawful until such time as they are amended by the city council no amendment to the provisions of this section shall be enacted by the city council until after an investigation determines such a char change is reasonable as stated in florida's statutes section 316.189 per m1 so i i think based on that provision the most appropriate thing if you want to consider this especially because gulf boulevard is not under your jurisdiction is to ask lynn or direct lynn to initiate a conversation with somebody at the county level to at least raise this as a possibility and then i i don't know in the past what what the investigation has entailed whether it's a i assume it's a some sort of a study um but that's what your code requires so i i think that to me is the starting starting point is to at least have a discussion with somebody in the county you have tom washburn stand like right here and say that we could do that i think he could tell us that not too long ago and that's who we've been dealing with for i've been dealing with it for two years lynn's been doing longer than that so i don't know what else we have to do i mean you know i know we can't change it and yes there's another city involved i got that um you know at least until 19th street and it's all ours but what do we you know i mean study it again i mean we're studying this thing to death here i don't know what else we you know this council says we think it's in the safety of the city to reduce the speed and it'll come up for a vote i mean it has to get four votes and that recommendation goes to the county then it's up to whatever their procedure is like that's why i asked before what is the procedure because i thought tom washburn told us that we could ask them to lower the speed limit well that's what he said my studies here i could have heard them wrong but that's not that's why i think it's you know what i've heard is you want me to get a little more direction from the county we need to clarify the other city's position uh as far as they're concerned that they weren't awarded or raised and then i'll come back to you with that robin does that work for you in terms of the timetable you bring this up as soon as next meeting but it sounds as if we get better information might have a better chance to be behind i'm just tired of getting more information and having the same information a year later and still have nothing done well for you but um i have no problem asking the county tom's been pretty good with us but sometimes it takes time a little while i'm being very nice with that i mean there's times it's taking top months to get back to us so and i'll do this we can move that along in real time yeah and i'll talk to when that will that might help okay i'd just like to add a final final comment if you see the traffic from far away going south on california it's like a racetrack on weekends when you've got a lot of cars turning south it's a racetrack getting to the merge area all you can hear is accelerating engines when i heard another engine that was roaring even better it was the sheriff so that was one thing uh three things one is with respect to [Music] stabilized traffic how many times have you gone down a road where you're doing 50 miles an hour and all of a sudden traffic is backed up for a mile doing creeping along bumper to bumper and you get past them and it's like the traffic opens up and there was nothing there on the side of the road it's because those pulses build up on and any traffic engineer will tell you those pulses on the stop and go traffic and can hang as long as 30 minutes to an hour so if you throw in traffic lights throw on pedestrian crossings you get these big pigs moving through the snake there and those are the things no it's not just because everybody's doing 30 it's going to stay 30. the uh one of the models that was used for the traffic calming protocol came from the pinellas county so i don't know what's involved in this stuff that's the stuff that needs to be clarified you know i don't know where this anecdotal drag strip stuff's coming from i don't hear it at my end i don't do six blocks across the street from me and i'm not i'm over on a saturday night because i and i do i ride a motorcycle at night and i ride in them and i don't hear it and i've not seen my buddies out there and the traffic's moving at 30 35 miles an hour so i'm not quite sure i can hear it from my backyard and i'm right across the street for me i'm out there all the time too but i don't i don't hear it i think it's back to the perception right you hear the loud sounds of the motors and some of those you know little fast motorcycles the young guys ride you know they they rev up the engine they're not necessarily it's kind of like i'm standing on my street talking to a neighbor and someone goes by clearly they weren't going over the speed limit but when you're standing in the street and it just it was perception it felt like they went past us too fast but they weren't though i'm certain and we're not going under the speed limit and and so we have to be cautious that we're not perceiving that there's a problem that may or may not be there i have a lot of the same problems you have mark getting out but you know it's it's part of it you know i don't care if i'm pulling out here or trying to pull out of publix you can't get out of publix either so i can't ask them to change the traffic situation on west bay drive because i because i'm nervous about pulling out into traffic i mean and that's really it's my old age and inability to see that makes it hard for me to pull out the traffic up there so i guess i got scared [Music] well basically what what i see is that you could put a five mile per hour speed limit out there and no matter what someone is going to do 50 it's just gonna happen i i'm not saying that you guys have a bad idea but i'm not also not saying that you have a good one either because for a year and a half we debated slowing down 22nd street all of the neighborhoods wanted that we weren't even discussing gold boulevard at the time it was just the feeder streets because everybody drag races down that and people are going to get killed and for whatever reason it didn't it didn't go through we we just couldn't come to an agreement the citizens didn't nobody wanted any they didn't want the speed limit change they didn't want speed humps they didn't want flashing signs they didn't want anything they just wanted everybody to slow down and there was no citizen buying well now that that's that there's no way that that one would go we're going to well or at least that's the appearance that i'm that i'm i'm seeing is uh is that i'm afraid that we're just looking for a win on something can we slow somebody down somewhere i just don't want to go that route unless there is there's a true payoff if you sit by my deck and you watch the bridge which you can you can see the cars right down over that bridge so you know they're not doing 30 miles an hour right and i asked nicely if we can get a speed sign that slows it alerts people what they're doing i see that sign and i'm embarrassed to see to allow somebody to see me doing three or four miles over that speed limit sign that as you're entering valerie below i just think it's something we should at least give it a chance before we go to the full extreme of lowering the entire city speed level i think you find out when you're speaking with tom i mean again two years is not going to work okay i want this to be in robin's lifetime she's brought this up multiple times it's not going to be in mark's lifetime he put two times on council let's try and get this you know in some of our lives unless you want to run again um but one second and so ask tom how quickly we can get those other signs today's point i'm coming over you know i'm sorry 35 is the right number on that bridge when you're posting downhill because you're going to be doing a little more but when i see that sign i hit the brakes because i want to pass that sign doing dirty and i think that if they are they can be effective so it is maybe an alternative to dropping it the guy who's going to rev up his hot rod or his motorcycle he's going to see how high that sign will go up before it will stop giving him a number so they don't care i mean i've seen drag racing on the street again i live there so i don't just when i buy it once or twice i live there 24 7. i can sit in my office and see the traffic and i can tell you just by looking at them if they're going exceptionally fast i would say 90 of the people follow the rule it's not the 90 it's the 10 that are going to kill someone so so that's what we're i guess going this really has to come up for a resolution and we're going to do it but i think we need more information clinton we've done speed surveys we've done over and over and it keeps calling back to the same music so obviously the police and the sheriff's office have their opinions on this we have different thoughts on this thing and and no amount of debate is going to change this this thing here so it may be time to survey the residents of governor beach to see if there's a problem on federal beach because on both boulevard because i have a different constructive speed and you know numeric just like you said you know that kid on his gixxer motorcycle they do but 30 miles an hour speeding certainly not going to change that so you know that one guy poops in his pants and we all end up wearing diapers so that's that's the analogy here and so let's see if if the rest of the residents of pillar beach have this construct that we've got this speaking problem and my god you know there's there's blood in the streets here and i'm seeing other people agree with that or they're saying hey man i want to get to work another one i don't want to sit there and wait for cars whatever so maybe we need to put out a survey in there and survey the records let's just make it happen in real time and not study this one to death i mean you're right we've had a lot of data but i discounted that only that it doesn't it shows 85 compliant i can tell you that without a box you can stand there and you can see most people are doing the speed limit it's not you know again what i said before most people don't break the law but you don't get rid of your police force because there's that five and ten percent of people that break the law and those are the ones you want to catch same deal here is the five to ten percent that are causing the problem it's not the people who are adhering to the rules i'm not bothering here i was lowering the speed limit five miles an hour where to stop those little calcitrants when i speed all the time it lowers the threshold for ticket giving and if they start getting tickets then that's going to determine you can't have a guy there seven by 24. that's the problem no nor 24x7 but you can have them there when they're there they catch the guy because they're not going to have that you know okay they're 145 it's fine now it's going to be oh they're going 45 it's supposed to be 40 let's give it a ticket it's not going to happen it's not going to happen you can't have a guy there well of course you're not gonna have the guy there all the time but when they are there they'll have the opportunity to catch somebody you never have a guy there any time if those guys are speeding already why aren't they getting caught well if they're going 45 now 35 it lowers the threshold you got that 5 10. but you're all in admission you're saying they're way over the 35 miles an hour so they're way outside that that five mile per hour threshold they're already outside the threshold so they should be getting tickets already i agree and we've already talked about that with the sheriffs but this gives them even more latitude because now they'll have a lower threshold they're not getting they're not writing those tickets because they're not there to catch them they're just kind of a work bounces back and forth forever it's the problem is there's too much latitude there's always been too much latitude if you drop it the five 8 15 15 over ticket is gonna you got a couple of those and you're done and i agree so that ginger guys out there doing 60 miles an hour using golf bull bars as a drag strip and a sheriff season he's going to write him a ticket as a matter of fact he may very well put him in cuffs and take him down to the jail but the issue is he's still not being caught so what's the difference whether the speed limit sign says 35 or 30 he's already so far in excess of the speed limit if the sheriff was there he's going to write him up anyway the sheriff isn't there well i mean it's not just the speed racers going 60 or 70 we all know that they're out it's the ones that are going like 45. 45 47 that now if the speed limit was 30 then over 40 41 they'd get a ticket and stop doing that it's not i mean we all know the extremes are just like grandma i'm going 10 should also get a ticket so i mean it's it take out the extremes because yes they should automatically get a ticket regardless now or 30 miles per hour i'm talking about the ones that are pushing the limits those are the ones that are in excess or not in excess those ones are still going too fast but not crazy speed racer so those are the ones that are going to get caught more it's going to get a reputation of hey you got to mine the rules and people are going to slow down and it's going to be more orderly and reasonable as far as speed if the vast majority of traffic is moving at 30 to 35 already where are these people doing 45 to 50 there's no room between the traffic to be accelerating to 50 miles an hour when she passed 18th and 19th i had to leave houses excuse me say something okay so our city code section 58.4 subsection c has a provision of how we handle this i say we take a step back we follow our code we get lynn engaged talking to the county talking to the adjacent city because there's nothing that we can do anyway we can sit here and argue this all day and we can't even do anything without meeting that criteria first okay so so that's when you'll get on if you get back to us this is a work session item so this is another one for a follow-up or hopefully the next work session if you can um and see what kind of time tables yes you have to speak to across the street but bad enough we got a bridge that has two speed limits we're not gonna have a street that has two speed limits on each different side that's crazy so yeah so something we could do of our own volition though is put up a couple of numbers flashing digits what we can do i mean that's something that's a quick hitter kind of thing i've already requested the one for here this one they did the speed study i want to say end of november and we got it this week so it you know it takes a couple months but my understanding from tom is they they have a contract set up for those already so the first day i will say this one was kind of jumping around i saw joey's i was doing zero nine one day but then when i went back another couple times i don't know if it was calibrating itself like yesterday and today it was right on i mean my speedometer and it does slow the traffic some of these may go quickly but i never know all right item five um discussing the formation of a procedure to address partial attendance at council meetings and work sessions is brought by nate how to record partial attendance at council meetings with respect to the absence policy um i just was thinking about you know we now have an abstinence policy this is not about any individuals this is about we've had a couple instances where people have to leave for they don't have to give us a reason medical reason or what happened if they attempt to have a meeting or a quarter of a meeting or something like that without driving paddy crazy how do we deal with this do you get credit for meeting when you come here and participate when you answer the bell and count at the roll do you get credit when you go through a whole meeting i don't have an answer i figure we better figure it out before it starts to you know we start to get partial absences so um what do we do with people who don't you know aren't able to stay for a whole meeting or late you know what have you obviously don't like being a person who's five minutes late but you know two hours late well you know how you attended the meeting so what do we do i'm gonna go back to what we said um previously when we talked about this we're all adults i think that if someone has to leave a meeting maybe because they have a prior obligation there's something that's it's pressing they're at their late they may be late coming from work they may have had a sick child they may have had a number of things and i think they're it's just not an issue it hasn't been an issue and i think that if you're here then you get counted present there's no there's no because robin had to take her child to the doctor and it shows up 20 minutes late that's foolish to count someone absent for something like that i just don't think it's it's not a problem we haven't had an issue with anyone you know not attending meetings and i just don't see it as being an issue i don't think it needs to be discussed it's going to be discussed i don't know if we're going to do anything on it but um what do we you know if we want to take a wait and see that's fine we'll wait and see um but if you show up for five minutes then it's as good as showing up for three hours basically is that what we want i would jody that i think right now it's i think a couple instances that i can think of you know are rare so i would say let's hold this off until it becomes a regular problem with everybody doing it you know jody doesn't next me and i do it the next one or if it's a single person whatever the issue arises let's just i would say wait until it becomes an issue before we try to solve the issue you pretty much agree with that okay we'll wait and see then item six discussion regarding amending more against section 26-3-d pertaining to city council discussion of current or prospective lawsuits discussion of need for regular updates to the city and the city council for missing attorney regarding status lawsuits or threat lawsuits provide made description discussion over restrictiveness of ordinance constitutional implications and how it impairs the city's ability i should say two address threatened lawsuits or actual lawsuits discussion need to keep city council and the city in form of lawsuit and trend laws and status we're not going to discuss any particular lawsuits this is just about deception and this i praise this to fred just in a casual conversation he was absolutely the one who found this section but our present laws our president orton says the presiding officer on the request of the city attorney shall rule out of order discussion by the city council of matters that are the subject of any current or of spanish say perspective litigation um my take on this and fred i'm going to be asking you next what i think but my take on this has got a couple issues here first issue is that we're allowing some individuals to speak on this namely the public and not the council and i think that since this is a public forum a limited one at that you're denying individuals the right to speak about it i understand the logic behind it you don't want to uh in any way to encumber the law that will also be friendly so that's problem number one i think everyone should have the right to speak or no one should have the right to speak in here we can set the rule either way or you let some citizens speak we're citizens too and then you say other citizens can't speak think you've got a potential problem that's number one that's the constitutional issue the second issue is that we actually shoot ourselves in the foot this is a policy that was not brought by this council this goes back i looked in 1999 or 19 2007. um it's an older policy i think the spirit of florida's sunshine law says that council is supposed to be able to speak about litigation i don't see how you could solve litigation okay we have several i think four or five letters that i've seen of late you know over last year i don't know the status of some of those and either there's the city in a lot of cases i don't know if the city realizes that there's even threatened litigation we don't get to talk about threat and litigation we don't need to talk about actual litigation so i guess my question to you is somebody wants to bring a lawsuit we can't talk about it up here as a council so you can't defuse it early you can't stop it before it gets to court if there's any merit to settling they can't settle it outside of here because my understanding that the city council has to approve any settlements of lawsuits or potential lawsuits and then when there's an actual lawsuit we can't settle that either so what are we supposed to do take every case to a jury trial i mean there's provisions in the florida code to operate in the shade legally in the shade on lawsuits and you have a stenographer it has to be done according to the rules but you actually can meet as a council and discuss these things i don't see how we could ever settle any litigation short of taking it to a jury trial based on this restricted policy so i know that spoken to you about it probably you know just casually but i wanted to bring it up because we saw stuff the other week and there's there's stuff out there and what do we do with this stuff just letting go to jury trial that may not be the best and smartest move so i'll go to you and then come back to council okay i'll try to address the points you raised the first one with respect to i mean you were at the city code provision and that is is addresses the citizens addressing the city council the the problem you have every time a citizen comes to the podium is you don't know what they're going to say and you at least have to listen to them for some period of time until you really get some understanding of what they're going to say and oftentimes people are are inartful and nervous and everything else and it's difficult to really know what they're talking about so that to me i know that's a i'm stating the obvious but that it's a practical problem every time that a citizen comes to the podium it's not unique to bel air beach i will say that having said this when it's come up in the past i i made y'all aware that of what your current rules are and they're you know that's that's what you're obligated to comply with until you'll see fit to change your current rules and you could change your current rules if you wanted to the i i want to separate apples and oranges between prospective litigation and current litigation if it is current litigation there is a florida statute provision which is 286.011 subsection 8 that provides you with the ability to have a they typically refer to as a shade meeting where the city council meets this is a notice thing and you reconvene out of the public with the attorney and a court reporter who records the the shade meeting at the shade meeting you're obligated it's a narrow exception to the sunshine law and you have to to really do two things and that's that's defined by statute it the the subject matter of the meeting shall be confined the settlement negotiations or strategy sessions related to litigation expenditures that's what you're supposed to discuss in a shade meeting anything outside of that narrow scope is off limits and if you insist on discussing other things related uh that are outside the scope of that provision then you're arguably violating the sunshine law so if you under your current code your current code is consistent with section 286.0118 because it relates to pending litigation the one that i think is is obviously far more problematic is perspective and prospective litigation is um you know it could be a citizen coming before you and saying i'm going to sue the city and you know when they say those magic words does that now trigger this code provision arguably it does the other more common thing that happens is the city manager receives a claim letter from an attorney that is following the statutory requirement of giving the municipality notice in advance that there is a they intend to someday in the future file a claim and they're putting the city on notice and the purpose of that statute to my understanding is to give the city an opportunity to evaluate whether that claim has merit and if so then to do something about addressing it and potentially resolving it prior to it having to go to a uh you know have a lawsuit filed and then going through the court proceeding so i i'm not going to tell you it's not a quandary it is a quandary because the what the way the codes code's written um what the the way and and i i don't like saying the way around it because my job is not to find the way around things in the way in the context of circumventing things the way to address it that we've done in the past is if there is litigation there is and there's you know something that needs to be discussed then typically i've had a one-on-one conversation with each of the city council members i have the typical restrictions on me i can't pull seven people and you know like i don't share information what i do is i say the same thing seven different times to seven different to seven different individuals and explain to them this is the nature of the claim this is where it stands and this is what the city is going to do about it there are there are typically i would say a number of different types of claims i'll pick pick two for convenience one is there's a uh an injury that occurs on city property that that is typically going to be a covered by the city's insurance so when we get that claim letter the lynn and i have received several of those and we typically coordinate and of course the city has an insurer the claim letter is provided to the insurer and they assign claims counsel that then reviews the the status of the claim and prepares to mount a defense if if this is a case that's going to go forward the other type of claim that is you know periodically happens with a municipality is a civil rights type claim and when that comes in that's also an insured risk and it goes through the same process the letter comes in to the city manager him and i discuss it and we immediately get it to the city's insurer who assigns claims council that evaluates the claim and what what to do about it the missing link is what mayor manzo has identified is once it has been communicated to the city's claims council then how how does the information flow back and forth from the claims council and i i will use a you know a very generic example if the city got a claim for a personal injury such as a slip and fall then they the claims council could do the same thing that i i have done which is communicate with individual city council members as to the status of the claim and provide information as to you know what what is the the thought process about defending the the city in the against the potential claim but i all this being said i don't have a magic bullet about discussions related to prospective litigation that that occur here and that again you've identified what is a uh quandary and that is simply what it is not just the prospective litigation the way i read this and i agree you know it was my point on that i'm glad you agree with that but it's also on the once the lawsuit any lawsuit is filed reading this thing i would have to stop any discussion even if we were in the shade according to this we can't discuss this this is not a good rule this rule needs to go well to be able to discuss this stuff and you know if trial counsel recommends to us that the case be settled and not risk a monumental jury award that's up for council here to say yeah we're going to listen to council and trial council and settle this case up or no we don't listen take it to trial according to this i have to stop any discussion that the council is having on this i don't know what we're supposed to like i disagree with you on that okay i think the section 2-6-3 which is addressing the city council is oriented towards the other rules or are towards citizens addressing the city council i think the shade meeting is certainly sanctioned by to it section 286 286.0118 in florida statutes and i i think that is is different from this rule out of order discussion by the city council of matters that are the subject of any current or prospective litigation so we convene in the shade and the trial council says hey good idea to settle this woman i have to say sorry we can't discuss this that's i mean that's what i'm interpreting it and i guess i'm the presiding officer so i can't understand it i'm also an attorney to me it says i can't talk about it and forget about yes the citizen one is another issue but this is actual litigation how do you settle it how do we approve a settlement even if you come to an agreement the city council has to still approve the settlement but i'm drawing a distinction between section 2-6-3 which is addressing the council and this rule pertains to a citizen coming to the podium at a public meeting and addressing the council all the other rules are oriented towards that i see what you're doing okay so you're saying it's addressing a citizen addressing okay so then you've convinced me because this is the only address only dealing with the addressing of the council the only issue we have now is [Music] so that's a downside to not being able to laugh and smile so this only deals with addressing the council so we can meet according to the shade meeting and discuss the sun the problem comes in um there can't be any discussion the citizens can speak on something the council can't speak back well i'll say what to me it's obvious but at times i realize it's not as obvious the my assessment of this provision is that the real policy reason behind it is that the council shouldn't be put in the position of in a public meeting with no notice having to respond to a citizen coming before them and explaining the basis for a lawsuit that's either prospective or pending and the purpose of that when it gets down to it is it's the council should not be in the position where you're going to have to say things that legally could be a admission against interest that's what you're trying to avoid and that to me that policy goes to both a prospective litigation case and a current litigation case i mean the same thing for the council is if somebody comes forward and uh comes to the podium and says i'm here to tell you that i'm going to file a lawsuit against the city because of this claim the appropriate response is we should not address that at this time you should contact our attorney and he will be glad to address whatever your claim is but it to me it's dangerous for y'all to address prospective or pending claims in public because there's that risk let me play the lawyer constitutionally you're allowing the citizen again all seven of us are citizens too you just happen to have an elected title too a citizen can speak but you can't speak back i know it's best practice and i know the admonition should probably come from you anytime that situation comes up like council member before you speak let me remind you don't say anything you know please don't say anything against the against interest but if that council member wants to get up there and unload this stops it and can we legally do that i don't know that you can okay because that council member could go and say that right outside five minutes later and i don't know how you can prohibit it here constitutionally legally in a public forum well i'll give you my response to that a citizen coming before you is speaking on their own behalf about their claim that's typically what you're going to have okay but you each of the seven of you are you are certainly citizens you certainly have constitutional rights but you also have a special position which is you're a elected official and as an elected official part of your obligation is to do things to represent the collegial body and to not do things that put the collegial body in a awkward position when it comes to potential lawsuits so you know i i'm not a person that is you know uh receptive to trampling on anybody's constitutional rights including the seven of you but i'm just saying you'll have a special position because you are elected officials and your obligation when you're sitting here and actually i would say it's 24-hour a day obligation as long as you're an elected official is to protect the interest of the city that you represent you know when i first had this pointed out to me this this limitation of constraint in my discussion with council i thought it was the stupidest thing i'd ever heard but as i as i've kind of been a prize of all their protections it affords us it it makes sense to me now this admission against interest thing i mean the last thing we want to do is sit up here and in a recorded format have something to slip or say something that's going to be used against the city in a trial or case or settlement or whatever so i've become very comfortable with the process and because the florida league of city is typically our representative legally and insurance wise on this stuff let them handle it and when they make a decision they'll come to us and then we can have a beating in the shade or however we decide this thing but i think it really is in our best interest to let's not discuss it i mean it's you know something can slip anything can be used against us and it all makes kind of sense now something else i have a divergent view on is a uh a citizen can step forward and comment not just necessarily as hey i'm bringing a suit against the city but if they have an understanding of what we're involved in they can make citizens comments about that stuff too he can't engage it i think that's that's again smart we don't do that to do you think that we could just take off our council hat and speak as a citizen first amendment i i'm sorry i have a divergent opinion i think we have additional sensitivities and as a friend just pointed out to us we have responsibilities and i don't think we can just take off ahead and speak freely based on my my feelings or interpretations of an issue as a citizen because guess what when that's reported it's not reported as glen gonna do not drive it's reported as council member clinton said this and it's you cannot just take that hat off and separate you with something i think so there are additional constraints were placed upon us and i'd be very cautious about just saying hey well you know i've got first amendment rights i'm going to make my plan now i think that's wrong you certainly don't make even if that's the route you want to go you don't make that assertion from up here you make it from down there because again it's at the separation thing you make that first amendment statement from here guess what no you're sitting in the mirror seat and providing officers see that's the way it's important if you want to pass the gamble and go down to the point well yeah okay you might be able to pass that one off but uh other than that i think detected exhibit about the florida league city sandlin and we're ready to do something to get them come to us i i heard what he said and i i make a distinction and i'm going to be the fallen of a piece of sand in your shoe mr riley okay this is the only time i can speak with you so i have to bring this out in the public forum here there's a difference between what's smart and what's constitutionally legal i don't disagree with anything you just said anything that fred reilly just said in terms of it being a smart move that we don't get into the intricacies somebody come up here unload on us and it's probably best practice that will keep our mouth shut by the same token this law says you must you shall i have to knock it off as presiding officer i'm charged with shutting it down and actually puts responsibility on you the question is is it smart it's probably not smart to answer it back the question is is it constitutional the way we have this written okay if we have the right to say it you have a lot of rights you don't have to always use them i tell that to people all the time so just because you have the right to do certain things doesn't mean you must exercise that right the question comes in is this the way it's written and i think you acknowledged it before it's a quandary i call it something different but we i have an issue with this okay this is a limited public forum we have rules of decorum and how we have to treat each other it's not anything goes so you can restrict it within reason but when you say you can talk about it there's something out there you can talk about it but you can't talk about it well maybe to your point well maybe you have to step down and say i'm joe citizens right now speaking about this it's fine but we're saying no you can't talk about it at all and that's where the constitutionality of this comes in that's my only concern actually of all everything i've brought you've cleared up the whole thing about the other piece of dressing council so i don't think that that's an issue i have no question that if we if florida legacies comes back to us and says settle this case we'll pull a state meeting we'll do it properly that's not a problem it's what happens in this situation if someone comes forward how soon is things opened up to the you know once we start zooming it that's open up to the whole country conceivably so what do we do before it happens because i don't want to be in a position as presiding officer or the next presiding officer comes in i want to put anybody in the position and say shut that person down and that person says well you violated my record so now we got another lawsuit so i'm not asking for an answer tonight i'm just saying does this bear looking into because to me you've got a limited public forum and you're not treating people the same inside that forum well i'll give you an answer when if this provision was not in the code i once i figured out what they were talking about i i would be raising my hand and interjecting that if this person is making a claim against the city then this is not the appropriate forum for uh for the council to respond to that claim and i would advise the council to not respond to the claim and that of course requires uh some degree of discretion and this discipline and you know i'm the comment was made earlier everybody's an adult here i i will tell you when i'm attacked i am ready for the battle myself each of y'all are and it is difficult to sit there and listen to somebody detail all the ills and all these the you know the glory details of what they think is a really valid claim against you except in this case the claim is really against the city and that's why i keep going back to you as the elected officials are obligated to look out for the best interests of the city and the in my opinion the appropriate thing to do is to note that the person is making a claim and that the city commission or city council at this point should not have an open discussion of it that's difficult to do but that's what i recommend you do and i i know what you're they're thinking okay well that's fine uh great explanation but you're not addressing the constitutionality and again you have constitutional rights you don't weigh them by being an elected official but the position you hold as an elected official when you're representing the organization should take a substantial precedent and i i would tell you to do that so maybe this needs to change and say we don't rule it out of order that we just that statement that you just made that that discussions i mean it's so limited public forum and we can restrict it again as long as we're doing this evenly we can say that any discussions regarding legal will not be entertained by the council that eliminates it now a citizen can't come through it's like i'm going to see you i'm going to do this you guys are horrible you're this down the other hey there's our city attorney over here go talk to him you know we're not this is the council can't respond to you and this is not permitted in this form just like we have rules of decorum and other things that you can't do here it's not unreasonable there is another avenue for the person to be hurt you're sitting right there and you'll set up an appointment and you can talk with them i if we get that person who comes up and says blah blah blah and a council member and it's not this council i'm talking the next five councils down the road this thing's not going away and somebody says i hear you i heard you mr riley i still want to talk are you going to stop me presiding officer uh now you just put me on the hot seat here what do i do what does the next mayor do well when that happens that's one of the times to call a short recess and i mean mike i i'm consistent about stuff we if that situation that you just described occurred i would be exceptionally civil diplomatic and everything else and ask the person once we once i figured out what they were talking about that there's a explain to them there's a rule and this is this is a rule i i come in every meeting with this stuff at my fingertips ready to use it if i need to if it continues then you as the chair have the ability to have a recess and during the recess i would talk to you as the chair and then i would also talk to the citizen and explain it and i you know i i don't want to overuse this line but reasonable people hopefully will act in a reasonable manner and i would say that to somebody that was here intent on uh explaining their full story and hopefully they would be a reasonable person i'm just i'm i don't i don't i'm just not comfortable i'm comfortable with the citizen being able to speak on the problem with that my problem is that if i have a council member or myself wants to speak about that might be best practice it might be the worst thing they ever say might torpedo your city's case can i stop a person from speaking or can someone stop the presiding officer from speaking and i i think the constitutional answer is you can't i think they can do it it might be political suicide it might be underlies it might be frowned upon but before it gets to that point i would hope we would have a recess and i would have an opportunity to talk to uh the chair and any council member that we needed to discuss it further i mean y'all are the ones that are obligated to follow that rule uh not the citizen and is that fair i don't think it's particularly fair but that is the rule you have now questions should we change [Music] hey let's not say something let's say something it comes down to the rule says that you can't have a discussion about it it says you can't it's ruled out of order so is that going to hold is that something that holds up to me it doesn't if you tell me it's okay then we move on to the next item i'm fine with it i don't expect a constitutional analysis that i want to research it but i'm just saying one side speaks the other side speaks for neither side speaks we're not employees you can do this with an employee we could certainly say to our city employees we could say to lynn reeves you can't speak because he's an employee we have that power as a city but i don't think you could do it to an elected official i don't think you can do that mr riley you can double check it but if you want i'll wait there's nothing urgent that i need to answer tonight i just wanted to bring it up before it becomes an issue well if you all want me to look into it further i'm certainly receptive to doing that i'd rather find out sooner than later i'm not sure i can't hear you i'm sorry i'm not sure i see the merits in front of us that we have to fix it right now it's become an issue once before so it's you know it was handled fine that night but it's become an issue so we'll pop up again i don't know i saw five yeah i'm not talking about any lawsuits i've seen five or six letters in the last six months so will it come up again who else yeah maybe i guess in my mind is the prohibition is against the council discussing right it doesn't mean that a citizen can't come forward maybe one way [Music] that's the issue we have no problem either one talks and the other answers or none talks you have a limited public forum you're setting the rules and you're saying you guys can talk you guys can't i'm not your employee all right i'm not you know we we could do this again i'm not picking out lady could be lynn it could be kyle it could be patty we could say your employees as part of your employment you can't go out and press conferences and doing this down the other we can do that but constitutionally i don't think you can do it to an elected official and tell them they can't speak on something robbing your nexus usually when a citizen comments we don't really give playback unless there's a special circumstance and usually you know everybody agrees yeah sure go ahead and answer the question or lynn answer the question so if a citizen comes up here and starts yelling spouting whatever then you don't respond we can't it's not saying you're not allowed to it's just saying that we normally don't respond to citizen comments so we're just following our normal protocols and that can respond at the end of the night or you're going to close the campaign if you choose to this stops it well i get that but hopefully by the end of the night your temper has cooled and you're not going to address it but we've also said why you don't address it it's because you don't want to go down the route the path of an admission against your own interests so i know i know what admission against interests are but people do it all the time so the question is is is it legal constitutional that's it's a yes no it's really whether it's wise or not i agree it may not be wise you know it's not wise for people to confess to the police when they get busted that they do it okay and then they lose i don't see i don't see the marital value of expending city budgets to have the city attorney research a constitutional issue then just doesn't mean anything to me right now personally as a council member i mean if if it were an issue i would say yes but i don't see tasking the city attorney to research a constitutional question that really just doesn't have any bearing on us right now just based on what i've seen since i've lived in bel air beach i think honestly if any council member ever wants to reply back to a citizen who is standing there i don't think anything's ever stopped i just there may be a rule that says don't do it but if that's the case i don't think if it's a heated enough conversation you know we've seen it we've seen in the past and there's just sometimes you can't stop somebody from talking and the rule is already in place so it's just a rule that we're not really you know we try to adhere to it but occasionally but i'm going to and that's exactly what you're talking about is you want the freedom to be able to speak well i don't think anything has stopped you so i don't see where this is it's not just about me i don't know i'm just saying all of us whenever we we've had someone standing there and they said something that hit accord with us we've all at one time or another responded to that citizen not thinking about what it was about whether it was a lawsuit or anything else anything that they say could be used against us if we if we turn on and say that the i mean we give an inappropriate response it's a risk we take for being up here and um i agree with what mr riley is saying is yes he's going to advise you not to speak if he detects trouble that's all we can do so we don't want to pursue this that we have tied two people i heard we said we don't want to have any formal research done on this at this point no no no okay mr riley i'll go with what you suggested if it comes up again though i'm gonna ask you the same question i'm just asking tonight so whether you formally research it or not we'll need an answer at that point and that will probably be on the spot so that's fine i will tell you just a final point in the other city i represent this comes up periodically and the way it comes up is citizen uh comes forward and starts explaining something and everybody's trying to figure out what it is and often like i said earlier oftentimes it's hard to figure out what it is but as soon as i or the chair figure out what it is then we you know at some point i i make the statement that the city if you're threatening litigation then the city council should not uh respond at this juncture to the claim that you're making and that that's the statement i've made and you know again i know it's not easy but the better course of action is to simply let them uh use their three minutes or whatever time they have and say whatever they want to say and then it is no matter how inflammatory it may be let them sit down and move on to the next item that is difficult to do even for me but i you know i recommend that's what you did [Music] that leaves us open for having discussions it's so recommended okay so we've got two more items i think they're relatively quick but sometimes i can do wrong [Music] 8 regarding this hoffman's construction parking issue and propagation of construction parking rules for contractors which i don't know is going to be necessary i brought it um the matter was raised to city manager's attention on january 4th council meeting it remained unresolved that's when i wrote this the citizen reported that there was no change after the council meeting now with that i will say i had a discussion that same day with lynn reeves and he went out and visited and sorry i spoke with miss hoffman miss hoffman's not here tonight correct there's no response from the audience so ms hoffman was invited to come here tonight and speak with us um i have not i went out to visit the site once and when i went the street was completely empty so i have no first hand information to impart here but the issue is basically there's construction vehicles there's two houses being built by her across the street the trucks are legally parked on the street but yet it's making it difficult if not impossible for her to get out of her driveway without driving all over her lawn and stuff like that according to her she's asked them to move sometimes they move sometimes they don't move code has been called apparently danny was able to help out in some cases so she was happy with that but she's also said she wrote two legal letters and i don't know if she wrote one to us as a city i see there was an email that was placed on her desk today so i just keep it here because it's a follow-up i wanted her to address us i don't know that we need rules but the one thing i heard that was very distressing is that there was parking on both sides of the street and i thought that was something that we agreed going all the way back to the festival that you don't ever want to have a situation where two cars are parked on opposite sides of the street because then we can't get an emergency vehicle through and that is a problem so i don't know the rest of this i'm not going to take sides she's you know basically registered her complaint with me via telephone calls now so i'm bringing it back up maybe i'll throw it right over to lynn reeves for his you know what's happened subsequently because i was not a party to that conversation well mayor consoles this mrs hoffman has to understand that and i told her that i told her it's a two-way street they are leaving you a lane to get in and out of your driveway they're building two houses unfortunately at the same time right next to each other uh i got an email from her yesterday stating which i have given you a copy of they were doing the sewer tap and there was plenty of room for a car to get out of a driveway and go on down the street there were there was a duke truck one duke truck parked at the very end of the street uh probably 80 to 100 yards away from mrs hoffman's house it was on the curve like he was turning to come back and his truck was parked there had nothing to do with the construction yesterday the county was out there as i said doing the sewer tap they dug their hole along the curb they put their dirt on the road and you'll see the pictures at the end of the day they clean the street up and they they did put a de-watering system in a well-point system and it's still running there uh unfortunately when you have a house being constructed and you know i said this at the last meeting the contractors tried to be nice about it but the contractor already also complained that mrs hoffman comes out there whether she's leaving or not and tells the truck they got to move and you know the contractor's saying she's telling my people to move when they're unloading something and they're there ten minutes and you know realistically our code says that there's an exception that says that vehicles are uh that are involved within the media area where construction of commercial work is at but only during they can be there only during the construction hours i can honestly say that council member shirley is well aware of what happens when there's construction because there was a big house built right across the street from actually two of them over a time frame and yes they do park and yes you might have to turn a little bit to get out of your driveway but uh i mean i got the same thing on my street right now where they parked trucks and yeah you gotta turn a little bit to get out of your garbler but that's the nature of construction and on the other side if uh mrs hoffman has you know some work done at her house she's gonna impact the people across the street so i i really don't think it's an issue it's just a person that uh you know again i think it's just a person that's probably with calling the mayor i think she sent emails to the vice mayor didn't she vice mayor and you know i tried to explain to her you don't own the other side of the street and another thing that's going to happen i was told by the county yesterday they're going to dig up her right away in her front yard so that's how how construction is to connect the water line may i suggest you have a conversation with her and let her know that because you know whose phone's going to be no i understand that but really you know the contractors have been very good about keeping getting their stuff out of there uh she did complain to me about a toilet that somebody dropped at the dumpster well it was probably one of her neighbors that dumped the toilet at the dumpster you know and the contractor didn't put it in the dumpster right away but you know i i think this is a non-issue she just has to understand that unfortunately for the next 15 to 15 plus months there can be construction there and they aren't parking they aren't blocking their driveway they aren't doing any of that what they're doing is parking across the street uh on the other side of the street it's just the situation and i i think it's a non-issue really can can i ask that question is um she house 111 is that her house okay yeah um you know i've gone down here a couple times knowing this was coming up and i've seen construction trucks like lindsay all parked on the on one side of the street not both sides there was a concrete truck there today they were pumping the block cells and he was kind of backed in and hanging out the road a bit but i don't know that there's anything that you can do it's the nature of construction i mean i didn't see them doing anything awful it's never fun it's not fun to have construction going on around your house there's you know i gotten issues with my neighbors but i never called the mayor about it you know i dealt with it and when the mayor did it because he built his own house a few years ago and we had two houses going at the same time i had cranes there i had heavy equipment and i didn't know my neighbors so this was my opportunity to knock on their door i introduced myself i told them when i might be blocking the road when i had pile of driving equipment coming in i let them know that i didn't have one complaint i'm very good friends with every one of those neighbors so you know i don't know why they can't all get along but they're not it you say it's not an issue and i i can see that maybe it's not an issue that we all have to change code or ordinances with but it is an issue when you get a phone call every week because i mean i'm trying i work during the day you know i can't run out and again i walk down here you've got a picture of an open block that's exactly what i said there wasn't one person there the block was clean it was actually very nice after they had left for the day this was yesterday at the end of the day i i don't know what the solution is because i mean now we're saying that they're going to come and dig up her right away you know the phones are going to ring and i'm not dismissing them i mean if i get a call you're gonna obviously know about it but i have no magic power either i certainly can't i'm not gonna take someone's side on this i mean if i drive down the road and i see a truck in the middle of the street that's a problem and then she can call the police or whatever on that and they should respond but i mean i'm not going to tell the truck we didn't do this when i built my house i mean we were courteous to the neighbors so and if you're not really coming out of your driveway then you know not an issue i mean if you have to get out then yes please move the truck well i will tell you that after she sent these letters from an attorney to the contractor uh they basically stated that would you please move your truck that came from i guess her attorney and uh so one of the contractors came in to see us with the letter and i i said i understand that she told me she was going to send the looker to you he said i was out there for an hour a truck pulled up she came across the street and told him to move immediately but she never left her house and so i i think we're she's getting a little overzealous with the whole situation well here's the thing are they breaking any laws that they are call the police that would be my answer to her they're operating within our code and their rights and you know we'll make sure that code enforcement goes up and down the street you know often to see if there's anything that's out of compliance otherwise call the police if there's a real problem if the road's completely locked judy i think that's an excellent with the coding force she speaks i mean she danny she's had a lot nice to say about danny so maybe it becomes a regular stop on his tour and um you know just he has a way of working with these guys to do it but i mean if they're building a house directly across the street to first of all i'm not yeah i'm not gonna i have no power to tell people go park here and there but even if i did i'm not going to make you park all the way down the block and bring your materials five houses that just doesn't that's not efficient that's not right i wouldn't want somebody to do that when i was building so um you know i don't know when i i keep bringing it up i don't want to see it again you know is there a way we can you know short circuit this thing i told her i told her last week and she kind of got a little upset with me and i said this is about your neighbor next door that was fixing their foundation complaining about your neighbor behind you complained about this guy and then yesterday when she sent this i was like wait a minute they're they're digging the sewer tab what if your sewer was gone you wouldn't want him digging it across the street uh so i'm at the point that i've explained to her i said it's a two-way street if they're totally blocking your driveway that's a different story but they're not and i'm sure she's going to be upset when the county goes across the street and tells her i'm big enough you're right away because of the waterfall so i don't think it's going to go away we'll just have to do the best we can with her i'll keep fielding the calls and getting back here you know this is the classic definition of insanity right she she keeps bringing up the issue we keep going back to the city manager to resolve this thing he's done his best and yet he's getting more direction to resolve he's done everything he can i i hate to say this but the book stops right there and it may be time for you to pick up the phone and have a conversation with miss hoffman or i know you have a busy schedule but it may be worth 30 minutes your time to walk over there and set up a meeting with her and explain hey you know just because it's not going your way doesn't mean we haven't looked into the issue we've adjusted if you look at the legalities of it we looked at the permanent coding stuff we looked at i said i've been down there three times i know joey's been down there to look at the situation and i guess the consensus of people spent down there spend time down there and look at it is like you know the team is it's a wide street you're telling me you can't get out of your driveway if there's a truck park on the other side i'm sorry your point i've never been called while it's happening okay and i've asked for photos at least that i know of the street looks very empty i want to see it when there's somebody breaking or infringing on somebody's well that that little photo does show what happened yesterday see she might need to turn her head over her shoulder look you know i'll be happy to go down but i don't run the city the city manager runs the city it's his job to do it and she doesn't have anything nice to say about you i got that it's she doesn't agree with you she likes danny she has no use basically for city hall and so she calls me thinking that i could say go do it and all i can do is bring it back up my only concern is twofold number one i don't have pictures of this either are there cars parked on both sides of the street if i see cars on both sides of the street i'll be calling you to come on out because that we have said is a major hazard okay so that's a no-go if it's opposite your driveway you know that stinks but that happens i mean so you know i i need to see it when it's happening if they're by the valley curve that's the picture that i'm seeing here and it's a terrible shot i can pull out of them so you might have to go over two or three times but you're going gonna do it without having any real problem if they're parked in the middle of the street that's a different story then you can't get out i need to see it i don't mind going down but you can't call me a day later and since they may or do something about it i can't do anything about it anyway even if they're in the middle of the street what am i going to say all i can say is hey i'm the mayor and guess what i can make ordinances and make the ordinance tougher and i can take away your street parking privilege i mean it's a privilege we have no parking policy we give this policy and we let people park on the street but just like we give it we could take it away we put restrictions that's why i brought it up tonight really to say do we need to do anything the answer is i'm getting is no we don't i would love to see this when it's happening i don't mind going out but you know i'm not going to come out of a court meeting to go and look at a parked car i mean that's we have a city manager in his staff i think if she calls you you could have that conversation with the phone and then that might soften it some i don't know she sounds difficult you know she's nice when i speak to her but i mean you know there's just certain people that have issues and i we've had success with danny to the extent you want to use them use them maybe we'll be talking about this in february maybe it'll go away but they're going to dig up your yard for the right way put this on put this on the agenda just what you say it will be going on until the house is done exactly i've got the experience from it with the house right next door until until they got the foundations refilled it was almost a daily phone call you know we have with the construction at the end of our block i mean there's trucks going up and down you know it's all for the good we're going to get better storm water treatment by the end of it so we'll bite the bullet and we deal with it because you know some people don't believe that that's not a through street so they pull their big truck down and they have to back up you know 500 feet and you hear bp hold it so but you know it's all for the good but we're different neighbors we're not like that you got to live with these people when they move in so that's that would be the advice i would give was it just goes back to being a good neighbor i know when glenn was redoing his roof there was a car parked right there and i was backing out and the guy was kind enough to direct me and i didn't care because you know what what a few months or a year before i did my roof which i'm sure it convenes glenn but he never said anything so it just came we all just get along it's just unfortunate like i said that there were two lots there and they pulled and started construction at the same time but it's workable okay we're not going to do anything on it to put it up so let's end on a positive note here number eight discussion of ongoing lack of enforcement mandatory covenant mass policy at city hall in particular lack of enforcement of mandatory mass department of city council meetings and work sessions by may explanation of mandatory covert 19 mass policies routinely violated by certain citizens and certain council members during the council meetings works as if there's a lack of enforcement i'm not here to discuss individuals on how to discuss particular instances it's the way it goes back to our enforcement of laws i'm looking at fred reilly and the equal enforcement of the laws the rule the ordinance we're under a state of emergency we've given the power to the city manager and this the county has said mass is required inside we have that we've adopted that policy which is consistent with best practices and it's not enforced okay people don't have the mask on and i had a particular instance again not going to save the people but i actually pointed it out to the city manager there was some individuals in the audience the city manager went over asked them to put the mask on put it on five minutes later took it off he went over again put it on took it off i might forget it i'm not going to stop the meeting every five minutes and be the masked police i don't think that's practical but the sign says mandatory our websites is mandatory and people wear it or not wear it i don't want to get into a discussion of the efficacy of these things it's below the rule and the law so my point is simple either we do away with the policy and make it optional if the city attorney agrees that that's a smart thing to do then you can wear it if you want and you don't have to wear it but if it's mandatory mandatory says it's mandatory and then we need enforcement i don't think the i don't think it's my job to stop the meeting every two minutes and tell people to put a mask on i don't think it should be the city manager although he's the responsible party for the building we need him to pay attention to the meeting not be the mass police so to me if we decide that we want to enforce this the obvious thing to do i don't see a sheriff here tonight but when we have our sheriff who does security here he simply walks up and down and someone doesn't have a mask he just motions to put the mask up it's real simple he can do that it's not taking him away from his duties that night to enforce it if we don't want to enforce it then make the sign say masks optional ask suggested asks hoped for whatever that's it's that simple okay i'm going to ask that we just keep the discussion on how we're going to enforce this not whether these are good bad what dr fauci said it doesn't right now this is what the law is and what our house rule is with that i'll throw it over to the city manager he has comments and then we'll get it back to council a city attorney also if you'd like yeah mayor console uh the sheriff's not going to enforce it either the governor put out an executive order yes this is a county mass ordinance and the city adopted it the county has some fines and penalties for it but the governor through an executive order said that no county could do any fine or penalty to anything and that was in executive order 20-244 okay so yes [Music] it's a recommendation and the county's mass ordinance is mandatory but it cannot there's no penalty or enforcement you can really do you can ask people and hopefully they put them on if they don't i can't you know i can't go arrest a council i could ask member to put your mask on but that that's about as far as it goes well the console that would be in my mind that would be the presiding officer asking him to leave not not the city manager but the public i guess we could ask him to leave but realistically there's no penalty that's the issue and the governor said that no county can force a penalty and there are stipulations that they don't have to wear the mask you know if uh they've got you know if it causes a breathing problem you don't have to wear that mask if it's uh provided by a medical provider and you cannot ask the question and they do not have to carry documentation it's specifically in in the ordinance do you want the section in birth says that if a person says he has a breathing difficulty or disability that's the end of the conversation you cannot ask him what it is and he does not have to carry any documentation or proof a face shield is allowed instead of a base cover right and there are some provisions that talk about in locations of over 10 people if you cannot maintain social distancing then you do the math but again it comes back to the nebulous scientifically it's not mask or we're not discussing that i'm not talking about the efficacy of a mask i'm talking about it's not one or the other all is recommended it's like saying wear a mask but don't wash your hands i mean it's all of it well and if you care about people then you should be able to wear a mask and i don't see what the problem with i just want to get this you know this is what we were talking about before on the other issue it's best practices it's certainly smart not to comment on litigation but the question i had was can you stop a person it's best practices to wear one you should do it and you can go on for an hour as to what the benefits are and other people may say no there's no benefit at all question is is it says mandatory you've given me an answer i want to hear from the city attorney if there's nothing we can do about it then although it's all i'm going to say is if there's nothing we can do about it then let's just make sure we're square as a city that there's nothing we can do about it so when mrs jones walks in in the middle of the afternoon coughing up the lung and says i'm not putting my mask on i'm going to give me a pimple so i'm going to have to wear that you're going to have to say sure come to the window and get your parking pass so i just want to make sure because i don't want to hear that we enforce it there but we don't enforce it here we are socially distanced over here okay we spread this room out really nicely and as long as we don't get an overflow crowd i mean it doesn't really matter i'm six feet away from glenn right now so but the question is what should we do and if the answer is we can't really do anything forget i'm not asking for people to get arrested or fine i'm saying all you do is not say put your mask on or else step outside when you put it on come back if you can't do that then we're done talking that's it we're finished you know i can ask them to put their mask on but i can't make them do it and i don't want you being interrupted in the media you need to focus on the meeting we did that we tried that and twice in 15 minutes i mean you you need you know we need you at this meeting that all of you you know not where you're scanning the room for violators it's you know i mean i don't know mark the only thing i can say is when the public is here we need to be an example or an ask when they're here what they do is another thing but what we do we're held to a higher standard but we need to follow the rules what does me wearing a mask have to do with anything that this the public's doing it has nothing to do with anything and i want to hear what our attorney has to say about this because if it's a requirement you may as well just kick me out of here now because i'm not going to sit at this podium for four hours with a mask on i don't care what you guys think it's not easy i know we're all doing it but there's so there's some people that are not capable of doing it there's some people that it's causing breathing problems for i'm not you know i really don't know what's in the science and honestly i don't really care what i what i care about is it who am i to judge what's best for somebody else and that's where i that's where i go with this is that yep you got some people that are die hard wear the mask i don't care if it kills you you're going to wear that mask and then you've got other people that are like you know i i understand you it doesn't it's not working out for you and i'm okay with that it's i don't i don't know how to address it but if there's no way to enforce it and this and the governor has said you know there's nothing we can do there's you can't you can't enforce the fives and the police aren't doing anything what do we have to stand on i think we need to hear from you yeah because really the discussion we can't enforce this we're done we're finished with the discussion there's nothing more to be talked about if you can't enforce it then it goes back to my question how do we enforce it okay no one's advocating i'll say it again because i don't want to see this incorrectly quoted in the press or anything else i was advocating that people be drop tackled and arrested and dragged up that didn't happen then it didn't happen any time simply please put the nasca now the u.s house of representatives in their little impeachment episode last week all were wearing them so that's us house of representatives i said wow bella beach council and citizens maybe you know there's a lesson here what say you mr riley okay this is another topic i discussed with lind there are four executive orders that are relevant i'm going to read from the the one that's the most relevant but the the this executive order has been extended through the end of february uh this is executive order 20-244 section 4 suspension of coven 19 related individual fines and penalties this order consistent with executive order 20-92 suspends the collection of fines and penalties associated with comma 19 and force enforced upon individuals so the the answer to the question as far as i'm concerned is you by virtue of this executive order you have no ability to levy a fine or a penalty upon an individual for not complying with a covet-19 requirement so back to my question can you ask i'm not never asked to add let me find never has to leave me a penalty never asked for an arrest i was at a restaurant last week when the rare times have went and i had to use a portion of the restaurant um by the restroom the guy said you know when you're eating you don't have the mascot but he's like i think mascot i don't know what would happen if i was that i'm not going to put it on maybe would have said you can't use that that area what can you do you know we can't defines penalties and electrocutions and all that kind of stuff so what can you do you can't even ask them to put it on sure if they say no can you ask them to leave this is a private building i mean it's public but it's a private building so can you say step outside until you decide to put it on that's the question you're asking yeah if the if penalties encompasses putting somebody out of a meeting then you can't do that that i i think that would be a penalty that's how it would be construed or that if they looked into it that's what they would claim is their defense that's all i need to know i'm never going to put anybody out of a meeting if you don't have good grounds to do it and legal you know constitutional grounds this is a public forum so this is one of these times i i'm telling you what the law is and the law doesn't give you the ability to enforce it you asked the question earlier what do i recommend you do i recommend you you claim or not claim that you continue with being consistent with the county uh position that it is mandatory and keep the signs that say it's mandatory you just don't have the ability to really do much about it i wish i had a better answer nope that is actually that answers my question i'm not sure anybody else on council has anything else i'm sorry executive order 244 the rest of that is while they can't enforce it against individuals they can't force it against businesses so that's why you can't confuse i'm in a restaurant a guy asked me to put on a mask well yeah he's the guy that gets penalized and fine and he can refuse your business that's that's where the difference is okay we have general business does anybody have anything that wasn't on oh i'm sorry was there anything else anything from the public to finish the thing we write them out now general business anybody have anything that wasn't on the agenda i had something that i want to talk about rv okay three years ago that was put a together people one died one move another one retired uh originally it was 30 and then when we got together before we got elected there was 40 items all those 40 items over the last three years have been addressed and i would say out of those 40 items maybe there's three that are still pending i'd like to say this council really has worked over the last number of years to get stuff done and i know i won't be a member of this group for too much longer but i'd like to say thank you for all the hard work a lot of long nights a lot of discussions thank you well we should be the one thanking you for two terms and all the effort that you got you put in and being on this group that kind of started getting the city back on the right path so thank you and uh it's not only me it takes it took a lot of people to do it and it took this group to get this far and put the city manager the attorney and it's been fantastic so i think thank you all thanks martha anybody else on council before going to see manager i just had a question for the city manager okay i know that pulled up all of our asphalt i'm sorry they pull up all all the asphalt on 22nd and and all the other streets but i've also noticed that there's spray paint where they're marking things is something else happening that there well the the curb company may be marking something but the other uh are you talking about across the bridge they're marking something i'm just trying to figure out what it is i'll find out for sure what it is okay i thought maybe it was a place where i was going to dunk the millions but maybe that's not it [Music] well i thought you might want to use exactly hey that thing's done okay just quick just quickly uh i gave you a little supplemental sheet estimate of things i didn't give you specific dates i just gave you time frames uh that'll be something that we'll discuss in the meeting i also gave you so you can plan ahead for the upcoming budget season we're going to start a little bit earlier this year with the staff trying to get the budget put together so instead of doing a budget work session like every other week we'll try to work it in one in june one of july and it'll hopefully be past that the supplemental uh patrol we did over new year's eve uh new year's eve day there were two deputies out there they because the traffic was so heavy there was no or new year's eve there was no traffic citations given because traffic was bumper to bumper then on the first they used the dui traffic enforcement people so i mean these were people that are well aware of the enforcement they conducted speeding and stop violations they issued three traffic warnings two citations in one criminal citation during those so first aid nothing because the traffic was so crowded and the last thing we've already talked about uh the undergrounding for gulf boulevard and penny for money that's going to come to us to do that uh i just wanted to make you aware that i'll be sending a letter to the big c getting authorization to start preparing those funds for expenditure it's just a formality we did it with the previous penny and we've already i've already submitted the invoice for the i think it was ten thousand two hundred dollars for the binding estimate for dude to get reimbursed by the county but i just want to make you aware of that i mean and if you have any questions that's it for me then i have two quick things for you one is the flags in my front yard or going on three months old can i take them out because my lawn mower is like eating them alive yeah i i don't think uh they're they're probably gonna they'll have to re-generate them at some point in time and secondly uh marv is leaving us here and um you know there's a couple people up for re-election for people who are coming off the council we've traditionally given them a nice little gift like crystal take away and stuff like that but i i've seen it and it's nice but i mean i think for the amount of services that person puts in we probably do something a little bit nicer as a city to show our appreciation no we don't have to give him a new car but i think we should give something a rolex watch and then we'll deal with the ethics issues but you know can we maybe look into this that the people waiting feeling for me well i have a clock i've seen that clock the clocks are nice mark was thinking about maybe a swimming pool no i mean something you know something that i don't know a little bit we can look further into that that's not a problem okay that's all i have thank you folks um the next okay i just want to quit the next meeting is february first after tonight yes okay okay just quickly hibiscus what's happening on hibiscus is there a sewer issue or something manhole recovery something that's out there or that i know the county was doing down there doing some some stuff on hibiscus i don't know exactly that's the road clothes that's so i'll find that out for you all right and then mark what are the three items that haven't been addressed on the list just curious i think we talked about variance committee needs to whenever they meet and decide something we never know as a council what the results are [Music] that's one that we could i mean like to get the results of the variance committee it's just a matter of getting some minutes from that so right or something that we want to change the ordinance on if yeah so can we i mean is that something we can decide we can solve that every time because i mean even though they don't go up that often variance is a big deal around here so well boards and committee reports have kind of fallen by the wasteland maybe we need to put a little more emphasis on those you do it very we'd like to hear if you agree and that should be part of the quarterly report to us because you know let's say you're giving the same variance we heard a gentleman come in talking about can we have a sky top sunset lounge well you know there's a few that were used to be able to say well if you're going to put a variance then we need to know about that number one we might want to change the ordinance this is what we want to do that can go in your quarterly report i mean that's something that we just have to add let them know i don't think we even need a anything more than this right and then the other thing that was on here before this i mean this is way before we got our house we were talking about any grants in the future that were paid to the city for any undergrounding since we paid for that ourselves get part of that money but we never put resolution together to make sure that if the city or the state grants any money for hardening the whole infrastructure hey we paid for this event and when we never discussed the fact that duke energy is going to raise our electric bills for doing pardon in the underground will be done why should we be charged with everybody else he was saying you know i doubt he would ever do it but especially if so if somebody actually offered to pay for neighborhoods i know that's not going to happen but let's just say a deep discount and but we paid full price right you know what i'm saying so i mean that's basically you know bigger we discussed that a few times and [Music] we're limited again just like with the speeding thing we could do a resolution if we agree on the account of the council but now all we can do is send it to our council and you know the county see if we get any traction with that we are going to try with the 12th street design we're going to talk to the county about instead of putting putting uh or we're going to talk to them about maybe putting an outfall from the storm water into that pond and see if they let us do it we are going to talk to them about that so that could benefit us in another way so then to his point i mean let's get back with these quarterly reports and for the um court of adjustment their report is simply any granting of an easement we don't have to know about all the ones that get shot down and there's not that many anyway these these only happen once in a while but if they're granted just a quick paragraph about what the issue was and you know why it was granted i think the last easement that was the last variance in the whole city other than the gentleman that wanted us to let him move his house into the uh setback and he was shot down yeah and we're taking him to a code hearing on friday because he's past his 24 months so he needs to do something at that house well i guess we didn't miss much now [Music] well you do get the part part thing and we'll continue to do that quarterly and the planning board has already started working on the code they've had two meetings and they'll give you a report also i mean it could just be i i i think we should have it and i think also now we've got 38 gun out of the 40 so yeah i mean and that's not a problem i mean that's this is not you know complete list lynn's got the rest of them i mean we probably could remember the rest that we're not but it's an amazing how this stuff all got done and actually it's the last two years can you forward that list to everybody thank you and i'm glad everybody i mean we have done a lot and you know in my two years and with the people before me we've got this city's never been running better so i hope everybody recognizes that um yeah anything else folks well thank you we got through this in three and a half hours the other thing i wanted to just throw out just for a lot we're not going to discuss it but just think about it we did a work session following a council meeting put it all in one sometimes that's not possible because we have too many items on a council session but there's nothing that says we can't do two meetings in one night i don't want to go to one in the morning but maybe if we have a light session sometime and we don't have that much of a work session we might be able to follow it up and do one it sets you know stops everybody from coming in twice and um minimizes the exposure with everything else cove it and zoom and all that but it worked that night because we had a lighter agenda we didn't have a lot on both but you know like tonight was three and a half hours but it wouldn't work but it's just something to think about if you see a light agenda maybe we can put it on one night we don't have to be twice you have a light agenda on the next meeting i thought this was a light agenda this one if that makes a recommendation the recommendation would be the cart swap the car to the horse because if you do the work session before the council meeting a you're time limiting the work session and b you're discussing issues that you can take action on immediately during the council session well the only problem with that is we did work and so if our regular council meeting is 6 p.m you're not going to get much done in a work session okay no i i granted it you're setting a dead time at that because i mean it has to end at six because by rule we have to start at six so um but i mean if we've got a light one and we wanna throw a couple work sessions we can even split the work sessions it just may save us a return trip that's a possibility you started early and if the business is done you go home or if you think you need to reconvene for another hour after the council meeting especially if you're buying pizza right that's that's the thing would cover what we can because we can cut a work session off it's not a formal i think we can cut a work session off we can't get to it we can we could say we're going to go to 10 o'clock and that's it you know so i just throw the phone out it worked that night and we got two for the price of one and it gives you a nice extended time for people who might be want to take a trip it's like okay you've got 30 days so you have another month you know we don't usually have too many special meetings and hopefully we won't have the need for them so but anyway just think about it folks if you want to do it but i mean then i guess you're going to have to let us know if you can combine it now this one we had a bunch of follow-up issues that probably aren't going to be researched in 10 days but maybe we deal with what we've got and get the rest of it later i don't know i'm just throwing it out there think about it i after keeping us to one o'clock that night so anybody wanted a mission to adjourn here a second good everybody in favor aye good night everyone thank you"
