    "transcript": "you would like to table this to another meeting that's fine i will look further into that aspect of it to make sure that there's there's absolutely no issue so i'm i'm fine with doing that although i i i hate giving percentages but i'm pretty comfortable with the amendment that was proposed by dave but in an abundance of caution i i would be happy to spend a little more time on it looking at the constitutional aspect if that would be helpful and i would like to make a motion to table this so he has more time to review it i'll say that can i say oh wait you get to speak first hang on we have motion to table now on top of the amendment um motion of tables not debatable need a decision majority decision patty call it by person can we discuss it nope it's not debatable [Music] [Music] discussion on the amendment well i haven't really had much time to talk um you're here you're recognizing thank you um well side comment i find it funny that that emotion was presented to table to use more valuable resource time when that is always being debated about how much you spend on the attorney so that was interesting second of all i think we're pretty confident in opera phrase that i am very confident in fred's abilities and if he is happy with the original one then i am too if he's also happy with the dave's uh amendment and he thinks that that is adequate and hits all the points then i'm happy with that too because i just want to put trust in our lawyer that he's doing the best job not for any one person up here but for the city and i i believe in him so thank you fred for today's been kind of rough on you from some people so i appreciate you sticking with it and doing the right thing for the city so just to summarize the amendment basically closes the door on any public forum discussing pending litigation or prospective dedication but it allows us to comply with the florida statute and home of shady regarding candy and litigation is that an accurate summary yes sir and you're comfortable with that yes i am one of the things that is extremely difficult to calibrate from a lawyer's standpoint is you make every effort you can to seal off any basis for a a complaint or any basis for a lawsuit i am not going to sit here tonight and tell you that you will never have a lawsuit based on this i can't do that but i have done my one of my favorite phrases i've done my level best to draft the provision that y'all or that i was asked to draft and i i put that on paper and that i'm not going to say it with a thousand percent certainty that you're never going to have a lawsuit over it it's it's y'all remember the sign ordinance and i hate bringing in something else because it always leads to a can of worms but the the exasperating thing with the sign ordinances that is that people all over the country file federal lawsuits over the sign ordinance and you know there's inconsistent opinions on it and you know all i can do is present something that i think will put you in the best possible position in order to have a safe harbor and then i would also hope people of good will would act with good will i have something else to say um it has nothing really to do with my emotion the table with as far as confidence i just wanted to make sure i was clear on that for everyone it was more about we're throwing something at him at you know 9 35 at night and i wanted to give him the opportunity to research it more so he would have you know more you know just say confidence in what he's saying or not confidence but you know more accuracy with doing some more research so it was just kind of a we're throwing self-management 9 30 you know so it wasn't anything to do with confidence in his just off the cuff being able to change something so i just wanted to make sure i was extremely clear on that great well this is an ordinance change so it requires two readings so if you pass the amendment tonight that dave has proposed then this will be the first reading and then it will have to come back a second time before it goes into effect so i appreciate you uh being concerned about making sure we get a thousand percent right if you pass the amendment that dave has presented tonight you can be assured that i will look into certain aspects of this between now and the next meeting and if i think there's a problem i guarantee you i will tell you what that is penny please place this in the record verbatim following the quote the standard of legal review for the infringement of first amendment rights is that it must be a compelling state interest and the law must be narrowly tailored to do the least amount of harm i do not believe that this ordinance the way it's drafted now or even before fits that the current ordinance certainly does not fit that it is unconstitutional in my legal opinion and yes i'm a legal florida attorney i'm also a legal new jersey attorney i'm also a legal federal attorney in the new jersey district i can be admitted into florida in two weeks so that is my quote please put it in verbatim this is unconstitutional end quote any other council comments that we've known we go to the citizens this is only on the amendment we still have the original but we're on the amendment only which is dave gaddis's amendment any other council comments citizen comments i i can't vote for the amendment because as you said the swoke i mean you brought it back to the attorney and he says i can you might have a constitutional problem i don't want words in your mouth but give me a little bit more time on researching i really believe it should be researched well the the voting for an ordinance is a two-step question i understand so i'm just saying let's get it right the first time rather than coming back next month any other council comments to the citizens finally no citizen comments back to council i'm going to call the question for the amendment only i'm going to read only the piece that gets amended okay so this is ordinance 2108. everything stands dave please correct me if anything i say is not correct dave's amendment is as follows section 2 d the presiding officer or on the request of the city attorney shall rule out of order any discussion by the city council of matters that they're a subject of any pending or proposed perspective litigation pending or prospective litigation except that the council may discuss pending litigation in accordance with section 286.011 uh parentheses eight florida statutes period then the rest of this continues section three four five six etc that was the change i believe you proposed you're nodding yes or i'll take that as a sign of correctness okay so patty we're calling that question this is for the amendment as i just read it please call by uh by individual for the amended ordinance council member banker no councilmember i'm councilmember in ontario [Music] council member slo aye council member aki no my sphere gathers no so we have four to three and this passes as amended you'll be going for a second reading and advertisement see you at the next council okay item 21. consideration of resolution 2021-10 a resolution of the city council of the city of bellaire beach florida authorizing the city manager of the city of baylor beach florida to execute and deliver the american rescue plan act coronavirus local fiscal recovery fund agreement providing for incorporation of recitals providing for findings providing for authority to ratify execute and deliver the american rescue plan act coronavirus local fiscal recovery fund agreement providing for general authority providing for recording providing for copies and establishing an effective date this is approval of the resolution ratifying the execution delivery of the agreement following the september 1st 2021 deadline first we have motion to tarot second hey guys leslie i will turn it forward yes console this is the american rescue plan act but there's a requirement to get it executed by september 1st and this is just a resolution to ratify that just to make a couple clarifications there was a date announced that said september 20 or i mean 2026 that is to get all your documents turned in everything has to be obligated in 2024 that's that's what the requirement of the document says also so that's the clarification it's 800 2 868 and be given to us in two payments uh as of last week they don't know when they're going to give us the money yet so at this point we don't really have a certain date but everything's been executed and set back to them they have to execute it then what they told me in an email is in a few weeks we'll see the money so then we'll have to do a budget amendment at that time and decide what we'll use it for so we're asking for you as approval in this resolution and you have a copy of the agreement so you've already signed this correct yes so why is our resolution saying to execute it shouldn't that be stricken in both locations you've already signed it for ratifying what you did you didn't do anything wrong you did everything right okay i have no problem with this i want to make sure the resolution reads properly because we're not executing it's already been executed are you asking the question why is it written the way it's yes it is yes i am because i didn't know it was signed like okay well that's what it says here to our packet so yeah it has been signed so due to the september this is lynn reeves to the mayor and city council august 23rd due to the september 1st 2021 deadline set by the bureau of recovery florida division of emergency management for florida municipalities to execute the agreement city manager reads has executed the agreement so again not saying you did anything wrong you did it right we wanted to get this thing signed we're going to ratify it tonight i'm sure we'll go seven to zero i just want to make sure the resolution is legally proper here should we strike execute from both locations mr riley that make it legally correct as to what we're intending to do here tonight since it's been executed yes to be a thousand percent legally accurate you with the factual situation you can amend it by striking uh shall execute or whatever the language was somebody want to give me a amendment on this um i would amend it to say ratifying the city manager's execution of the agreement and i suggest we just say take out two execute and execute it's in there twice if we do that i think it's compliant unless mr riley tells us otherwise that's fine i just want it's leslie's motion so she has to agree whatever we need to do to make it proper to make it safer you'd strike [Music] on the amendment act of counsel let's learn the tarah last word nope okay so i'm going to read it as revised and then we'll uh we can do this as a voice resolution can we do a voiceover padding or we have to do individual individual individual okay consideration of resolution 2021-10 a resolution of the city council the city of bellaire beach florida authorizing the city manager of the city of bellar beach florida to deliver the american rescue plan act coronavirus local fiscal recovery fund agreement providing for incorporation of recitals providing for findings providing for providing sorry providing authority to ratify and deliver the american rescue plan at coronavirus local fiscal recovery fund agreement providing for general authority providing for recording providing for copies and establishing an effective date adam clerk i guess will ratify what the city manager has done again all right council member doterra hi council member aye council member aki i remember [Music] i don't know if the copy that i have up here will be um amended for tonight but if you need me to sign it i can certainly soon swing by inside actually i'm not sure yeah i'm not even sure if i had to sign it i probably did yeah i do so we'll just have to destroy unless you want to strike it i mean have a couple of minutes after i woke up to you your call you can decide later um all right item 22 authorization to execute a purchase order for the 22nd street bridge repairs this is authorized uh contract to pro shop concrete and bridge masters construction llc for eleven thousand thirty five dollars based on 2021 f dot bridge inspection report proposed this is proposed by city manager reeves first motion manager stuart reese mayor council this is uh to do repairs that were recommended by fdot 22nd street bridge comes under fdot inspection every other year and they provide us a report which they did in january of this year per their recommendations we went out to several companies and we provided you with that documentation behind it and there is money in the current fiscal year budget we have a savings account to do repairs on both our bridges in the city and uh so i'm recommending uh approval of eleven thousand thirty five dollars for pro shot concrete improves construction to do the recommended repairs to the bridge and we've provided a copy of the report to you also mr reeves i saw a variety of different prices and stuff here and some were comparable some were an example uh the gcc people don't set up for traffic control proshot does set up for traffic control i think the other guys bridge masters had mobilization traffic control are we comparing all these apples to apples because there was a big disparity in prices over here and i just want to make sure you know it was clear that you know one of the bids was much better than others but i just want to make sure we're comparing apples to apples yeah we're comparing it based on what they submitted to us they were given the report and said told that they should give us a proposal based on the report requirements some of them is the one came back 76 thousand dollars which is pretty ridiculous uh and then the other ones let's see trying to look to see where the other one the other one had a mobilization fee of uh just ten yeah ten thousand dollars up front for no work they're just mobilizing so uh that's one of the reasons why we're recommending proshot concrete 11 035 so you want i think gcc do you not i'm reading the sentence below it is gcc okay so our explanatory is wrong our our motion is correct so you want to you want gcc yes okay so we're going to cross that out i'm going to reread that when we vote on it okay okay the pro shot concrete is out they were seven pieces that's what i thought okay that was all my question i just read this lower sentence i saw it don't worry i just want to make sure you're getting who you want here and you want the 76 000 when that's online and we need to fix the words and they've done repairs for us before uh given the volume on that bridge we don't really need flagmen and stuff like that they can safely do it without it right okay okay all right council any other comments citizens any comments at the council last word we're just slow benny question item 22 authorization to execute purchase order for 22nd street bridge repairs this is to authorize a contract to bridge masters construction for eleven thousand thirty five dollars in general i'm sorry yeah it's still wrong okay my mistake i'm gonna reread that last one authorized contract to gcc general caulking and coding's company for eleven thousand thirty five dollars based on 2021 f dot bridge inspection report correct mr reeves yes okay yes vote passes this we can do this as a voice vote yes all in favor all right hi anyone opposed seven to zero mr reeves you're authorized to move forward unfinished business i'm sorry 22a frank bankert frank would you mind i don't i didn't write down exactly what you want this to be titled so would you please just introduce this was one sentence if you could 12th street lot access beach access parking violations according to our interview okay do i have a motion to make motion second second second by uh i i heard robin's robin uh go ahead anyway um last thursday when i started saying before i was at a border i apologize i was going north on call or around 9am and there was in our 12th street lot two tractor trailers and 130 ton crane all parked using up more than half of our lot on my way back the crane was being built which again saying that the counterweights the block and accessories were being put on the access path to the beach was further blocked because you had to back the trailers in to get the counterweights etc i went home got my cell phone took some pictures of this and sent to our city manager and clerk the reason who would issue a permit on a parking lot which was built for cars that generally weigh under three times now supporting a crane that weighs 100 tons okay 100 tons the two tractor trailers coming in probably had counterweights so now they were legal okay everything was legal because they had permits to move the crane okay they were probably around eighty thousand pounds all right the crane weighs approximately 55 tons unbuilt right the reason the two tractor throws were there was to carry the as i explained permits are required by dot on equipment vehicles that are oversized and overweight before movement on roads further permits and costs may be required for bridges if wanting permanent wrap these permits all have heavy costs associated with them each time these these pieces of equipment are moved reason being they tear up the roads and bridges hence compensation is collected before him permits are further on specific roads and routes meaning travel is addressed on roads which do not have weight requirement restrictions we just passed on 22 and reported or amended to have a bridge report right in there it says traffic restriction based on road rating analysts posts are not required structure is posted at both approaches single unit truck 11 tons combination 19 tons we had over 200 000 pounds on that lot in just one area all right that's why they have these restrictions getting back to the email i sent to our city manager and emailed me back and noted we only issued permits for our residents it would have no involvement or knowledge of other permits so the question is who would issue a permit to allow this type of weight on our lives other question would be was an identification contract entered into to assume liability in the event of loss or injury now the pictures i passed out has a circle on the outrigger that was blocking the beach access okay so it was a tripping haz further if you look at the crane the outriggers are not fully extended when the operators are fully extended when the turret or the upper structure it's called turns the counterweights will not go past generally and on that crane it is the upper structure so when the crane swung it was completely into the access path of that beach all right now where i come from we would have it called an oil or apprentice watch down here all right i'm not going to get into right to work and everything else then but what i'm saying is that type of weight okay will destroy our parking lot all right we just settled and was brought up tonight the lawsuit at morgan clark for a slip and forward slip and fall and now we put up these little signs saying that could be slippery when wet and sand in there these are our lights these are all dots to use now the crane in question okay there was another crane there beforehand but that was on the owner's property all right that was probably i believe a 20 ton i didn't really take notice because it's been concerned when hurricane hermine came at fourth street they needed a crane for some of the damage that crane came on the owner's property of the high means watermark all right set up on their property it was on the beach and performed the service they could have used a 20-ton hydraulic truck crane or an atv tray crane and put it on the beach total with that crane would have been under 25 feet their control line is 20 i think four feet five feet right there and i'll have it exact but they elected to use our lie and i don't know why okay well i it's probably because of the loss factor of getting a permit to shut to move the crane up and down the beach but i've listened like i said the council tapes in the past and this council was 100 for the defense of this citizen by the citizens of this town or city a year ago with the beach umbrellas and everything else and again um i brought up the issue you know that we sat down i sat down with the city mayor and i was given some kind of insurance that cleaning up the beach umbrellas cleaning up the buoys and there was never an assurance here okay because clearly bel air shores has taken an approach that they can get away with this they can get away with that and they're they're actually becoming a bully to us and i don't know why we are taking it i really don't know why i don't know i i'm going to ask the council that we direct our city clerk to because the only one i can think of if we don't know positioning these permits is bellar shores perhaps but i'll tell you who's issuing the permits i'll tell you the people who've issued the appointments city clerk barbara clinching has issued dozens of them uh mayor schmidt has issued him deborah rosman issued one and i think that's everyone who's actually issued permits well those are the people issuing those permits that have better shore better hand that says it's okay to park here those are the three people we have found interveners correct me if i missed anybody who's issuing those are the issues well the only thing i can find in the bell or short minutes is back in may 21st noted in bellar shores meeting of tom brady's event is to use the park parking lots and it was asked if we could use those parking lots and the dollar shorts mayor noted issuing permits was okay by council is that their council is that our council i can't find it's not our accounts okay well who gives them the permission again your own ordinance doesn't give them permission well i i i know that and and this is just i can't wrap my head around this and until we take a stand we're going to keep getting abused and and when i proposed earlier and i was out of border and i don't think i'm out of work now we need to say hey you're parked there you're getting towed you're parked and that was actually proposed last year wasted your time well because i've done it already i did it with debbie mall we called this city manager and he didn't even come out to come to the location on 12th street we had we had the police there we spent hours they told me to go f myself the people out there we got it on video it's all part of the complaint mr banker it's all part of the complaint in terms of doing something there's only one person doing something and i'm joined by 42 other courageous people one just passed away we had 43. well we could make a stance by saying the beach umbrellas we're going to put them up at 6th street if anyone's fine we will cover the cost we can i believe we can install buoy at 6 30 i believe we can install building 12th street which would cure unsafe conditions there okay i think we have every right if you read the deeds it says submerged lands all right um and that's my motion or my motion is to pick up any cost and to install those two buoys right now and if possible if we need to go to court this council if this council approves because we have a lot of snowbirds and i'm not taking away from anybody's full-time residency because i have one all right but the snowbirds will be coming down shortly they want to go to the beach older people need the umbrellas all right let's go to court and get a restraining order on that shade like this you won't be able to do that if you could i would have you can't legally and i won't go into the detail legal strategy just trust me on that it can't be done there's a reason i filed a verified complaint that was the precursor of that you can't do it okay trust me you can't do it what about the buoys um i'm not part of the buoys thing but i know you have done an incredible amount of work i mean i know how i i don't even know how much work you've done i know some of the work you've done and it's incredible and i'll tell you what mr van guard my hat's off to you okay because i didn't know you when you came on this council i didn't know much about you um your dedication to safety for our citizens is incredible you have put this city on notice and you put the other city on notice okay of what eventually is going to be a tragedy okay it's just a matter of time okay it was so bad the other day we were home at our house and june said to me it sounds like that boat is like almost coming around and that was probably the one you were talking about that you know they were within several feet of the shoreline somebody's going to get killed it's just a matter of time now you know i said it before i can't do civil disobedience okay um i'm licensed in multiple areas and i can't go and break the law intentionally there may be people who will do that okay and then there's recourse if they get pinched by the you know by the police on that but in terms of setting up for safety if you want motion to whatever we have to do to get bullies in there you got my support 100 i appreciate what you've done here i went to that 12th street the other day there's cracks all over that that mcadam over there this thing has done a number on there this is absolutely unacceptable this is dangerous oh and by the way we have an indemnification agreement as part of our interlocal agreement if anyone gets hurt on the beach access belair beach will pay for it so when we're derelicting our duties by not forcing people like this to get waivers by turning a blind eye and say it's not my job well it is your job because the interlocal agreement requires it and if somebody got hurt on this crane their attorney guarantee you will read the interlocal agreement and go oh it's baller peach's problem imagine if you're a city and by the way i don't know what council signed this thing worst agreement in history we are completely liable for everything that happens on those those easements we have completely assumed all liability so if somebody gets hurt here if somebody illegally parks here and gets hurt their car gets damaged anything it says right in there that we indemnify them we're gonna come to citizen comments we will i'll get to it as soon as we go through council again just just to clean this up i have my belly full with the fwc about this buoy permit that we requested have unnecessary buoys that believe was signed in may 2020. all right i went round and round with them i finally said you know what the hell this i filed an appeal of the building permit okay on my own so i'm going to be i guess you know as a bad child here okay because you won't be and not by 40 interveners you won't be well i'm just saying okay this if i'm successful in getting that movie permit repealed then the old apartment comes back and 17 buoys would be reinstalled okay now according to fwc it's unstretched or the statute language has been changed 12 years ago all up and down the coast we'll see the same language all right but they're now telling us that we have to change our buoy language okay it's all nonsense it's all typical government crap that they just don't want to get off their dead keisters but i really believe that we should throw those two buoys out there at 6 30 which is ours and 12 streets may i say something yes um actually a couple things you said that you went ahead and filed this bill did you do that on behalf of the city of miller was you personal right frank banker i used my own email account i mailed it from my home address okay so that would be made a public record at this point since it was mentioned is that correct to the city so that okay the city should get a copy of my complaint since we filed for the amended permanent appeal okay and then um as far as the inner local agreement and the liability of that clause you were talking about i've mentioned this before when several of the citizens had so much concern about that maybe we should give them the 60-day notice and bail out of that so that's an option too and um i am not i'm sorry about council member banker but i am not in support of the police that's my opinion there is their property it's on their tax rolls not ours it's on their needs not ours so i'm sorry i'm not gonna vote for that at all because you're a real big um proponent and supporter of not spending the citizens money but he didn't want to spend money to put something out there in the property we don't know i'm a proponent guys let's have a conversation i don't know she didn't say anything that was improper so i'll put that out of order but uh rita's welfare okay go ahead frank i'm a proponent of not spending the taxpayers money on frivolous things like the sign that's going to be installed outside we put 3 500 in that budget away from buddhists a year we just spent what thirty five thousand dollars on sign all right i'm looking for two buoys that will probably be less than a thousand dollars all right which are a safety item all right now that sign all right what kind of safety is that providing the citizens of this town all right in fact you get a drunk trying to read it he might ride into it so i am a proponent of safety and i don't care what the cost is when it comes to safety you'll see that in the future but um i don't know why you would be against two buoys that would cure where you live and where other people live i don't think rita's made any statement against the safety thing i think what she's saying is there are other issues here now what's the rest of the story with respect to this thing i mean there are things happening based on this appeal and stuff basically the legal standing of this thing as well as again rita's raising a very poignant question is what's the legalities of this thing now we have easements in the parking lot but how does that extend into is it this easy or is there another is there a rest in the store and there was a lot well here's here's just to clarify the buoys okay uh we're working on fixing our buoys so they come into compliance we sent the uh i asked the city attorney to prepare an ordinance to change our ordinance because currently it doesn't meet the statute requirements which council member banker is aware of those things have changed and we're going to have to change the wording on our moves we sent that to florida fish and wildlife actually yesterday i got the friend sent me the ordinance we sent it up there he sent it to me over the weekend i think i sent it to you last week and yeah you and i turned it around in about a day and a half right so we're in the process of getting our buoys in the gulf the city's movies in the gulf alliance with current statutes the requirements so that is went forward they have to approve the change in the order they'll send it back to us then we'll bring it to the city council as far as balor shore and i've discussed this with councilmember banker the the situation is in the position of the florida fish and wildlife or florida wildlife commission is you cannot go into another city and get a permit for buoys when this buoy permit was originally done 2000 was it one right in 2002 okay when it was originally done both cities went together bellar shore paid for the buoys in front of theirs city of bellar beach paid for the buoys in front of our city last year we wanted to update our buoys because we had a lot of them that were missing we wanted to put it back so uh bellar shore did not want to pull back and it isn't that somebody took them away what happens to buoys unfortunately as they break away you may find them in saint petersburg or out in the ocean somewhere so if the current situation is based on what florida wildlife commission is stated to me is we're going to fix ours so we're in compliance we've got the prices to have a offender go out because we don't have the resources and then every three years we will have to have someone go out and do an inspection on because we don't have the capability to do that they have stated that we cannot put buoys in a city that is not ours basically bellar shores of another jurisdiction so what i understand and i heard about it after the fact from bishop wildlife they asked me if i knew about it and frank had already done it sent the i guess the appeal and i haven't seen it because so that's what i know about your appeal well the permit of 2002 the permit of 2020 clearly states that any buoy is missing it has to be replaced immediately all right i can't see how 17 got missing all in one day all right so i don't know if we were plucking out some of those buoys and putting them in our area or not i don't know but we've never been in compliance okay fwc has not held us in compliance now all of a sudden fwc because i brought this to the attention of them and it wouldn't back off threatened us okay saying we're just going to make you change the language or we'll remove your permit and take all your buoys right meanwhile indian rocks clearwater or sankey has the same verbiage on their voice all right so where's equal protection of the wall here and why are we keep taking these threats from these agencies that do nothing okay they haven't they haven't enforced their own permit and we haven't really monitored our own permit i don't know how many years but now we're going to spend money and change the verbiage of our our buoys and allow the other towns to go away with nothing just because i brought this to their attention of a safety issue and this is this is nothing but a safety issue as you said mr mayor this is an accident waiting to happen all right and i'm not talking about you know a rush word i'm talking about a possible death and bellar sure's previous commissioners even said that one of them said that saves one life i don't care what the cost is commissioner rosen said not even a year ago let's put the money from the [Music] pennies for pinellas back to get the buoys all right so i can't see how they're 100 percent against it council member banker and i don't remember the hurricane because we get them every year but i believe it was either hermine or irma one of those where those we had movies they were on 6th street i used to swim there every single day and they i don't think anybody took them there we had a hurricane it was hermine was pretty rough even though it was a smaller hurricane and those things were gone and i and then it was weird because i think after maybe lynn reeves may remember i think after irma like one of them came back it was really weird you know but it was in the wrong spot so it looks like it must have broken loose and maybe it was submerged the other ones as you go further up towards 12th street i don't know what happened to those they all disappeared but you used to be able to go out in the water and i know because i used to swim beyond those buoys and come back okay i do long distance swimming and you would be able to go and you'd be able to see every single bully in one and now you can see it at indian rocks but you can't see it here well we wanted sixth street okay got washed down on irma to third street you're gonna say well how do you know it was that one well it had a leak in it and i patched it okay so i would not pass it yet and and it was fine but it still took off so i know it was a six street boot but in terms of not being replaced immediately i mean that was what three years four years ago hermine was what two yeah seven years ago now i was in seven it was like four years or so ago but it was a while ago anyway their derivative did not replace him yeah absolutely robin right after frank um i'm all about the buoys and the safety but i kind of want to talk about go back to some issues that you said about a different subject about the crane um if there's damage to the in that parking lot aren't we responsible for paying for it so and that may issue where you said the film crew with some council members thought it was fine because tommy boy was great thank you well i like to call tommy tommy boy because he was a big star it's okay but i don't agree with that i contacted lynn reeves and sent him pictures and i actually just pulled up the picture it was the parking permit has the seal of bellaire shore and is signed by kaluchi now my understanding is they aren't allowed to give out permits so if they're not allowed to give out permits for tommy boy his friends film boys to park there then they should have been cited or ticketed or something like for example can i on my computer sign a permit and have all my friends park there and walk to my house for a party is that okay or would i get in trouble because if i can't do it tommy boy shouldn't be able to do it don't waste your time calling the pinellas sheriff asking for a ticket because i got that one on tape and it's part of my litigation style what was that frida did you say something because excuse me i'm i'm sorry do you want to say something i'm right here keep saying tommy boy and all that stuff i mean okay come on that was old discussions old council meetings want to bring up the old discussion do you like to always bring up like money and overspending and how much we pay on the journey all the time okay just thought so thank you let's go back to the uh the waste of time that would be to contact the sheriff i spent an hour i took it all the way up to the corporal level our wonderful friend captain weiner did nothing absolutely nothing i showed him the ordinance of bel air shore i read them the ordinance that says they are not allowed to issue permits to anyone but belair beach residents we confirmed that the construction companies were not from bel air beach because guess what folks we don't have businesses in our beautiful premier city you know what they did nothing nothing but lynn told me they were not going to enforce the law they said it's quote it's their loss and they can do what they want i said but here's the law we don't care thanks sheriff so lynn did they contact you for permits to park there like the film crew yeah they someone not well whatever it was they asked me if we had a parking place and i told them i would rent them parking spaces in our lot here and i told them you know we'd probably give them some kind of discounted fee for you know how many other days and uh they called me back and said they got it taken care of so because i told them i had i couldn't give you bargaining my last did you tell them that they are not allowed to park there without a permit and you will not be giving them one what i didn't give them any permission no i know but i'm saying that they asked permission you said you don't have control wait let's get this on the record is belair shore allowed to write permits for those three parking lots according to the ordinance not to their win their ordinance we only give permits to our residents we don't give them to anyone else that's we but is bellaire sure i i ordered it's allowed i don't know what their ordinance says give me two minutes i'll have an answer to you i'm just pulling that meeting code and i'm gonna read it right well i'm just saying we need this on the record now so all our residents know we don't issue permits to anyone but our residents no i know that that's us i'm asking them is barbara calucci's signatures on this one and why don't we do an information request on all permits issued for this year and take them to court for the loss of reptiles or find them why don't we start being a little aggressive instead start taking i don't want to look and it's another point in the movie but you never want to fight by keep taking a punch right well i sent this picture to lynn reeves 2 the parking sign that says restricted parking parking only for bellaire beach vehicles with valid permits police patrol town of miller short does not say and the women are sure based on who their friends are and via construction yes i have your answer to your question let's get this on the record would you like this verbatim i would love it please quote this will be the quote section quote section 30-57 parking permits this is from the munico bel air shore no motor vehicle shall be parked on beach access lots 21 43 66 at 6th street 12th street and 18th street if you don't know unless such motor vehicle bears a parking permit a decal or sticker authorizing such parking period such parking permits shall only be issued as may be provided by the board of town commissioners to the property owners in the city of bel air beach east of gulf boulevard and shall be numbered i will buy you a soda or an adult beverage if you show me a number on any barbara kaluchi permit okay um that's it the rest is reasonable rules and parking permits and stuff like that okay that's what the law is so the answer is no they're not allowed is that your end quote yes i'm sorry yes i'm sorry the quote ended i'm sorry fatty shouldn't have said anything that was my bad the uh it ends at and shall be numbered numbered is the end quote thank you and back to you uh brother i mean it's freak i mean i before you got on console i've been talking about this about how you know if the sheriff is going to be used more more you know enforcing the umbrella issue then they need to pay more that i'm tired of always having to deal with bella or shore and being like the the redhead stepchild where we get cracked on and you know just stuff like the pictures of the parking lot being half-fold with film crew for a resident a non-resident of bell or shore borrowing a house when i can't do the same thing if someone wants to film a document on me which would be very interesting um nope but so my whole point is i'm with you frank i i'm not a fan of bullying i'm tired of it so what i don't know what we can do i can't buy my son right he doesn't win i can't get one for my mom so she can take my kids to the beach you do live here i'll give you a solution i've got 43 interveners in this case become an intervener in the case or the city of bel air beach can enter into the lawsuit you don't have to take this you don't have to take it we need four votes on this council and then the city of bellar beach is involved in the lawsuit the city has the right to sue as a property owner do you have an option we haven't exercised it only one person had the courage to bring the lawsuit in this city it's okay 43 people who joined that's your option you can do it individually you can do it as a city you don't have to take it please don't come in my lawsuit and work against me you won't be in it very long well i don't think as a council member all right um we i should be fighting for the residents all right i shouldn't have to intervene in a public or private policy we i took an oath to uphold the support of constitution defense united states constitution clearly says i have a beach i have the right to use the beach behind me it means high water mark okay if i don't do something they're in violation and everyone here is in violation so i'll make a motion that we do get involved in the lawsuit okay or we sh we sue them not getting by the lawsuit that we sue them on behalf of the people of bel air beach for violating our constitutional rights okay and putting us in a hazardous situation is that a motion yeah there's a motion we have a second second then i don't have to recuse myself thank you i was gonna have to hand this over and go through that whole form ate again but um because i would have to step aside on that one i can't preside over that part of it but you know what the options are folks okay so um when done and then we're still debating here on council and i see there's some hands and we're going to come to the uh the citizens as soon as we finish your council clinton yeah a couple issues before i come back to the bowie thing is i found it oddly out of character for robin to be talking about tommy boy it sounded ugly passive aggressive to me to quite a phrase i've heard i'm familiar with counsel of course yes because he's thrown around a lot with respect to a lawsuit the government's been tossed down by the mayor the city's council just said no we're not going to intervene in this so i would suggest that if you feel that strong about instead of accusing us as a counsel for not standing up for this thing why don't you intervene and become part of the lawsuit i've asked that question myself several times they they speak very strongly about it but then that's the end of their involvement in this thing coming back to buoys for just a second i asked the city uh manager what's the rest of the story and my understanding is there's been some trickle-down effect from this involvement with the fwc on this stuff basically they're not just targeting us anymore they're looking at looking at our neighboring municipalities for compliance and this thing may mushroom and balloon and affect everybody who all of a sudden they had no interest in this thing but all of a sudden the fwc is going to come down and be looking at their permits and boo replacements and there may be additional costs or problems for our neighbor municipalities not all municipalities have buoys how many of our neighboring municipalities don't have buoys i can tell you there's several that don't have buoys uh on on the ocean side and there's almost none on the intercoastal we're one of the few and i can also tell you that the [Music] conversations i had with them about the intercoastal buoys they could come back and tell us to take them out because they're not compliant but at this point the only one they're looking at is us because councilmember banker made calls to them and and now my understanding and you can correct me if i'm wrong frank but i understand that the staff any conversation with them any further is with their attorney is that correct yeah she um she when she threatened me that she was gonna and i can't believe she's an attorney because she puts it in writing and she's gonna take all the buoys out because i brought this to the issue okay i said then let the blood be on your hands okay with the first injury all right and then she immediately called you okay so this is the ridiculous behavior from the fwc and like i said those bullies that the language you're talking about being changed mr gunn i think the first time it was changed was in 2010. all right the permit has to be as mr reed says renewed every three years so for over a decade they approved an unstatute plan it just kept it proven just kept approving and their answer is why did you approve it we don't have a staff for checking out so if you don't have the staff to check them out you should give up that right to monitor the permit that would be an argument i'll make it from an aoj no to address the movies again the trickle-down effect that you know one's alluding to that it may trickle into other municipalities good because then they'll be safer that's like saying oh this one highway has drag racers and so now one person complains about now the cops show up and now nobody can drag race good so bring down the trickle-down effect i like it they'll be safer for all the other beaches and swimmers and tourists and you know i applaud frank for being proactive and not reactionary so we're gonna wait for the first taurus the first kid to be killed by a drunk boat that gets too is oh close sorry i was like not passive aggressive enough i was talking i'll i'll talk louder if you can't hear me she has the floor you're next mr run okay okay can you hear me am i close enough i just want to make sure so i i'm all for i've always been since day one i tried to get traffic and safety in this thing about uh speeders on our street and i was shot down so i'm all for safety um so frank i completely support you with everything and you know the fact that they're threatening you is showing me that they are seeing their flaws and they can't uh own up to them so now it's easier to bully you into uh blank on this next and uh just caution you the unexpected consequence all of the things come out all the boys come out it's it's like putting your faith in a bicycle laying on the bridge they tell us we can't ride on the sidewalks because there's a bicycle leg next time you drive over that bridge look how many skid marks there are up on the divider on the side of the road protecting that sidewalk from traffic going right through the bicycle lane hitting the guardrail when next time you drive that bridge take a look at the skid marks on there and it'll blow you away what i'm saying is don't put your faith in a boy or a painted line it takes a little personal responsibility and i i'm for you i want those buoys in there i'm not fighting others but i'm just saying you've got to be careful what you what you ask for and how you do it because you need the cooperation of those government agencies you make them mad or you antagonize them they're not your friend anymore they're working against you they're not working with you or for you i'm starting to get that impression that we're alienating the people who we need to assist and help us mr gunn for the record before i sat on council i contacted our city manager about this issue okay i've been a total sweetheart okay for months on this i can show you volumes of emails showing boats two feet away from children's heads okay i can show you both coming in my neighbors almost hitting that i can show you videos i sent to the fwc all i ask them is to comply with number 14 of the amended permit saying if it's a safety violation the permit must be withdrawn okay they more or less gave me the middle finger on the whole thing all right so what am i supposed to do roll over and play dead it's just like again the bellaire shores about getting the beach umbrellas back they can't get the middle finger all right they're not going to do it until somebody takes them on mr baker dude uh key they have the same issue they have the same buoys okay and uh what same garbage what are they doing i don't know i i'm not a councilman for sankey but they have the same i went up and down the coast taking pictures of buoys the coordinates and everything like that like i said since i retired as long as i keep out of my wife's hair she's happy i'm not sure if it's true or not but i heard that because of of the ongoing conversation they may be pulling their buoys too i'm not i can't guarantee that but frank a couple things i think you may have excuse me you may have um done some of these already some because i might have heard about but i i certainly will um maybe my contacts if that's what will help you you've contacted our uh our representative nick sibling you've contacted senator brandes i think did we get anything from these people not from the senator but nick i've talked to a couple times because i could have gotten you in touch with them i'm surprised you didn't get anything from senator brandeis i don't want to break sunshine rule here or anything like that but um we can reach out to them where i can get i mean i can i can make a call saying that you're going to call them or something and that will help the other thing is you know i'm not going to worry about what's going to happen with some other city and whether fwc is going to come down on us take this to the media that's what we did we brought the film crew right to the beach it didn't matter they didn't care but you know it doesn't look good it doesn't play well and i don't think anybody's going to look at that video and say oh yeah sure like those boats you know right up on a you know 10 year old kid's head we have media contacts too if you need it so um you know we can get you in touch i can get you on the radio i can get you uh you know and maybe that's what's needed is for you to start going out because you are doing one hell of a job and i totally admire what you're trying to do for this city and this city safety i i will help you however i possibly can in here and to the extent that it's legal outside of here well i don't i it's mr guys i don't i don't use the sand key beach okay i would hate to see those removed um but that's up to the people of sand cave they want to they want to allow i i i still i mean i don't i worked in black's wall i worked in webster's teacher i don't understand what the premier city is anymore i mean i i understand the definition but i just don't see it here well we call it our two-hour sound so you don't hear anybody else calling us do you yeah all right can we go to good citizens they've been waiting they want to talk on this jim jim vinsque 7th street beach uh first one this is a question and then you could just answer it after leave because i know we can't go back and forth um any of the buoys that are there or were there i should say or there do we still have maybe the amount still there so all we're doing is basically putting a moving back and hooking it to a mount and then maybe do maintenance down the road if you get what we're trying to say on the existing second of all can't that kind of pressure on a parking lot cause a um a sinkhole a sinkhole now think about false code okay now that those commissioners that we're having problems with or the one commission maybe and the the crane gives way because of the parking lot and now it falls over on his house where's the liability for this city vice versa the brand new house where's the liability for this city okay second of all osha has rules uh safety pools what osha things were presented to this city showing that they were in place to protect this city for that job site third of all i'm not seeing anything was cornered off keeping any kind of people from going in that area where that crane was working so there was no safety precautions in place even if they did use the lot okay not at all okay third of all if anybody who's been here long enough if you remember the boating accident that happened because of the no wake zone in the rocks beach and several people were killed because somebody did not respect the noah's um they came across with the civil right right across another boat that was crossing the water and killed several people this was several years ago and just recently the debris that was in the water in the water where somebody got killed and thrown from a boat okay so safety is supposed to be our number one issue in our strategic plan in this city and and this city needs to start taking a look at the safety of our citizen than anyone else that that comes into our city that we're going to be liable for thank you thank you frank you can you want to respond at the end or you want to speak because i see you always coming up next but i don't want to get into a council discussion but if you want to respond back i don't know as she brought up i don't know if the anchors are still in place there um they may be the coordinates are pretty clean okay you can go down there and check um but it might be a simple solution but real quick i don't mean to cause you but there is still one billion bellaire shores okay it's around 17 i i never known you could be half pregnant wait are we changing that verbiage because fwc says you can't touch them it's not in our jurisdiction how do we go change that so is there going to be one bully saying no weight zone in the other one saying no swims there this is beyond again ridiculous my comment on the movies is that i think it's absurd to get upset about protesting the lack of movies because the consequences might be there to pull all the buoys i don't see how anyone can pull all the movies and i think the media is our answer because once the stink gets raised about safety and the lack of safety and cigarette boats coming up and down that beach very very fast and close to the beach so excuse me i don't know much about the boom situation but thank you because i think that is um really really important but i am livid about the parking lot i don't think canceling our interlocal agreement is an answer to the bully all right the answer to the bully is to stand up to the bullying we are responsible for any and all damage and liability folks does that not bring it would string fear my heart about you that at any time anything they do could cause us this city to pay aside from let's let's even leave life and injury on the side let's just make money money so definitely who gave them permission to um to park there why weren't all the safety measures done over the convenience of a private homeowner that has two lots on the beach that can afford to put that crane in this property or around the back it again 12th street at least it's for the benefit of two people two private owners commissioner bloom and the new homeowner and that should not be allowed we control those parking lots and whether we own it outright or it's deeded to uh valley or shore but it's the eu to believe short for our benefit and it says it on the deeds for air beach residents so they don't have unfettered control on these um on these locks and what they're doing now is they issue the parking uh letter and they fold back the signature so that we can't see who's signing the parking lot the letter giving permission but we see the letter but they fold their statements back so they are in total violation of their own ordinance we need to step up this council needs to step up and send them some kind of warning do something we can make them stop issuing permits and we certainly can i would tell them i will start telling any of you anybody i don't see why we can't call uh have a contract with the tow committee because the police sadly do not respond with all respect to the sheriff's office they don't respond and when it comes to the umbrella i'm not even going to discuss it they they don't respond so definitely they're the bullies thank you thank you councilmember for the bullying thank you any other citizens wish to comment saying no other hands i'll bring it back to council well maybe the answer is what she just gave us we hire our own private company i didn't look at that but that's a great idea the other thing is i believe we ought to do an information request on all permits that were issued by that other source we were there several councils have talked about towing companies because that would be the easiest way to do it first couple cars that are towed well i'll tell you what queen's house so i'd like mr vanguard see her in the audience tonight jody shirley came across i didn't come across but went across and made the comments and brought the comments of this council to their council this council had a meeting and most of those suggestions were made by one of our citizens rick shock okay about towing about stepped up police enforcement there was a variety of stuff she made every one of those guess what goodbye thanks for coming have the lovely partying gift but remember i told you earlier that was the 21st of july 2020. city manager was working with them on the 15th we had zero chance of getting those suggestions so maybe you want to try it again i'm not going across i can't speak with them okay but i'm not allowed to legally but other people can there's nothing stopping you from going over there and making these proposals towing is an absolute way of ending all the illegal parking but the suggestion's been given a million times well we don't need their approval no i think you do i think you do well if they don't have a valeria beach permit on their car and you can tell them um fred reilly can i i didn't bring my inner local agreement tonight i don't believe i have it but i believe is it paragraph five where it talks about strict enforcement and it's kind of vague who is supposed to be strictly enforcing the permit system i could read it and easily come to the conclusion that bellar beach is responsible i could read it and say well bellar beach is only strictly responsible for issuing tickets uh you know parking stickers okay we certainly know that this crane isn't parked anywhere in bellair beach and if you could show it to me i buy you a bottle of your favorite scotch because it's not here because we don't have a crane business in this city so whoever issued this permit or if no one issued the permit that that was improper i just read you the statute the police missed this guys i love you you do a great job how the hell did you miss this frame it was there until at least 5 p.m liner says don't enforce it so you don't enforce it a liner is wrong and i had the guts to say and i told him that so i'm not saying anything behind his back remind him gentlemen that i told him at our emergency management services meeting and he was improperly enforcing this law he doesn't return my telephone calls so mr riley if we hire a towing company and start towing cars that do not have a belair beach parking vermin sticker are we liable for any type of damages can i answer a different question which size shoe do i wear i i wanted to comment for 45 minutes so i have several comments everything i'm going to say is oriented towards solving problems that is the absolute objective so i'm going to segregate the problems into two two categories two things and two things only so if you want to make a response please don't bring in other things stick to the two things that i'm going to use as examples the the first one is the buoys okay there's a safe statue that specifies what you have to do in order to have buoys or replace buoys and then there are florida administrative code provisions that further define how you should do that okay so that that's a i'm establishing factually what the situation is state law requires that you do certain things so fundamental thing for me you should comply with the state law okay i am in no way diminishing the safety issue that you have very passionately set forth but my job is to tell you how to make sure you don't have problems and one of them is i can't solve the problem related to somebody that's drunk in a cigarette though but i can tell you how to implement a solution consistent with florida law and that to me is very clear cut the city of bel air beach has jurisdiction and the city of bel air shore has another jurisdiction they do not overlap where bel air shore ends bel air beach begins and that's up to sam key so the the point that i'm making is you as the city council can fix the problem within your jurisdiction and lynn contacted me last week and asked me to prepare a an org a change to the ordinance so it would be consistent with florida law and consistent with the administrative code and i uh put together the the code change and got that back to him in a day and a half so that has to be of course considered by the city council one of the nuances of state law is that for this type of ordinance change you have to submit it to the commission for them to review it before it becomes effective so that was written in to the the ordinance change so lynn has that i i he hasn't told me this but i surmise it from what something he said earlier i think he's probably already sent it to them to look at to for them to at least give us some initial feedback we're still going to have to if you want to go forward with it go through the procedure or bring it in up before the city council in october and then in november and then in november once assuming it's passed then it's submitted to the commission and they finalize it if they look at it before you have your meeting in october which i would hope they would do then you should it should be a absolute they will approve it later on but you know people sometimes act inconsistently so for purposes of the buoy issue the solution is being done and i leave out the discussion about the and all that stuff i i don't know that much about that because i lynn did not ask me to get involved heavily in that i know there's been a lot of communications back and forth i really don't have much to say on the set status of permits but i do have tell you that you have a solution waiting in the wings which is to change your city code so that's what i would recommend you do so that that to me is the solution to that problem the other city if they choose to run their jurisdiction differently then that's up to them i don't know what uh mechanism there is legally for the city of bel air beach to make the city of bel air shore do something in relation to buoys within their jurisdiction don't know if if you press me for a a suggestion i would suggest talk to your state representative or state rep senator and you it sounds like you've already done that i mean this should be to me a pretty easy thing for the cities to work together on but at this point in time uh bel air shore has chosen their path and you you're trying to choose your path so that that's that one issue i'll go now to the other issue prior to you explaining this i had no idea there were cranes on the lot okay um just wasn't aware of it if and i i was aware of the film crew months ago and of course uh hope that that sort of thing wouldn't happen again but um apparently it ha something similar happened with respect to the cranes my suggestion on solving that problem is that the council authorized myself and lynn to address how to get this resolved with the other city and if the resolution it i i don't know when your next um workshop is but i i would assume it's within one to two weeks that we come back to you and with a several options as to how you address it part of the reason i suggest you do it that way is i i'm not challenging anything that anybody said here this evening i i will take it as you're you're telling me factually accurate manner what happened but the the appropriate thing to do before anybody starts talking about let's file a lawsuit is let's establish actually what the situation is and i've read the interlocal agreement i've read the deeds i've read all that stuff numerous times but i don't have instant recall and can't tell you all the intricate nuances of that stuff off the top of my head but between now and when the council next meets for a workshop i i would suggest we len and i work on trying to figure out a way to address that specific issue with the use of the parking lot and again i'm not diminishing that either i mean if it's your your property and there's something bad goes that goes wrong on your property then there's always going to be an issue of liability and uh the points you raise are to me very legitimate points to raise but the solutions are establish factually what the situation is and then come back to the council with options so those are my two recommendations well could you look into putting the buoy at 6 and 12th street um if the appeal was successful it would resort back to the joint permit of 2002 which is bel air beach and bellar shores hence uh bel-air shores would have to submit their own permit to have i guess our apartment or the joint permit modified is that buoy within bel air beach's jurisdiction or their jerusalem jurisdiction it's still there it's within it's in within bel air shores jurisdiction well it's office yes it's within your shores jewish nation if it's within their jurisdiction i don't i don't know what mechanism you have to force them to do something within their jurisdiction and the question again is you know we're going to change all the verbiage on ours which that will be i believe still on under our apartment i think the coordinates is i've had to check the coordinates again i don't have them here but i think it is so we so bellaire shores has one buoy then okay what permits adam i understand he's just one of the buoys that's it's the only movie that's left so what happens is like i said they break away and how they're put in now they don't drill them they put them in on a concrete concrete thing and going back trying to find them to put another buoy there you'd be chasing the wind then bellar shores has one permit or one buoy with no permit so they're in violation of the fwcf it just gets i think technically you're right they are yeah and and what is the fwc in that brandy the the attorney doing about that nothing frank let me ask you this because it's going on 11 o'clock here what do you want tonight from us what do you want out of i mean we can we can have an action item tonight okay you can ask for something you know action wise as long as it's not related to spending money we said that was okay you can have an action item tonight we can do this as a work session for more information i don't agree with having liberated to do anything across the street so i have a problem with that um we just went through that for the first half hour we're not doing that game again i have no problem with fred reilly talking to people across the street but i gotta accuse myself that that's gonna happen okay so i'm not putting any leverage on these people whatsoever i'm going to make that perfectly clear i got a lawsuit i don't care what you do as a city of bel air beach they've got us get emotional we're not related on this thing i'm going to do what i got to do i'm going to get them completely removed as trustees that's going to be the end of the game that's what i'm going for you can do whatever you want to try and settle it but it's not going to change me one bit just understand that now i want to know from you though i want to call a question what would you like the question is i would like i'm keeping belarus shores addison toad i would like two buoys one placed at sixth street under the submerged lands as our deed says and one place in 12th street but what i was hearing is that there was at least from our legal person who was saying that that might not be possible so we have been asking him to look into this so we're asking him to do the research to see if it's possible is to put a buoy on 6th and 12th to provide safety for our residents okay now i think we can do that so the question is before us is this council authorized fred riley to do some research within reason obviously you're always reasonable so within reason um as to is it possible given everything and mr bank art is the expert here uh to put a building on six to put a buoy on twelve given the current conditions mwc the rules the hurricane rules you name it we just heard you know this is mine there's a lot of stuff here um are you asking me can that be done can you research that yesterday of course i can i can look into it if we can determine if it's something that this city can do right and the caveat to that is this city may not be able to make that happen and then you said that and if we can't do it then i have to step as much as i want to have safety i can't authorize us to go out and violate somebody else's you know sovereign space i'm not going to do that um other people might i will um but you know if you tell us there's any way of doing it then let's go for it it is safety and it is our number one priority um i don't think we're asking i hope we're not asking for too detailed of a legal research thing here but sometimes these things tend to go crazy you never know the solution is for me to call the the attorney that you've communicated with and i i will talk to them i mean i i've read over the emails back and forth and you you have done a stellar job of trying to figure out how to get something done and i may hit the same brick wall that you had i don't know but i that would be the first call and i i will not spend endless time trying to figure it out that i i say again the starting point is to establish factually what you're trying to do and who has jurisdiction over that that is the starting point meanwhile you have the the proposed ordinance that did you send it to him okay so it's now in front of them and i will gladly call that the attorney for that the commission and talk to her and see if if we can expedite them giving us some review of that statue or the the ordinance there's nothing in it that they should reject i mean i went meticulously through the code or the statute and the administrative code provision to make sure i was using all the language that they use in both of those two resources so there's no reason they should reject it but that's up to them and it's it just has to be noted though about those deeds and our access and submerged land part of that when you're talking to the city can i make a comment too oh are you done with the pool well i guess i'm done for now thanks uh before we take that step uh wouldn't it be feasible to go ahead and get you to send all these public or all these records that you state that you have showing all your communications so we can at least look at something a little bit more than just go and send in our city attorney to do something i mean i'd like to see all the documentation that you have so i asked patty so i sent it through uh except for the appeal i sent everything through uh city or city account okay so the world representing the city versus i thought i heard you say earlier you did that on your personal account on the appeal of the tournament but there is no has been done on the city can you send that a building as well so that i can i can forward it to patty mr banker you might want to review the public records rules first of all it isn't public record so you make your own decision or speak with fred riley about that you don't necessarily have to provide that perhaps okay i know mine is a personal lawsuit and it's not part of this and fred riley's already written on that so there's a memo i have nothing to hide okay nothing to hide either but what you're entitled to is what you're entitled to with regard to um so we're going to call that question um and with regard to this parking situation we really don't have much that we can offer you i will tell you this and it's going to be extremely cryptic for a reason okay by the next time we meet i might have some more information and that's all i'm going to say okay about this issue okay um i i will know something that's quite important okay um that's all i'm saying okay um so let's go ahead and well respect to the voice has that question already been asked of fwc whether or not we have any standing to ask for a replacement off of shores yes it has and what was the response no we don't but i'm not questioning that i'm questioning the lots that are deeded to us in the submerged land language which i believe is not under belarushore's jurisdiction because if you read into it as soon as it goes into the submerged lands it's actually the florida yeah florida exploration florida trust so that's that's where i believe we have the argument plus that would only protect our residents if balor shores at fourth street wants their people to go out there and get hit by boats frank frame this question for me please request uh city attorney to look into installing one buoy at sixth street one billion twelfth street under the language of the deeds that we were granted back in 1944 with the submerged language the suburbs land language along with the florida trust public trust dog document that's the question does everybody get glenn's nodding everybody understand the question i'm not going to try and repeat that okay so a yes vote will authorize the city city attorney to move forward with the investigative process within reason to work with frank banker who has the information and actually it sounds like a lot of it has been put in the public domain already okay so um with that we can do this as a voice vote all in favor aye aye opposed a 7-0 anybody else opposed let the record reflected six to one read this wolf is the net is the no okay because i want that in the um even though we're doing a voice vote i want the accuracy of the vote maintained every one of that says yes and that's the count zopas is 61. so mr riley you'll move forward um good luck yes sir frank thank you thank you your your dedication to the safety of this community is incredible and i i'm total admiration um unfinished business item 23 do we have any none city attorney due to the late hour i'd prefer not to give any report this evening okay city manager yes mayor console i just want to give you an update on uh the sign of bird issue uh i asked mr darrow to send me that information at the last meeting she did send it to me i contacted these people nick jennings from the florida wildlife commission and uh i spoke to him i always spoke to also spoke to the florida department of transportation and i also so spoke to mark rachel that they contacted and based on their comments there there's no requirement to do any environmental study and they the information they were given by whoever contacted him and i'm not sure who did contact them whether it was deborah mall or miss ridero based on the email i got they uh mr rachel sent me an email saying thank you for reaching out to me i don't believe there would be any negative impacts to birds that nest or roost on the intercoastal islands located a thousand feet away there's a buffer of vegetation and residential development that would obscure any direct line of sight the fdot said there's no permit required they don't do any environmental studies so whatever was said to these gentlemen it appears that it wasn't clear like maybe where the location of sign or what kind of birds they were the gentleman from florida wildlife commission told me that there are no endangered birds here the only thing the fdot said they would do is for the sea turtles on gulf boat park so we're not not an issue i think the information was just maybe misunderstood or whatever so in your opinion at this point nothing further investigation is necessary and you can move forward with the installation yeah yes yes based on what they told me city council before we let that go i just want to ask the city council if anybody has any objection to what uh city manager or the city manager moving forward with this it doesn't matter whether you were for or against the sign there's no permit issue the sign passed does anybody have any problems with him moving forward please move forward okay uh i told you at the work session just want to remind everybody because this meetings tape that we did retain our 20 reduction in the national flood insurance program for the citizens and with assistance from kyle and mark beam participating in some things that we got some extra points for i that that was very positive and i appreciate their help we talked about the carnivorous funds already the telephone system we received email on the 17th of august telling us that our phone system was obsolete and they weren't going to maintain it any longer so i reached out to two or three companies and got prices for the equipment from dollars to fifty seven hundred dollars the phone system uh currently would change over to it's called point voiceover okay uh and it looks like the most cost-effective thing to do is go through verizon instead of these specialty phone companies uh verizon will give us the equipment for the phones for 700. they won't charge us in the installation and then we'll pay a monthly fee for each of the lines which should be covered with the main the maintenance agreement that we previously had that's in the budget we'll be able to cover that with that cost so we'll you know unless you have an issue with that we'll just move forward on that because it's uh what's your total anticipated cost anticipated cost of the new system uh for the equipment 720 okay for the monthly cost it's uh 25 a line we're going to reduce some of the lines because there's phones and places that you walk across the room there's another phone so we're going to make something we're gonna end up with nine phones and that'll cost us about 245 a month for those phones so for for the service not the phones and they'll install them for us so uh that's ask a question we currently have an automated attendant uh that's that's is that included yeah okay great can you have adequate bandwidth because we will be using bandwidth now with this yeah we uh based on what verizon has told me and the two phone companies that other that came out and looked i think i think we're okay if we have to increase it we've got to do that they're not anticipating uh transfer uh changing our internet provider which is spectrum right now but we've got verizon equipment in the building and we are we do have verizon lines in here uh we're gonna be able to trunk all the numbers over we're not gonna have to change numbers no we're gonna try to trump them over okay yeah yeah they're it's the phones we eliminated were uh we had one in the park records room one in the kitchen one in the break room two in the kind of reception area well ten feet apart we don't really need to uh and the what's the room called archival uh we're gonna eliminate those funds but i'm curious as to uh where spectrum did they quote us also spectrum doesn't provide equipment they don't provide i went to them first thinking oh maybe they do this but they know and i verified that again today with another person evidently they don't know who they've called and talked to because they called me to try to talk to me about it so i've given you the county-wide planning rules amendments that's something that the county sent out and also the legislative action agenda from the florida league of cities uh probably the biggest thing on there for us is the short-term rentals at this point and you know they're they're gonna uh support some things trying to allow us maybe to amend our ordinance in the future that doesn't hurt us uh the last thing uh our second last thing neighborly services sent you all a letter asking for a donation we've done that in some years and some years we haven't we have one individual that uses that service what's the conscious pleasure on that do you want to donate or not have we previously donated uh we didn't last year but the year before we did and maybe that was because of the pandemic or maybe they didn't send us anything but you know we do give money to the uh sheriffs you know where they take the homeless so but we do have budget humanity how much are they looking for uh he didn't really say this time in the past we give them like a thousand dollars i'm okay with this since one of our citizens uses the services yeah in the letter they told me that it was what was it 20 it was like 22 or 2300 in services that our residents used actually it was 2167 they received 281 meals and one transportation in the previous 12 months i don't know what to say i mean you know we're not a charitable organization we're not a for profit so like we're giving away taxpayer money yet it's a very good cause so i have a flip coin on this i i don't know what to say really what's the next step what's everybody else think i'm good with it [Music] it's the right thing to do i didn't hear anybody say they had an issue citizens no issue go ahead and the last thing uh i've asked if i saw it on the legal bill i asked fred to look into an attorney general's opinion on public records and fees i think it's important that we resolve this once and for all if elected officials get paid for public records requests or anybody gets paid for public records requests and what that fee is and fred and i looked into it a little bit but i just want to let you know we want to settle this yes or no it's good good day thank you any questions for the city manager citizens thank you city clerk nothing no comments city council comments i don't let's see september is nine star um um yes really all i have to say is i just want to ask everyone in our community to keep the families and the victims of 9 11 in their thoughts and prayers since that anniversary date is coming up you know we [Music] this evening i just want to make sure that i mention it thank you i just want you to know i was going to mention that also and we i didn't want to intrude on uh particularly with josh's widow here um i would like to hold a moment of silence at the end here uh that is absolutely something we've never looked at we have a resolution that we passed so um we'll do one before we leave here if that's okay with everyone dave i know it's been a long night uh i do have one one comment i've talked about this before and i think i'd like to add to the next agenda uh our work session about what to do about these dilapidated uh boat lifts docks boats that have not been moved in years things growing out of them it was a it was a a rude awakening whenever our neighbors both fell in the water and then the storm was approaching and then the uh i think they had dock issues then they they tried to fish the boat out themselves and it wound up upside down for over a week in our in our area and it's all because they had a boat that they don't use they don't care about everything's rusted and the cable eventually snapped um it's it's a hazard and i see them all over the place and uh i think maybe it's time to look into doing something about it dave to your point not only we have that i'm noticing there are no boats in the in the travel lanes and you know not necessarily in the uh the channels but they're all over the place now and we talked about this we talked about what other cities have done but that's a problem too so maybe we just deal with all of these problems in one shot if you want me to latch on to your what you have there that's fine i think we need to deal with it because it's going to come this way i'm seeing them i'm not seeing as many here yet but across and i've seen them break loose too and being against the walls and stuff and it's absolutely good so let's deal with it uh just one question work session to have it right after the special meeting you know i i was going to say do we need a work session we had a real long session tonight i wasn't going to call one of us everybody else wanted one i certainly have some items that i could put on but i you know we really did double duty tonight so i if if you wanted council you got it so just let me know it would be after the 505 meeting which should take hold about 15 minutes so um i'm already here i'm up for it if others are if no one's in the mood for it we can push it out it's still hurricane season this is a good time to be talking about this because somebody or something's going to get hurt council what do you want to do work session yes yes yes everybody good okay so um after the 505 i'll probably have a few items well patty what would be the deadline for getting items on the agenda wednesday this wednesday no the wednesday today's wednesday 15th okay so that's the deadline to paddy by close business okay close the business right that's good all right okay all right do you have anything else nope that's it i'm last i um i i do want to recognize the folks with 911 20 years ago a horrible horrible day in uh new york city in the pentagon and in chanceville pennsylvania so um i'm going to ask that we adjourn but before we adjourn we're going to do the uh the moment of silence i'm not going to call you back and say let's do a motion to adjourn so let's do we have the motion to adjourn everybody in agreement yes yes now let's rise and do a moment of silence [Music] thank you everyone"
