    "transcript": "good evening everyone welcome to the monday july 12th city council meeting for the city of bellar beach this was rescheduled from july 6 due to the storm before we rise for the pledge of allegiance um fellow city as i'm sure you're all aware on june 24th surf side florida experienced the horrible tragedy the champlain tower south collapsed as of today there's 94 people confirmed getting 22 people missing so i'm going to ask that we rise and observe a moment of silence and then we'll go into the pledge of allegiance thank you here here okay thank you patty um so the first item of business is the approval of the agenda i'll understand a motion pretty question second a discussion i have an item that needs to be moved the uh june 7th meetings are incomplete so i'm just asked that we could prove it to the regular agenda it'll take me 30 seconds to explain what needs to be added but it has to be moved it cannot stay the way it is it'll ask for a motion [Music] i'm sorry that's fine and i'm just going to say everybody i have two ears that are infected right now it feels like i'm under water so please speak up tonight for my benefit thank you in a second if you leave it the way it is it's illegal second okay it does mr riley if we are to approve this agenda it would be an illegal act so what shall i do here i don't believe i have to entertain a motion for i'm sorry forget to uh you know for this um for these minutes in this situation i could deal with it when we get to let's say the sport reveal the aerial complete and they need something that's required by the law that's not in there i'm sorry i'm not following the training call okay the training thought is simple there's a required document that needs to be in these minutes and it has not been included by our clerk okay i'll second that it's it's okay i just want to understand why i'm doing this for the council's own good seriously i don't care personally it's my paper that has to go in there so all right got a second by dave gaddis um so the reason for the move is that there's a it's missing the form date being that's required by law i don't know why it's not in here it's the second time it's happening so it needs to be it says it needs to be in the minutes and the minutes that we have do not have it in it so okay so as long as we have the stipulation that it's going to be in the final ones i'm okay with that but that's required by all i'm going to ask if the clerk will stipulate to that we could leave everything alone very well if she's stipulating to it it will be included so that's the 48b that's the recusal statement from last council session okay approval legit any further discussion citizen comments back to council all in favor aye no opposed zero agendas approved next move to item two citizen comments each speaker has three minutes to come up to the podium here please address the council um you have uh three minutes to speak to us on any non-agenda item if you wish to speak on an agenda item later on you will get to that point and i will ask again for citizen comments on that item so if you go out of water i'll just ask you to sit down until you until that item comes back up um there's a code of conduct on the desk you observe that code of conduct so if you come up and speak with us please do the same would anyone like to address the council john hansen john hanson 22nd street lillard beach mr mayor council members at last month's council meeting council debated at length and ultimately passed a resolution distancing itself from a certain lawsuit brought forth by a member of the council and the citizen of the city during the discussion a council member questioned why the city had not requested or an injunction in the interim until this thing was resolved or came to court for a resolution so that the citizens could enjoy the privilege the benefit of beach access on belair shore he got no response during citizen questions and comments i approached the podium asked the same question did not get a response either i understand for as many years as i've been coming to these meetings i may not necessarily or a citizen necessarily get a response at the same the question is posed but now it's been over a month i've heard nothing so i asked the question again why i asked the city about an injunction against the city of bel air shore so that we can use the beach and even just the beach area in the parking on a areas subject i just want to pay a compliment to uh the city manager and public works staff for keeping the beaches clean with all this vessel red tide and fish and everything else my wife and i enjoyed the beach on the fourth of july on our beach and it was very nice to go out there and see the plane beach y'all do an outstanding job so mr lynn if you would share that please do thank you thank you mr hansig mr riley i have the uh authority to refer this matter and i'm going to refer this matter to you i'm not going to comment on it we have litigants in the room and potential personnel might be bringing into this also in this room from valor shore i'm not going to comment on it you can feel free to comment if you'd like now you don't have to comment at all but i do have the right to refer it to you so i did see that this had come up and again i'm not going to say why i'm not doing that okay well i i will make one or two comments one comment i make is the city was not named his according to the lawsuit and because the city wasn't named as according to law the lawsuit the city has not participated in any way shape or form in the lawsuit and neither of the parties have motioned the court to have the court uh brought bring the city in as a indispensable party and although i personally know of the lawsuit's existence i have not monitored it i you know hear have heard things about it and i'm not going to comment on the merits of the case at all because it involves several people one of which is a member of the city council and they i've said what at the meeting last month i said that the individuals that serve on the city council have their certainly are here in representative capacity as an elected official but they also have the right as an individual to pursue a lawsuit or to vindicate their rights if they some choose and they've so they they've chosen and you know at this point i want to abide by the city code provisions about the discussing prospective litigation um and that's that's really all i would like to say about it okay thank you any other citizens like to address the council i'm seeing no other hands i will close citizen comments and move to the presentation of the pinellas sheriff sheriff are you prepared to make this presentation tonight yes sir okay please come up good evening for the month of may the bellerin excuse me just for the record sheriff i'm sorry thank you for the month of may there were zero for the ucr property in person crimes there were two people arrested in the entire city there was a total of 734 events of the top three house checks director patrols and traffic stops and there was only one crash in the entire city that was along the uh bellar beach causeway and there was also 142 citations and warnings issued for the entire city sure if we had a month of zero crime and can't get any better than that so again my thanks to the men and women of the sheriff's office um i had one observation i want to give you i went to the beach recently in bellar beach and a large group of individuals open containers of alcohol glass bottles doing it for hours on end no enforcement whatsoever and the sheriff came and i saw him go we were quite ways away there was some go up by bellar short and i don't know what he was doing to tell you the truth um but he went and he left but he didn't come to the right side and start working his way down um that they were well behaved i would say but glass bottles corona you know i mean i like it too but i don't drink it on the beach so i'll just point it out to you in terms of if you're out there you know it's happening uh it was going all day long and um they weren't bella beach people i think they were condo renters or something but that's what's happening out there so if we could just maybe keep an eye on things absolutely i'll pass that information anyone else on the council citizens any comments for the sheriff thank you sheriff great month excellent item four is the board reports we have board of adjustment board records park and recreation and planning and selling we'll start with board of adjustment hi kelly mike kelly 2740 hibiscus drive board chairman reporter adjustment the past quarter the board had a really active quarter um two of our regular members resigned in april and thanks to the council you put that part being the name put back jane coleman in june and we added an alternate gerald was a white wizard who attended our one and only areas that we did have last month in june it was a full board plus an alternate new residents in the city needed something similar to what you did dave and what fred had with backyards that affected waterfront and wedgelocks in the back um the board granted the variants it was a good discussion and the board members are getting more and more familiar and more experienced so i thank you all for filling our board i'm glad we have an alternate and we still have one opening for another second alternate which um i know one of the regular members has their house for sale down the street from mr mayor i don't know if he sold him yet he was in attendance at our meeting in june but should he sell his home and leave delaware beach we have an alternate on board so busy busy quarter and i thank you all for filling our vacancies mike thank you um i have a question for you i know you gave a course not too long ago with some of your newer members now it looks like you've got a lot of new members here and yes you're correct i don't believe the house is sold yet at least as of the other day when i drove by but um uh are you giving me any thought maybe you could give another uh class another uh because when you look at the two that you appointed as our regular members one was mark beam who served with you on council he served with me on the board of adjustment before he was on council so he he stepped right in to be able to play book and he was ready to roll jane goldman who's been involved in the city for years and years and years hit the ground running and she too had no problem with mr hollis of all the people that ironically didn't attend the training session is the gentleman who has his home for sale so he did well at the meeting thank you again thank you mr mayor thank you council park sport hi everyone um i'm tam lavenda i'm the chairperson of the park and red board i actually have my whole board here with me this evening so um which is very nice we have three people right now um the old testament is here six fighters secretary and narcotic whom we all met at the last meeting and voted on she's our new vice chair and george ortel he's been on the last however many parks in red sport he's our historian so we do have one board opening and we have two alternates open which are always posted and we're always looking for help because we too we um like i mentioned during the last i think i started last september we have just been slowly acclimating new um activities into our calendar so if you look online we still have the yoga and the paddleboard we just um the blood drives and then we just started with the beach cleanups so august 7th they're always on the first saturday of the month you meet at 19th street they're growing month by month so if you welcome volunteers to come we met members of our community last month which is very nice to see them come out and help out so we just kind of meet at 19th street and we go both directions and just kind of clean up so that's good um in the springtime i mentioned some of you were here some of you are we were talking about doing a couple of events well then you have to stick right that microphone yeah there you go oh sorry yeah you move back that's right yeah that's perfect okay sorry so um we talked about doing three different events in the spring was fun and we were looking at jazz in the park and because of coven and we really didn't want to have to wear a mask outside we kind of moved everything to the fall so there was a little bit of confusion i'm not sure i'm just going to give you a little bit of detail because everybody was pretty pointed on like you know their suggestions or their concerns about how this would be done so i just wanted to give a couple of um points and then i'll answer any questions and then i'm not sure if like there needs to be a vote speaking with lynn reeves i guess before like historically like things like this if they were small community events they didn't need to be voted on but i would love all of your like um support and approval on this so just a few things that we talked about and we pretty much discussed it at every single meeting just to make sure that we have we want to be buttoned up and we want to make sure that everything is addressed but some of the biggest concerns that were presented to me either during the meeting or after the meeting was the fact that we want this to be a bellar beach private party residence only it is not open to the public it will not be advertised as such so like um the residents will be invited individually like by a little postcard mailer and there will be no signage no newspapers no magazines nothing like that we will have a detailed parking plan we will have an officer on site and every single detail of the three events that we're looking at for september one in october which was the pet and kid parade and then a little christmas like holiday social all of those are very in detail coordinated with all of city staff meaning kyle and lynn and patty so there's really nothing that we do or talk about like we kind of do the research give the suggestions and then everything that's carried out as far as like i don't even buy the donuts for the beach cleanup like kyle orders those and pays for them and then i pick them up so like they're managing with us every detail so just to make sure that we're all like on the same page and there's no surprises and no one is being um you know like at the last minute going oh my god how is this managed what are we going to do with this so that being said i i don't know if you have questions about it the the jazz in the park we're looking at saturday september 25th from 5 to 8. we will not have we're maybe looking at one like italian nice vendor but for the most part we're leaving all the parking places open for residents you know we're encouraging people to walk if you provide your bike if you can carpool or whatnot because we don't want like the causeway jammed up we just want like a nice even flow and we'll just have room for everybody in back low key simple um we'll be selling like you know the the bella beach t-shirts and tank tops beach towels um one of you we're kind of looking for a license plate that we used to have in the past so we're still working on those things as we speak so we'll have some nice things that residents can buy if they want no pressure um obviously um but otherwise it's just like a nice event to get to meet people and listen to some music and and be in a good pleasant atmosphere so i i don't know a lot of people on the north end i would love to meet some more because i know our neighbors are great and i would just love to meet more people and that's all that the board is hoping to find or you know to do with this event and all the events actually so but if you have any questions or if you guys want to is it something that you would vote for i mean as far as okay perfect may i have asked a few questions you mentioned that you have details and basically a plan put together can you provide that to city council because that's one of the things i have consistently asked for is some type of a plan now during it if you're not going to tie up you know our streets for parking we wouldn't need a parking plan but as far as your budget dollar amount you're going to spend your safety plan your you know plan to use the city personnel and what aspects that kind of thing if you can put together a plan for us i would really like that because that's one thing i have pushed for for a long time i also wanted to say i have received a lot of good feedback about the beach cleanup and the blood drive and so you can definitely put me on your list for the beach cleanup i will be happy to help and assist with that but nothing but great comments from the community and i've talked to quite a few of them and they are so appreciative of that part as well as the blood drive maybe not so much about the exercise because there's a lot of us that don't do that but anyway um just great feedback from the dangerous so that i am very appreciative and i wanted to make sure i told you that so if you could just give us that's the only thing else i'm looking for so it's a plan for each um event that you intend to hold okay and we actually do already have that in place so like um it's on a spreadsheet that kyle and probably lynn has as far as broken down by what we need what it will cost what not the way we've been discussing it or maybe even helping out with this is like our our budget has already been approved and then so on the spreadsheet is like basically how some of it will be broken down and then what has been everything um but we do have that as a spreadsheet i could get it all you know email it to you tomorrow um and because we're not having vendors or anything like that like we have the parking like layout as from past events but there's no street parking so i know that was a big concern and there's no vendors there's not going to be a whole lot going on to take up space so it'll just be for parking for residents and i'm going to encourage everybody to get their parking stickers because you know it's it's another way for like speaking tonight sorry he knows your president because you have your sticker on your car so without having to id people before we get too far along with this let me be the voice of someone have some internal controls i don't know what mr reeves told you but i know what we've done in the past and in the past we had this council approved the events now maybe i'm missing something i may okay and i don't remember every single item that comes by us but i think the last thing that we did was clear the slate of prior events i don't know that we ever as a council approved the new events and then approved operating budgets dates all of that kind of stuff so i think that is something we have to do with our council although the money is in the budget it doesn't mean that there's no city events unless this council approves if that's not in the purview of the city manager we've been down that road already with um uh citywide garage sales and he's been called out twice on it it has to come by council for the council here to approve it and i think we're going to approve every one of these but it does need to come up to council just for your protection and arrows in the cities um and you know making sure we have insurance and everything else that's officially sanctioned here i don't remember us doing that and if i did then somebody refreshed my age in memory here but did we ever approve the events for this year no no but it's july and the events aren't until like the end of september so like that's why i'm just kind of giving you some more detail that i really um we touched upon it last time but when everybody came to me with questions and concerns i wanted to make sure that i had the answers to those which we definitely have and it's all written down and then if you can um maybe because i'm not sure can we vote on these tonight that's i was going to ask you here so here's the game plan okay if you can you certainly can send everything out to council in advance if you have everything i think that would help because this way we have the information we already know the events i think you're talking about jasmine park in september there's a trick-or-treat thing with books and stuff okay and then there's one other event there's a holiday social like a christmas tree lighting right before one of the council meetings like the first monday december so if you could just put together something on that or give it to deliveries he will put it on the august agenda and then we will pass this in august and then you have full council support and blessing um of course at least if it doesn't pass then you don't have to do anything on it but it's going to pass i would be pretty sure my only concern is just that we track the budget on this last time we made sure we track what each event does my only question for you with regards with parking in the jazz in the park you said you're not going to have street parking what happens when this spot fills up where did people go well i it was yeah so we have 70 and you know if it was me and i came late and there was no parking i would if i really wanted to go i'd either come back and walk take myself on the walk or everything i mean there's and we're going to encourage that we don't want that but we think we have enough parking if we fill this parking lot i would be very happy you know the people that are walking and riding their bikes if we had that many residents in attendance i i would be thrilled um so political council yes um it sounds to me like parks and rec is uh very organized uh congratulations this is very refreshing i like hearing this it sounds like you're you're planning things out very well just get the formalities cleaned up so that we can vote on it i think if we had this two weeks ago we probably would be voting on it tonight right okay now i understand thank you um are there any other questions in regards to let me run that i hang on sure i'll answer the questions and then they'll get anybody else on council have questions i'm just concerned on what councilman spoke said about parking in the streets or opening the streets up to pardon me if you have 70 spots i mean can always park at 6th street 12th street however if it's a real big success and i'm not big on government spending money on entertaining the citizens but have we ever looked at like having psta uh giving us a short bus and just hitting a couple of streets you know what i'm saying i'm not sure i don't think it would be that costly but i don't want to see the streets before and that was one of the biggest and loudest concerns that people had were street parking and if there needs to be emergency access vehicles and all of that so we weren't doing that which is also why we're not doing vendors because they would take up half of the lot if they had their everything set up so but like the other concerns like just like the garbage and the recycle and like my board is small there's only four of us right now hopefully we get to our seven but um with a few volunteers which i know will have we pretty much don't have to ask the city for anything other than like you know what they would normally take out the garbage but we're going to do the setup we're going to man the tables which there are only three we're going to have a hydration station a first aid station and then like i said we'll have like a little table off to the side with our bellar beach wearables or whatnot um and then we'll help you clean them so we're really not asking the city staff because i know they're they have a lot on their plates now so like we're not doing any more than we can manage ourselves if that makes sense i didn't hear anything about restrooms in that group of things are you going to use the inside once you're in the middle so yeah there will be yeah we wouldn't have it and we were gonna support so if we couldn't get in the building it would be a non unknown event example council comments questions citizens any questions thank you very much we'll see you back in august and you can send us anything you have in the meantime and i i would plan on these events going through so just continue if you're working thank you for your rest of the park support for working on this appreciate it planning and zoning anyone no so if anyone couldn't hear that chair jcm failed said there's no report okay now we go to public hearing item number five this is consideration of ordinance 21-03 an ordinance of the city council of the city of valuer beach florida providing for the amendments to section two desk 245 e8 2-247-b section 2-3-5-0-a section 2-3-5-0-b and section 2-3-5-0-c of

to add no i'm not ready for them yet counsel i have one question um page two you changed these numbers last time and i'm not this may be correct or it may not be correct somebody tell me section 4a it says the city manager shall establish an administrative policy setting for the procedures for obtaining pricing for expenditures up to ten thousand dollars but this is the section that deals with expenditures up to five thousand is that the way it's supposed to be or is that a typo i know we were changing these last time now i'll hear you from the city manager because you wrote this actually well it was or no but it was your we changed these last time so it was it wasn't this didn't generate this question last time yeah it's just actually it's just saying i have to establish a policy for five to ten thousand that's all i'm saying well if that's the case then the next page it talks about you establishing policies up to ten thousand dollars so it's something's not it doesn't seem right

that's highly unusual although this past year i'm not sure uh because of the cares act that some of our clients are actually across the threshold realizing that 750 000 of expenditures so we need that

that we addressed last time i was here i just kind of refreshed everybody's memory on those the two items i think there were concern was the illumination and the impact that would have on neighbors the second item of course was cost so let's go over the brightness just to kind of get the impact on that again as you know like i referred to last time the sign comes with automatic uh reduction in blooms based on atmosphere meaning night day cloudy days it also has the ability to override that so if you feel that that isn't sufficient you can override it to whatever lumens you see fit i also remind you that should a neighbor say man this is just too bright you have the ability to put it on what we call a sleep bump this essentially let's say from 10 at night to six in the morning you can totally put it in sleep mode which means there's no uh illumination there's no directory there's no verbiage on it at all and then at six o'clock on a scheduled platform it will come up again so those issues you can't pretend so that would address any of those concerns of the neighbors who feel it might be too bright at any time and diet the other issue of course is um the cost and i think if you look well first of all let's go let's go with what i hand you out has anybody uh referred to mr robinson over at reddington shores has anybody called him referred to his sign we talked about last time or has anybody gone by the side to look at it at night during the day mr getting in half as well very good yeah as well uh so that's essentially what we're looking at um that sign is about the same size as the one that i'm proposing um that sign is a 3.5 by seven foot nine okay so that's the size of that sign and i think the sign that we're proposing is a 3.2 by 6 foot so relatively the same size so if you've bought the gone by there you kind of see the impact uh they run theirs on auto so it's predetermined based on like i mentioned the life of the day night 30 days um if you look at some of the photos that i have sent uh to you passed out those are just some of the items that they've displayed on their sign i've given you a night and a day representation so you can kind of see uh get a plan hurricane seasons november 1st november 30th uh do you have emergency access permits issued here um and then i also gave you one that showed what if you didn't want color you just wanted to go with the red you can do that even if it's a red green blue color display and they've done both you can do that as well no personal property allowed on the beach one hour after sunset until eight so those are just some of the items that can be put on this display i know just listening to parks and rec some of the issues they brought up park openings agendas private parties the jazz at the park all those things would work well on this display so people driving back and forth going to publix going to their home all they have to do is look at the sign and they're exactly what's on the agenda so that's a very good uh illustration of what the sign can do just for the aspect of community also the blood drive very important is there any questions other than uh let's go over the let's go over the uh the money the cost you've got two options so essentially you've got one which is well let me just say the difference between the two what we've done is reduce the base we're going to have a concrete base the block similar to the building we've eliminated that we've done a stucco finish that sort of highlights the concrete if you look at the illustration it's got some lines kind of indicating grout lines but it's all painted and stucco so that was one of the things we changed the other thing we changed which we took off that wave top and i know a lot of you like that so what i did in the proposal i gave you an extra cost to add on inside a four thousand dollar add-on and if you look at the two options i've indicated the cost with or without so you've got those numbers in front of you uh the difference between option one or a and option b is how we address the verbiage at the bottom community center you've got one that's channel letters that are illuminated and you've got one which is a push through letter uh that has kind of a glow around the letters but it's not a channel letter it's just a push through out of the base so it's a very it's multi-faceted it's very nice and it gives good uh visibility either one so those are the only two options you have here just to show difference in cost if you wanted to reduce it a little bit more uh the visibility what you're seeing is the same it's going to say community center it's going to be lit the main difference is you're going to get uh you're going to be eliminating the wave and you're going to be eliminating the block base for a stucco either one of those very viable doesn't really change other than the way it doesn't really change the overall dimension or the look of the sign if you want to go with the way you add on the additional fonts but in either event it's much lower than what we initially uh presented so we cost value this and we became a very good very good option for you all so what i want to do first you're finished with your presentation i want to see if we have any questions on council then i also want to see if there's any questions from the city these will just be questions while he's here then we'll have the debate on the council and we can get our personal opinions and so questions [Music] well i put that one in there only because it's a digital display it's coco and i just wanted to show you what another side would look like we did the one and ready for shorts we did not do the other reddington uh indian shirts we did not do that one but i wanted to show you the difference between just an electronic board it's much bigger without some of the you know decorative features just a plain board and that's essentially what it is now the photographs keep in mind these are photographs of the digital display it's not really representative exactly what you're going to see it's going to be much clearer photos don't really take well with digital displays but that i just showed you another option down the road uh if you wanted to go by there and look at that um you know that's something as well just just another option of visibility okay so what you were trying to point out was just the plane digital display versus having it in the cabin so my question is is having driven by both sides and looked at them i find the indian shore is going to be a little more subdued so is is that can you program some dude define some dude uh well it's just not as loud and bright so i guess maybe it's a choice of colors or very well could be because you have that ability to do that so i can't really answer your question specifically because i don't know what they did but it could be the colors um and it could be the board i don't know what led board they use they could have used a different manufacturer obviously that i'm not aware of and the manufacturer has it's different but we talked about mints which is the brightness and their knits may be a lot lower which means it wouldn't be as bright but it wouldn't last as long either so there's a lot of variables um i don't know exactly what they did but you do have the ability to tone it down i want to make sure everybody's aware of that so yeah so two more questions one is they've got indian shores has this beautiful monument sign it's a it's almost a piece of art the sculpture is a big seizure and my thinking is they put that in front of the community center a long time ago what was the time frame when they decided to install a digital sign because obviously something changed where they said maybe there's a need for you know i don't know because we didn't do that and if you look after you go past you go south where that intersection is going to park there's another very decorative similar display that they have there it's a sculpture type art art piece and i don't know uh the time frame between the two but they obviously separated them because they didn't want to obstruct the art pieces so last question is the options if you were to go back and talk about the original proposal like the swoosh on the top what kind of lettering did it have did you have the routed letters or did it have the channel yeah aesthetically that's more pleasing is that it's a matter of taste i mean some people like the channel letters preferably i would like to do the router only because channel letters have a little depth to them so when you're driving at an angle that depth sometimes you know you don't see this you have to almost go by it but you can see it because the depth would sometimes take away some of that you know visibility where the rounded is about a half inch sticking out from the sign base itself so it's a little bit closer to that side base and it gives it kind of a glow because this router is pushed through with that inch acrylic and what we do is we fire glaze the ends so that it does illuminate like it glows so that's it's a nice look so i think you'd be happy with either my friend any other questions yes i had a question uh only the auto sensing is that completely fixed that functionality or is the overall range of auto adjustable so if you're saying well let's go back the auto adjustability is based on the the light so you know how bright it is it automatically adjusts accordingly and i can't tell you if it's down four minutes or five minutes just depends but you're going to take that and you can i think i'm interested in your question you can't alter that so that it's lower whenever you want it to be lower okay so you can have different ranges one on its own set the variable of the highest and the lowest right and and so that it will it'll take into account yeah that answers that question um i uh i did ride down there take a look at the sign and uh what i noticed is the brightest periods are basically whenever they wanted it to be bright they selected certain photos that were backdrops and it was wide open but then there were other i watched it for about 10 minutes and uh and there were other messages that were very subtle they weren't very bright and uh it was acceptable so i think really it's uh it's all in the in the hands of whoever is controlling it as to what it's going to look like it is and remember like that i told you last meeting um it's once a week on a tuesday you can hook up into hiyoko and they have a period of time you can actually ask questions you can get their text service you can go through an actual kind of schooling process where they teach you how to schedule things and that's you can do that anytime you want so it's not like oh i got to do this next month and then you're on your own you can do this whenever you feel the need okay thank you you're welcome any other council questions um that's correct that particular unit is three foot five by seven foot nine so that gives you a ton of difference it's three foot five to your three foot two a little bit smaller there's a seven foot nine to your six foot a little bit narrower the plan can be adjusted the font is not predetermined so you can adjust the font in other words if you want to say let me see if any of these have it on there i can point out too let's say for instance 6 17 am you want that to be prominent you can do that very large and then 78.4 you can do that smaller so you have the ability to change the font on anything you want you have the ability to add lines based on the size of the font so if you've got a lot of verbage you can change the size to either all on one display what my question pertains to is how much can you put on that side 35 miles an hour that's 51 feet per second people can see this feeling so how much are you actually important well it depends on how much you have on the side i mean obviously more very rich is smaller smaller copy um and how long you have it on you know so you can vary that as well you can have it on three minutes if you want or whatever yeah questions only is not for opinion question yes yeah come on up give them the name and then and i'm and by the way the way i'm going to do this is if you ask a question you're you can come back up for an opinion this is just to get questions right now information i think you would seeking in my correct if there was a spotlight where we were going to illuminate the base of the sign that's the question okay just [Music] and if that was the case i thought if there's nothing there why would we distract detract from the actual sign and uh the or two is does the sign or face be able to see it at an angle coming down or as you're right in front of it you have to look quickly so those are my two questions thank you right all right to answer the first question it's not spotlight what's what's illuminated um i don't think you have probably a copy of the sign what's illuminated at the base is the copy that's illuminated there's no spotlights on the base whatsoever the illumination comes from the lettering so you can read the letter um to answer your second question uh we originally designed it at a triangle like a v shape but cost was cost prohibited so we made it so that it's perpendicular to to the uh cosplay housewife any other citizen questions john hansen 22nd street my question is to the vendors in the council in the event we lose power cleaning power for emergency signs when we don't even have a generator for this building and this room that we're in right now is called about a temporary shelter where staff can't even work so that's a question for you all thank you and thank you mr anzac that question is going to be addressed to us but i want does anybody have any other questions for mr vogel because he's up here no other citizen questions any last round to council questions we had before we debate this okay thank you can i respond to this question you can't waste a comment sure i'm going to look into that because that is a good question i'm going to see what ioka has as far as a backup for that sign if i remember correctly there is something that will keep that sign on during the hurricane um and i will get back to you on that but no we're not gonna right now as he correctly stated we have no generating capacity so right now i think my answer to him would be it will be going dark but if there's another alternative and you know about it yeah i think there it is excellent all right now the point that everyone and you're not going to leave us right you're going to still be here because i have a feeling with the debate there may be more questions that get generated here this is like the highlight item of the night i'm here thank you okay so now i'm gonna open it up to council debate starting with glenn gunn because he had the floor you don't have to sit up there if you don't want to you can okay if you want please feel free i'll save my comments again you can do that any other council comments yeah i just wanted to make a few um obviously the communications committee recommended having this sign having this type of sign and we've had a number of citizens that have been mailed against it a number that have been built boring but i would like to say that i have spoken with the number of people in our community especially over the holiday events and parties etc and a lot of people are in favor of it but sadly they just did not want to take my advice to send an email because they honestly stated that they would put a target on their back so i think we should go with the communications committee's recommendation uh we have beat this can and kicked this can down the road for well since at least october 2020 somewhere in there and i i'm just ready to move forward with it council i have also heard from a lot of people i've also read all the emails and responded and to kind of summarize some of the comments some people are saying we don't need it because if you're going to use it for emergencies we all have cell phones and you know tvs we know there's a hurricane coming so you don't really need it to tell you that the city website has all the informations on meetings and events like the parks and rec board person came here and saying how all these events you want to keep at bellar beach residents only so the last thing you want to do is advertise jazz in the park on this blinking board while all non-residents go by and say hey i want to show up and then now we're kicking them out of our event and then that's going to look bad in the city the survey that they did um prior to the communication board was strongly for email communication to the residents not signage and obviously this i'm just summarizing what residents have said i've also heard that nobody knows what this building is because the sign is down so we have no idea that this is a community center so that's a pro for the sign to give us information on this building some people have said we need to move forward into the next century with technology such as digital sign as opposed to the old summer where somebody had to go out there and put it up my only comment is i'm kind of in the middle i don't know which way that's kind of this debate's for to help me decide which way to go so i want to represent the residents if we do decide not to go with this sign then my suggestion would be for that four thousand since one of the big questions was what the heck is this building for is to use that four thousand dollars and put community center on this building like right in front on that little rounded area because that would solve a whole bunch of those problems [Music] honestly i see both sides so i'm having trouble with this one so nothing against you your sign was beautiful and i appreciate the adjustments she did and if money wasn't an issue we'd probably go for it but yeah guys help me decide so let me hear your opinions mr vogel i'm gonna weigh in and i think i've been pretty consistent with this first off i thank you whether you get this or not you did a tremendous amount of work it's a beautiful sign okay in terms of it's it's engineering and it's look um it's just not something that's for me and i just don't think it's for this community uh we pride ourselves when it's convenient sometimes to be this traditional 1950s you know aussie and harriet kind of community we don't have businesses we're you know all residential and then we're going to go and put a very modern sign and i got an email this morning i think all the council members got the same one which showed a whole bunch of cities bigger than us that communicate i think as well if not way better than us they don't have these kind of signs some have no signed goal and i agree with robin aki and monreap's had a proposal for this a monument sign similar to what we have when you enter the city that says welcome to baylor beach you could say baylor beach community center i i really wonder if you don't know what this building is like maybe you're new to bellar beach but i mean this is the community center i would hope that people have figured that out but we certainly could put letters on the side of the building if that's the case um i don't think it i just don't like the the digital aspect of this i don't think mr hansick's excellent point there is the lights go out well first off when the lights go out there shouldn't be people here um so we're you know playing to the people who stayed that didn't follow instructions but beside that i mean i i think they're you know the lights could be out for a long time too if you look at some you know panama city when it got devastated those lights didn't come back and you know yeah you could put a honda generator outside but you better chain it down because it may not be there when you come back you know it might go with the next guy going over the bridge um it's a nice sign but it's i just don't think it's for our community i do i do value the aesthetics of this community and i'm also worried on a slippery slope kind of argument that we put up a sign outside this community center and then the condo association wants one because it will help them advertise their rentals and then the motel wants one and then some resident living on callaway says i want one too because the governor just signed a thing that says you can have home-based businesses so why not have a little advertising business we're going to cheap in a city we i remember dave gattis i remember his quote will when we were talking about just little campaign type signs that we were saying that um you know they would have to stay up longer than just election season people have a right to put them in their front yard and he said well there goes the community and you know there's something to that i mean there's a law that says we have to let you do it but you know i gotta say the community looks a lot prettier without those signs so i just don't think it fits in i think it sets a slippery slope for everyone and um i'm not gonna be for it but i do thank you for all the work that you put in there so whether you want the electronics on i understand i understand your viewpoint i appreciate it for the mentality of what you have here i understand that perfectly again i'm not trying to sell your electronics um so that being said the generator thing i would almost tell you right now it can it will work internally in general because i think one of the things my michael robinson liked about it was that when there was a hurricane the sign was on and it showed people kind of the way to go you guys that's totally your call the other aspect of it and i'm just gonna throw this out here um get it hurt or there but if the condo association wants to let me put it a different way you can generate revenue on that sign by other people wanting to put information on that sign and i understand it wouldn't necessarily be better maybe it would be i don't know but you could charge revenue for them to put messages on that so that's a way to get revenue to offset the cost of something so it happens all the time so that's something to keep in mind as well uh but aesthetically again i'm here to answer your questions to present what i was asked to present if you want me to come back and give you a quote for a set of letters on the building glad to do that we put custom assignment infections because it's 45 years so we can do anything you ask us to and obviously you know our costs are reasonable so you know i'm here to abide in to do whatever you guys want me to do but i do think this is a beautiful sign and if you know i think there's a lot of value in it quite frankly okay thank you um did you want to go get hannah first you're passing okay i'll go ahead and speak then and frank i have you next i'm not sure the comments about being stuck in the 1950s mentality is representative of this entire community if i drive around and look at some of the signs where some of the other community centers billiard belongs to there they look like signs from my 1970s high school this this whole digital sign thing was recommended by the communications and hot committee comprised of residents and speaking for the residents it aligns with our vision and our strategic plan and our vision for what a premier city looks like it's been budgeted beforehand this wasn't a surprise thing we were planning on replacing the sign long ago and started building the reserves for long ago and we also had the opportunity to leverage money from the insurance companies that will pass if we don't make a decision in a timely manner the useful life of this sign i would anticipate it's going to be in a 10 15 20 year time frame so i mean this is a statement we are making about what miller beach is all about it's the first thing you see when you drive into belarus beach it's the last thing you see is you exit better beach and i think the original proposal and the alternatives are very tasteful artistic things and is in keeping with technology i would be willing to bet that everybody in this room has probably purchased a car in the last five to ten years and we buy cars to match our ideas of aesthetics and what we want to represent ourselves with we also go over the top to purchase technology and have the things that make make driving the car easiest and keeping us in touch with what's going on around us so i think you need to put some of that stuff into perspective i mean you buy a car you should probably spend more on your car than you're you're paying for the sign your car is going to last five to ten years the average car in the road today is 11 to 12 years old this sign is going to last 15 to 20 years and has a lot to say about miller beach i think it makes a statement that we are a premier city again if you go around and you look at some of the other city halls you're looking at signs with slip-in letters that look like high school billboard shawnee we've got a game saturday night at 10. now we're a little bit more than that it's a means of leveraging technology the city staff can provide a flexible reprogramming design and change messages very quickly from wherever they may be sheltering i would anticipate them with led lights they probably run out i don't believe we should sub optimize on this thing as we keep nickel and dime in this thing we keep sub-optimizing and we're going to get to a point where we've got a sign where we stick it in front of baron beach and the naysayers are going to point at it and say see we told you it doesn't look good it doesn't fit what we're trying to say about better beach so what i'm saying is don't sub-optimize what this thing we've come a long ways from the initial proposal we've chiseled it down the sign we've got if you were to take option b and the proposal to go with the illuminated rod of letters and the electronic cabinetry put the swoosh back on it which provides some nice accent lighting to this thing we're still way under the initial proposal and i think we've got the money for it and we want you to report and i think we need to make an important statement about our premier city that's all i've got to say today frank banker i think you were next yeah um i'm really against my unnecessary respect when i see a sign like this i haven't had a sign here for about a year we've gone through two schools a cat one early account july 4th i was over helping sandbagging first of all that kyle thumbs up creating that new sandbag container great thing we're doing sitting back in 35 minutes but that but going forward all the residents most of them have these things okay just at the top of the bottom you can get all the information they want right off our city hall website i just don't see the necessity of this sign do we have the money for it sure even but do we waste our money do we waste your money on unnecessary things i don't think it's appropriate the other thing is not to fly on here yeah mr mayor but i could buy a weatherproof 40 inch by 18 inch digital sign my motherboard it's just unnecessary spending i too have gotten a lot of emails i too have talked to a lot of citizens on the streets i'm getting a four to one ratio against it um i'm not floored at all mr vanguard a council of event card let me just show something i've showed this before i think i know i get a copy to the city everybody can see this this is a portable sign portable digital sign 4 500 and it is 38 by 25 you can put these all over the city temporarily put them up and take them down but to your point jumping on my point back to my point i can buy one of these too and i can stick this on poll and i can rent advertising that's what you want in your premier city then open this door open this pandora's box because it's going to be a hard time for any planning board or any zoning board to say you can't have it but the city hall can you go tell the people who live on causeway that they can't have it sure they can they can have it for four thousand five hundred dollars and yeah they can make a lot of advertising money because that's a really nice heavily traveled road this was the first one that i got now of course this sign isn't even close in terms of the looks to your sign but it gets the job done and if we're concerned about an emergency or quick information that's fine also to council member banker's point that committee that i keep hearing about first off their advisory committee were the people elected by the people those people were appointed by us they weren't elected by the people i've heard both sides of the story some citizens were very nice in the way they wrote others were not but i'm not convinced that this is something we need is a waste of money we have other things we could better spend our money on and i just don't see it and i don't think this national sign makes you a premier community and your premier community when other people start calling you a premier community think about that other council i'll open up to the citizens um mr vogel i'm just gonna have you if you you can stay up there but just step just a little bit aside like the sheriff did before and then uh absolutely yeah you can do this give me another round of debate here so to your point about these little signs you can put up you're going to put up the front lawn uh first of all you have to go out and remotely just like you have to slide in a leather you have to go out there and type it in the corner the first one that comes down comes down the pipe it's going to be on the ground number two it won't last i guarantee you that these things are not built to last they're not commercial uh the leds are not quality um you can have some boards go out before others so what you're looking at for five thousand dollars is exactly what you're gonna get for five thousand dollars and you're gonna have those all over the community talk about an eyesore that would be an eyesore plus when you start having them blowing down the road that's gonna be a problem so to your point i understand what you're saying it's a cheap way to do it but it's inefficient and i think it's gonna jump up to community and have all these things that people want to grab plus how do you know if zoning would allow to have individuals to put up these led boards and how are you going to run them you know i'm going to stick an electronic cord out there i don't know so to your point i understand what you're saying it's costly but you look at the big picture you've got little displays that people want to put up but they're gonna they're gonna fail they're gonna fall down they're gonna they're gonna and to your point about people using their phones you're absolutely right we're in an agent technology people can go on google and hook up whatever they want but they have to have the mindset to get on google to get on the website go through what they want get what they want and remember it out here you have people going to publix all the time you have people going to to eat out to come back all they have to do is look at that sign they don't have to think about getting on their phone there it is and uh robin to your point you can only put on what you want to put on if people don't want the jazz festival on there don't forget put on what is comfortable in what that is good for the community so you have all these options do whatever you want illumination whatever you want it's going to have a standby battery so it's not going to go out um there's just so many pluses to this thing it's really aesthetically it's beautiful and i think once people see it it would probably get worse i'm now going to open this to city council to city citizens comments um mr bola i'm just going to have you step right right yeah right about there and then you come up here if you spoke before and asked a question that doesn't count so certainly you have three minutes of time here june benson in april 23 of 2019 you did a constant contact you did a constant contact survey which i have a copy of if anybody wants to see it and communications was only at 20.8 percent of concern for the citizens this is the copy that was given to me by the city manager okay we have this other forms this is dated february 18 2020 the community center is only used 25.6 of the time 25.6 and we're spending money to advertise it as a community center when it's only being used 25.6 of the time i remember our citizen steve marsh saying that after a storm that the power went out for some of the residents down on donada okay and they he wanted to bring him down here and let them sit in the air for a little while and they were denied community center i don't think so but the other thing is we do not have a generator i personally came here one time to bring up some forms and the power was out and the employees had to leave early even though the storm was gone we could not operate as a city because we didn't have a generator so how can we which is supposed to be our number one thing is the safety of our citizens in this community not have a generator and worry about a sign before generating lastly i remember members on this council saying we had to fix the flooding on our streets that's why we could not take a matching park grant that was being given to the city that was awarded because we had to fix the flooding first but we're worrying about a sign i just don't agree thank you thank you um after the citizen comments sure other citizens i see no other hand citizen comments are closed back to you glenn gunn with respect to the matching part frames i mean that keeps surfacing especially when it comes up with budget discussions and the missing point or the point that's completely left out of the context of that thing was we were willing to match a 200 000 grant with no follow-on money and we were handcuffed to those changes for the next 25 years we did we had no clue on the demographics of who were going to use those changes to the park we had no clue of what the recurring costs were going to be for that 200 000 expenditure to change the parks and once again it's just because somebody was going to match funds while we were getting free money 200 000 so we were going to take 200 000 out of our budget not being able to ask questions about what does that cost us the current outcomes to support and maintain those facilities if we change our minds because certain things aren't being used by these changes in the park we're hand comfortable we can't just eliminate those things so at the time i think that was very sound responsible stewardship of the the budget process getting on your phone just like he talked about that's the distinguishing difference between push-pull communications push communications you drive by a sign it's in your face hey do you items of being forced to eventually know your fans unless you either win the program and go on your phone within a reverse 911 how many text messages did you get from pinellas county with the upcoming story i got okay that's my point the other point is and i did a lot of signage in my career signs are great for about a week or two and then they fall into the landscape for the typical citizens that just drive by them they ignore them and see what's wrong with them so decided he proposes and he did put a lot of work into it but that's what sales are okay sometimes you make the sale sometimes you know okay what i'm trying to say is i think it's going to look great for a week or two and then most of the citizens are going to say i'll just drive right by more people are interested in getting first to go over the causeway when that two lanes narrow down and yet when they're coming in they're more interested in whether they're going to go left and getting in which lane to go left or right um we have a great county that informs us all of emergencies i got notice today for a thunderstorm okay phone call and text message we don't need a sign as you say which way do i go well any idiot that lives in this city that goes west during a storm they got bigger problems they had a sign all right you go that way all right two last things one is it was interesting you brought up the no discipline option so i mean you put the cabinet up there if there's no message to decide hey the screen's blank and it's black and you have the flexibility of using it at a later time in the event of an emergency or you need to get some time and information out so i mean that is a flexible point there i think we're at the point where we could uh argue this thing and i would like to just make a proposal an emotion i know person speaking out here who wants to speak down here go ahead robin no i mean i get what everybody's saying but if we're going to again pardon me some of this talk seems um hypocritical because you're like talking we're talking about low sign kitchen information it's in your face about things going on but then we don't want people to know about things going on in the city because we don't want other people coming to our city we're not welcoming of other people in our city if you're talking about putting thirty thousand dollars toward a sign for emergency uses only that we're gonna use once hopefully never maybe once or twice a year about a storm i mean do we need thirty thousand dollar sign to warn people there's a hurricane coming in they should get out i mean if we were gonna be advertising events and all this stuff that we do because we're so active and we're so inviting and we want people we want people to know about what's going on in our city then yeah the first one up here like yeah let's do it we need it we gotta get it out but you're talking about a premier city you want this respectful sophisticated city but then you're talking about color size in your face so again it's getting in here you got your one moment you're over here the next moment you're over here just the arguments are just confusing so if we're only going to use this mostly we're thinking emergencies then i think an idea of a temporary sign you put up saying hey warning your flood zone a everybody get out that would be more effective than this beautiful sign and i think something more like a monument sign or just community center written all the things that suffice so again i'm still on the fence so um i'm glad i'm gonna come back to you and then i'm gonna say something because you've had about three times here uh you have the last word because this is your emotion so um you know i look at some of the surrounding towns and i certainly consider them as quality as us lr bluffs they don't have a digital sign bellaire i don't think they have a sign at all um you don't get better shore they don't have a sign they don't even have a city hall so um you know a sign doesn't make your city again nice sign you know maybe in the right city this might be perfect you know maybe indian rocks look like they had an old-fashioned school kind of sign lake clinton and that might fit in well over there for their type of environment i think it does but um i just don't again i think it comes in here so go back to columbia yeah two couple two couple things i stood in front of the signs at berlington shores i stood in front of the starting at indian shores and it wasn't just about emergency evacuations or whatever there were some public information messages on there features don't leave your stuff on the beach if you leave it on the beach it's going to be confiscated hey it's that time of year and you should get your emergency access tags for your car if you if you haven't done that already so there's a lot of public information going on it's not just hey head east if there's an evacuation instead of the west okay so there are a lot of public information messages there and we are this is a arterial roadway here so it's not only our residents looking at it and being engaged with our our neighboring municipalities there are people coming down through uh clear water bees are people coming up from indian rock species to access the causeway to and from work so the world's getting out everywhere so i mean it's it's not just the resident thing i mean i'm taking any kind of a broader scope we're providing a public service to our enabling communities as well so i don't know if there's any more comments can i make a comment um i'm on council i'm gonna go back to you okay no i mean i hear what you're saying and i agree but just you know this has nothing to do with my own personal opinion but i'm just going on base with all the majority of the residents have been saying in their fields and then just ever since i've been on council the feeling and the comments from residents about our communicating we're not welcoming we don't want to share the love i mean so and what are you going to say you know don't leave your stuff on your breach if you're rolling in the car i mean i mean what are we going to say you know we're not saying hey come to our beaches we should say beaches are for residents only all else stay away i mean that's not going to make us look premier that's going to make us look maybe maybe that's how we want to look i don't know that's not how i personally want to look but look a lot of people are thinking it i'm just that person when you think i'll just say it because i have nothing to lose i'm just going to tell you like it is this this is the feeling i'm getting we don't want other people here we only want residents you can't bring your umbrella to the beach we don't want i mean i don't think a sign is going to be public announcements because i don't think we have anything to say do i want to be more technological yes if this when this first came up i was all for i was like yeah this is great it looked good blah blah blah but then all these citizens are coming to me and emailing me and i'm like that's obviously not the feel that the citizens want and i'm up here to represent the citizens not my own personal even if it conflicts with the majority of the citizens so that's all i'm saying i'm not trying to pick on anybody i'm just saying like it is of how the what the citizens have told me and i mean this even citizens that are my patients have talked to me on this in a professional capacity instead of talking about themselves they bring up the signs so i'm just saying right well if you live between 1st and 18th street you can't take anything to the beach anymore so there's no need to put anything on the side are we going to put on the sign if we do pass it no each umbrella is allowed between 1st and 18th street are we going to put on the sign potential residents you're not allowed to have each umbrella because i'll tell you one thing that would be a big drawback i believe to any potential buyer i mean we're going to inform the people that's important anyone i was on the communication committee and uh yep i'm aware that there was a survey that was sent out the sign was not the number one form of communication i'll admit that but i will say that there were there was a number of people that said yes that's what i want i drove past that the old sign and that's where i got what was going on in city hall i saw it every time i would drive by that sign i would look at it and see okay am i missing anything what's going on tonight because that was that was a good place i didn't have to pick up my phone while i was driving down the street to try to figure out what was happening at city hall i know that there's many people that they are on their phone all the time driving around we know that's not safe they do it anyway i can think of some people in this room that i've seen doing but you know not going to point anyone out i'm just saying that just because it's not the number one form of communication requested by the citizens the residents of bel air beach does not mean it's not going to be used it's just another form and whenever i was on that committee we were trying to creatively come up with as many ways possible of communicating with our residents if there's one form of communication that's leaving a few people out because maybe they don't use their phone maybe they're not computer savvy maybe they they just don't understand the technology well why should we leave them out and that's all i've got to say so here's what i'm going to do mr vogel i'm going to have you make your last comment i'm gonna open it up if anybody else wants to make a last comment that the last final comment was the person who brought the motion under our rules okay so one more round okay for you thank you first of all just to be clear i'm not here to sell you this sign that is totally your decision i'm here as a request to provide you with a design capable of communicating with led and it did that i think in a very conscientious beautiful sign at a good price that's all i'm going to say about that i'm not here to promote this sign necessarily secondly you're all talking about well you know what can't we we don't want to do it all in emergency we need that we need that well think about the community think about discussions of what you do want to promote to this community what do you want to reach out and have a positive influence on the community through what you've grown assigned i mean there's a lot of positive things you can probably all think about but you're all talking about but we don't want this we don't want people to know that you know there's a beach here there's what do you want to promote this is your community so you should promote it as best you want to promote this community and you have a great tool to do about it you have to do it all the time no you can you can you can go dark you need to sleep for weeks something comes up put it up there but you have the ability to do it where now you don't so now you have to have somebody think about going on their phone i understand that i do the same thing but you have to be thomas said okay now i gotta think about it now i gotta get on it now i gotta scroll down when you can just you know a couple times go past and the information you want is there you can put phone numbers call city council if you have any questions or call whatever any questions it's available instantaneously so that's first comment secondly i really wish i don't think anybody did this although i offered it many times to call michael robinson at reddington shores he and i have just the same discussion we think we deal with the same problems with the people in the community it's going to be too bright it's resolve that they have a beautiful sign i wish you would have called him to get the questions and answers from him and how he resolved it with his community i think you might feel a little differently perhaps unfortunately you did not but for sure thank you again mr vogel i'm going to start on my left here last round of comments you don't have to make any comment but anyone here unless [Music] i would agree with you know what dave said the old sign we got information from we're not trying to sell anything we're trying to provide information to our residents to our citizens um since that since the old sign went down you feel lost driving by here you know when is the next meeting for this when's the next meeting for that i think it's very valuable for that um and you know during storm season and stuff yes we can put um signs up get your entrance your reentry permit and stuff like that but just to have information for the citizenship city hall is going to be closed on friday for this and such a date and you know where they're closing at noon or something like that i think it's very valuable for information it's a very tasteful sign and i would be all in favor take that money put it towards that generator that benefits a lot more people particularly if we ever get hit with a hurricane this becomes a area where we can have people cool and and stay temporarily at least during the daytime not that it's a shelter but someplace where people can come to and they weren't able to come to here last time glenn gunn last word i'm going to call it yes i'd like to amend item 10. okay to authorize the purchase of a monument sign with electronic message display specifically option b with the wave add-on total cost of 32 500 as specified on the international sign proposal dating june 30 2021. second for that second okay we'll open that up to discussion you first no you want to call the question that'll be your third motion you want to call the question do we need citizen comments do you want to call the question yes or no let's go through the protocol go through the protocol okay so we're in council comments now your amendment okay which i didn't even bother to write the whole thing down but you'll give it to me again um basically you're picking the most expensive option so for all the concerns about the money let's spend the most amount of money okay um if you want to make if we're going to have the amendment we have to vote on that proposal and we have to have discussion so anyone on council have any other comments besides myself before i open it up for citizen comments on the amendment i do yes i don't like the link i don't like that i don't like the way you know like 4 000 i i i you know it kind of seems like i know which way we're leaning and if i we're going to get picky about where we're going i don't like the color blue i don't like that blue i think it looks too garish too in your face and i don't think that it matches the building well and maybe something more viewed of a blue just saying if you're calling details in this amendment let's how many other amendments amendments are so many amendments that we won't be able to follow but yeah i mean i'm not going to tell anyone they can't make an amendment absolutely you can make an amendment to get rid of the blue you can get an amendment to make it a half an inch bigger do whatever you want yeah well i might i don't like the wave i think we could save that four thousand dollars and i don't think we need to wave and we're going to start debating shape and sizes then i'm going to go outside and get my bag of news so i can entertain myself while we're doing this in my car i will go get it ask for recess for five minutes getting total from our insurance did we get a hard number on that yet mr reeves well they they told us if we purchase a sign they will reopen it they paid us the 4 000 already so what they had told me initially was somewhere around 10. well my experience would be a little bit more my experience with insurance companies is they'll pay out what they owe and then they'll socrate in the long run so we're gonna pay back that four thousand ten thousand dollars and the next council against us will inherit our mess first round second round london yeah i think my point is i'm i'm putting something out there let's make a decision on this thing and move forward if that's not what you want but but it's time to fish or cut weight on this thing instead of arguing and adding for nikon so i've made a proposal i've prevented the initial line of 10 and i'm saying option b with the wave and the eliminated routed letters and 3 500 which is significantly less than the initial proposal so we thought the initial proposal was very nice until we found that we saw the price tag well we've seen a huge adjustment on this thing and it's been budgeted for we're going to get leverage off of our insurance money and i'm just saying let's make the decision well i'm not opposed to making a decision but that was a very specific decision let's make a decision and then if it's a yes vote then we can figure out which option well no i i guess what i'm saying is let's not sub-optimize let's let's let's go over the cadillac version of this thing because i think it fits the idea of miller i know but you're going from hey let's buy a new car to let's buy a cadillac 2022 with hang on you know and the spoiler this i'm just saying maybe we should do a little more general like do you want to sign or do we not if it is a yes then we can get into the weeds with the i guess my point is is after all we decided we've been we've been arguing this for how many a year now and i'm just saying you've got information before us i've made a motion i'm ready to move forward [Music] okay any other council comments okay i'm opening it up to city commons now this is only on the amendment the amendment is to uh if i got this right mr gun option b with the wave add on 33 500 correct okay so that's the amendment that just means that we're going to amend what we vote on because right now this thing says 28 000 to 33 950. so he's saying forget about 28 000 to 33 950 he wants option b wave add-on that's what i want to hear comments on if any citizens have any mr hansen come up if you have a question ask us and we'll straighten it out for you maybe john hayes at 22nd street so i can only talk about the motion is amended so my comment is this i've been following this whole scenario forever and in recent meetings the city manager warned we would get four thousand dollars minimum period or we could get up to fourteen thousand if we place a sign so we were playing with this little thing forever and now he just states city got four thousand dollars i will wager to say the chances of getting the other 10 000 if the council votes for a sign might be slim have thought about that instead of dragging anchor other citizen comments coming back to council on the amendment last word glenn on the amendment if you have one if the protocol is ready it is ready so and glenn please correct me if i state this question wrong we're voting on the amendment the amendment does not mean you're voting for the sign it means you're voting for us to consider this amendment so the amendment on before us right now is to not go with a range of thirty three thousand nine fifty but instead to select i'm looking at international sign june thirtieth twenty twenty one uh quote to kyle riefler uh option b as in boy and it is the wave add-on thirty thousand five hundred dollars before any offsets the weight is illuminated by the way i'm sorry wave is illuminating you can you can eliminate the illumination if you don't want it just he gets it all if he wants it so did i say that correctly yes sir madam clerk i wanted this call by individual please okay no reason we've taken enough time on your vote so start it however you'd like this is on the amendment only this is to amend what we're going to vote on and then i'm going to pull the question right after that if this passes or if it doesn't pass either way all right no so the amendment passes four to three i think we're finished with debate on that when you call the amendment at the end okay so now we're going to call the question unless anybody has any last words no okay good so what is before us right now is item 10 as amended it's an authorization to award purchase of monument sun with electronic message display and suspended requirements as amended to include option b item uh item with the way to add on thirty three thousand five hundred dollars that's from the june 30th 2021 quote from international signing yes vote gets that sign madam clerk same deal please call it by person this is where they pass the sign or reject the sign counseling [Music] no so it passes four to three we will be buying the option b thirty five thousand three hundred fifty dollar wave add-on sign yep yep so that's that thank you very much and i'm sure the city manager will be working out in particular thank you very much okay thanks anybody need a break we're at 7 49 getting moving this one along here all right item 11 of

if you will [Music] uh authorization to enter into an agreement with spectrum for undergrounding of the overhead cable wires along the west side of boulevard from harrison avenue 12th street explanation authorization for 51 676.69 to complete the west side of the gulf boulevard beautification underground project motion i'll defer to the city manager yes mayor council this is a part of our underground project this is funding that the penny for pinellas money is providing us to underground the wires this is the area that we have some little pockets and you'll notice the majority of it is at the north end of town on the west side of the road we've got a couple of pockets of spectrum wires and currently uh if you drive down boulevard the only thing that's left going across the road is spectrum wires and that'll help finish this project up we do have money from this this money for this actually is from the p3 money that will expire in september so we need to expand it to move forward with the project i have a question for you when do we do the east side of boulevard that's what wires that i have to look at and everybody else has to look at well i thought you wanted those wires uh we're in the process uh i have spectrum's numbers uh back already for the well actually the spectrum wires from first through 12th street on the east side will be gone the only thing that

duke and they are working on re-programming that money and trying to figure out if we do it like we did with bellevue estates island where we went out and got our own uh boarding company uh so they're

been approved espo gets this done i'll take a voice vote all in favor anyone opposed passes seven to zero it's like a record it's eight o'clock and we're getting into the unfinished business okay do we have any unfinished business i'm not hearing any city attorney any comments city attorney report today i sent the revised sign ordinance to city council members and it's my understanding in the not so distant future of a workshop that will be discussed again there's a you know number of changes i made i tried to do my best to make it uh exceptionally clear what i had changed and made comments and i'll be certainly receptive to hearing the further comments that you have that's the first thing second thing is lynn and i have continued to talk and work on doing the changes to the city code that were recommended by the review committee and the third thing is i wanted to do an educational thing that will take about two minutes so this i had prepared for the last meeting that that meeting went late so um i will tell you it now this is the progression of things that i consider when uh make doing an amendment to the ordinances and the code this is what the progression of things i would recommend that you all consider when you you were looking at an issue again it will only take two minutes first thing is an amendment's the code or an evolutionary process there's typically a change in the law uh that we have to comply with or there's a technology change those are the two things that lead to the evolution um next point is what is the issue you should define it the better defined it is the less nebulous it is and the easier it is to discuss third thing that i always consider is does the city have jurisdiction to address this issue or is jurisdiction with the county state or federal government at times citizens are very interested in making a change in law and there ought to be a law to do something except it's not your law to change so that's that's something we always should consider next point is is there an existing legal standard in the city's code of ordinances if you're amending it there probably is a standard but that that to me is a obvious starting point the next point is really getting down to the deliberative process how important is the proposed amendment and you know you can spend a tremendous amount of time demanding things and you'll have to decide how important a certain issue is and some issues i would submit to you or are things that you probably should consider another day compared to other things that may be a lot more pressing next thing is discuss the issue at a workshop and reach consensus on the proposed amendment that to me is the far better way of of doing it because i think you know with seven of you there's gonna be several different points of view and it's good for you to in a workshop session be able to share your perspective on very on a given topic next thing is once there's a consensus that's the staff which is primarily uh lynn patty and myself would review what other cities have done to address this type of issue so we're we are efficient and we don't reinvent the wheel there's with unicode i can access and so can you anything or almost anything in the state of florida in municipal government and to me that's a common starting point is to look and at least get an idea how other cities have addressed this issue the final point is to consider an ordinance which contingency amendment to the code and that would be that could be after you do a a second workshop where you consider the actual document in a workshop so those are some things i would suggest would be prudent for you all to roughly follow that progression of events when considering the amendment to the city code and i'll stand for any questions council mr riley i had one thing that i brought you in passing the other day and i'm throwing it out there because it's something that the city is going to have to do not necessarily you alone but our governor and our legislature was quite busy this session and i believe we have close to 90 new bills some of which affect our city and affects our code and affects the way we've been doing business um and you know while we're doing other things the tallahassee is doing other things too and we have to make sure that our stuff is up to date i'm gonna give you one of them okay because i'm just gonna and i'm going to bring this so madam clerk i'm gonna tell you now i'm gonna bring this at some point in time okay we never had the right as a city to uh prohibit motorized bicycles on the beach because when they tried to in tallahassee encourage people to ride bicycles they said a bicycle is a bicycle and that includes a motorized bicycle well all the beach mayors that were screaming because people are whizzing by at you know 40 miles an hour on the beach so they passed it or a ability for us to change that and prohibit that and we should take advantage of that before they change their minds again so stuff like that is in there it's for us as a council i mean we certainly can debate it just because i say do it doesn't matter everybody here wants motorized bicycles but most people don't and this would be our opportunity to change it some of the other stuff home-based businesses are now legal um so we need to change our code we need to look at how we're going to be affecting stuff and how we're going to be affecting um the community so i give this to you i know you're aware of it i you spoke about maybe using the league of cities for a summary i think that's a great starting point but um i just want this council to be aware this is our job uh aided by our city attorney to bring this stuff up to date these codes need to be revised now of course all 90 don't necessarily affect us but they some of them do well i'll just add to what you've said there are periodically mandates from tallahassee that the legislature's determined that the cities have to do something and you're stuck with figuring it out and what's worse is you're often stuck with the tasks that really aren't without paying for it so you know how many of those are in the 90 i really don't know off the top of my head but the the two examples that you have given are things that certainly will affect the city of bel air beach and it's it is the sort of thing that you you should take into account because one of the worst spots you can be is if there's a new state law that's applicable to the city and you know don't do anything about it and you're in conflict with state law which is probably not the best place to be a lot of the laws give you an opportunity to phase things in but some of them don't so when you and i talked about it briefly the point i made was the florida league of cities has been active for you know sincere inception in trying to be the liaison and my expectation is that they have uh periodically up give updates of summary a summarized version of things um i what i do not want to do is you know me dive in and read 90 different bills that's a complete waste of time before a better application of time is to start with a summary and then you'll do things methodically with your charter review and your code review that's the way i would suggest you do this although you don't need a committee for it you need a summary to sort with and then decide which ones you're going to tackle does anyone on this council have a problem with mr riley's reaching out to the league of cities i like the idea of trying to see if there's a summary i'm sure there is um they had a legislative update that they did at the end of the term so that's probably a good start but the governor didn't sign everything until sometimes june 30th he waited to the last second so if we could see what's you know what passed i mean i i don't unless we're going to pay him to read 90 bills which i know he doesn't want to do some of these needs to be 100 pages better idea is that the way we want to go about it to start yeah okay so minimal amount of time see what they have and then you get back to us and we'll take it from there um mr reeves i mean i just mentioned a couple of the key ones be careful if you get into that area i mean you know yeah you can't like run a funeral parlor from your house but if a guy's running a accounting business i think that's going to be okay well as they they signed on the very last day 30th of june i think it was 89 bills or something uh the ones that really affect us or the bicycle we can do that and that's probably just some ahead of the current ordinance should be pretty simple uh the whole business there again we've got a pro prohibition against it so we need to just probably enter our organs at some point the big one though is the house bill 53 which in your budget you're going to see that where the state is requiring every municipality to do a 20-year needs analysis of their storm water management system and that's due to the state by july 31st 2022 and then every five years thereafter and i put a copy in your thing and really you only go to you just go to line 191 you don't need to read all the goblet of it which for the city that estimate i i got a revised estimate and it's about 130 000 it's uh to do the study to do the study there goes our star warfare well you know i guess how i look at it we are at some point in time every like today they sent out a little message about that american rescue money uh they've told someone given to us they sent out you know a stack of paper like this to read and so you know all the goodies about it but uh i think we'll be able to because we can use that for stormwater so if we're fortunate we can kind of leverage that maybe with this money by doing a stormwater project with that money and uses stormwater so it doesn't burst in the end so hopefully in the very near future they'll actually give us the money it's going to be given by uh for the department of emergency management and they can't do any hold back and i do know that they gotta give us a portion of it this year and we've got until 2024 to spend so there are reports that we're going to have to make of course things to fill out but that's an example of the bill that's actually going to cost the city a lot of money uh most of the rest of them really uh code enforcement there was a bill signed that if you make a complaint you got to give me your name or we can't investigate it and that's that's already come to kind of fruition uh because uh people don't want to give you their name because it might be their neighbor and they don't want to do that actually we had a call today for i think it was landscaping or something somebody called and as soon as you asked them for their name why don't i give you my name so technically it has to build so technically speaking we if we didn't find it technically speaking we're not supposed to pursue it by how the law reads so there's there's nuances through all those bills so we'll you know i'm sure fred will get to the summary and i've kind of followed what stood the fact that's okay frank we're still on you um so i think giving you you know go ahead and see what you have and if you report back to us and start this project i mean 90 bills it's a lot to wade through but i didn't even know about this one that you just said about this 20-year study i think that when i missed but i mean when you get 90 of them blowing by in one day it's hard to track them all so and there's 100 that didn't get passed so sometimes you follow but they don't go anywhere so okay anything else okay thank you um city manager yes as i mentioned uh i gave you an updated budget based on a few things and i kind of highlighted the things that were changed we'll discuss this next week i put page numbers we have the page numbers in there and all the graphs so it's a little more easier to read we've also given you our financial statements for april may and i gave you uh dep finally closed the co issue out and the sheriff finally closed it out uh that we maintained that or we turned the seals last year i just want to clarify that the statute says you can turn the seals and the email i got from bp they're not going to do anything they're they're not going to tell us to do anything because the guidance it's only guidance from them that says you should trim them to 18 inches if you trim so i spoke to the person that replaced mr trying to remember nelly or maniello he retired but this jason spanier said basically it's guidance because the statue allows you to turn but the guidance is 18 inches so i just wanted to close that out it's gone it's time to move on we've come to 18 inches we come to about 18 centimeters well the statue the statute doesn't dictate that this is just their guidance guidance in the statute says you confirm it doesn't say hello you trim them but when i had the conversation with him and he was well aware of what happened and he said that we're not going to do anything with you because i've been trying to get them to respond since what last october october yeah so that that is uh finished and i told you about house bill 53 the gentleman that does a lot of our engineering and site plan review has a medical situation and he's in the hospital and i'm going to be bringing something to you uh because he may be out of pocket for a month or two so we'll use one of our other contracted engineering firms which is duel and they've agreed to take over his 12th and 13th street design because he was just starting on it for the cost that he proposed so it's not going to cost us any more money but they're going to send me a letter and i'll bring it to the council to transfer i have spoken to larry's wife and the prognosis is good but it's just the situation so um and we have uh duel's going to help us out with the cycling stuff that we need an engineer so that's part of the contract that we did a couple years ago okay next monday is budget work session and then there will be a special meeting following that to set the tentative military and the tentative military i'm going to propose is what the military is right now 2.0394 that just means we can't go higher than that after we set the tentative was it a workshop also we have the workshop prior to it and then we have to set the tenant village so we can turn that into the county it's normal process we're going to recommend 2.0394 which is the current village i will tell you that the second set of numbers that came from the county on july 1st instead of 6.03 our value is 7.6 increase which is about 18 000 more dollars in uh millage over the previous 69. so but we'll discuss that more next week but i just wanted to let you know that and mayor i may try to add if duel gets me that letter to that special meeting um the approval to transfer to them to do 12th to 13th street design okay the letter no no i don't remember i said i was giving you one foot i just want to clarify we have the budget workshop and the setting lieutenant military but then after that we were going to do a work session right well we're not doing a work session no work session so just budget okay and then i think try to schedule next month's work session on the sign orders it's next month then okay i just i thought it was just i thought it was next week so i mean i'll read the sign arguments much later if it's not going to be next week because that may take some time very well so [Music] else that we pushed off to there too and they forgot what it is i'll remember it i got notes oh yeah it was from last class last work session we went to a couple things but the sign was the big one so that's fine i'd like to you know brett's done it two or three times i'd like to get it resolved and move down plus we've got other ordinances to work on and that's all i have okay see clark oh i'm sorry did anybody have any questions i only get one um did uh kyle get a response from the encore about the wiring changes and uh no we haven't we haven't got anything from them yet okay all right anybody else frank two things um that new building how to find when you have a complaint you have to give your name we don't have to give that name out for the person that we're investigating we're uh we're gonna do some research on that because that could be an issue whether we do or don't uh we're going to do a little more research but the bill basically states that if somebody wants to make a complaint they've got to give us their name before we can even uh if they're going to redact it then they didn't do a damn thing without doing it so i think you're going to have to give it out but i'm not your attorney but the point of it was no anonymity right that's what we have now people call it in and then you redact it what i think it'll do one thing i i guess how i look at code enforcement that means city staff needs to be more cognizant of what's out there so that neighbor doesn't have to call in and to me that's more of a benefit well the other thing is um this past week or whatever we have a great maintenance group i mean those guys gave up and gave up their holiday weekend they're out there in the heat filling up sandbags kyle did an excellent job coming up with that new system we're gonna make a couple more of them actually he they were telling me he's not taking the credit he found it on youtube a bunch of kids i think 10 or 12 years old came up with the id but it really saved a lot of time definitely i was out there monday for quite a bit so it saved a lot of time ten bags at a time and i'll say it also as usual excellent responsibility in the crisis okay for the people in the city you know we have our differences and people fight but when it comes to a crisis the city never fails to deliver ever okay excellent job do your new steps anybody else okay uh city clerk no comments from the city clerk city council comments beginning but rita spoke uh yeah um i just want to also comment and compliment the city staff for the job well done one of my concerns was this email that we received regarding you know pictures of different signs my main concern about that is people going by and taking pictures of other people's property back in february on february 19 2019 i received a phone call from um actually this gentleman's wife of a vehicle that was spotted going down her street and backing up and taking pictures of her property and she kind of freaked out thinking that she was being stalked and i just don't want these same property owners to feel that way too because she not only called me but she posted it all over social media as well as i think she put notices on the donor at that time on the city community center but i just really want to caution people from going around taking pictures of other people's problems call the correct people the ones with authority and have them go out and look if you have a concern or a complaint or a question or anything but just don't take it upon yourself because i just remember her phone call with me and reading her uh post she was extremely upset and felt stalked by this person so it was just somebody driving down the street taking pictures so no different than these pictures here at property owner's properties and other than that i don't have anything else to add okay thank you leslie the comments long gun right banker yeah last month i uh brought up the buoy issues and i did submit a resolution and i talked to the city manager and split on home because we're trying to get a meeting set up with dollar shores and resolve both issues um [Music] the umbrella and the uh just the umbrella and the bully issue what quite hopefully get resolved i i know i've been communicating with fwc uh about the abilities um i guess they get tired of me contacting their staff so they sent me to their attorney we try to claim that since i raised this issue all the buoys are illegal and pinellas were on the same key so she then threatened that she's going to remove them all because i informed her so then i said well fine you can do whatever you want but the blood will be on your hands and the first person that gets hit because for over 10 years the statute was changed and over buoys have to be inspected every three years so for over 10 years and at least three inspections the fwcc improved illegal inspections so she kind of changed your attitude i guess it contacted lynn instead of me and hopefully we'd get this whole thing resolved but it's still an unsafe issue and it needs to be correct yeah just so you know that they're going to look at our permit that's what they're going to start with uh and she told me she'd give back to me because our boys may well they probably don't they don't need the guidelines so they are gonna and we'll have to change our own ordinance from what i understand so they are going to send someone out to evaluate our foods so until that's done uh i want to make sure ours are right as opposed to trying to put more buoys in that may not be right but we will still talk to bella shore thank you frank anything else i'm good thanks yes just before the storm came um a gentleman's boat only dilapidated lift collapsed and fell into the water nearby my house um as timing would have it the storm was approaching and the boat was not secured in the water the lines that were attached to it were very old the boat has not been moved in years the lift had not been used in years and uh it was an immediate hazard a neighbor called me and said hey you're not going to believe what's going on over there i looked and looked out into the water and he and his wife were trying to secure this boat so i grabbed grabbed some line went over there and helped him get it secure and eventually some more neighbors came over and assisted with it long story short we have addressed sea walls docks boat lifts the one thing that we've not addressed is the fact that there's a giant vehicle suspended up in the air that is sitting on this impending doom boat lift i think that we need to seriously consider something in an ordinance about this if we hadn't if the storm had been much worse than it was and we hadn't gone over there and secured his boat for him it would have broken loose and probably broke someone's vote with damaged property or even worse maybe caused someone in their life it's unacceptable and i look all around the water and there's just one here one there they're just kind of scattered about boats on rusted out prototypes that you know they don't work and they've not been moved in years and they're just waiting to fall in so one of the work sessions i'm going to bring this back up and i would like to discuss it more because i think it's in the city's best interest uh safety wise that we do something about it and that's all i have thank you thank you david i have just a couple items um first i'm just gonna touch uh briefly on the comments about photographing people's yards and stuff i'm not your attorney i'm not going to give you legal advice check with your attorney before you do anything okay if you're taking a picture of a sign in someone's front yard i believe you're fine if you're taking pictures of their bedroom through their window you're not going to be fine you're going to be in jail so be careful what you're doing but taking a picture of a sign for documentation purposes should not land anybody any problems i know it's uncomfortable we've had people take pictures of our licensed plates at my house that people take pictures of our house the people who walk on our property soon a former guy before your city manager walked up my property that's how he met the first time i didn't know who he was he was taking a picture for female purposes i thought he was my ex-wife's divorce investigator and it got pretty upset we patched it up pretty quickly anyhow that's that um secondly i'm just going to say this out just so people know what's going on after last council session i got not one but two records requests one was a complete request for all of my emails going back eternally um patti jensen was able to cull that down to all of them since march uh it's a voluminous request and i'm going to be writing you a letter this week i believe i have all the information i need legally to know exactly how to respond now and i'll let you know what the you know how what the arrangement will be for that the second one may be a very limited request or maybe even more voluminous and patty was going to check on that so we'll wait to see what the second request looks like and i think that one that second one affects mr banker also because it looked like it was directed to mr vanguard myself and june van scoy but if it's just the communications as i read it between the three of us that's going to be a real quick response um because i don't believe there's anything so we'll see how it goes um but anyway i just wanted to let you know that so you can expect it if you don't see something this week let me know okay um i think that's everything that i had for this week thank you for a good meeting uh you know the sign thing is a good example of how we debate things i know so some people in the audience it's upsetting we had to do amendments this is the way it goes this is the process florida doesn't allow us to talk behind the scenes so it would be great if i could pick up a phone and say glenn what do you think about this we can't do that it's illegal so we have to do it all here and it's time consuming and it's sometimes a little archaic because we have to do it in a certain certain fashion but those are the rules that we have to play by them with that we'll entertain a motion to adjourn second second all in favor hi i'm opposed have a good night thank you for coming we'll see you next monday"
