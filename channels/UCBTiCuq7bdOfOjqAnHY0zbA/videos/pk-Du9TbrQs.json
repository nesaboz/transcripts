    "transcript": "good evening everyone it's 6 p.m thursday june 30th 2022. this is a special uh council meeting in the city of miller beach florida first we are going to do the pledge of allegiance please rise into it i pledge allegiance [Music] councilmember frank banker councilmember leslie otero council member lloyd roberts here council member jody shirley here council member mike zabel vice mayor glenn gunn yeah mayor dave gavis here okay uh before we get started council members surely because we don't have anyone that's manning the zoo just kind of butt in this is a more of an informal meeting even though it's a special counsel meeting we're going to treat it more like a work session so i just wanted to get that out first okay we have two items on the agenda the first one is to discuss the selection process with city management candidates i don't believe this takes a motion because we're not actually clearing on anything so last in our last meeting we left this discussion we had several questions about how to handle the selection process of city management candidates and we've had some correspondence from vice mayor gunn and and then we we also have our list of seven council members with that being said since uh we have this this new information that flame gun shared with us i'm going to hand it over glenn and let us know what you were thinking well my whole purpose in building that majors was just so that people could look at it in perspective everybody at the same time you know it can get a little harrowing when you just kind of look at one when one resume and to be able to kind of look at you're looking at a resume to kind of get through the whole perspective of how everybody is rated in the same category i just thought it would help out and make things easier that was an audience did you find anyone in the list that you thought was a shining star in the group i think there are some extremely well qualified people there i i looked below the line i think everybody submitted two people submitted an extra name and uh i think there were some things you kind of brushed over or looked over or i think some people probably went in and googled the names and some jobs and cities and kind of took a little bit more interest in what all was being said and didn't rely just on what was on the in the resumes so uh based on that i think a lot of the names still float to the same why but i think after i did a little extra research i kind of reorganized it all right council yeah um right through every resume googled most of the names and i took them back down to the same you know breakdown i've taken a look at the matrix frankly i like that because to me you've got to show initiative throughout your career you just can't do it once and say you know i'm qualified you got to keep pursuing publications and currencies no different from what we did going up to jacksonville for classes but utilizing the search committee utilities and this i'm still coming down to a natural break it's about you know eight names total underneath that failing to see any qualifications that really stood out to me yes i'm sorry i'll come back ryan okay that's okay mr roberts one of my one of my concerns after the meeting we had last um well i know glenn was mentioning about maybe we need to slow down a little bit my biggest concern i've had a lot of experience in this is that you know sometimes you know the bird in the hand two to the bush thing the longer you put this off we may come to a conclusion with regards to who we think is the best only to find out when we make a phone call they've already found another job so we need to be very careful about that we have good qualified candidates i think we should not slow down i think we should move forward and with the candidates we have because i don't really know if there's anything really compelling out there that would make me think that well there's two or three other hugely strong candidates out there that for some reason they haven't come forward now but they will later that's just my feeling so i think we should move forward with the process and the timeline that we had originally talked about thank you councilmember shirley did you have any comments my only thought process is i think that it does warrant the opportunity to bring in a consultant or something or you know someone with hr expertise to help us with the selection process and maybe put you know maybe there's candidates that didn't find our um our post you know maybe there's an opportunity to use a head hunter i i'm just kind of floating some ideas but the main reason is um you know while i've hired many people in the past i'm not going to pretend that i'm an expert in the hr department and that i uh think that i can make the right selection this is a government position it's a city management position i think we've got an opportunity to make a good selection and we need to exercise an opportunity rather than being making a quick decision just for the sake of making a quick decision thank you very councilwoman wants to reopen accepting applications now because we had a deadline of the closed date the way i took her comments was look we should now explore other candidates or we reach out to other academies i mean this has been going on since what march uh thank god anonymous worked for nasa or apollo 13 would be by pluto i mean this is ridiculous i i want to make a comment but i want to make sure everyone else goes before i do um i would be in favor of the council moving forward with the plan we had we've got plenty you know a good number of very qualified candidates you know some of them have different kinds of experiences in different environments you know they have pluses and minuses on all of them but i think the council should go forward and interview the top candidates thank you okay so yes sir i agree with what lloyd's saying in a measured pace from the last hiring process my biggest takeaway was that people got the impression candidates got the impression that the city was just going through the motions and checking the boxes due diligence right the date they knew where they were going with this thing and they were just checking the gloves okay we had some really well qualified people withdraw from the process because it's like i see who's on the list there and yeah it's not worth my time i know where this is going i've seen it 100 times before so i think it's worth the time to make effort and make go through the process really well and to in that vein what i would say is rather than and this is a suggestion another recommendation is rather than trying to go through a lot of time right now of trying to rank order these guys and narrow it down to five we've got seven that we kind of all agree on why don't we just go round one of the interviews interview all the candidates and get get a first impression of these guys everybody can get a first impression how they look how they speak are they articulate what did they have to say did they have anything to add to their resume that they thought was of value and then let's go ahead and go through the first round and try to rank these and narrow it down why not get them all on a zoom interview i mean it's a relatively painless process let's see him and talk to him for the first round i'd be kind of against how they look i mean that can be discriminatory in a lot of ways okay but i'd like to speak on this and then we'll go around again you stole my thunder for sure i was pretty much on track with what you just said unfortunately i think that we have stalled so long that probably some if not all of the candidates have lost interest in us it may turn out that if we reached out to the eight candidates that are that are now on the list it was seven if we if we reached out to the seven and we said we'd like to do a zoom interview we may not even have three or four i spoke with all of the mayors at the big c and discussed their process and they all said that various municipalities are scrambling to find city managers i also spoke with mike tweedy about this and he said you have to grab them up as soon as you can and immediately interview and we may have missed them all this i'm not sure so my recommendation would be to go ahead and do what vice mayor gunn suggested which is let's go ahead and call them and let's have an interview with them a first impression and then we meet after that those interviews and we see if we can narrow it down to one or two that we bring in we should have already done this but we stalled for a week we've not lost a lot of time but we may have lost the candidates my recommendation would be that if we did lose the candidates that maybe we do another rfp start the process over again but this time be more expedient with with the way that we do it sort through the list rank them again and then immediately call them in and let's meet them and let's see if we can move forward if the council does not does not agree with that process maybe maybe it would be in the city's best interest to bring in a consultant i think we all work with city management we know we know what we expect and we know the personality that we it works well with us and i think that it would be something that we should be able to do on our own that's that's my thoughts i would agree with you i'd say you know let's go forward and interview the top six or at least have paddy contact the top whether it's the seven or eight people say hey we're up to first interview things are you still interested let's do it you know if we get eight of them great if we get five of them okay you know there's nothing to be gained by waiting right and i went for the list and everyone is slightly different but they're all very qualified and they have great backgrounds long histories and they they know how municipalities work so i didn't see anyone that i would be against working with now once i meet them that may be a different story but first impressions on paper they all look great and that's why they made it to the top seven so anyone else like to make a comment yeah i definitely agree with that process and i came in here today it's basically the same thing i'm gonna just grab the top seven to me all very well qualified again like i said read all the other resumes and those are the ones that stick out if we can possibly call tomorrow you know prior to the holiday you know to do that next week i don't know what the schedules are for anybody but potentially scheduling social work session for those interviews it may be difficult because it's a holiday weekend but i don't know why we couldn't make a phone call paddy mayor i won't be here tomorrow no you're off tomorrow so definitely that's out can you call them home we made a phone call in these seven or eight counties are we going to tell them what well i think it would be only fair for us to give them the range that we're working with and um it turns out that someone is just a rock star it may be negotiable but we we already sort of have it in our budget what we're planning on paying and i think it's in our best interest to stick with that and that that that uh range salary range may very well rule out several of the camps and i'm just saying before they take time to interview them soon and whatever like dad say what are we paying for we're willing to pay you 106 000 or what to do up to 100 610 so it's been bounced around so it gives them a chance to they may say you know i want to go back there i'm going to relax well some of these guys can help myself 25 and up you know and i don't know if they're going to take a pay cut to come here you know councilmember roberts yeah i think great great land i think we should afford it as quickly as possible the the consulting firm otherwise known as headhunters from my experience typically works in let's say a very large city like fort lauderdale where they're putting this out there and they're hoping to actually recruit people that have existing jobs because they're offering 190 000 a year and people will leave their current job as a city manager to do that we're not in that ball game so we're kind of at the bottom so to spend money on a recruiting firm a head hunting company i don't think it really fits our needs here so i think we have a good candidate so we're all good and i think the right candidate would be willing to possibly take reduced pain to work in a laid back very calm generally generally community where we're relatively simple to manage so in miami beach you can do bellar beach that's right vice mayor done yeah i'm on board with the discussion of the summer but i just want to ensure we don't give them the impression that we're they're hard and fast it is a situational kind of thing and if there's something you bring to the table then we didn't see maybe there is room for negotiation there but i don't want to poison the well and say hey this is our salary range take it and leave it if you're not interested fine because i think there are people out there who are willing to come to mayberry beach and kick back and i don't know that and you raise a valid point that we need to file away if this goes to plan b where we need to resume the searches the thing that a recruiter brings to the table is they go out and they recruit people in jobs it's already in an existing job we're not just narrowing down the market to people sitting around waiting for their job well we're using a recruiter what are we going to be paying the recruiter most of them charge anywhere from 5 to 15 of the candidates wage for anywhere from six to 12 months so that's another question that's true i'm hoping that that's like plan c i hope it's planned exactly but i agree but uh i i say that we move forward with the original plan except rather than trying to select four or three out of the group we just call them all because at the end of the day that's probably what we're going to line up with anyway there's three or four is a meeting can i make a motion that we go forward and have patty contact the top that will be the next that will be the next adjustment council member shirley how many grains i mean let's try to get them in and get this thing moving along i don't want to sit here and keep rehashing the same discussion um but you know what we're not able to secure someone of these you know top eight candidates then we have to be open-minded to using a recruiting firm yes vice mayor i think we're all on board which way is it going if we interview these people maybe just have a quick discussion on the format how long it's going to last i don't think we're talking about a group set of people on the same screen we'll probably talk individual ones maybe for 15 or 30 minutes that's right and uh what we would try to do is squeeze it just it depends on how many i would say more than four or five we would need to spread it over over two evenings but i see no reason why we can't do this really quickly individually are they going to be on like some zoo maybe channel six seven because what i'm saying is when you interview one right another one's written down they're going to be separate so we'll make sure that so we'll just go ahead a scheduled time and um and whoever is operating soon if it's not added and we will just turn off and also that they can't hear each other okay uh that means that uh the schedule as it stands right now today is the 30th and that was supposed to be um let's see let's see the regular council meeting in july which we're not doing that anymore so right now we were to review we're only one week late and it sounds to me like the review process has already happened and we are sticking with the original seven is everybody everybody good for that i'm fine with the seven yeah all right yes and voicemail you added an eighth just because that was the next score is that that was [Music] same group of these people is i'm going to do this okay all right uh so if that's the case uh that that ends agenda item number one now let's move on to agenda item two which was to continue the selection process for eligible candidates i believe we just did that but we're going to need a motion to send those candidates to paddy to be contacted i made the motion to add in the salary region we're talking about and the salary range okay and that's with the initial phone call yes everybody get with that we have to put one more item on there is this is not a hard and fast range situation i just can't believe that given the range they can select themselves or not select themselves but at least they've got a range going on well if we tell them 110 000 backs and the guy's making 150 now i don't think is it that he's educated enough to take this job no like sometimes people will actually back the salaries down and notice that in a few cases people took i think 116 they went down to about 120 a year for their next job i would agree with you a year or two ago but not july okay inflation the way it is okay uh so you just tried to amanda motion it's not being made so i need an initial motion to send these candidates to patty and my recommendation would be to make that motion uh with the criteria that we give her so if we're just making a simple motion somebody's second we'll vote for it and then we will hand her the list of 11 with a stipulation that as you're speaking with that you will give them the salary range and that we would be interested in having a conversation with you man i want to make the motion that we forward seven days not eleven days no no i'm sorry i said 11 it's because it starts with 11 but it is 17. i would like to make motion though before the top seven names um to paddy to call to start the interview process i think we already have a first admission so would you like a second i would like a second okay great all right okay now we'll go to uh council and then we need to go to the uh citizens because i did not give them the opportunity to speak one question about the motion does it have the salary range in it yes we'll we'll pass that off to patty we we we have that published somewhere that's part of the motion that we forward this question i'll go with his expression okay we've kind of already discussed is uh would any other council members like to speak before i call on the citizens no citizen comments no all right back to the council hey dave yes i've had my hand raised for quite some time it's jody so it just could we because it seems like every time the question of salary range comes up no one knows what that range is have we do we have any salary range we actually uh published it on the uh on the job description which i do not have in front of are you sure i thought it said depends on yeah depend on qualifications experience and professional credentials that was the app that was the ad that is what was the next one that was on the website we will get you that information that's published i know it's published somewhere it's just not a great work that i have for looking through the candidates so i guess back to the point is it you know i don't want to eliminate someone that may be slightly out of our range you know who might bring it up to the table but it's that it makes sense to paint them a little more and i'm and none of us seem to have that committed to memory so certainly doesn't seem like it's that important i mean i i hate to be flip about it but that's i'm going if it's that important then one of you that keep insisting that we publish it or make that a criteria for an interview maybe you should know what that number is i am calling i'm pulling the website out yeah jody when you said recall from memory i'm pretty confident it was like 90 to 115 i'm not mistaken range 85 to 90 it's the base 115 as as the top of the range pretty sure that's what it was i could be mistaken i'm looking at the website and then you tell me where it is on the website do you see the job advertisement on the website no no i don't see anything except right here let's see here three different numbers except the numbers ranges that we came up and we had they raised estimate we had the city stats estimate and there was one third one they were all ballpark but we never sat down as a body and went through all three and said this is it so don't you think we should do that and or at this point we just was not discussing well we can give a projection i mean the range was at the bottom end of all three just and i could pull this up where i need home because i don't have it well as a matter of fact i need to have it on the computer but it's probably like a 5 to 110 115 range and the lynn guessing it was really ballpark and that includes like nine teams they're all similar yeah they're always they were all in in that range i didn't hear any pushback on the high or the low whenever we were having these conversations but i think one of the reasons why we were reluctant to post it was because there may be somebody that immediately we would want but immediately they would know us because of the the amount of money that we published we were willing to pay but for some reason i i know i heard that it was on the website but it's not i did not see it did you find it on the website no i found the the job posting but the salary range was never on there if my memory started correctly we were discussing an interim increase that fell within the bottom of the salary match and then i made a suggestion once we hired him he gave it 5 and still i think 4 000 under the top [Music] well um we have a motion on the table right now to move forward where someone can amend with a a salary range to get the padding make the uh like to make a motion for the match i don't believe in minimums but the maximum salary range looking at this is 123 000 per year the reason i came up with that is certainly a 115 around that max but i'm factoring in 10 inflation and the fat job market because i started looking around when i started reading through these we're not the only city obviously out there we tend to see the same little posse apply for each job you know the same three games kind of pop up on each side but that's my figure number 123k so and that is not looking at the budget and affordability that's so so your amended motion would be for patty to contact the candidates and announce that we have a salary cap of 123 000 but the salary you would be offered is based upon your qualifications yes okay so now the amended motion uh we have a second would anyone like to comment on that motion should we voted on the first one before we start mending uh we know because we have uh the motion was on the table and then a motion was made to amend that motion uh if the amendment the amendment passes then we'll go back to the original and we'll vote on that one under robert's rules the discussion was what is the salary right never had a fixed salary so exactly so before i pass it off to the citizens would anyone like to make a comment i am not in favor of putting any sort of a salary number in the content that pani has with the candidates i mean believe it the salary range depends on which qualifications experience and professional credentials you know let them let them sell us on their qualifications credentials etc i would not put it in at this point my thoughts are leaning that direction also and the reason why is because if someone is applying to work at miller beach they may they may want an easier lifestyle job that's less hassle easier to manage and they may already know that they're going to take a pay cut for a better life now i can't guarantee that but i can tell you in my past i took a serious pain once just called sunshine just to get off the road and so so it was well worth it to me but council member shirley do you have any comments on that well i agree with you completely i'm not in favor of putting it in there but at some point we got to vote in vermont so what are we voting on and let's say do the vote you know a motion to amend the original motion with an exact salary cap listed we can vote and move it forward or we can vote it down and then we go back to the original motion where we never actually defined the salary we were trying to figure out exactly what to tell patty to say and and who to and who to contact let's see who's out there whether or not they're interested i think what you're saying is we don't know what we don't know right but the problem is like let's we said we want them to sell us okay so guy comes in meticulous about everything he's got all the qualifications he's making 150 000 years pulls up the public record of this and says you need to sell us well i'm making 150 thousand dollars why would you want to maintain the time and you're going to say well we just worked on our beach and we don't have that much money that's what it comes down to so i said why did you put a cat why didn't you let me know where to catch i would have gone through this procedure well i i think we're taking the discussion a little too literally here with with marketing and some of what they're doing i think it's like let's talk to these individuals and then once we we see everybody we go through round two of refining the list we vote on that narrow down the final interviews and we come up with a finalist we offer jobs in that order and when we ask what what's your expected salary range or you leave the discussion with this is what our salary range is they say well no it's too long then fine we'll go to number two i mean it's it's an integrative process but again what is the salary i think we will get to that once a week before we make the final call not only that but once we see what the candidates are looking for this is willing to help us hone in on that salary range because we may i don't know i'm not going to speculate what we're doing by trying to set a cap but i think it's in our best interest to find out what the market is what's actually happening in the market and the only way we're going to find out is to interview some people and see what they're looking for let's go to the citizens right quick any comments no all right back to the council okay first we need to uh vote on whether to amend with a salary cap so let's just do a quick uh voice vote on that roll call yes councilmember banker yes councilmember notaro no councilmember roberts which one was this i'm sorry this is to uh to add the salary cap to the list of names we're handing them out the salary range of the salary the salary pretty much the cap yes yes yes thank you council member shirley no council members able yes fighting your gun no mere goddess no so that's uh four to three i hear that right two okay so the motion dies now uh the motion to have been nice now let's go back to the original motion which is to send the seven candidates and and i will go through the list right now it's ending number 11 which is griffin candidate number 15 which is cabelli candidate number 16 which is mendes salt libya which is crawford candidate 20 which is uh riffler 27 is fabri and 28 is daniels all right so we just need to do another voice vote or a roll call vote pay if you will council member banker yes councilmember notaro yes councilmember roberts yes councilmember shirley yes council members abel yes vice mayor gunn yes mayor goddess yes uh so uh city first if you don't mind as soon as you come back what day will you be back tuesday tuesday i'm sorry i just changed my appointment that i had today so i could be here tonight i didn't know we were going to do something tomorrow i'm sorry no no worries no we understand so tuesday morning bright and early would you please start contacting these candidates and seeing if they are still interested in interviewing with us and then we will try to coordinate a zoo me with with each of the candidates preferably we'd like to have it all on the same date and if we go back to the original calendar date i believe we have a council meet a regular council meeting on the fifth uh the sixth was supposed to be the candidate application deadlines and then you had a deadline and we did not have another meeting scheduled until july the 19th and that was supposed to be the zoom interviews so um we're that's that's uh about two and a half weeks from now i'm looking to see what day that is july the 19th it's tuesday that's a tuesday that's what i have on the calendar but we could certainly get them in faster if possible bear in mind also that we still are supposed to have a work session to discuss the budget uh before we have the the uh before we have the next budget regular budget meeting so i'm trying not to just completely overwhelm us with meetings but these are trying times right now we have a lot on our plates and we need to get through this so that things get back to normal alternatively it's the 19th good with everything for uh zoom meeting interviews yes july the 19th yes mike yes all right boys jody jody she had to sign off okay she signed up i'm just going to uh i'm just going to say that we at least have a forum and we can move forward if it looks like maybe we can meet with all of them sooner than that the stars line up and we'll do another special meeting but as it stands right now yes okay the zoom interview that's pre-employment application and background check or post what this would be this would be where we actually just face to face with each candidate and we kind of feel them out and see what they're looking for and what their personalities are like and try to narrow it down to possibly two candidates uh who knows with after those zoom interviews we may say let's call these two guys in because they're our favorites and we'll move forward that's the only difference between the only deviation between this and the original plan is we were looking for only three or four candidates for zoom interviews i have a feeling whenever you contact these seven you'll be lucky if you get that many and the reason i ask is because to do the background checks that's why i was trying to get the timeline on that you we have to have an employment application and they're signed released so are we looking which one makes sure yes the suggestion is that unless there is a conflict is there any reason why you as the head of the city reach out and make that initial call hey i'm american and look here's where we're going with this thing we've made the first pass through the list are you still interested if you're still interested this is your time frame we will provide you with an email or a letter with further information keep it short but i think okay have questions i did consider that and the only reason why i didn't and the council can say one way or the other was that i didn't want anyone to think that i was being biased and formulated my opinions before everyone else had the same opportunity to meet the candidates so we're giving them the wrong impression or by saying the wrong thing causing them to self-select out but i agree that should be a city employee advice one of us i will i'll go with the direction but we currently have we have just voted to let paddy contact the candidates yeah now i don't mind helping but i would prefer you actually make the program and i think that'll be a short process so you know just a initial contact yeah and i just wanted to check on are we trying to accomplish by what we're trying to accomplish by the 19th that doesn't include getting the actual applications and background checks right or does it okay so background checks do cost money and and they they take what you say about a week yes okay and i would say that out of the ones that you contact if you have let's just say all seven say well yeah i'll have that conversation with you maybe hold off but if it's three or four maybe you go ahead and get ahead of the process okay i just didn't know what you wanted by the 19th just uh okay all right i will have a discussion once you determine how many people are actually still entertaining the idea of working for them i think okay that's perfect yeah okay so i understand that process suggestion together you don't have to think back apart because the question is [Music] okay is that okay yeah yeah all right okay um so that takes care of item number two i'm gonna open up the floor for comments i know it's not it's not our normal deal with a special meeting but this is more of a kind of a work session anyway so any council comments just mr bank last couple weeks ago one of our residents was sighted for a beach umbrella on the beaches fell our shores but they were in the public wet sands so apparently our shores is enforcing their ordinance until this thing gets your job we have a big weekend coming up i believe on the front side outside with you at least inform our residents from 1st street and 19th street no allowed there's going to be a lot of guests there's gonna be a lot of friends there's some relatives uh they don't look at that little they'll look at the sign when they go on the beach um [Music] and uh i just wanna avoid more engaged sign was supposed to inform the residents of current events uh things that are happening i think this would be a good thing to prove that council any comments any gays mades any any any uh do you agree disagree we need some direction on the side is there any other information on that i mean i haven't seen that well i i guess i'm hearing from another source that the sheriffs have talked to people and that political statement is trying to be made and where the officer is trying to de-escalate and just give kind of a warning the next thing that happens is the person is basically begging the sheriff to issue a citation actually i just pulled it up no it said no it was postmarked june 30. they talked in june 2020 that's when they started to just give the background here they did go up to well now that i i understand the employee that a lot of shares have tried to work things out but now that they've ticketed somebody as one of the commissioners said the learning process is over now with citations and they're actually happy that a citation was issued and they want more citations so look we have a sign out there we want to be good neighbors with belair shores tell our residents they came down to shady actually i think i'm going to comment on that i don't uh believe that there is a single resident who is is unaware of the policy at bellar store it's uh it's been yesterday it's been in the uh it's been all over the press it's been heavily debated i would say that if anyone that's staying in our community walks across the street with an umbrella they're either wanting to be written a citation or they're in a short term round that would be my guess but my initial thoughts on this are i don't want to advertise one way or the other for bella and i got it then i just read the story and frankly comes off of the natural lawsuit there's no mention about anybody inside of it contact was made on june 28th that just the attorney's contact in there for comment advice you know i would be more in favor of a blanket disclaimer on the city website basically saying that just because you accessed the beach from the biller beach side through the miller beach access before doesn't mean that you're on a bel air b portion of the military city beach and any beach you access here take a moment to familiarize yourself with the signs on any beach access that would blend and cover whichever city beach you're going to be sitting on i could see him like a disclaimer on our website for any chances i would be okay with that i i just don't want to use the sign for that that's just my opinion any other comments on that okay uh well i appreciate everyone coming tonight and [Music] i got that one too but there's another one regarding a code violation letter that went out regarding an australian client on a property yes i did receive that and my take on that was that [Music] we are our code is actually okay i didn't see a problem and i actually went over that with kyle and we we spent about 20 minutes on the phone back and forth and then we had another conversation the next day and he said i'm granted and it looks to me like we're we're justified for enforcing that code okay so i don't know when that conversation took place but i also looked at it and i also had a meeting with kyle and i think it may have been a follow on me because in his email he raises the point about waterfront properties appearing to have an exclusion to that and if you go in and you look at the codes it talks about hey in [Music] rl district low or district medium you cannot plant these things but if you go into the waterfront section there's a paragraph in there that says that if the owner removes an existing plant or it's in his knockdown by a method she's not planting so there seems to be a discrepancy there and he raises the issue is hey you know is this something that was overlooked when we wrote these things that he doesn't have anything here and uh yes i think he has a conversation and i would say that the correction for that would be to have the exact same code for the waterfront properties not the other way around otherwise you restart the grandfather clock on all invasive species they're growing all over our community it's already there it can live and if it happens it's struck by lightning or you decide to cut it down then you can't replace it with the same one and that that was my fear is that if we if we level the playing field we give the rest of the city the same i don't know why that exemption exists but it was specifically in a section for waterfront properties they had a different set of rules but we see that with everything we see that with high-shaped lots they have different setbacks we see different setbacks between properties in various areas of the community where everyone is not treated the same and whenever the founders were putting this community together they they thought everything through and i'm sure there was some reason specifically why they did that but i for a lot of fun i don't even know why washingtonian paul is considered bad i mean i have to look look it over but i don't think it was a complete exclusion for all invasive species it was just three plants or something the issue as i see it is there's about 20 or 30 of these trees throughout the beach so by singing out wine where are we going with this well they're not really trees not right there there are trees there's a big those big conifer yeah they're not considered a tree i was told they're considered a bush i i agree with you they're a hundred feet in the air and they get some tree but it's supposed to be so my name they are named by species well it's it's my understanding that the gentleman that owns the property is going to be compiling an extensive list of all violations within the community and if they're if they're not following code and they don't belong here then code enforcement needs to treat everyone the same i agree period you don't just pick on one person you you start going systematically through the community and unfortunately the way that we our code enforcement has worked in the past up until just recently was it's the squeaky wheel next door doesn't like something the neighbors do it you know files a complaint and then the city responds and it's been very rare where we've been proactive in code enforcement until recently the only reason i said it's not what i thought i'm not into the shrubs or whatever but you have a you have a code for bushes around homes and it has to be so high i say it's a tree okay it looks like a tree but i'm being told it's not classified as a tree it's classified as a push which would give wouldn't that give us the ability to chop it down to what max height is like six feet you notice you know where i'm going so the invasive species of this is very specific yes and that is only the invasive species you know it doesn't say hey this is abortion maybe it's a tree whatever it names it by species this is on the floor invasive species list and then if you go into the codes it talks about from what it's actually about water consumption is what it's really all about saying these invasive species are are problematic and that respect and you're not long they have these things well in one section of the codes you know it talks about it in uh like 66-32 the planning of these things and it was a dense edition of the wallet in district 2. well that's basically it the planting of washingtonian palms australian times brazilian representatives puppetry shall not be permitted in the district too but then it goes on on the waterfront and say existing trees located at water waterfront property within the city which are not in conformity with the provisions of these sections just you just let it lie until the hurricane blows it down or expose you know what i'm saying and i think that's what the neighbor that raised this issue because i think elsa came up last year threw some of the branches into his book right through his like i said maybe it's a tree okay he's saying no it's not a tree again i think he did say it was i forget how many numbers he said it was it was a large amount just in the city right yeah and and uh i will i'll say it now and i've said it many times in the past there are many trees and hedges and shrubs and whatever all throughout the community that are completely off the chart anything that's completely blocking a neighbor's driveway where they can't get out without nosing out on the street whether when their glass is already in the in the room before you can see what's coming that's a problem and some of these trees are hanging really low and they're they're actually over the traffic we definitely have a problem with with landscaping and i am all for enforcing it as much as possible so that's my two cents on that and if we have if this council agrees that we we have inconsistency it's something that we should look at but i think it's something where we should go lean more towards enforcement rather than leniency on these problems because miller beach is a beautiful community and the last thing we want is a few people to uh make it look bad well and another thing is i wrote to this former city manager and the interim center manager about a tower being directed i believe people contacted you about it and it's not an antenna it is a talent and um it's i think it's crystal clear you can't have one between houses too it is it's big it's it's worse it's beyond a tower it's a danger and the reason why is because it has homemade mechanics to where it becomes cantilever in the backyard so this this thing that's supposed to be installed by permit by a licensed professional is being raised and lowered and then leaning on its side and it's a full-blown tower that that has three three like those towers because sometimes i go it's not now i understand that's right but it only has like a 316 cable to pull it up and who knows that the inspection of the cable coming halfway up it's it's a uh a hybrid a homemade hybrid is what i would i would call it and whether the concrete pad in the ground is is good or not and it can sustain it we have ordinances in place that say you can't do that what happens is the waters get muddied on enforcement because the fcc says you will allow anyone in your community to have an antenna but we're not preventing them from having an antenna we're just saying if you're going to have an antenna it needs to be within reason for aesthetics and safety and even the ordinance we have in place concerning antenna says you can only put it on top of an existing structure so erecting a tower out there does not fall under the existing structure and raising a tower does require permitting and it's supposed to go to the normal process based upon our code it would never get through permitting because it's in people it's calling residents residential property rather than on community plans or something that's designated for that type of purpose well she's padded and important it isn't within the setback it violates violence well this is uh what what i would like everyone to do that's involved in this is to compile your data if you have anything uh emails whatever and send it to the city of tournament because i want him to look at the fcc code look at our code and then look at the evidence presented to him and let him decide whether we're uh in incorrect and we need to do something about our ordinance or if we are correct and we need to do something to the uh the violation i think your assumption is i don't understand how a hundred dollar bounce check could go up to 20 some thousand dollars i do believe we discussed some of it's not a balanced chat what was was it went to court and the justice said i believe there's a fine of 1500 or 2500 that was awarded that day and since then it's been incremental because of the interest 70 a day but no it is for that it's not ours yeah [Music] i guess we all got the emails yeah i am what was the initial uh you know what drove this was the uh the magic blue is the magistrate's ruling right you know here's the amount and you will have and they didn't pay it therefore he started you know those lines on top of it it wasn't a hundred dollar check it's relatively robust and the last time we had one of these we handed that off to the city attorney and he actually came up with a game plan of okay this is acceptable i would advise you to make this offer for settlement and uh and it actually worked out i would grip and doing the same thing again is that where it sat now mr mayor that this is not the same person yeah okay well i'm saying do you get that again sounds like you might get rid of the house or something else that's probably what it is they're probably wanting to cash cash uh yeah [Music] through us there's a city is there's a magistrate's ruling that letter was not complete they told his thoughts about where he thinks he stands and doesn't judge what i've talked to files on that project um i i would say that we probably uh right now our city attorney is on vacation but he'll be back next week they'll be here on the fifth and um council member comments or during a city the city attorney report we should bring that up and just make him aware of what's going on maybe give it a copy of the letter and and let's see what he advises us to do uh certainly he's he's gonna know better than we do on how to address these issues all right any of the comments uh before we adjourn uh that being said do i have a motion to return second all right i have a first a second all in favor aye any opposed all right thank you very much"
