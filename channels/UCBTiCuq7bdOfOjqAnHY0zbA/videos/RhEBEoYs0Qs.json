and then item number five is the discussion of the ond calendar events so um at the actually it was july sorry about that or no it was it was july 5th not june 5th um they approved all of our events for the fall so meaning um the chili cook-off the halloween event and the christmas event so um i'm gonna sit down with kyle after the meeting so we can just put like the the schedule so we'll do those three events and then the health and wellness fair for january since we have that date locked and loaded so we'll put those in on our on the web page for bellar beach and just a few details not too much but like you know call with questions because we have most of everything outlined and done but just so like if someone happens to be looking on there that they know to put it on their calendar like well before we can get things out like the signs go up or it goes on the sign and then maybe can we send out an email blast like maybe two months in advance and then one may be closer to the event like on the um constant contact yeah is that okay okay don't bother anybody okay just so hopefully we can touch base with a couple of people um and thank you for coming to the meeting caroline i appreciated you being there um because i have never been up three times and then kyle said they like were yeah and they were talking even after you left it came up a couple of times and we got some compliments they said they were really happy with what we're doing and you know yeah so it was good but i um i mean i knew i was staying through like the third thing but i didn't realize just because like say for example with the um the approval of the swing set equipment or the playground equipment or whatever like you know that is kind of you know we survey the parks and we make suggestions if something is rotting or if it's cracked or broken so um you know it was kind of good that i wasn't there because like we don't say oh yeah we're gonna use our budget for you know playground equipment or for fixing the crack in the seawall it's just eyes on all of the parks which is basically our main job in this board is to is to look after those and make suggestions or whatever so but otherwise it was a good meeting i thought it went well it was it was a little scary because there was like 55 people in there that were angry you could feel the tension in the room and then all of a sudden it just like it was a balloon that deflated because it didn't even like what they were there for with attorneys in hand didn't come to fruition so like they just all walked out and it was like oh okay well they're happy so that's good but does anybody like there's really not a whole lot because obviously it's only july but i just wanted to let everybody know that they were approved and we're good to go on our events so i didn't know if you guys had any questions or how soon do they give us a budget or do we propose a budget for 2023 well september is the budget approval i know they're working on it now what we're working on because like say for example like currently say i'm just making up a number our budget is four thousand dollars and we spend two thousand dollars on t-shirts and hats and towels when we sell those the money comes out of our budget but the money doesn't go back into our budget so it doesn't matter if we make a million dollars we don't get the money back to pay for our things so like we're gonna ask if they can make it a different line item because at the end of the day like you know they obviously charge enough to cover the cost and then whatever taxes or there's a little padding and they're not a lot just to make sure we compare pay the taxes and yeah so kyle decides what the padding should be but then when it's selling and we're selling i mean we sell it pretty quick we have a little bit of inventory on t-shirts right now but like we're sold out of towels we were sold out of hats we're sold out of koozies we're sold out of stickers i mean we're sold out of the majority of the things that we had i mean i was literally with someone yesterday she's like i've got to get in there and get a bellar beach towel i was like you're too late we don't have any so like you know we sell it but it's just like the way that you know the budget's set up it comes out of our budget but not back in so we're gonna maybe ask to see if they can that would be next year though well she's asking about the budget for next year no not next not this current budget that's that they're reviewing it'll be all the way around four oh so it's too late to ask for 2023 yeah oh okay i didn't realize that okay so it um they'll decide on the budget and then we just are told what we have to work with and then kyle pretty much we say this is what we want and then he tells us if we can afford it it would be kind of like we did the last this last go around like the money will be there um and then i i just thought it was a good idea next year that we we separated out and we say okay and this this year we sold this much or we spent this much on merchandise so then just separated out like this is what we plan to spend to purchase merchandise and sell it back you know recouping all the money so that it's just it's it's flat yeah it's just it's basically even at the end of the day yeah okay so does that answer a question yes okay it does so we'll just get allocated a budget yeah we don't get to request or say you know this is what we need it's kind of like this is what you get and make it work and yeah but then we through kyle manage it after that pose it gets proposed but the council decides yeah right but longer term like if they if this i know a lot of that's going to go to the bellage community foundation that can really generate profits on it but if they were the support was more it would be charged a little bit more then we would create profits right rather than being just an expense item on the budget this you follow what i'm saying so the next is that what you're saying is going to happen in the next year oh we're going to keep some of those funds and uh well the idea with like with the merchandise is we just wanted to break we want to cover any say like minimal at the time that it you know say it takes the staff to to get the goods or whatever like that but we we're just trying to break even really and provide the service to community yeah if they want to buy a bellar beach tank top for 20 they can go down the street and buy one so like we're just trying to again pride in our city and and i know you don't know the background but for the last two years pretty much it'll be two years in september over and over and over like the previous mayor was like oh well the last parking rec board raised 750 i heard about this 750 every single time i got up there to where like i wanted to go yeah i said it over and over there are four of us we are not fundraisers our goal is the park and rec board and all this little like the little social gatherings that we do is extra we will work it into our budget but we're not here to raise money for the city we're not a for-profit board like we were just starting out i mean george is like our historian and our veteran but everybody else was new and even at the pretty much every time i give a quarterly board report like we worked up a sponsorship program if someone wants to donate money but we everyone's busy and they have other things that they're doing like we're we've said from the get-go and we voted on it and it passed so like if the majority of the board at any point and we're getting three new members well two more two new ones that can vote um and if you know like say three out of five people want to be fundraisers for the city and try to make money then it's a majority and it passes and then like they can kind of take the ball and run with it so it's been something that every single time we get up in front of them we have said it over and over and over like park and rec board if you read in our book or you know that's the sunshine law but if you read in the book like our stated purpose you know like other than the events we kind of wanted to stay within those guidelines um and then like you said like once the foundation gets up and running and we are for profit and we will say we're a for-profit because we're trying to beautify this park or we're trying to get a kayak launch in or we're trying to like there's a purpose behind our fundraising that benefits the community then i'll be like yeah we're going to charge 20 for the t-shirt instead of you know cost plus just covering what you know kyle wants us to cover he sets the prices when it's like city um here she comes when it's city related so that's just a little history for you because we kind of got i got browbeat every single time i went up there for that 750 and i fought against it the whole time hi patty sorry i wasn't looking at my phone i was jabbering so i didn't realize um i didn't see your tech so anyway okay thank you for that background because you know of course i come from a finance background in for-profit so i hear really do not try to do any uplift and i go oh okay i have to remember this is community service community service yeah so it's like we just want to um make people happy and have pride in like so they can wear a bell or beach tank top or have beach towels or whatever and not trying to because like i said i think if we made money it wouldn't come back to our board and it's at the end of the day it's not going to make a dent in anything we're not going to make that much yeah make a difference really so we're um we're do you have an agenda i want to make sure you have yeah okay so and then this is your um here's your book you're official and um we are on number number five so i was just mentioning to them real quick that we um like all of our events for the fall city council passed at the last meeting so we're good with that the only thing that i would say um that i couldn't do before they voted was we were planning on having live entertainment and i had someone very specific in mind she's very reasonably priced and she is excellent and she's not available she's in europe so we're not going to have live music so that'll come off so that'll be 150 we can use on something else or leave in the budget but if we have money left over it doesn't roll over so like we could probably just um if we don't need it we won't use it if we need it for something but we can just as easily pipe in really good music for a chili cook-off lunch because that's you know it's no one's going to be really looking for to be entertained that much eating their chili and drinking their beer because no one has wine with chili so that's the only change um because like last time we had you know like my cousin my uncle you know blah blah and it's like we don't know what they sound like we don't know that much about them it's not like we're gonna have auditions for the chili cook-off it's like oh it's like open mic night or open mic day because it's a daytime event but is everybody okay with that like kyle and i kind of talked about it when she's unavailable i mean i don't know if someone's dying to try to find a really good like entertainment for two hours at noon on a saturday for a hundred bucks it's gonna be tough she charges 50 bucks an hour and then we were gonna tip her so she's very reasonable and she's amazing i i told her i'm like give me your dates and i will book something around you like but the last kind of music is she a guitarist or just a vocalist or yes yes yes yes if you have a if you have a keyboard if you have a piano or a guitar she can do acoustic but mostly she would probably play guitar and sing and she said she could pretty much sing like if you say this is the genre she's like i can fill two hours so she's um excellent but unavailable for our event but that was the only other thing um i think everything else on there is a go and um the trophies we're going to need to take in so that really wasn't budgeted for appropriately so that it'll probably cover that yeah do you remember the you know the fees right i can't remember last night it was 30 bucks 30 30. if we if you need to change out the top plate so somebody donated 17 boxes of old trophies and so um we're some of them are in decent shape so we're going to um re-do the little plates on them for the halloween so for first second third for the kids and then first second and third for the dogs and then how many do we need for that one six all right yeah we're doing something for the chili cookoff for like the person that wins um i was just curious you know what actually we didn't budget for that for a while well like i said if we just get a skillet or something i'll i could do the vinyl so i did it before or like chili cook it off yeah we we need to decide that too like what the categories are because like we want to try to get people to sign up and they're going to ask like what it is so maybe we'll tackle that at the next meeting in november they're categories yeah like dave so it's dave gaddis come here cat is really like he requested this event and they're super fun i've done a ton of them it's um but he he had certain categories that he's used to working with in the past and you know i don't care what the categories are so it's like if he was like hey let's do this this and this then you know we have like maybe most creative like whatever i can't i have it in my notes i just don't have that chili like you know creative recipes vegetarian i've been to a few of them too and they usually have like best big meat or best hot you know whatever most spicy yeah that's the it's like a skillet like painted gold and then you just put like who on like with their name yeah i did the vinyl for it like i put the names oh nice and we do have the funds now if we're not going to use that for them like music yeah so we could do it for them because i don't think a skillet is that expensive oh this is what it looked like there was one for cornbread one for chili but like if we just did the chili one or something it's kind of cool like you hope like so that that person would have it for the year and then like they have to get that yeah and they give back and you put someone else's i don't know if anyone's gonna part with that why well you had to put the name like 2022 and then you know it's like a legendary i understand that oh yeah iconic so they don't get to take it home it kind of can go on the wall here or something yeah you know how you guys like to hang straight are they hold on we've been trying to get a darn tank top up there for a year and a half it's like no hanging it on the wall but we'll figure it out we have time but yeah so like we do have the extra 150 bucks that we can figure out like um a trophy or a prize or something um even like have you guys seen those they literally you know like a three liter of um they they have the hot sauces they're in ginormous bottles like that would be cute with like a little plaque on it or something you know we could be creative but we have time i actually ordered one of those for my husband for something and i thought it was full of hot sauce but the three liters are empty like the glass is tinted and there was no hot sauce in it but i think you can get like a 1.5 so you can still get like a big figure it out but you guys put your little you know creative caps on and like maybe for the next meeting come back and we'll kind of figure out like we could do a skillet or we could do or we could do three that we could do one skillet one this one that for like the different categories like if it's a spicy category we could do the hot sauce bottle or whatever and but we can do whatever we'll figure out it's not a big deal um okay so now that you're here patty we can go back i move number four for when you're here because i wanted a full board here since we have everybody um we need to so nora was the vice chair for um the last year and a half i guess and she moved so we need a new vice chair so honestly in the the time she never once had to go up at a meeting for me she never once had to run a meeting so she really didn't have to do a ton of i don't think she did anything anything so it's not a big job and then no slam to nora she just never had to you know what i mean like it was just i was always here so like she was um back up she was back so anyway um so we need to make a motion to nominate a new vice chair or if you can also nominate yourself if you're interested why don't we see if anybody's interested and then and then we can make the motion yeah anyone anyone nicole you're one of our seniors well she's a secretary though yeah she's very good at being segregated and george george is the historian sure george do you want to be the vice chair george i thought i was being set up when you said that really don't have to do anything she hadn't been anything in two years now we'll have to do it but it's not because she didn't want to do anything well george is your senior member of the committee i've seen you of anything he does know and he remembers everything from every board he's been on so that's helpful so now no pressure on anybody i really do not not interested okay okay patty caroline i think he would be great i'm happy to do it if nobody else is interested okay it really it's not a lot so we have to decide on the vice chair and the secretary tonight no because we still have a secretary for a while yeah we'll deal with that when we come to it okay yeah because then at that point our alternate will move up to the board and then we'll still have a full board and then we'll try to find another alternate um but like in the pa like so when we first started i want to say we had seven we had a full full board and two alternates and i mean if you come to the meetings and you give input then we value your input like if you're an alternate i just we kind of treated everybody like they were um and it counts for quorum if the alternates are here right if like regular members can't be here but anyway all right so i make a motion for caroline cornelly to be the vice chair of the park and rec board do i have a second all in favor aye okay perfect thank you thank you to confidence i look forward to supporting you all right perfect hey and you came to the meeting i just i try to always go since i've been since probably the first i've been trying to go to everyone i've been argentinally explaining because i i thought i'm super interested in what they're talking about it's like i'm very i find them very interesting and it really does help you become a better board member because you see how they disagree right it's very open right and yet that's how they function so yeah i usually go that's probably my fault yeah well i i got an ulcer the last no i did it i'm joking it's probably very less painful it's less painful and they're a lot shorter which is helpful and they're still they seem so long even now though they do seem well nicole when are you phasing out probably a few months okay at least three two three we're gonna plan a party three i don't know i guess we'll see how far the universe wants to take us post office spots yeah not change my license you mean no george she's gonna move right over to the foundation is what she's gonna do yeah i still want to do the apparel yeah and plus kyle wants the apparel to move over to the foundation anyway so it's just gonna follow nicole right out the door great yeah you know how you like storing things does your new house have more storage no well yeah but a boutique is bigger than ever so anyway but yeah that's fine so we have a plan we have a good one we have a good plan so all right so we're we were covered for um patty do you have any questions because we were just finishing number five so the events for the fall we're going to put them on the park and rec board page on the website patty's gonna or kyle's gonna change out the picture for us because the picture is from an event from last year i sent her four pictures to choose from or three or whatever so we try to change it out like every quarter depending on what's going on and if we have good pictures like this last beach cleanup like the only picture i had was of the donuts and they were so cute because they were a flag they were like fourth of july donuts yeah they were so cute but everybody's was scattered i never had a group like i never had the whole group there like together so i just usually i'm really good about at least you know five or six pictures but um we had a good group we had 14 people so for the holiday weekend i was really happy with that and um i um recruited four new people two new couples so i'm hoping to see them back next month bellar beach residents that didn't know we were doing it it's amazing to me like um just you know people pass that sign and they just don't see it as much as like i see you know like i'm looking for it though i know what it is but if you're not looking for it you just don't see it um does it say on the website that you guys meet at 19th street i thought i looked up one time so it does say and it says it on that board yes okay i have a question that's uh foundation and this is like very close is that they're separate entities but they're kind of mixed we'll work together yes meaning um the foundation will take over some of the things that the park and rec board and then the park and rec board will be more true to like what the charter says so like um so i guess like historically only like the park and record before us was doing events but then like the chair of the um the committee that you were on before caroline he said that when he was here they had events they had a chili cook offer they had so i mean in the past they have had some events it may not have been a park and rec board thing that may have been a city thing but like he said that they did they have done things in the past because he said they got a beer and wine license and made a ton of money on the beer and wine so you know it was back before that was back when it was uh strong mayor before they swish yeah yes so you know like maybe we kind of work it where like the foundation takes like the majority of the events and they could be turned into fundraisers to do something good for the city but to your point like maybe if the ticket sales go well maybe we can do one event park and rec board every spring where we sell tickets and do something and just do that one thing um because we will have a budget and we you know we'll want to do something good for the city that's like um that's fun and entertaining or you know like where you can meet new people i've met a ton of new people at our events so um it's good i think you know the people and as the word gets out and we do more and more it's like we've only been doing this for like a little over a year and a half so it's i can't tell you there's some guy on next door neighbor app every time it would come up he would be like bellar beach has a park and rec board and he put a same guy every time i was like yes but i never said anything but i was like why does the same guy keep asking a question like it was so shocking because i guess that because we're small and yeah whatever but um so it's like hopefully more people are finding out that we are here and we are trying to do something good and we constantly are saying if you have any suggestions if you have any requests if likes you know if you want to you know substitute the you know this for that or you know like anything that we could add we're constantly throwing that out there whenever we get a voice so hopefully people are kind of hearing the you know hey um they'll listen to me and we'll do what we can so you were talking about the foundation versus the parking rack somebody i talked to when i met all the people with lloyd doing all this thing mentioned the parking rick is totally different than it was when she was on parking record her husband was on parking rec or something but the park and rec used to be like more beautification stuff not parties in her terms yeah you know so when did that change and is that what you were implying where a foundation would take more of the party stuff over and park and rec would do more i don't know she said they were very closely tied with the um community garden club okay yeah so when we started the garden club was non-existent and the way it was described to me when lynn sat me down and said okay you as chair decide if you want to meet once a week once a month twice a year like you you kind of like figure out what you want to do with your park and record here's the charter here's the book here's what it says so like so for beautification i don't know if you've got this but so we do do park and or we do beach and park surveys of the 13 areas and then we you know like we say the good bad and the ugly and so yeah we're not buying bushes with our budget to beautify the parks we're not but so that's what we're kind of hoping that as a fundraising um group the foundation will be able to say because like if you look at there's a park on hibiscus it's beautiful i mean it's like the nicest park but they all have placards on the benches and it's they're all donations so that's what we're hoping to do with the um you know the foundation as far as us throwing social events or parties you know i a halloween costume for the kids and the dogs i don't really i mean i consider that like a family fun kind of wholesome event so like as far as a social thing we do too and moving forward we won't even be doing that because it'll move over we might do one like i just mentioned if we vote on it like we don't have to we could do whatever but our budget is such that like we don't i mean you know if we can do an event for anywhere from 250 to 800 dollars we're not we can buy a palm tree with that like yeah and that only a very big one and it doesn't even pay to have it installed so as far as beautification like that is our version of beautification of beautification yeah so we are making sure that our eyes are on the parks the beach accesses the marina um so that's kind of like what we're doing and then kyle updates that like once a month or once every other month and brings it back to us saying okay this was your suggestions this is what's been done this is you know what we're still working on or whatever and they do it as they can do it it's kind of how we've been doing it yeah last two years three years four years i guess we've as board had been more inclined to do recreation part of parks and recreation yeah prior to that we were more focused on the parks themselves what did you do like what was the very little oh well thank you for not making me feel bad george we did very little back before we got into the recreation part of it yeah and the parks part of it was if there was some issue like a path or something that needed to be updated or there's potential for problems there we just make recommendations to the city council kind of like what we're doing exactly okay so we're doing both i mean in my mind we were covering we were checking all the boxes but i think i was at that event i i think it was because i was standing there when she said it yeah and i wasn't i was like i mean i don't think she was being snarky i just i think you know she was just saying how it used to be yeah i didn't i didn't take it like she was being like you know upset that we were having of social events i didn't take no it did sound like she felt to me that she wish we did less of that and more of the other the garden cup she referred to the garden club multiple times well the garden club was a non-for-profit like a 501c3 so like as soon as we get the foundation up and going she'll get more of what she's looking for we just don't have the means to do that at this point because there is no 501c3 in bellar beach right now there have been two in the past and they're both defunct is that a word and we also do like like what he was saying all at one shot whereas it seems like with the wave time i was like piecemealed like as a problem comes up as we're doing it like what do we do that like once a quarter yeah like so you kind of like take all the parks and squish everything together to like just do it one time whereas then it's like when a problem comes up then they say it but we're always like monitoring and we always say too like if so there's a problem in a park we always like bring it up like oh we notice that people are sleeping on the bench or whatever like yeah we just crawled kyle immediately with the issues sleeping on the bed yeah or doing other things on the bench yeah but yeah it's kind of undercover i guess we don't like if we don't put it out there yeah like oh yeah we go out once a quarter and we take photos and we report on and we have a spreadsheet but if they did ever come to us and say like what are you actually doing with your time on the board like here you go here's all the pictures well i did ask kyle to post that on our web page like that like that attachment um i don't know if he's going to do it but i did request it because then he'll be watching right there and you'll really be watched people call you like did you just wear them yet these parks and rec board was run at different times well because it's up to the chair to do whatever they however they want to run it again soon coming into the factory network we only met like three times a year that's the minimum three times a year i think yeah i think that's what it was yeah like you know it was very it wasn't nearly as formal as this okay cool that's awesome well good bad or indifferent like you know again everybody has the same voting power on this board and anybody can say hey how about you know we're constantly in our discussions going okay ideas for this ideas for that are like maybe next month what do you guys think about this and we we talk it all out and then we decide as a group what we can do and what we can do well because at the beginning we said we're new and we're not going to bite off more than we can chew we're not going to promise we're going to do all these fundraisers and all this big stuff because you don't know you know what i mean like i just don't make promises that i don't know if i can keep and so we said we're going to start small and try to build and make sure that we can do it the right way and which is kind of what we've done um and we haven't bitten off more because i think if we have too much to do where everybody's so busy and because this is a volunteer position we're like then it's just like oh my god i can't do this this is too much and then we don't have anybody to do it so it's kind of like we got to make that balance to say you know we're going to do these things and we have enough coverage and nobody feels like they're being not taken advantage of but you know i mean like being asked to do too much for a position like this so it's kind of how we've looked at it um but yeah we do do that but she wouldn't know that because we don't up until this very last meeting unless you go on and listen to on you know your youtube you listen to this recording you don't know what we talk about because most of the time i think until this very last one i may have mentioned it but i mention a lot of things and even like somebody on council at beach cleanup was like because this last time i used one of our beller beach towels for my tablecloth instead of a plain white one and he's like where did you get that did you have that made i'm like we've been selling him i say it in every meeting but like you know people don't hear everything you know it's not like they're taking notes or re-listening so it's like they miss it or whatever maybe we should show up the board meetings with our t-shirts on i i did do that for the first couple and then i started dressing up at www dot com right yeah see laura for tank talk show the hat over the t-shirt and bring a beach towel oh it's so funny yeah no it's i just i asked the original question was because i feel like the reach in the facebook group is like great but it's like hit its max because like you're saying oh two other couples like well they wouldn't know about between because they're not in the group and then if they don't check the website but like that one time we posted the apparel in the group and it went bonkers like it went bananas so it's kind of like trying to build that what do you mean there's a like facebook bellar beach community private group like that you have to like get accepted to because they do check if you are resident stuff and then that's where we post i you know i don't know i only got on it recently because i mean i don't um we were just doing next door neighbor app and then i you know i'm not on facebook my dog is so i don't check that yeah i know she's gonna get into that group on facebook and i'm a resident but they check they do check yeah and they'll ask do you know this person like have you no jokes yeah no seriously i swear it's like tight-knit like you got to be the best of the best it's just but like people do get to know like they do see like the stuff that like gets posted or they'll be like i'm going to beach green i'm like great because the next door we don't know where like it's going out in the universe somewhere i don't know and it is mostly the group that does like the flags like it's that core group and i wanted to help them this year when i found out late so i would like to be part of the group you helped me you actually she called me but okay yeah if you have a link tammy i'd love to or whoever has them yeah she's our social media yeah so i will apply stanley has the link yeah so that was the only reason i asked about the foundation because i figured if it's not like directly tied to the city then maybe they can have their own group we can we will people on our website right and we have we'll have our own website um we're i mean we're just so in the beginning phases we haven't started putting any of that stuff together because we don't have anything to put on it but when we do we will and then we'll try to get i mean obviously like um members but then just trying to just get as many people as we can to know about it yeah okay so yeah we will definitely with the foundation have to work with the city because everything still has to be approved and like not approved like you're going to have it in our parks yeah yeah yeah like we have to say hey is it okay if like so-and-so donates this bench or this bush can we you know have it put there or whatever like they have to know that stuff coordinate it yes oh that's fine and then like kyle like has a um like vendors that they've used that are they know are good that um so with pricing so we have our list of things that people can say oh yeah i think we've talked about this i want to buy a dog poo stand like bag stand or a bench or we had like a list of 10 things at a certain point but all the prices have gone up yeah so he's got a you know we got to redo that sheet but i mean foundation doesn't need it yet so he's he's already got people that know that know the city that work with the city that you know so he already has those contacts so that's good um okay so item number six so you should have in your packet now obviously this isn't until january but like last year um i didn't even know or like ever heard of and if i mentioned this before um it's a repeat but the mole patrol like that would have been a great thing to have in our parking lot for the health and wellness fair was like a dermatologist where they check your skin like on site but um i never heard of it and then when someone mentioned it i called right away but it was too late so like i'm calling them early like i'm calling them right now but i just wanted you guys to have eyes on the list of vendors that we had or healthcare providers that we had last year so some of them will be taken off some of them were most excellent and will definitely request that they come back some of like last year i called and called and called and we called and called and called and never got a dermatologist to commit and our physical therapist canceled at the last minute so there are certain categories that we were missing there are certain categories that we will take off like say if we had x category and no one went to that table and they just sat there like this for four hours we probably like it wasn't probably a good fit um but like say for example we got the lady from um palms of largo for parkinson's and most excellent like she was so excited to be here and her son tested positive for cover the day before and she had to pull out yeah so like people like that i'll definitely call back but like i wanted you guys to have eyes on this list if you have any thoughts i would love to i mentioned it in the meeting council meeting i would love to get like you know we have dr quick he's a bellar beach resident i would like you know but his office is across the bridge i would love to get more beller beach their practice may not be here obviously but they live here but i just don't know how to find them so i'm just going to keep saying it to everyone that i talk to um or that was going to be my question you don't need to live in bel air or be close because i i know you've heard of the wellness way it's a chiropractor but it's a lack of like coast dental this is a franchise type thing wellness way is a type it's a franchise but um it's a young couple that's a friend of my daughters but there i think they're all starkey see like the chiropractor that we had last year like they were great and i made an appointment it took me 45 minutes to get there so just based on where they're located they will not be well they're in clear water but they couldn't be any further like they're all pretty big it is pretty big so they're on the uh almost to um dunedin like they were so far i think they were like on the line so i mean i had no idea it was mostly traffic mind you but like i went once and i'm like you're too far i'm not these people are like i said right on starkey okay go down east bay west bay and take a right on starkids half mile down okay um but they it's not just counter practice because that's what that franchise wellness weights like whole body you know and how things are connected yeah that's great yeah so like i i wrote them down and if you have their contact information yeah not with me yeah no no rush but um or if you guys know anybody your neighbor you know your neighbor's friend um somebody that you use like personally that you know is great like you know eye doctor we didn't have one of those yeah we didn't we never got an eye doctor you might know a good one really it's hard to find local i call probably three different ones it's like some people are great because they have a whole department that does stuff like this but if they don't they have to do it themselves and they weren't getting back and it was oh well we still haven't started to do anything after covid so i'm kind of hoping that that it's going to be a little easier this year but yeah so if you if you know someone if you see a category that we missed if you know you have a neighbor that might might replace one of these like because we'd like to support our bellar beach residents so we can maybe do some trade-ins and outs but i just want to give like a high top just because i'm gonna call the mole patrol now so hopefully we can get on their their schedule early i'm sorry um does anybody have any questions about anything are they compensated in any way no they volunteer and so actually um that brings up a good point because last year like okay so one of the vendors on here did an event in tampa they pay 300 so what we're going we didn't because almost everybody on here who has that does a lot of these events says well how much is it i'm like nothing you're volunteering four hours of your time on a saturday and you're giving things away like or you're doing free services like the stretch therapist and the massage therapist could have been here for six more hours like their tables were never empty like the whole time so but what we're thinking about doing this time is charging 25 and then what that will pay for is we're gonna um just buy bags white plain white bags and then we're gonna have bellar beach stickers made to put on the bag because as people were walking around and gathering all these samples um i swear everybody gave away like um hand sanitizer with their logo on it you know cookies um you know paperwork gummies like whatever they were passing out like people were christmas cards you need some place to put it yeah so we're gonna do bag so it'll cover that and then last year we had um beller coffee was here which that was great and then in the um kitchen um we had snacks for the vendors but i paid for that so it's like this year we'll have the 25 cover because i just you know they're there for four hours so it's like i wanted them it's like there's yogurt and mixed nuts i wanted them to have something if they were like oh my god i'm starving because there's really not a lunch break and it's from ten to two so um you know simple math but like it'll more than cover if we just do 25 bucks a person through four um it's a good question should we lower it to three that'd be my suggestion about that i'd like to hear about input yeah that i was trying to look for what we discussed about that but yeah well last year because the weather was like freezing and like there wasn't a single person walking over the bridge and it was like people coming in were like icebergs it was pouring down rain and it's like i feel like we had like half the people that we should have because no one wanted to leave their house over there is it outside no no it's in the okay in the meeting room we set up the table i mean we provide the tables but i asked them to bring tablecloths and then all their giveaways and i would say 90 of them did an excellent job like their tables were full we had the produce market like surfside produce market and she brought all kinds of like little fruit cups and like unique fruits and vegetables to sample that people may not be familiar with so like most everyone did an excellent job with um decorating if for lack of a better word but i don't know so we can cut it to three hours and then just do you think ten to one or eleven to two probably ten to one i don't know what do you guys think i didn't see anything wrong with the ten to two so yeah i think the ten to two is fine too because it gives people time if you're a late riser early riser exactly i like attempted to wha what would we gain by cutting back an hour well this is a thing last year because it was slow people in there started packing up and leaving so the people that did walk in at 1 30 were like i thought this went till two so one of the stipulations for these people this year is one it costs 25 and you can't leave and if you have to leave you can't leave seriously you can't you're going to approve the request you're dedicated to the time frame and if you can't do it even if it's slow because like it looked bad for the people and for the vendors that did stay and invited people they were like i thought it went till two and my friends came in and they were like i'm like yeah well i didn't tell those people they could leave me you know now that they asked me for my like permission twenty-five dollars it's only twenty-five dollars but people there's skin in the game there's money in the game i'm gonna stay right i don't care if it's twenty-five or three hundred i think and we always just draw it was very selective to get in that year that they wouldn't be favored to get in next year if they leave early yeah you know and that was going to be my question is there an optimal number because there's 23 on this list now like are we limited to 30 vendors 25 vendors room in the room for the tables in the room this is it like we were crowded with this many tables you can only have up to 23. spatially yeah look at what our final arrangement logistically who needed electricity who needed i mean there were all kinds of and then like i was watching the camera the table's [Music] it was chaos that was yeah because we came the night the day before and it was just like we were trying to figure out a plan like how to squash like everyone in there and it was like no it was good i mean i didn't move a couple tables around with no one knowing it we're just like let's go we're gonna move this hurry up four feet no one even noticed i know so he's literally in the back because we handed out maps and so it would say this is this is who's at table one this is who's at table two and then on the other side it had something else again with their information oh listen to what their contact information was so they had everything on one piece of paper if they wanted to go back and you know use one of these people for future so like we didn't print out a whole kyle's like oh my god i have to make another map i have to make another map you kept like changing everybody around yeah so we'll have to look at the like who we get and who's the final but like some people needed an eight-foot table some people needed a six-foot table some people needed electricity some people didn't some people needed more space than others so it ended up being fine it was just like made it work we made it work and it was i i don't think anybody out there realized that it was a little like you know lots of moving parts we'll say it was that lots of moving parts so yeah that's why we have 23 because literally that's um the spatial for the number of six foot tables and the number of eight foot tables that we have how many we could fit and with people still able to walk through and like if say if there's like three or four people waiting for the same table or like bay care got a line because they were doing the health you know the blood pressure and the glucose and all that stuff so it depended on what you were doing whether there was a line or not january right january 14th january 14th anyway you could use the back porch for some people if it's not freezing we would have to wait for the day and then we try to get the maps done in advance so it's not a bad idea um actually like the yoga instructors were going to go outside and do that but it was freezing that day so they didn't go outside it was freezing it was like 40. it was florida freezing raining it wasn't chicago freezing yeah it was florida freezing um but maybe there's something we can do out in the hallway i don't know i guess we'll have to look at it and see based off of what we did last year well last year say like so bellar coffee and the welcome table were in the entryway so and we had the blood mobile on the welcome table which that won't happen again because it was she had too much stuff to give away and then people were asking questions and she was wandering the room so it was like we won't have anybody on our table it'll be separate um is the bloodmobile out here that day it was okay yeah last year it was so yeah we'll definitely ask them again to be there and they can have a table if they want to work a table it just can't be on our table because we were giving away like face masks and um what else did yeah right yeah we had hand sanitizers and maps but we're also getting people for the email list and we were getting people for the constant contact uh and we had our suggestion box look so we had a full table so we didn't need like to share our space yeah so like that that should have been in the room with or maybe they have their own one right now psychos outside yeah not outside outside but in the entryway too yeah that way they wouldn't take up one of the 23. yes exactly that's a good point um i think the reason why we did it last year is because she wouldn't commit to standing at her table and i said well if you're not going to stand at your table you can't have a table and then that's how she ended up on our table so it's going to be one of those things where if she she was at our table and she didn't stay there she didn't stay there but we were giving all her stuff away yeah it was crazy yeah so if like if that's why how it ended up like that so it's if she just wants to leave her table and it's a free-for-all take whatever you want that's another story but like when there are people asking questions about things like she somebody needs to be available at the table or i guess they could go out but like they were only still letting two people on the bus at the time so it's like if you had a question you really couldn't get on the bus to ask unless you were waiting if that makes sense this might be a little off but yeah i was talking t-shirts a minute ago um i know you have tank tops and then regular t-shirts right have you ever thought about doing the um sun protective shirts the long sleeve whatever that material is for the svf yeah those are great um we've thought of doing lots of things but it's like um kyle prices stuff out for us and he doesn't want to get he does how do you explain it he doesn't want to get too many things at one time so we can try especially with an event coming up because there are more people at the events because the office is open from what nine to four so if you work a daytime job in a place it's hard to get in here um so like right now we're having like hand towels made like for your guest bathroom or whatever that was a request from a resident and so those are at being made as we speak they should be ready anytime but like once those are sold then we can try a new thing so but we can't have all of it at the same time we've got to flip stuff in and out because it's too much we don't want to have too much inventory tied up and too many selections and like you know we can't have too many colors of you know it's like we can't have three colors of t-shirts and three colors of tank tops or designs it's too much to like deal with so yeah those would be a great idea um there's a couple other things that we've looked at like someone had asked for uh no one has one today i usually bring on every meeting you know like the yetis um like those like with bellar beach on it or um i don't know if you've seen i brought one in to show kyle it's about this big and there's a zipper so it would be white and it would have the beller beach patch on the front of it and then you unzip it and it's it's a beach bag or a tote bag for like the farmer's market or something those are real cute and we could sell those for 20 bucks so there's lots of options but we just have to like pick and choose and think okay what are people going to like christmas those tourist tumblers too is that a yeti um well they're like more simple they're like the plastic you know the turbos oh i don't know what tervis means okay how about you buy the cup we'll buy the sticker yeah they're not like the they're not like super duper cool insulated thing they're like like they all are travel cups yes yes they're like you'd know it if you saw it i know what you're talking about i just didn't know the name of it do you have to leave i have okay well safe travels okay thank you next time um the dates is there anything urgent on the agenda just okay i will probably do either one of those things okay great okay thank you bye take care thank you okay um but maybe that's something you can do so i'm going to assume that your vote is from 10 to 2 for the health and wellness fair yes okay thanks um because do we need to decide that today no we really don't but if i start calling people they're gonna ask me because you're not trying to put that on the website you're trying to just put the three events well i guess i can tell if i'm calling a couple of people to lock them in early i can either say it's going to be from ten to one to ten to two and we'll let you know because i intend to do is fine i do too so i mean george if you wanna leave it one we'll let you leave i barely made it last time pills i was shaking those things because why are the cookies that you well i didn't take my pills oh you should have said something don't worry we'll let you off that yes so on nicole to bear man we'll drive to your house and get them and come back i kept you entertained last year you were entertaining yeah exactly [Laughter] they're like where's tammy she's getting a massage we were eating those peanut butter things aren't we we were addicted to those ball things like travel around and then we go all the way to the back and like get some eat them send you out on a mission yeah so healthy that they became unhealthy because we ate too many of them oh we were laughing because are you talking about the ones from lindsay and your yeah so like you know rita is like a sugar she's like yeah she loves her so um she went back and got one and she spit it in a napkin and then um so and deb keith told me and so then i went up to rita and i said oh so you like the peanut butter balls in the back she goes oh yeah they were really good and i was like i heard they went in your napkin she was like she told you it was so funny i was like there's not enough sugar in those to appease you like they definitely didn't taste like i liked them but like they definitely didn't taste like a doughnut yeah they were from the like the nutritionist and the the personal trainer and if you see them you would know why that they'd have no sugar in them fit yeah they're so fit yeah no sugar they were no sugar at all yeah good times yeah so it was fun it was funny i mean it wasn't um and i don't think at any point anybody on the board literally felt like oh my god we're gonna pull our hair out it wasn't like that kind of chaotic it was just a lot of moving parts when you have that many people coming in at the same time yeah you should have seen george's hair before that event last year he had a full head right you had as much hair as paddy i think the parking was the debacle that was the biggest about because they didn't know and then they were like we're like you have to go out and around but that was no big deal it was easy a lot of them had a lot of stuff to wheel in and the ramp was only in the front so they had but they had to park in the back to leave the parking lot open so if there's a lot of repeat like there won't be chaos because they know and for the most part we didn't even see the chaos they would just come in and out and figure it out and i think maybe hopefully the weather is nicer so unload right here and then travel around yeah because they get here almost an hour it starts at ten we open at nine so they could get here and set up before everybody got here so they had plenty of time to to do their thing and switch tables on us well so if the um dentist doesn't want to come back i know a really good dentist okay i'll ask i will ask dr quick and she's a holistic and other one anyways she does um other stuff like acupuncture um vampire facials you know what those are okay well aesthetics there we go holistic and aesthetic dentistry okay so and it's a holistic means whole body again sure so yeah so the one thing that we do oh they draw your blood and they put it in a spinner like they used to do in the when you're doing giving blood down plasma let's see if you not have enough iron but then it also separates the um the red from the yellow fatty whatever it's called and um and then they take a little machine that pokes little holes in you and then they rub your blood on back into you so you get in your own yes that's a thing george did you see george's face no my friend has it done they they inject it back in her knees yes they do it right all over but that's the vampire facial my daughter never called it that is there another name for it uh there's got to be a prf um prf i think is it like plasma reef yeah yeah we didn't have that last year so that would be i mean i don't know but the holistic thing is really all about whole health with your mouth because your mouth affects everything yes yourself well this is a thing so like what we did oh that's okay what we did well what we did promise people was that there would be no duplicates but like say if like for if the personal trainer was a guy i said there won't be another male personal trainer there might be a female though so like we didn't have a holistic dentist that does all of that so it's like dr quick could be there and then she could you know what i mean focus on her other things but then if you want to go to her for you know dentistry you can do that too so certain things like if we're trying to fill spots and if it actually fills a need of what we have like that we were missing or whatever we can do that but we try to just say you're you know you're the only one because that's a perk to them right because they're not competing in the room and we have more variety for the residents but yeah that's good does anybody have anything else about this he's laughing all right i'm still trying to envision yes i know i'm with you there's a lot of you get her signature signature we're signing the letters today oh i'm not i i just finished number six no i was just i just thought of that oh she didn't sign that oh it's okay yeah i mean do you want to wait another month just text her or something yeah she could stop by here it's not like well she's getting on no she's getting on a plane oh like maybe next week she can sign them okay oh yeah i don't know how long she's gonna wait on her ask her if she wants to come back i'll just ask her okay yeah and if she says no then yeah yeah yeah that's fine but we can sign them all right now so does anybody have any other questions so yeah it is january 14th we do already have the date because you know post covid like we had to book our dates because we won't get the room so we needed to book it in advance and then it enables to the people that need more notice we can say this is a date this is the time blah blah um i don't think a a lot of a lot of them would be like you're calling me in july for january but some of them definitely need it because they're that booked out um so anything else for that like i would like to say it's gonna run smoothly this year but i just think when you have that many moving parts you're just gonna be moving stuff like people are gonna it might be a little easier this year huh yeah we'll plan on things we're gonna move around yeah but we'll start with what kind of what we had yeah and tweak it from there because you know you had a pretty good plan going in as far as electricity spacing i had a list of questions that i like answered everybody before um like what they and i had like i took tons of but you couldn't really envision after you got in there and saw it and then they are you are they in three rows or rows yeah and some of them like the massage people stretch people needed to be up against a wall because they had a table so like logistically there were all kinds of different like like some people had banners the size of that wall like so they needed to be on a wall in the back you know they were some people asked to bring tvs in so they could show their movie videos of their what they do that ended up not happening but not to say that it won't be asked for this year so we did a pretty good job accommodating what everybody and then we had two people cancel last minute and we didn't want tables to look empty so we moved those tables out so and we just took the numbers away because we had those you know like if you're at a wedding and you're at table 10 so that's like on our map it said it you know there was a 10 on the table and then we just moved those around and something was off of the number and had to make some numbers quick was it upside down like a six-handed yeah that's something that's strange there was something weird yeah i think maybe it was like that everyone was not saying i don't know and so i don't know i just remember yeah oh good time so whenever we have event we always meet meet here the friday before and we do as much as possible and sometimes we're here an hour and sometimes we're here for two hours and then like things like that how much more we think that means right we put george in charge of the decorations for um jazz and we had all oh my gosh all of us couldn't figure out how to like those little pom poms and the lanterns we were trying to get them something that just popped right open and then others were awful the fluff the pom-poms yeah good times good times so depending on what we have to do and a lot of that stuff we could save and reuse like um there wasn't too much that we had to throw yeah we saved all those yeah we didn't the core stuff we could yeah like boxes so we can pick through them and not have to re-buy things which is great so we had to buy a lot of stuff last year that we won't have to buy this year because like we we figured out what we needed and we don't have to rebuy it um but i think that's it i just wanted to bring up a couple of things just because i'm going to start banging on i've already got i think two people that are committed that said that you need help making phone calls or do you like to do it because you got your little system down no this is a thing like it's so hard with the park and rec board because of the sunshine laws so and we only meet once a month so unless i put it on kyle or patty which i don't want to do like like say last year nicole like i beat on bellar coffees i called them i emailed them oh no i emailed i called him and i went in there no luck no luck she's in there all the time she closed that one but she can't let me know because we're not allowed to talk so it's like what couldn't happen was like i assign you five and i don't find out for a month that they either can't do it or they need to be replaced or blah blah blah so it's pretty much i just like i would say if you would say hey i know a wellness um chiropractor then i would put you in charge of that and then you would text the email to kyle but as far as like splitting it out all these people are on my computer all i have to do is go dink dink dink and i already have the letter made and i just put the attachment and um all that good stuff so it i will need help for sure but because we can't talk and we can't update each other it makes it it actually makes it harder if i divide the list out as opposed to and unless you know for sure and you know them then i'll be like absolutely because they're going to answer your phone calls they're not going to answer mine and they're more likely to say yes to you so for sure um it'll be something that looks like that okay so and jules chandler just sent me an email with like four suggestions and she gave a couple suggestions for last year too and they worked out well and um so i'm going to look at those and maybe add them to the list but i want to wait until next month when we come back and say you know with our suggestions like additional categories or you know like if you have other people that you or like say you call your person and they're out of town that day or they're already committed because that could be for any one of these people they're traveling they're not available and we have to substitute it out so i'll definitely need help i just don't know exactly what help i need yet if that makes sense um okay oh there were some important ones that we didn't have so yeah we definitely missed some good categories some cutting yeah yeah and there's some yeah there's some that we don't need again i don't think that and then like i know that they wanted to be separated but anyone that is part of our like recreational things here i feel like they should share a table yeah and i think that their table should be like in the back and if it is nice out and they want to do because like they i'm pretty sure they both wanted to be outside but like it was raining they couldn't be out there so maybe we can have them like to get you know what i'm saying just so it's like we get the good people that we really missed out on last year like eye doctor dermatologists well we didn't miss out on them because they wanted their own table we missed out on them because we couldn't find anybody to yet because we originally i think we had 25 tables or 26 but like the corner tables were weird and no one really got back to them and then um yeah so i think those two could definitely share a table like they need to understand that if they sell things they're not allowed to sell them here and like i think that's why jessica wanted her own table because she was selling things which she had to take them back out to her car so and then tara had nothing on her table so she didn't really need a table so they could have definitely shared a table um what are we talking about stand up paddle board and the um the yoga instructor that we have here yeah we wanted them to be here so people meet like who they could go you know if they wanted more information about the classes that are offered through here um what was the stand-up paddleboard selling t-shirts like those shirts that you're talking about like with her logo on them and then some kind of health supplements yeah something something that's really yeah i was like no you can't sell anything here um and she didn't tell me and i being the stand-up paddleboard person i didn't even know i didn't even know she had anything to sell so i didn't even mention to her you can't sell anything um like they can give coupons and discounts and raffles like they were really good about all that stuff they just can't collect any money from anybody yeah yeah definitely like we did miss some pretty big categories but not by choice it was just like like we probably don't need a travel agent that's what i was everyone was saying i think that was it was a request they called us we didn't call them and i already have like um this certified health coach she called me right after and requested to be here like she heard from someone else on this list that you know um so that's how that happened so anyway yeah okay cool so so yeah hopefully we get some of the the biggies covered and we make some slight adjustments and go from there but we have time we start early um okay so item number if everyone's okay okay um item number seven so um thank you letters to our volunteers so um we are we just did a quick little thank you letter and we're all gonna sign it and then we're gonna send these chick-fil-a gift cards like if it's to two people six people one person they get like it's one gift card per person so kyle got us another stack of gift cards and then i brought in the ones that i had originally so we're gonna sign them and stuff them and kyle's gonna mail it you know we need those little you know like how you get your new credit cards and they got those little sticky things on the back do you have any of that oh no can we get some can you get that stuff maybe we should scotch tape it

that slime that i use did you get do exactly 40 on here same total i think it was 36 no it wasn't 40. okay so here oh here's the list no way i know i yeah trifold or i can try fold them as they come back down how many are we signing uh well there's a lot of couples so it's not that many i think it was like 14 maybe oh not bad at all not bad i thought we were telling like 50. [Music] um so should i sign here and everybody else sign down there because it's kind of like i don't know spaced weird it's not like anyone's going to be able to read yeah i'm sorry wait i'm signing

you can't even give it thanks you know what i'm saying he's like because we'll probably do that again in like september october just so and then we just split the parks and and we try to do different ones than the ones we did before so i i everybody gets to everywhere with parkinson's all i have to do is move the paper around hey see those are perks [Laughter] you're signing two aren't you kyle i'm not gonna decide you should sign you do a lot with this um yeah because if i'll keep them then we'll step on me but i could put the cards in just the one for the um uh nolan reena they get six

because then she would have signed it and they're like oh i didn't even know they had names on it yeah they're personal [Applause] i started to ask something about uh you know we cleaned up on what the third second was cleanup day and then fourth was on monday third yeah we cleaned up on saturday the third fourth fifth no second third yes yes yeah it was not pretty on tuesday i'm sure it wasn't i'm sure it was awful yeah maybe the night before next year with some kind of sign out please clean up your own or something well you know we thought the thing is we finally are get i mean it's like we've had as many as two people like so we're finally established on the first saturday so i kind of didn't want to change it because of the holidays oh no not change it but just signs for the people who are going to shoot off fireworks clean up their own mess because they do not yeah they never did well that's why indian rock speech outlawed them because they brought in trucks to pick up all the garbage i can see that because i picked up and i spent two hours and i didn't do half orange ignored see that's just ridiculous either they're not yeah they're not legal but yeah people don't one lady

the week that you babysit that you're not monday wednesday monday wednesday okay so you're not available on wednesday and neither is deb de cosimo so we're gonna probably if it's okay with everyone that fits in their schedule try to move the meeting to a thursday is that okay with you nicole george what about you sounds okay can you check your schedule his social calendar he's very busy he is very busy do we have any other business stuff i don't know oh yeah number eight does anybody have anyone anything else they want to talk about or any suggestions any questions any other business i actually have other business i just remembered and it does concern the park and rec board um so uh was it yesterday no on monday because i called so on the fourth of july we are going out um whatever on the boat and we see this boat that looks like it's ready to be retired being towed pretty much right in front of our house and dumped and um so it doesn't run obviously it got towed and no one's on it it's not being used for recreational purposes and it's literally just a big hunk in the middle of like the water so i sent the pictures to kyle and i think because that body of water belongs to the city of bellar beach for park for recreational purposes it was donated from the state of florida and it obviously like we've had boats back their sink because people left them and unattended we've had boats that have become unmoored and crashed into someone's dock in a storm and basically like they're turning it into a boat graveyard because they either can't find parking or they don't want to pay for parking and they have nothing to do with their boats so like i took the pictures and i really do think it whether you live on the water or not if you use the water because people that are back there like skiing or tubing or whatever in the low tide there's a big huge section that turns into a football field and so the and then on the one side of it that's the channel and then people's houses so they can't park in the channel they can't park in the football field because their boat will go like that so they're right outside in the deep water but like when people are tubing and um doing all that stuff skiing and it's low tide that's the only place they can go to because they can't take their boats over like the low area either so it's pretty much like someone parking their car in the middle of a parking lot like haphazardly and like people are trying to go around it um so kyle said i got an update on that so kyle said he was gonna like send it out to someone because my understanding is like on the other end of bellar beach they've had something similar do you need to go uh george no oh okay oh right my phone back at night okay um they've had um some success getting the dumped boats removed i mean it's one thing so madeira beach had a similar issue and in their city ordinances because it was in city water they said you can park your boat there but for no more than three days then you've got to move it so it's like we don't have to reinvent the wheel like other cities on this beach have had the same problem and if they owned the water area like we do in bellary beach they were able to work it into their codes we're like yeah you can park your bar your boat here but you have to move it every three days well if the boat doesn't run because it's dead then it's they killed it then they can't i don't know so the marine unit um responded and they said that the boat should be moved next week we have been in communication with the owner and he is in the process of making repairs the boat's not gone by monday we'll initiate a case okay so because like right now there's four boats on our side and none of them have been moved in eight months except for this one who got towed but he was originally closer to the bridge and got towed closer to us but he was already there but just like not right in like you know i mean um so i don't know if you go over the causeway and you're on the beller bluff side not the harbor bluff side they've got like 10 boats there now and people are actually living on the boats and they dump their raw sewage into the water and it it comes up under people's docks because yeah yeah and there's some big dogs that have been here a long time that live in those houses and they have tried literally everything but harbor bowler bluffs may not like meaning like lawyer people that have like put things together yeah and there's like nothing but the difference may be because there's a lot of maritime laws that allow them to park it in the like it's not considered like a parking lot but bellar bluffs probably doesn't own that water that's the difference because if you look into madeira beach they were able to i thought they created like a mooring field i don't know oh what they did like they created like a mooring field where they charged oh well if they're paying for it that's you know like yeah yeah i mean that's one thing because they're gonna hurt they're like beautifully placed but they are very close to those people's dot and then like there was a big boat there and then that boat moved to the other side where it's literally like it's so low tide when it gets low tied there it's like it goes like that and like it dumps to its side yeah yeah well that's another thing if their city knows about it and is charging for it then i can see them not being able to do it because it's kind of like how our city charges at the marina i don't know about oh madeira was able to move the boats out though they said three days and you gotta move it like you can move it to another spot but you can't literally park it right there and abandon it which is what's happened what's the definition of moving into like 50 feet i they didn't say they just said they have to move it like musical chairs so basically what it does it keeps them from dumping boats that don't work and just leave it right well the thing is we can always contact the marine or the sheriff and they'll check to see if that boat is is derelict and then they can have it totaled away okay um but anything that's like that they could take care of okay it's just the hard thing is getting them to not do it because even like what our ordinance is gotta uh i think it's 24 hours or 48 hours but there's something in there but the trick is enforcing it that's that's the hard thing well like who do you call the marine unit like who you just called yeah but they don't have the resources to enforce our yeah apartments out there well can you get yourself a boat kyle yeah can you um is there a fine because my little kayak goes right across that waterway pretty easy and i have no problem like putting a ticket on their boat kayak out every day hell yeah doesn't have to be every day but i mean i could do it once a week seriously because like if they see that they're getting stacks of tickets that they have to pay a fine if they don't move their boat i mean that is like not a big deal like it would be more you'd have to give them a notice it would be a process a warning first yeah right just like again that to me that falls into the spectrum of the park and rec board trying because like i said when the one boat sank and obviously like when a boat sinks and all the gas and all the crap goes into the water then they have to do it took them like what it took them a solid month to get that boat towed out of there i don't know well the sheriff has gone out and identified that the other boats at the time they went out and identified them all where they like they were bored so people were there okay and they talked to him okay so that's the tough ones on our side yeah because i've never seen anybody on those boats ever i don't know we can have them check out how many boats you got over there now four and no one's ever on any of them you've never seen a little dinghy coming they're using it as a parking lot like it's not dare look like the one i sent you pictures of where it's rusted out and the doors are open it's abandoned i can ask them if they got information on the other ones but they probably do it it is people that are there the question is like they live in a board and then like you never see them leave so where are they doing with their their sewage right yeah yeah they're dumping it in the water but again it's not like you can run a dna test i know it's something the council is kind of gonna have randy our new attorney look at it okay they brought it up um they've brought it up to the previous attorney and then i think they brought it up when they did the interviews i mean nothing to do with us but like if those people are using it as a parking lot and they live there why is it any different from the marina if that there's no lifts at the marina if that water belongs to bellar beach why aren't they being charged to park their boat there it's the same difference like if if we it would be tricky to go out there and really collect these to charge you know well you don't go to the marina to collect their money do you you make them pay a year in advance you collect the money one time it's not like a monthly rent where you're knocking on the boat door you would think if you're an agreement then yeah you just put a notice on the boat one time that would be like so that would be kind of like turning it into like like a morning field idea where you'd have to have assigned agreements but how we getting out there it's tricky we have to work out the logistics of yeah it's just a thought if like if you know the city is looking for ways to make money and you're allowing them to park their boats there and they're actually living on their boats and they're not leaving their boats to dump the sewage in an appropriate place i would think that like i and i don't know like citywide how many i just see the four that are parked behind me like how like if it's an issue all the way up and down the it is an issue the inner coast is more more of an issue yeah because the influx of people with boats don't have places to put them exactly oh it's me now it's a what was it a three was it a three-year weight oh yeah some of them were just products but yeah i mean it's worse on the other side but still they shouldn't just be like left especially because the one like there's a few that are like i feel like close to bird island very close yeah they're not far there's no mooring boats in this area or anything like that no i don't know are we allowed to do that i thought you said it was our or well we have to change i i don't know again that's a challenge turning question because i don't we our ordinance actually says there's a time period you can leave a bow in that area so that would have to change i think it's 48 48 hours yeah okay well then all of them are in the same spot just need to take a picture that's time stamped for a month and show that it's there for yeah okay well it's just a thought because again it's just going to get worse and worse and worse because look at what's happened to the other side like i mean it's like i said it's one thing if they're charging for it and making money for their city and that's been a decision that's been voted on by their city council or whatever i don't know what their situation is yeah i don't either it's like six boats nine boats six boats they've had boats in that cove though for ever since i came here they're just now like piling and then if they don't can't find a spot over there because the like the boat ramp is there so if they you know obviously people don't want their boat where it's gonna get hit when people are backing taking their boat out on the ramp there so then now they're moving across the way so there's like this big boat that someone is definitely living on like literally like right on someone's dock like it's like if i was those people i would have like probably moved because it's scary you don't know what these people are yeah i don't live on the water personally but i'm just saying it's kind of yeah but you will in like two months and it's like yeah and it's scary because you're like it's dark and you don't know what these people are and where they came no i get it when we first moved here i would have people like the fishermen and this was when i didn't close the blinds in my windows but like midnight it would be like it would be like if someone took their car and turned it so their headlights were like pointing right in your window right up on my seawall and this is in the middle of the night and i'm like oh well are you doing it like thing out there because there's like it's just like rules like yeah how close someone can come because we get a lot of people from the jet skis and these people are just renting jet skis and they're cruising like right up on people's oh they're doing the tour they're doing the tour the house tour no there's nothing that says they can't do that and that's fine i mean you know same thing with the kayaks but for the most part like if the tide is low they can't come that close because like yeah but you know it's like if they're in the channel and if they don't want to get hit by a boat you know they try to stand on the channel too so it happens but not like it's mostly like saturdays and sundays it's not like you've got like a parade of people like doing the tour every day um but the rentals have gone up a lot too in this area people who got more and more jet ski rental businesses going yeah and there's a lot of people scrolling around yeah well one of them launches right off of bel air um under the causeway you go pick up your jet ski rental there so it's like i wondered where all the jet skis in the cove were coming from and then i found that business i was like that's where they're coming from they're all i feel fueling at the gas station speedway all right see those big trailers oh yeah yeah so i mean it is what it is i mean the water is to be shared but like it's like people do things on the water that they would never do like in front of your house but they do it behind your house it's just weird like i said like shining your headlights in someone's bedroom you just don't do that i mean i guess you do if you're um right if you're doing something like that in a car you get attention a lot quicker yeah it's um well there's more eyes on you in the front of the house and there's like she was saying it's dark and um i don't know anyway so there should be a city ordinance that covers all that stuff yeah it should be yeah bring this account meeting i will but you know so should i just get up there on like citizen comments and have like three minutes i mean it won't be the first it's ever i'm sure but still something the boys well you know what though actually isn't this a park and wreck sit situation can i get up there under the parking rec board and say i don't know if that's at the park i don't know it's not you don't think oh yeah well you said stoner island was our responsibility and like the pictures of the boat i sent you is so close to stoner island and the bird sanctuaries which are park and rec right i gotta check i don't think that is our land i don't know the body of water belongs to beller beach there's submerged lands there's a park so you can see it on the on the map so i don't know and there's actually people who own some of their own submerged land yes well if you get up there's like a citizen and they say oh it's part of park and rack then we'll know bring it back here and then talk about it next meeting no i meant being like um limited to three minutes which i could do it in three minutes because it's not an unheard of it's not there yeah i think nine minutes oh what i would do is i'd bring my whole row of neighbors that are all equally as aggravated with this boat oh like the buoys there you go with the boot yeah well we don't have that many but like if it's getting moved then you know they'll be fine well it should be moving well that was meaning that one but again yes someone's going to move on them so the the tell the ordinance policeman that he can borrow my kayak that would be something of another so i'll give him a life jacket we'll give you a whistle get out there okay well i won't beat a dead horse but i just thought you know this is kind of like maybe it's not park and rack but i just thought you know it's close enough to things that are considered well the more the more noise you make them out of the more attention it's going to draw as far as they were just talking about strategic plan and what the citizens want okay well i'm going to look how close it is because that's where she does the sand up paddle boards and if that boat is too close to where she does the thing oh she sometimes does it it depends on the wind like we've done remember we did on the other side of burdock yeah like if you're it it's kind of like this for me but if you're standing in deb keith's yard it's literally like smack on like straight line to her so like me it's like it's kind of like this yeah i was just saying if it's if it's creating a problem for like her to have her classes out there and we're telling her that she can have a class there but you can't because the vote's in the way that's an excuse to get it out of there yeah no i mean i'm just saying she's paying her insurance and crap to do classes here and if she can't take her students out we'll talk about it okay kyle's done does anybody have anything else number eight other business george no other business nicole nothing patty no ma'am kyle all right so number nine so honestly like we have two two people that aren't available on wednesdays anymore um are you thursday august 18th work to me we can do two o'clock i was just i didn't know schedule-wise i was just throwing so do you want to do two o'clock or three o'clock two
