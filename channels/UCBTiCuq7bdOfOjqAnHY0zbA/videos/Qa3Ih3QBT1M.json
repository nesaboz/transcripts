the halloween pet and pals costume contest so this year it is on a sunday and it's from four to six so um there'll be a costume contest for like the animals hopefully dogs nobody brings their chinchilla and um the kids we had a great time last year we had a really good turnout so hopefully you know the weather will be cooperative as it is our only weather permitting event um if you would we're not going to do the parade this year but if you would like to donate a bag of candy for like our version of a trunk or treat please drop that off at city hall that would be appreciated and if you have um any other questions feel free to call either myself and there'll be more details on the website and then in november for the entire month of november we're going to do a holiday food drive so um non-perishable items and about you know we'll have something in the lobby of city hall leading up to our chili cook-off on november 19th and that is on a saturday from 12 to 2. we do have information sheets over on the table so if you want to grab one it kind of gives you all the information that you need and then the second page is an entry form that you can turn into anybody on the parking record or just drop off with laura at the front desk and i believe that's it we're selling tickets um for one ticket for ten dollars you get your entry fee to taste all the chilies and then you get two drink tickets so we are having beer in line at that event we have our license and insurance and you can also get those from any partner member or you can contact the city oh and last but not least we have our health and wellness fair on january 14th we're moving right along with the participants meeting the wellness participants but i would love to get more people from bellar beach that like say dr quick or clean eats they own businesses outside of bellar beach but reside in bellar beach i just don't know how to contact them i would love to have more people participate in our fair that actually live here um so like just trying to get the word out we do have i think 15 people already signed up and we have room for like 23 health and wellness care providers so we're moving along but we do have some openings and some endings so if any but any of the residents would be interested in actually having a table for their business that would be most welcome so i think that's all i have does anybody have any questions thank you very much okay thank you would any other citizens like to speak yes sir hi folks jeff keith 109 hover drive first off i'd like to thank you guys for doing what you do do a great job you know i'm here every week every month watching and do great so i know most the citizens probably really respect that and what i wanted to ask tonight is the last couple years there's been some talk about the paving of our eastman the back walking eastman and i'd like to just go forward with whatever's happening there that the citizens aren't really too aware of they don't think and i'd like the council to look into it and maybe uh see why we'd want to pave that and then go through the cost so that's all i've done thank you very much would any other citizens like to speak yes sir yeah good evening city of valor beach council um i'm victor vorianick the video guy i am not a resident of the city yet i hope to one day be able to afford such a beautiful house in a beautiful community like this but with inflation i'll have to work harder um i'm here to talk about the video that you guys are discussing um i would just like to i listened in on the last work session that you guys had that i was not in attendance to um and i i see that um there wasn't any direction that the council came up with so i just like to further that discussion and let you guys know what my thoughts are first off i'd like to also address that i did approach mayor gaddis and i addressed him and said hey going forward for this zoom style meeting what do you guys envision as a budget mayor gaddis in turn replied to me and said you've always been fair with us you've been working with us for seven years so just present a budget and we'll go from there so i was a little bit surprised that the budget that i came up with with kyle we hashed it out was a little bit high but um i feel like i did give the opportunity to put some discussion there but um furthermore i'd like to also um address a few things um so you guys are a premier city you guys spend a lot of money on digital signage to look like a great city and in turn i think the media should follow i invite you all to look at other cities such as yourselves on youtube and see the production somehow i feel like the zoom direction that you guys are going into looks like an office meeting or school board meeting and it's a little bit um it's hard to see who's talking hard to see what's happening um and and i don't know if you want to canvas the residents to see what their thoughts are but i do see views on youtube anybody can see those numbers and i'm seeing like five to 15 people watching the zoom meeting versus the production of where people are close up and they're actually on video is in the hundreds of views so but that's obviously i'm speaking for myself so you'd have to ask the citizens what their position is on that but i do think that the views speak for itself um there was also some discussion on my pricing and it was compared to council like i said my pricing is not meant to be as expensive as your town attorney he works a lot more for you guys and if you look at it on a monthly basis it's quite different um the the hourly rate uh again which is negotiable is just based off of other productions that happen um i know when i do a wedding uh the the rates start at about three thousand dollars and go up to ten if i do corporate videos they're much more expensive so you guys are really getting a bargain um so those are just my quick thoughts um it really helps to have a professional production to um for example i get often asked why i have two cameras if something happens i've got redundancy so that um if there's a problem that is taken care of but anyways in closing i'd like to just point out that i've been with you guys my family as a glad contractor for seven years i've never missed a date i love doing this as a job and i hope you guys see the valley and what i'm doing i think i was speaking with kyle and i saw that i didn't raise my rates at all for the past seven years i was actually under the impression when we negotiated i did but i did not so that's my two cents for you guys i just wanted to give you some thoughts but let me know what direction you want to go in and i understand thank you any other citizens all right let's move on to number three which is a presentation from the pinellas county sheriff's office uh beginning with law enforcement monthly report please step up to the podium is your name and uh let's have it good evening mr mayor council members i'm sergeant clinton mcnair with pinellas county sheriff's office let me present to you the july 2022 office report for the first page the only information gathered there was two assaults for the month for july of 2022 the second page is the arrest report there were six people arrested in july of 2022 for a total of nine charges for the third page there were 948 events that required 1065 deputies to respond to those events and for the final page there was one traffic crash in the month of july and there was a total of 222 combination of citations if you have any questions sounds like a very slow mod council some questions sure just briefly so the two assaults were directly with a traffic stop one was another one was one of the deputies on the opposite ship his mind found a couple people under the bridge uh two of which were runway juveniles one of the juveniles came with one of the dead pieces so that was the other development charge okay thank you anyone else thank you sergeant up next code enforcement monthly report good evening mr american council member of staff citizen steve clappy for the record um from the august uh agenda that we've had we've been fairly busy with several things again going after people with building or doing work without permits and licensing the other is also had a couple of complaints about some docks that we're looking into and also again because of the rainy season we've gotten a lot of complaints from overgrown grass and weeds most of those issues have been taken care of sure okay again steve clapper for the record uh had a pretty busy uh month with the in october august we've had a lot of incidents again with contractors licensing not permitting the other side of that we've got a couple of follow-ups and we're doing some docks that need to be repaired i've been in contact with the homeowners to let them know that work needs to be done again because of parts and so forth and getting contractors out here to do the work the other area is because of the rainy season we've got a lot of complaints about overgrown grass weeds into empty lots and we've taken care of most of them but other than that it's all i have for you have them come into the house and do some drywall we're talking non-structural they're just cleaning uh you know dead in the wall do they really need a license i mean that's the home between the homeowner and their insurance company uh if it's a homeowner doing it uh no if it's somebody on the outside they have to be licensed what type of license well it's uh up until july of next year um if they're doing any type of drywall work or painting they have to have a license and again when you're removing drywall or you're doing any type of work the county considers that demo work so you may need a permit for it again it depends on the size of the job that they're doing and what they're doing now what type of license every time i want to be very specific what type of license are you requesting because there's business licenses there's contracting licenses well again it depends on the status of the work i mean um i've had people just replace 300 um feet of drywall and that and by the county code you have to have i'm talking really under that i'm not talking major projects i'm talking about somebody's got a one by one sheet of you know they've banged it in with their door and it's the homeowner doing it no we're having some you know a lot of people here can you know i can do it no problem well fortunately they have to be licensed and they have to be insured just to do a patch job and again that license you're talking a contractor's license with a county yeah there's different licenses for different type of works that they're doing okay um but yeah unfortunately unless they're homesteaded at the property they have to have a licensed contractor worker in the house and the reason for that is is because if that person falls or something happens to them um they can go after the homeowner well yeah but that's between them and their insurance company not the county well that's what we're trying to avoid so my big thing is i don't want to put the homeowner at risk this is you know people who are licensed insured um those are the ones that we're really looking for see what i'm getting at is the homeowner should be empowered to select who they have work on their house and how they do the work i'm not again i'm not talking major construction work i'm talking about that most people don't know how to take spackle and repair a little door they bring in a handyman that has a business license fine they're just taking care of that simple little patch and you're saying that they have to be fully licensed you're going to come out and check on the work just for that path for the doorknob well and again sir i i got to look at what type of work you're doing because again i've had people say well i'm just doing patchwork and next thing you know that they're actually tearing down walls and moving them i mean it all depends on what the work is through the licensing board handymen really don't exist or they are in piles county all right it depends on what type of work they're doing and again there was an issue last month with somebody painting the house well it's a friend of mine that's painting the home is your home said there then is he being paid well i'm not paying them directly but i'm going to take them out of my boat it's compensation you can't do it i mean um so they're telling me if they're homesteaded referring clear here yeah if it's your home your homestead you can do the work but you may require a permit depending on what kind of work you want but you can't have anybody on the outside come in and again that's the ordinance and that falls under chapter 489 okay we'll be looking at that thanks okay um follow up on mr sabal's comments i believe our code actually leads 90 square feet of sheetrock you don't need the license or imperment right because i discussed that last year and i guess that's where i'm a little bit confused i think you're as confused as i am is that yes i am yeah because like you said a door goes in smashes it you and i could do it no problem anytime you want to compare each other but what i'm saying is we need our codes you do a great job i just don't think the citizens should be you know scrutinized as well as i think mr sable was implying or whatever on little little circumstances like that and again it's hello one second can i just suggest this is really something for code for you to go over and it's probably you're doing a great job thank you and we have there we have pcclb which is the licensing board for contractors and all of this work we're talking about those questions are probably better geared towards them so we might want to invite them to a meeting since they've come i've been trying to get them on the phone to get some detailed handouts and i can't get that information but it's it's our code that's the issue not so much the enforcement side correct and that's where uh we need to sit down and look at our code and occasionally things do over rule for whatever reason a good example is uh the county requires so many feet away from your neighbor if you want to install a generator but the lrd's doesn't have that same code so there are some i'm sure that there are some variances some differences between our code and county code and i think what i'm hearing tonight is that there may be concerns that um we may have some rules that give us a little bit of leeway versus what we're following right now but i i want us to get to the bottom of this and have more discussions on it absolutely and we're meeting on the 21st of september and my supervisor sergeant skipper is going to be into that meeting if they would like i can get somebody from the licensing board to sit in on that too so everybody will have you know a great influx of information so you you know i think that that's a great idea and uh and it should certainly be an open and open conversation so because there are many concerned citizens right now they're they're not used to someone doing such a great job of keeping an eye on and again one thing that i do want to express is education over enforcement that's my big thing you know so people understand it so it's not like we're we're picking on people you know it's just it's a protection for them any other questions no all right thank you very much thank you all right we are on to item number four city attorney report city attorney thank you mr mayor uh briefly i i've been in contact with you folks in a general sense on a few on a few matters via email the first would be that the where we left off in our last meeting the candidate for the interim manager position had withdrawn his his candidacy i followed up by providing new correspondence from last week where he found solutions for the disputed issue of the health care coverage for his his spouse and was open to continuing to serve if you'd be willing to approve the agreement on those existing terms in addition to that option i also provided you the beginning of some resources depending on which direction this body ultimately wants to to move but ultimately the council is at the helm of the manager selection process and that's where my involvement stands at this state another matter that we workshopped as recently as august 15th was the fwc or as it's being called fwc voting restricted areas of mexico safety zone however you wish whatever moniker you wish to give it um i've been drafting that ordinance i was on the phone with a representative from fwc as recently as today i'm just trying to get a general sense of their impression of their code and how it has been that how the code is administered uh and i i expect to have a product for you by the end of this week if not at the very beginning of next week i i would recommend ultimately that we should likely have a workshop at some point this month so that we can have an ordinance that is in first reading form uh next month so we can show our good faith effort and good faith attempts to resolve this issue it is my goal though i'm not at that in the driver's seat is my goal to give you a product that we can put this matter to bed in 2022 for lack of a better term if a resolution can be found by majority of the body but my attempts are to draft something that aligns with your general direction and the code as it is administered other than that i continue to be in contact with the manager on a daily basis we joke with one another if a day should go by that we don't talk that something must be wrong but we are in regular contact the one other matter that i do want to make sure you know i have not lost sight of is providing you an estimate relative to the code rewrite including the signed code of vision i should have i hope to have that next week i've just been putting attention on a few other things but that has not fallen off otherwise i'm available for any questions you may have counseled no questions good good i was just wondering if if you have a subtotal from the legal side what you've expended on the city manager search and contracting negotiations i have given my new tenure to the city and the need and that this has thus far been a relatively straightforward process i have thus far put all of my time for that under the retainer depending on how this goes and what my role in that process is i reserve the right to request that that be made a special matter through the interim manager as i've done for the voting restricted area ordinances is that when it's once was on a retainer seconds on a retainer okay at this point we're having multiple workshops it's a special project but the process of the any of my time spent going towards the manager has been fully within the retainer and i think you'll find you'll see that the billing on the retainer far exceeds the retainer in terms of the time spent there thank you thank you very much mr banker uh are you sure you are probably daily contact with our internship manager yes sir would uh have you found any errors in the last four months that he's been with the city manager that he's uh hasn't bail to address properly or whatever because we have a guy that wants the job now that um clearly told us that we don't abide by what his demands were he wasn't going to take it and we have a guy sitting right next to you who i think is fully capable of doing the job but if i'm being misled by you saying that you're talking to him every day which he didn't say anything negative uh what hurdles hasn't he been able to tackle in your opinion pick that ultimately i'm going to leave your hiring process in your capable hands um i have a question with reefer i understand and i'm answering the question but i want to make very clear what my role is and is not because i've in past situations been accused of putting my thumb on the scale of the process and that's not my role you've asked me a targeted question and i'll answer it um i've dealt with mr riesler on a daily basis i will tell you that he is one a professional two kind and respectful three prepared when we speak he's also a human and that means he does make errors he is capable of errors i'm not going to say he's infallible um i'm not aware of any complete halo that surrounds him and all he does so i i will not represent to you that a circumspect review of his performance will not review will not reveal some way that something could have been done better i'm also not an administrator i from a legal standpoint he responds to feedback he calls me with concerns in advance generally speaking and he seeks my counsel and is responsive and where we have a disagreement and i'm not suggesting conflict um just hey here's how i'm seeing it while i'm saying it this way we're able to resolve him he's a professional that i work with and i i have enjoyed that process ultimately whether or not he's the best fit for the goals and vision that you wish to achieve as a council in the direction you wish to move that's a policy maker's decision and i leave that to you sounds all good thank you thank you any other questions from the council hey mr mayor can you hear me yes yeah just a quick question so where do we go with respect of discussing what our options are with the candidate for the city managing position is that something goes to unfinished business that we'll discuss [Music] that's ultimately your decision it is business that remains unfinished about how you wish to structure your meeting or when you wish to discuss it i defer to the body we'll probably leave that to a work session and i i sort of have an idea that there wasn't as much interest as originally thought in this candidate that's my gut i i have nothing to back that up but we'll talk about it in a later date and see what happens okay all right thank you very much mr moore next uh we are to the city manager report interim city manager reefer okay thank you mayor council um first up i have the uh 12th and 13th street bay drive uh bmp seven and eight stormwater project our projected start date for that is now september 26th uh what we're currently waiting on is for utility conflicts uh to be resolved duke energy needs to come in and raise some poles and actually remove one pole to put back at a later date after the project is completed the clearwater gas company needs to dig out a utility line just to explore exploratory gig just to make sure that we're not going to come into conflict with it um some of this stuff is just things that you don't want to get down in the ground pinellas county has approached us and i want to make you aware that they're looking to do a joint project agreement with us so that they can add some fire hydrants and replace some older style pipe water pipe while we're in underneath the road so they were going to put together uh it's going to be a complete reimbursement but you'd have to approve it to to do the work and then pay for it upfront and then have it reimbursed by the county so once that's together i will present it to you the golf ball of our undergrounding project we discussed that in the work session well the last one we did and i did the presentation and i have those two items for the utility consultants and the duke energy agreements on the agenda seawall 7th street 16th street sea wall and 7th street boat ramp project that we were still waiting for the water navigation permit to come through i did speak with one of the supervisors for the permitting department and did get the permit to be accelerated and assigned so she told me that they are understaffed in the process of training new staff so you can't guarantee it's going to be the fastest turnaround but it has been a sign so it is so-called expedited and slow-moving that comes within a couple weeks um the contractor is prepared to start the sea walls on the project so hopefully we move forward this month the 17th 18th street stormwater improvement project which will be the next project on our list um i've put in a request for a proposal for dual associates for the design work so i'd like to see what number comes back from them and then i've discussed with them at this time around that we'd like to not only look at the original design but to really investigate um different options of what what's going to give us the best cost uh benefit um for the project so what would instead of just doing what was in the original design um kind of figuring out what we're going to get the most bang for our buckets um our code enforcement analysis project that was scheduled for the sticks that got bumped back to the 21st and uh in that meeting right now the staff is going to be council member roberts myself uh laura madeline who's the executive assistant and my code enforcement officer steve klapkut um i heard tonight that the i believe he's bringing in the supervisor who's uh wants to kind of get an idea for how they would work and then at the same time we'll try and pull in his own house county licensing board ahead to that meeting um to the lcl project that again is um we have money in the budget for the next um budget year um i plan on trying or putting it out for it in november just to see what the number comes back and make a decision that's all i have questions from the council um we all received an email from a resident on the pond in the back here am i under the impression that that's county property the pond area it is the kind of property that we have an agreement to maintain um the reason for the agreement is if the county was to maintain it at the rate that they maintained the rest of the retention bonds in the county it wouldn't be up to our standards so we've kind of taken it on ourselves so can we get like a schedule like every two three weeks to go out there and just clean that up for their regimen we're gonna adjust the schedule to get out there more often and thank you thank you other council members all right thank you very much mr weaver all right number six city click report howdy thank you mine is just updates um nothing new we have that board of adjustment hearing for the variance from the pool height and that variance was approved and then the city manager search process that's still you know a pending phase so that's kind of at a standstill we have a contract with the supervisor of elections to hold their primaries here so we're a polling place for them so we had that and that's completed and we had a code enforcement a special master hearing for the tower structure and the special master issued the order and the fine and would you mind telling us what that order was mayor i'd rather if you don't mind out we'll step in will be as the clerk that is not involved in the quasi-judicial process directly both parties presented evidence and ultimately the special master included by the special magistrate uh enforcement manager concluded that the property the property owner required a permit to have a structure of that type at the property there was no evidence of the permit in the file and the respondent affirmed that he had not applied for a permit and so he was directing him to apply for a permit within the next i believe it was 14 days it's my understanding he has already secured some of that paperwork and made at least an initial submission i i don't know where that is in the review process but that was the order was that it required a permanent application you know very much any other permit i just wanted to hear it just as a note to date the the permanent application is incomplete all right thank you any questions for the c clerk all right thank you very much miss gentry all right now we are on to the very painful consent agenda i'm going to read this just everyone bear with me okay this is covering items six i'm sorry seven through 16 for the approval of the june 20th special council meeting minutes june 20th budget workshop minutes july the 5th city council meeting minutes the july 12th special counsel meeting minutes the july 18 budget workshop minutes july 18 special council meeting minutes the august 1st city council meeting minutes the august 15th council work session minutes the august 22nd council work session minutes and finally the august 22nd special counsel meeting minutes all in favor aye mr and before we go to vote uh just refresh my memory you know we move consent agenda number seven to the regular agenda okay all in favor of approving the consent agenda any opposed incentive agenda passes thank you patty for getting us almost caught up it's a lot of hard work we've been very busy and i greatly appreciate it all right now to the regular agenda starting with item 17 which is to authorize the interim city manager to execute the contract for code enforcement services now we could actually move that behind the budget items have to be the first order of business budget item okay so we need to a man to a man no you've just moved it to that general place in business you can move to the very last thing or take it up first but so let's move on to item 18. consideration of adopting the proposed admiral military for fiscal year 2022 2023 the sign was placed on the agenda by interim city manager riefler and it's the first public hearing on setting the proposed final millage rate for fiscal year 2022-2023 first off do i have a motion so luke leslie nataro and do i have a second second jody shirley wesley you have a floor um thank you um so chapter 200 of the florida state statute the determination of knowledge of we have to set a statutory timetable and procedure for the calculation and notification public process to set the final app alarm tax knowledge and about the budget so this year the preliminary gross taxable value came back for balor beach which was uh 730 million uh 194 961 which is an increase in property value of 14.07 from the total uh from the year prior the the final military uh at the current military which is uh 2.0394 with the new property values which projects approximately one million four hundred and twenty nine thousand five hundred and ninety dollars in netapp loan tax that is tax calculated with the early payment discount so that represents an increase of avalor income and revenue at 177 775 over last year's budget and it's also a requirement to calculate the rollback military and that would be the millage rate that would generate the same amount of tax revenue levied the prior year the rollback rate would be 1.7916 the proposed nose rate of 2.0394 is 13.83 higher than the rollback rate the staff outside the rollback rate of 1.7916 [Music] the staff respectfully requests the city council to set the proposed and those rate at 2.0394 for fiscal year uh beginning october 1 2022. so it was the first adopted uh knowledge and budget must be adopted by separate votes so this first vote will be for the adopted military thank you for that information mr ray for uh council if we split the baby from the low back to the proposed radiator and current rate to 1.9155 how much of an impact would that do on our budget while we're giving back some of the money to the citizens well they would essentially cut the uh the increase in half so so we're talking about 87 um i know we discussed this at the workshop in depth um my take on it generally interestingly enough i did get some emails from citizens about how their tax proposal was impacted um i almost started laughing when i saw mine because my overall tax bill from the county actually went down which was interesting because as we all know there are several line items that make up our overall tax bill um bel air beach as a city standpoint is really not a big percentage but it does impact us so i think overall that our part of the overall tax bill is fairly small and the fact that it's spread over all the citizens of our city when you add up those little small uplifts if we don't cut it back it does provide significant money to the city for us to be able to get projects done that have been requested by most of our citizens so that's my take on it thank you any other comments from the council before we go to the citizens any citizens like to speak on this topic yes sir ron cigarette 2218 divano uh i appreciate y'all taking a look at this virtual artwork uh city staff is done i think retaining the military where it is it's fine i did a little bit of research city belt airs at 6.5 dollar gloves at 5.35 and those are just a couple in comparison clearwater clearwater largo they've got a lot more infrastructure but i think just you know for the infrastructure gains our city has mr roberts pointed out we need to do a lot of work i think it's a good move and i agree other people i know my bill overall proposed is going to go down by a little bit but you know i think it's good for the city of state the two of them thank you thank you other citizens let's go back to the council and then i will you know the last word council yes vice mayor gunn any thought of what's happening to the expenditures in the city i mean they're not going down you know only 12 percent of your tax bill goes back to belair beach so i think just the 13th street storm water increased 200 000 at project and we're talking about rolling back it doesn't make sense the the economic climate is just too unpredictable at this point to be moving back taxes and and yeah it would be nice to do that but it would be even harder to explain next year when you have to increase the underlying taxes so i propose that we just leave it where it is along with the recommendation of the city staff and we use what we can now to get ahead in the infrastructure thank you mr gunn anyone else that said mr gun you are going to probably be facing the pinellas county fire it's at 3 8 of a mill it's going to be increased so i just think in this day and age with all this inflation our increase from 177 000 to 85 000 86 000 would be substantial uh and we give the citizens the right to spend their money more wisely than we could thank you mr banker i have seen some hype online i occasionally do actually get online and look around and i think the most of it the biggest complaints are new homeowners they buy a house and it's the old appraised value or assessed value and then the next year whenever they're reassessed at the price they actually bought their home at that's whenever they take the big hit and it is shocking it looks like the uh the city is robbing from them but the truth is is that the cost of these homes just continue to go up and for the people that have been here for a while and haven't haven't bought a new home these have been very minor increases overall so i am also for maintaining the same illness rate that we've had for 12 years now something like that so it's been been quite a long time where we have not raised the millage rate so that's uh that's my thoughts anyone else uh yes um you know brian good point about the inflation uh and i am too is maintaining the military but we've seen so far in the short term of our council that uh providers to us for services have all dramatically increased their prices so basically in this rate of 10 you know inflation rates uh we're keeping our price the same and uh still attempting to provide the same services that you need any other council members before i turn it over to okay just as a point of interest i mean how many agenda items are we talking about tonight where we're talking about increases in the expenditure we're talking about the code enforcement we're talking about video and we're talking about some of the other issues here so i mean our costs are going up and they're not going down and i think it's it's only fair that the residents share in some of those expenditures and or maybe the city needs to start considering more usage of special assessments because the city can't cover all this stuff so when you have an issue in your neighborhood or on your street or wherever maybe we should start considering hey the city can kick in this amount but maybe we need to go to special assessments for problems addressing new york problems thank you vice mayor leslie material um i think it makes perfect sense to use the same ratings that we've used for many many years 2.0394 given the increase in costs projects things like that it gives us a little more old buffer rather than going back to work to the world right so thank you very much with that being said i think it's time to take a vote patty would you please call the robot council member banker no councilmember doterra yes councilman roberts yes council member shirley hi councilmember zabel aye vice mayor gunn aye mayor goddess hi uh so it's uh six to one uh and motion carries so that is the first public hearing and we'll have to do this one more time before it becomes official all right now we are on to the budget portion this is item 19 consideration of approving the city of bel air beach budget making appropriations for certain expenditures expenses capital improvements and certain embeddedness for the year beginning october 1st 2022 and ending september 30th 2023. this item was placed on the agenda by interim city land manager reefer and it's the first public hearing on the 2022-2023 budget do i have a motion until vice mayor gunn do i have a second second mike sable vice mayor you have before i'll defer to the university manager okay so retired uh city manager lynn reeves have prepared this budget for the council we've gone over it in multiple two budget workshops june 20th and july 18th and the we've made some adjustments during that time some of them were updated expenses increases decreases based on estimates that we got the final numbers for and then others were under the city council's direction uh some of those budget changes that were made in that time period were the state revenue sharing was increased based on the state's estimates the city manager budget was increased up to 191 780 based on the proposed city manager contract finance department was decreased that was primarily due to the accounting software that we decided was not necessary the sanitation has gone up that we covered later in the agenda library was decreased to half based on the needs of our population and the non-department of other professional services was decreased from ten thousand down to two thousand and that was just based on the estimated needs for that type of service as far as capital the base tech park improvements have decreased to a budget of 15 000 and that is just to cover the replacement for the playground so the uh the attached budget is um this is the uh the first uh vote on the budget but it will be finalized as part of a budget resolution submitted to council for approval at the second and final public hearing which will be on september 19th at 5 05 pm and this is the staffs is hungry requesting that the council approves this budget as a work through by the city council and the attached budget is prepared and is here for your review so this is the first reading thank you very much mr reaper council let's go to the citizens if any citizens like to speak on the uh on the budget all right we're back to the council again with the vice mayor done having the i would just request that perhaps a quick statement from the chair of the citizens advisory committee because i know they they've reviewed the budget and they've been intimately involved in a budget build and i'd just like to know if he's on board and if he has any questions or additions to this i will allow that please come up with thank you um so we did review the budget in advance uh on the first draft we haven't sat back with um city manager reflector to review this but uh sitting through the budget sessions personally i believe it's fair and it's done appropriately it is in line with what our original discussions were i like the way things have moved around thank you very much last chance for the council and then back to glendale that's where you're going cold question okay patty would you please call the roll council under table i'm councilmember shirley i councilmember roberts yes councilmember otero all right councilman revamper yes vice mayor gunn aye mayor davis so it passes unanimously and uh that's the first hearing um at the end of this thing it says the mayor is supposed to announce something and was a similar one on the millage rate let's just go right back because i can read them both at the same time [Music] first one is on first one is on page 55 199. hit the bottom all right well we'll first take care of the proposed proposed millage rate of 2.0394 males which is higher than the rollback rate by 13.83 is to fund the expenses of the general fund for the fiscal year commencing october 1st 2022 and ending september 30th 2023 final approved military for the city of valor beach will be presented in a second and final public hearing that will be hailed on monday september the 19th at 5 05 pm as far as the budget is concerned the final approved budget for fiscal year 2022-2023 for the city of bellaire beach will be presented at the second and final public hearing that will be held at the community center on monday september 19th 2022 at 505 pm randy you were supposed to catch me i knew i knew all right so now we are on to item number 20 which is consideration of appointment of an alternate member to the citizens advisory committee the candidate's name is tim holland before we go forward uh do i have a motion judy shirley do i have a second second mike's able uh jimmy shirley you have the floor i'm going to defer to i guess mr satanic if there's some explanations have an open position advisory chair um we've got an open advisory position and uh i don't know mr holland but i look at his application he's got a great background i think working on the future budgets and the uh workshop out of that uh develop that we need to address from a financial perspective his finance background would be a great help as we get to those discussions so look forward to his appointment thank you very much uh i've i've been told that mr holick is not here tonight but just for formality is mr holik here tonight and so would he like to address the council and i say that because we're we're different now and he could always be zooming out there somewhere you see that's a good question which seat did come up and it was a uh it was a um any citizens would like to speak on behalf of mr ollick or okay well let's go back to the council i will give you surely the last word nothing further all right let's take it to a vote since there's only one candidate uh let's do a voice vote uh all in favor all right [Music] see not our opposed congratulations go out to mr holly and uh if you see him thank him for serving in our beautiful city all right to item 21 moving right along this is to authorize the interim city manager to execute an agreement addendum with waste management inc of florida for residential single-family and multi-family residential complexes solid waste collection services so i was placed on the agenda by interim city manager riefler and he has a note here that this is uh to execute addendum number four increasing the agreement amount from three hundred and four thousand three hundred and eighty dollars and fifty eight cents to thirty three thousand three hundred thirty thousand nine hundred and eighty five dollars and ninety cents annually before we begin do i have a motion judy shirley do i have any second second like sable miss surely you have before um i think this complies with our contract and the opportunity for them to increase rates which of this state of things is not a very large increase and um they do a great job they're out there picking up trash on labor day so if there's anything more you want to add for free i just want to add that yeah the addendum number four is included there's also a letter from bob grisham who is the public sector solutions manager for our area and he addressed the increase in the justification behind it council yeah if i could i just want to go back to the knowledge discussion um i just want to point out as you can see here just in this one instance um that prices i mean for just in this case alone um you know went up uh 26 thousand dollars so again keep the millage rate uh are you is this somehow leading into the uh contract with police services uh yeah i just want to point out that this was a very significant increase and i would be voting to approve this i just want to point out that's this is one of the things that that military pays for okay thank you very much and sorry all right well all right uh anyone else that um i don't i don't believe the noise rate's gonna pay for that i believe that will get reduced back to the servers when it comes out to or the citizen that comes out their water subtraction i believe that mr zabel was just showing an example that everything is going up yeah but um why is it going up nine percent they give you a reason um so the one thing to pay attention to is per section not in the agreement there was a cap on the amount of increase for the cpi uh that was a maximum of four percent uh if you read the letter from bill grisham um they cite the increase in fuel um staff management and uh other prices of unprecedented increases in the cpi and that they're uh they're respectfully requesting that the the cap this year um be revised to allow the full increase of cpi um and then the other increase that comes into that balance is in the contracts section nine which is when the county uh increases their base rate charges for disposal then that directly influences their costs they are a contractor with belarus correct how are they allowed to work on the holidays since all our other contractors aren't allowed perform work i believe in their contract they're allowed to work says contractors are not permitted to work on holidays though one needs a big trash pick up here years ago the fed established money since the holiday so i'm just curious why we allow that to occur nothing on you okay and meanwhile we can't have a resin and have a contractor come in and work on their house now i believe this is utility service and not a contractor it's not it's not a hired licensed contractor it's a utility provider well they're a licensed contractor waste management i've dealt with them for 30 years they are definitely a licensed contractor but they are also a public service to the city of bel air beach and i'd like to see them guys have a day off on uh on their holidays rather than servicing us i mean i might even reduce the nine percent cost actually i'd probably pick i would they differ on that one you've seen strikes uh across the world uh when they've stopped uh refuge collection and sled pestilence disease uh spells and i know that none of our citizens would ever stand for that and as far as days off yes they are union representative and yes they do have top days off so they are getting those days off and that's one of the things excuse me yes and i again i do understand they open into employment with their company and they do negotiate the days that they have often the time that they have off they do a great job it is uh not for the faint of heart to do that job and uh just i want to applaud them but i definitely want to make sure that our streets are clean from refugees i'm 100 percent of our streets are clean uh they're not union represented i've talked to them many times i told them to go union um so that we'd get the days off but uh i think they should have a day off like most of the other people here thank you lloyd roberts did i see your hand uh no i'm fine okay thank you very much let's go to the citizens that's what any citizens like to speak on this topic oh all right let's go back to the council with jody's shirley having the last word nothing further i think we should take a vote thank you very much patty would you please call council member banker yes councilmember ontario yes councilman roberts aye council member shirley i'm hi so the addendum agreement agreement addendum rather it passes and we will move forward with that mr reaper you are all for us to proceed all right getting close people item number 22 approval of piggyback agreement for consulting services related to utility undergrounding and authorization to execute a purchase order with utility consultants of florida this was also placed on the agenda by interim city manager riefler he also has a statement here that is to underground utilities on the east side of gulf boulevard phase one for eight hundred forty seven thousand four hundred twenty four dollars and fifty cents and phase two for one million one hundred thirty six thousand eighty one dollars and twenty cents before we move on to this one do i have a motion salute like sable do i have a second second clean gun might say well you have the floor yes i refer to our interim city management thank you so this is the uh to approve a piggyback agreement that was drafted by mr morris firm and that is going to piggyback the contract pricing that's currently has affected indian rock speech that in turn is what uh our phase one phase two uh amounts are uh based off of and i'm requesting council approves the purchase orders to move forward for phase one and phase two for the installation of the conduit by the utility undergrounding so this was discussed in the presentation of the the undergrounding uh depending for cornell's money and uh this is the first step in in consolidating your fitness is to approve these these two uh agreements and to start installing the conduit and speaking with the contractor we believe that this phase one and phase two can reasonably get done within five months even though the platform interesting thank you very much mr rayford council yes just to verify that those prices reflect the consolidated they do i believe we actually came out of the massacre but i believe if you could carry it back it was closer to thirty thousand good job i'd say oh yeah i just briefly had some various questions coming in from you about the the timeline now can you use this like a broad scope look phase one includes this there's start date here's the end date phase two broadly includes this start date and date and again approximate ballpark ballpark um so for this part of the project the utility consultants um you'll be starting and proving it this month to start in october um five months time frame is is the goal and uh as soon as they complete phase one of that which could be you know two to three months which would be the south causeway boulevard shortly after that duke which is the next agenda item can come in and start their work after inspection so they're going to work directly behind usually consultants so broadly until what's the date say phase one to everything's underground nice you know ground tank all that good stuff uh all part of two years trying to accomplish both the agility consults will be done and then do follow up with phase one through phase two really depends on availability of crews they might be able to get multiple crews working at one time at the same time any kind of emergency that pulls those freezes no i understand so probably speaking uh from today uh it's going to be two years deliver things underground and that's phase one phase two basically the builder of each underground and on call yes and the only other variable is the communication company which is a spectrum they have underground they need to do from 12th street north to harrison that either will get squeezed in somewhere in the project between duke's faces or it might have to wait till after because they are not through experience we've seen that they do take a longer period of time and that would be the least in priority to accomplish boyd roberts uh yeah we discussed a bunch of the workshop i'm fine with that i have no further questions any other comments from the council before i go to the citizens all right back to the council mike sable you have the last word like says the vote [Music] would you please call the role councilman brazil aye councilmember shirley hi councilmember roberts hi council member natera i'm councilmember baker no vice mayor gunn aye mayor gavis aye so it passes six to one thank you very much mr reaper you were authorized to proceed with the piggyback agreement all right we are on to number 23 which is for authorization to execute underground conversion agreements and purchase orders with duke energy florida llc which was also placed on the agenda by interim city manager riefler before we discuss this would anyone like to make a motion move forward joey shirley do i have a second second leslie judy you have before real quick these are the uh two conversion agreements from duke energy uh that were based off of the binding cost estimates that we had done for us they are pretty straightforward they were reviewed by our city attorney and with uh with these agreements being authorization signed these agreements it would also be to create purchase orders with phase one they would need the the money up front as part of the agreement i've discussed with uh miriam who deals with the contracts for duke that went out to the face too we could postpone the payment on phase two and keep our binding costs uh until next year's budget so starting october 2023 we would execute that purchase order thank you very much other council members one big thing i have with underground wiring is the transmission of electrical energy which is reduced when it comes from doing underground to above ground most undergrounding only will carry about 11 kb all these new electric cars coming out and everything like that has duke addressed possible increases [Music] or the wiring capacity that's going to be able to transmit the electricity disease we're going down to a full board that will feed in the neighborhood and while there's other things that i think we should have been spending this money on because it's gonna i think the total cost is over five million dollars and again once government gets money they'll find a way to spend it i think we could have used it to cure our storm water problems out here rather than paying duke energy to hide blinders but uh my big concern is with this added electrical surge on the grid has duke energy ever been addressed and saying is this going to if everyone has a budget car in the next five 10 years are the underground wires going to be capable of carrying that charge for that boat i know that they have a team of engineers that have worked on the project and designed it but i can follow up with that thank you can i add too i know that when we've done some underground in the city it was a huge requirement to upgrade service the service was upgraded by duke at the time the mines were buried in uh long-term incentives you're talking residential i'm talking transmission for going into residential there's a big there's a big difference once it goes into the house i'm not going to argue with that i'm just saying that i don't think duke energy is going to take the lines that are overhead as they sit and bury them there's going to be new lines laid no i heard a border wait wait let's not have a back and forth on this let's uh let's take it one at a time uh i'm going to step in just for a second and add that i did see a presentation at one of the big c meetings from duke and yes they are increasing their transmission line capacity um are they prepared to handle 25 electric cars on your street probably not i don't know if that will ever happen but they are as they do these projects they are increasing the line capacity size and my point is if it's above ground that we'll be able to handle with 25 cars per street and no it's usually 11 kv max on underground lines to service the community thank you for uh that opinion and uh let's go right quick to the citizens uh would anyone like to speak on this topic no no electricians okay let's come right back to the council with joey shirley having the last word i think this has been a priority for the city for quite some time and i'm happy that we are aggressively moving forward with this project thank you for the support thank you all right so teddy we're going to do another roll call mode on this one and again this is to authorize the underground conversion agreements would do please take the vote council member banker no council member doterra yes council member roberts i'm council member shirley aye councilman was able hi vice mayor gunn aye mayor goes hi so it passes six to one mr whitford you are authorized to proceed with executing the underground conversion agreements and purchase orders with new cleaners now we are back to item 17 which is to authorize the interim city manager to execute the contract for code enforcement services with the pinellas county sheriff for fiscal year 22 and 23. this item was placed on the agenda by interim city manager replay do i have a motion to move forward on this one salute mike's able do i have a second second frank banker i'd say well you have the floor uh yeah just uh before uh after seeing her and city managers wanted to point out that this contract is an enough to amount it does not guarantee use of the full amount but it's under our control as to how much where when and the enforcement is under our control okay to city manager reporter possible thank you okay as mentioned in the work session we're increasing the uh the hourly rate is going up to 51.80 per hour we discussed starting october one the code enforcement officer going to 15 hours per week as opposed to 20 hours per week we're doing now that will also be followed up and discussed in our code enforcement analysis to find out where we end up with what the best solution is for code enforcement and dollar agent thank you other council members mr roberts i have nothing to add all right let's go to the citizens for comments so all right back to the council we might say we'll have in the final word if not move to vote thank you very much all right so uh this is to uh authorize the intercity manager to execute the contract for code enforcement services for the pinellas county sheriff for fiscal year 2022 and 2023. howdy would you please call the vote council member shirley i'm council member stable i'm council member banker aye councilmember roberts aye councilmember ontario i vice mayor gunn here guys now the motion passes unanimously uh you are authorized for that contract thank you very much all right i'm 24 unfinished business do we have on any unfinished business council all right well let's move right on into yes sir mr gun well i guess i have a question on uh is respect to the city manager hiring and responding to mr griffin's latest communication with the council and just i guess just to be professional and responsive to that request do we have a timeline in mind for responding to that i didn't pick anything out i haven't said anything yet i was uh i was actually hoping for a nudge from the council basically contacting the city manager city attorney and and uh giving me some direction on whether we need to have a special counsel meeting or not i guess i was just wondering if uh city attorney moore picked up any vibes in his discussions with mr griffin as to timeliness or a response when i spoke with him last week i informed him that this body would be meeting tonight that i had not yet received indication that a special meeting would be scheduled on the manager selection process and that ultimately it would be at the will of the body whether or not they make a decision tonight and that i could not guarantee one would be forthcoming or not or what that decision would be i was very explicit with him to manage expectations to state that the offer as from the city's perspective was not open but if they chose to extend it again if you chose to extend it again you of course have that option as far as process and timing he while he did not say that i need to know in x amount of days he did express that he was was and remains eager for the opportunity that he welcomed the opportunity to work with and for this this community and ultimately he respected whatever decision the council made but wanted to make sure they knew he remained interested and eager pending whatever decision you make whether you decide that you certainly aren't able to make that decision as a body tonight if you so desire at least as to that i'm not suggesting you hire somebody tonight either way but if you wish to offer some closure on that or have a direction you wish to move simply provided and i will execute as appropriate thank you i would be interested in hearing the council's general thoughts on what they would like to do whether we move forward and offer the opportunity again or we [Music] take a step back and continue looking in another direction um i would be interested to know um attorney morris and he contacted someone in the florida league of cities what is the status of that um thank you uh so in recognizing that you were in transition and that i've facilitated similar processes in the past i wanted to make sure you can do what your options were what regardless of what you choose upon learning that mr griffin had withdrawn his candidacy and reflecting on what next steps might exist i reached out to a contact with the fccma flc senior advisor program it's a program of retired managers who offer consulting services to managers and communities for free for communities that are i believe under 10 000 residents of which you clearly are i reached out to see if they were open working with bella beach sometimes they'll say hey based on history or based on availability we're not in a position to help they said that they were they were willing to and gave me as i provided to you the list of managers in transition that is the list of managers who don't have positions are affiliated with the organization and are looking um ultimately it was there's no status update because i had no client direction uh given the way that the as you all well known i'm not suggesting anything to the contrary given the operation of the sunshine law i haven't been in contact with any of you directly as to this is what needs to be done or have any sense of where this body wishes to go i make sure you have information and when you have an opportunity to deliberate and provide redirection you do so i there's no status beyond the resources available if you so desire just like you know the world remains your oyster thank you very much mr banker well i i believe the last session mr griffin was here he argued for his wife's health insurance to be paid and when he didn't receive that he bolded from this room that says buy into may because the meeting went on for about another two hours and we were discussing a five million dollar job my opinion he showed no interest in the city moving ahead when he didn't get what he wanted um one resident sent all counsel i believe a few articles he was terminated for i believe cause i'm not sure why he was terminated um i think he should be taken off the list i think we have minimal diamond in the rough sitting next to mr moore uh the man should be promoted and that's why it came thank you mr roberts would you like to weigh in on this i would as all of you know i was one of the four initially that was in favor of moving forward with mr griffith um i i wasn't exactly pleased when he came forward with the request to add an additional sixteen thousand dollars approximately for his spouse i shared with him openly there that there were options out there that i know were available to him that would allow him to get some coverage for his spouse at a much much better rate and a very good coverage so i was real pleased with that reaction and then as we all know he came back and said well he wasn't going to be able to move forward without that so he was withdrawing his application then um through mr moore we were contacted and we would [Music] let known that he did find something else that was better and he wanted to proceed in addition to that as mr banker referenced we were copied on some articles from the newspaper so that coupled with the information that mr moore provided to us regarding tools available to us to find potentially interested parties that were previously are currently city managers around our state i personally would prefer that we not move forward with an offer to mr griffin thank you judy shirley i'm not in favor of moving forward with mr griffin um i am in favor of um reaching out to some of the resources that are available with an effort to try to streamline this process i think we've lost some candidates because we because our process is so long moving through the review of the resumes lack of response on the city's part to those individuals who showed an interest in the position um you know i think there's and that's where that's what we could be more successful if we brought in an outside source to spearhead the project rather than us waiting a month in between every meeting and not being able to move quickly enough parties that are interested in the position i don't think it was a bust between every meeting we had special meetings but even then uh our hands are tied on trying to expedite anything and there is a very good possibility that well i know for a fact we lost a very good candidate uh because of timeliness and uh and also another offer so i agree she is not a human resource officer so it's really tough to saddle her with all the responsibilities when he could potentially use why do you see your advisors or a firm thank you mike savelle yeah mom agreed and not moving forward but i just want to remind everybody that you know how come we don't have a city manager you know things are going on it's a due diligence due diligence is precisely that it takes time you got good days you got bad days just continue to push pool on every way just want to point that out and yeah we're under time you know certain mechanisms that we cannot unlike a private firm immediately hire somebody going you know right after the interview boom and two days later they're working um it does take time but uh having said that uh yes i would uh recommend again not going forward without hiring uh and then going back to a working session uh two interruptions and i'm saying you know back to all the options from uh retaining uh you know interim city manager up to looking at the new people that's all thank you vice mayor god after the last meeting with mr griffin kind of fell out of my favor and i'm not in favor of uh supporting any further discussion of mr president i think that train has left the station but i think what's important right now is we move forward because we're at a decision point on how to proceed with this thing what i see is just gleaning from the discussions here we've we've got a some some alternatives here we had suggestions about a head hunter service we certainly can repeat the city's job search and take this project on ourselves once more [Music] we can look to alternative sources i mean the city attorney talks about deplored legacies one we forget is the icy event they do a lot of this this kind of work they have people standing by also to support the city manager camps and that sort of thing and what i will also throw out there is a consideration of extending the interim city manager duties kind of in the form of like a probationary period extended out six months a year things are seem to be proceeding on a a well-balanced approach to running a city while we take the time to sit back and decide how we're going to do this the old expression comes to mind make hate slowly i mean the job's getting done let's take a take a breath figure out where we are and how best to perceive it so i would agree with you also that if you look at just all of the minutes that we went through it's been it's not been a joyride uh we've we've been very very busy and we've been trying to somehow work in hiring a city manager at the same time i think maybe taking a break and just letting things be idle at least through this budget and during the budget period and uh in the next work session we discussed a little bit more what our game plan should be and uh and we take our time and uh and we come up with a solution that works for everyone on the council and uh and then we'll move forward on it i like the fact that we do have other resources that we were not aware of before we started this process and i greatly appreciate that so i am not in favor of bringing mr griffin in i've heard the body's direction and i will communicate the same to mr thank you very much thank you very much any other unfinished faces all right move to city council comments i'm going to mix it up a little bit this time and start right in the middle with lloyd roberts thank you mr mayor um you know it was interesting i heard some talk about you know moving as quickly as we can because we felt like we lost opportunities with potentially good candidates and then at the end we were talking about slowing down so i think i stripped some gears on that move there just a little bit but uh obviously you know i don't think there's any perfect answer there but i think it is great that mr moore gave us some opportunities there and actually some names that were given to him by the florida legal cities um i think it would be in the best interest and obviously you would mention um we could have another um work meeting we could discuss that further if we could have that sooner i think it might be better so that we can get the wheels turning on this personally i think that would be a good idea and as we've said multiple all those people have said that we have a good interim city manager who's doing a great job somebody told me that you know the city hasn't burned down so that's a good thing but i think he's doing a great job and we should move forward to check and to see what other people are available because i'm sure there were people available now that probably weren't available when we were openly advertising previously so i think we have some options available to us and i think we should pursue all of them and move forward thank you thank you very much judy yeah surely just would like to thank kyle for everything he's done during this transition thank you for you've been a great support and um especially thank you for taking care of the intercoastal abilities for us and getting those underway and pulling together this undergrounding project and you've done a great job thank you very much thank you it's been a pleasure mike savelle yeah unfortunately i you know relay some bad news but you know communities lost one of their own uh this past weekend uh mr bill milton um bill was an eagle scout one of the first in the city to achieve that rank and he's also a navy veteran ran a company that provided at least on the confidential side special cables to the us navy and their submarines um to the melbournes you know our thoughts and prayers are with you he will be missed so just a reminder you know you know look after your neighbors we're a small community um not everybody has you know family look in you know your neighbors sometimes they they need help with some sort or another and i also want to extend an apology i got an email this morning for miss small and you know i apologize you you're doing landscaping i'm going to have the county you should be doing that but thanks for having me at your house early this morning then again i apologize for you having to you know do that stuff but it should be the county's work so thank you thank you mr sable up next is frank mayer um earlier susan got up about paving of the easements i've been talking to a few people ninth first i haven't found one person in favor of that i think it's wasteful money i think it would bring in all sorts of uh electric bikes and everything like that going right down the street litter i think that thing should be tabled indefinitely the thought process of doing this i know it was discussed at a work session this year to go forward i talked to kyle um last month and he was saying they were thinking about doing it i guess on the 12th and 13th street project since you already have barbara green out there in the painting units but i think that should be squashed for now the other thing i want to say is i attended a magistrate hearing last month about a tower that mayor was heavily involved with over the last just two three months and our city attorney and our interim city manager did an excellent job defending our code and bringing safety to that uh resident i just i apologize with vice to the switching years i i i think the strategy we're really taking is to slow down just a little bit to decide how best to proceed with this but once you make a decision on how to proceed then time is of the essence and that's when you know blitzkrieg on this thing so i don't think we need to confuse it completely the best practices i've seen in other council meetings is that it would be nice that maybe during discussions or something like that in between rather than just having a great family picture on the screen would be nice if we had the agenda on the screen so that the people in the audience can see what we're talking about and they can see some of the dollar values and stuff like that i've just seen that so in between kind of just we can have the agenda up there so they can see which line item we're on and where we are in the agenda and also uh once a while if if possible we can flash up uh one of the the charts or whatever we're talking about specific data so they can follow along with us rather than just sit out there trying to clean all this knowledge from the conversation just just a best practice i've seen in other council meetings in some of our sister cities here the retention pond across the street at one time my understanding was there was a fountain out there it was it was flown and that's how they kind of controlled some of the stuff that the pawns coming and their phones and stuff out there and it was removed and all the time for cause but maybe it's time to revisit that is that you know it may be a cost a recurring cause for power but it might solve some of the issues with cleanups and that sort of thing the along with the [Music] consolidation of phase one phase two for the undergrounding we really need to work into the discussions of uh the strategy of how you plan to pay for that 1.2 short million shortfall so i just want to make sure that doesn't get kicked down the road too far we need to start working out into our budget discussions and how we're going to plan that that's all i have thank you very much thank you i also agree with the vice mayor gun on the slowing of the years conversation or comment really the gears start moving quickly whenever you say go and that's whenever you have a brand new set of candidates at any given time as long as once we say go and we we begin the research process that's whenever i think it's it's more important than it is uh uh being in a hurry to formulate a plan uh i will admit i that one was on me i put something together that i thought would uh would work unfortunately it was not a realistic plan because of what i mentioned earlier about how our hands are tied because of the sunshine law so i think that if we work together on the plan and whenever we say go we step back and let it happen as rapidly as possible we'll have a larger set of candidates and better chances of agreeing on someone also there are several issues concerning our current code the purdue code and methods used to enforce our municipal and county codes i'd like to address some of these issues in our next council work session until then i would like to thank everyone who attended either in person or on zoom i'd also like to thank the council and staff for your dedication to this city and make my job way easier than it should be and with that being said do i have a motion to adjourn motion frank banker do i have a second second judy surely all in favor any opposed all right goodnight everyone"
