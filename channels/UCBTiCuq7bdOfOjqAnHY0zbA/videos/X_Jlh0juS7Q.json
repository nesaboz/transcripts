    "transcript": "um called many February 1st meeting at a zoning board to order and the first order of business is the approval of the agenda thank you roll call first though well I before we approve the agenda we got one too I have to call it um for the record okay chair jcn film president vice chair Rudy Davis board member Angela Berry present board member Brenda buenasera president board member Hart McIntyre president city manager Kyle riefler here and City attorney Randy Mora present you had a chance to look at the agenda so your approval fortunate to approved second motion carrying all those in favor all right bye opposed motion Kerry review the draft two of the comprehensive plan we're going to start with the attorney or is Linda going to be here or so Linda Linda's on Route she's coming over the bridge right now um so she will be here shortly and Linda for purses of the record as the representative of Fort Nellis who's been assisting with the comprehensive plan uh process before we continue on that I want to give you a little bit more Exposition on where we are in the process sure um so we had a meeting roughly two weeks ago discussing the proposed revisions to the comprehensive plan based on the Ford Pinellas review for compliance to align our code with new statutory requirements that are required in a comprehensive plan like a statement of property rights and things like that during the course of the last meeting as the minutes reflect there was also a review done for the members to individually review the comprehensive plan and consider whether there was any additional policies or objectives that this body wanted to recommend to the commission to adopt as we amend the company intensive plan and that was based in part on the explanation that your comprehensive plan is like your Constitution for Land Development no development can be approved that is in conflict with the comprehensive plan Land Development regulations your code on Heights and things all those flow from your comp plan and so we wanted to make sure this was an informed uh process and detailed review the goal today is to finalize any of the recommendations from Fort Pinellas to gain any input and potential consensus direction from this body that means a general agreement maybe not everybody agrees but if there's at least three of you who say yes we'd like to see some kind of policy to this effect put in place then ultimately what we on the staff side will do is come forward with a proposed ordinance that captures all of this and have a public hearing no different than this one but with advertisement run in the newspaper in advance to check stat story boxes and then that whatever products comes out of that meeting will be what is relayed to the commission so there will be a third meaning as it relates to this common plan process so that's where we stand in the process as of today I was just explaining procedurally where we are and that we would um my recollection was generally there was consensus approval of Fort pinellas's recommendations if having had more time to digest that there was any wish to review them please do so there was a question before we went on record for the meeting as to what Ford pinellas's role is that this is an interlocal agreement that they operate to provide planning Services which we are required to possess for the purposes of comprehensive plan review that while they are a interlocal body that may serve multiple jurisdictions as the law defines it there's no conflict for their operation across jurisdictions Meeting those individual jurisdictions needs so beyond that that is where we stand presently the aim today is to make sure we have all your input so we can come to you one more time with a here's a clean version of what's coming out of the land Planning Association pnz wearing your hats and go forward are there any questions or confusion on that I know it's a bit of word salad but I want to make sure we're clear on where we are procedurally one observation when we hit uh feelings of additional suggestions yes not actually changes where do you want that at that's for today's discussion and how you as chair of this body wishes to go through anybody's individual notes whether you wish to go member by member go through the document chronologically if you each have prepared notes say you know these are my notes on this that ultimately that's up to you but what staff is looking for today is consensus Direction on any remaining revisions additions deletions that you have so that we can incorporate them into a document that this body would ultimately approve foreign how will this assist you and what you're doing what are the things you would like to see Planning and Zoning address specifically if anything I don't mean to put you on I mean those areas that you know you feel you can create more vision of what where we're going or what we're going to be or stay stay the same or um just so I can relay that back to everything else I mean this is just where we see where we see the future is is there anything in particular or general that you think is lacking that it needs you know more time looking at vision I mean we talk about the marina I thought that was a good topic um seems to be a hot one right now you look at the work session and everything as well occurred you may consider putting something in about preserving what we do have is open space I don't know how much boarding I'm gonna check back through but I mean just from considerations of the past I think that would be important okay for instance for instance when um we were looking at every lot that was donated for open space for parks in a way to make money so in other words the vision should address whether or not that should be a revenue generator or a more of a benefit convenience perhaps for the citizens here sure I mean if it was donated for a purpose you may want to say you know in the future you can probably never keep it that way or right if you address something like that at least it's kind of laid out and described as the vision so if it comes up as an option in the future it's uh you know we can look back to this so do we have the discussion more in detail now or wait till we get down to the specifically here you should have a discussion around it I wish we could start with you and we'll go around the table and if there's any suggestions additional to what we covered with Linda last time protect him on the end and yes this is a chance to prepare it so my my hope is my my role here is to ensure our process is sound um but that process can look like a lot of different things what my advice to you is is that this body not be too concerned today with what I would call wordsmithing how are we going to write that's what we want to do how do we write it we are taking in addition to all the software we have to record and transcribe worked with on the staff side we'll be taking notes if you came out today with a recommendation that was like we wish to preserve the historical character of Bellaire beach by ensuring the primary colors those visible in a beach ball are incorporated into any City branding which you could do in some other complex but let's say that's what you were trying to do I will handle what that sentence looks like and prevent it present it to you at the next meeting and I just what I'm looking for is do you guys all agree that primary colors should be a traditional you know blah blah blah blah um so you know for example we had a very similar meeting in Indian Rocks Beach two weeks ago on short-term rentals where they were going through their full regulatory scheme and we spent two hours but what we did was we went through it we went through the template document and said what do you want to change what do you want to change give me your notes I'll synthesize them all I'm looking for or all we are looking for is synthesis and consensus if we have your general agreement um on synthesized distilled thought policy objective that's fine by me whether you guys do it individually based on your individual druthers and you know um and Ames that's one thing if we do it sequentially having looked through the different planning elements because there are elements to a comp plan there's Recreation flooding all those things we can go through the elements I defer to you folks as your meeting we just want to make sure that anybody who wishes to be heard is hurt and we get a distilled product that we can move forward with okay Linda do you have any guidance that you would like to present um I was going to make a suggestion that we go through the guidance that I received last time and how I wrote it into the document everywhere that you see yellow highlighting is a change that has been made since the first draft and if you'll allow me I can go through those and explain why I did what I did that's a story okay that's a good idea okay and I do apologize that I was running a bit late just stop for a second agenda and now we've moved on item three to three so we need to do two first requirements yes okay um when I interject at this point if I have a point in a minute is that I don't feel represent what we said yes if we're going to do that yes if we're going to do our approvals of minutes now yes and so so JC would call for approval of the minutes I was just wondering and then if you have something you'd like to say about that okay okay let's go to number two terminal the January 18th planning and 74 minutes before we um closer to approve those I'd like to look at one particular point that is in those minutes that title could actually represents clearly the discussion we had it's on page three first quote first paragraph promotion made by Mr McIntyre and Mr Davis stepping down to the last sentence where it says and if possible impose some economic gain or penalty for those that travel down this way I was more under the impression that it was looking and if possible impose impact fees or charges to Clearwater Beach for lack of Road improvements to handle their traffic issues forcing excessive traffic through our community that impedes our ability to use our roadways something along those lines but I don't understand this economic penalty for those who've traveled down this way I think my point yeah when we discussed it at the very end I said you know some is there some way for Bel Air Beach to gain an economic benefit I don't know necessarily a penalty but we talked about the potential of having some kind of Total Access that that would would either go to the benefit of Bel Air and War wart the amount of traffic that chooses to come this way and what do you want to strike then Rudy um possible can I make a point yeah I mean I I just went by what was said on the recording so I can't put something that wasn't said but I can like you said if you want to strike something or if you want to clarify something I can do that but I just can't put something that's not that wasn't actually said this is verbatim What was Factor said at that time it's not that part right there is not exactly verbatim but it is the words that were used so if you feel like the wording isn't uh exactly what was meant you know like Jason said I guess where I'm I'm having some issue is it says impose some economic gain or penalty for those that travel down this way yeah that was said and and maybe that's not what the spirit of it was and I can go back and listen to it and um if you tell me what you so I gather their heart that what what it was saying here was that you'd like to see a toll put on that road as I don't even know how practical that is it was just kind of a hip shoot comment to say if the citizens here are the ones that are inconvenienced by by the the heavy amount of traffic that we incur because people can't come down 60. right they're trying to get to Clearwater right and and I I don't disagree with what you're saying somehow if we can I don't know how we would uh impose anything on Clearwater or have them one improve but you know when it's a county road yeah we really have no way to put up a toll booth or anything else it was sort of a show of the hip as we've talked before all we can really do is suggest something be done on a particular issue and here so to look at ways the county can help us control this traffic form so the road capacity is not exceeded and to me it's more a matter of to me the whole root issue is that clear water has allowed expansion of its density it's in a far greater degree than it has provided traffic control and egress and Ingress and egress within their own borders forcing it over on that so how do we say if I may yeah um I given with the administrative role of the minutes my suggestion is it seems like your concern is everything after the word flow as it characterizes how you would go about addressing so the sentence presently reads um emotion was made by Mr McIntyre and seconded by Mr Davis to explore means of controlling the traffic coming southbound from Clearwater and coming westbound across the Bel Air Causeway to look at ways that the county can help us control this traffic flow and so that our road capacity is not exceeded and if possible yeah and so it seems like everything after the so is what's presenting a concerned so that our road class okay after the after where it says is not exceeded right the end if possible part is your concern my suggestion to you is we're not having a policy debate in the minutes is simply capturing the spirit and verbatim of what was or or nature of what was said that you just moved to strike the everything after not succeeded sure yeah Evolution right trying to suggest something that we have no authority to do so I make a motion that we put a period after exceeded in that paragraph and strike the rest of it from the minute do I hear a second sorry any discussion all those in favor aye aye opposed okay thank you okay then I moved to approve the minutes until the January 18th 2023 planning and 34. all right here a second any discussion it was in favor aye aye opposed unanimous okay any other consideration all right yeah next phase yeah okay okay we'll continue with what Linda was suggesting okay as I mentioned the changes that I made from last month are highlighted in yellow so I made some corrections on the title page I mean this is the city council and our permanent city manager the next uh changes I have other cases are on page one of the goals objectives and policies in the future Landing settlement so there were two classes of changes that I've suggested here one is based on the discussion from the last meeting there are a few others that I made based on a conversation I had with the city manager after that meeting where he talked about some concerns with some non-conforming hotels so there are a few changes you'll see here that we haven't discussed yet but I've included them for your consideration and that on page one of the future Landing settlement where currently the language reads that you your city has a totally residential character and changed it to primarily and that's why um and that that'll bring in that ties into the discussion of how to deal with the non-conforming hotel units if you decide you don't want to do anything with that topic then these changes can come back out but these are just there's a cluster of changes that surround that discussion and that'll make more sense as we go through the next couple of things this primarily open the door though for someone to say what you didn't say this is excluded right that will be regulated through your future land use categories and your zoning districts so what's the purpose of saying primarily because in in the city's position that it should be and remain residential um it might make more sense if I can skip ahead to the next change and I think that'll explain it a little better it's on page three physical objectives and policies and it says discourage the introduction of any language right but the reason that that language is drafted that way is to accommodate changes on page three and Kyle please correct me if I've misinterpreted anything but the my understanding is there are some multi-family units that are renting out some of their units and acting as on the de facto hotels yes and in the residential medium but the idea was was given to me from a resident that what if we should consider allowing future or at least Hotel use so that we can collect the FED tax for what they're already doing yeah um and then you open up the whole thing with a vacation rental by owner or Airbnb and music but it doesn't have to you don't have to acknowledge it do you we don't go down that road it's already happening fine but let's stop it I personally I don't want to turn into an Indian Rocks Beach it is awful over there Now's the Time stop but we're going through something similar in North Carolina right now trying to stop vacation short-term rental and because nothing was written into the Deeds or the bylaws is going to be very very difficult to to prevent it and and I'm I'm absolutely opposed to to having any kind of short-term rental and if we insert language here that implies there's some acceptance to me that just doesn't work I agree yeah beef totally I guess I have a question about the new law where it says that the citizen has the right to do whatever with their land um are you referring to the the language asserted into um I'm going to address um what that is and it's not okay the private property rights element is a separate issue that's a new law of stating that local governments have to recognize existing private properties rights but it doesn't create new private property rights and it does say that use of land or property can be limited by local ordinances so that means you can still control things through your zoning districts just as long as we're not violating the law already then that's fine not not that long in terms of what I've proposed here it adds a use called temporary lodging and that has a specific definition under the countywide plan where that is um less than 30 rental of less than 30 days I believe it's four times a year I'm not sure the definition is in here but we recognize temporary lodging as a different definition from vacation rentals temporary lodging is a separate use under state law vacation rentals can happen in properties that are designated residential this would create a designation other than residential and allow those properties to do short-term rentals Indian Rocks Beach and moved over here for you know before the airbnbs and things we on our street there's eight houses now for sale people that have been there for 20 years are moving out because the police can't handle the noise when they get called at two o'clock in the morning it's not a residential town it's turning into a vacation land which is fine if that's what they want but we're stuck in the middle between clear water and Indian Rocks Beach I think the objection here is the word tote yeah okay well it's anything that implies that there's something some tolerance for it it just doesn't seem that if it doesn't seem to fit the neighborhood I think the majority of people here would say we have no tolerance for them we don't want any of it so then we retain that we're totally instead of primarily exists it does is that what we're looking for as a name as a board yeah but I think there's even more discussion about these these hotels and yeah they're they're there their grandfather but one one of the things that we've worked on in North Carolina is if you are vacation rental to clear now because because we're going to change the bylaws so that future you can't and it won't be grandfathered you can if the grandfathered to the original owner but once that fee change is titled there's no more there's no more opportunity to make that a short-term rental I don't know what exists here with these hotels allow me to address just a little bit of the legal landscape on this issue um the Florida legislature in 2011 adopted a statute amending Florida statute 509-032 sub 7 Sub B uh concerning temporary lodging and specifically short-term rentals at the time what they did was they preempted the local ability a local jurisdiction's ability to regulate short-term rentals provided there was nothing on the books before June 1 2011. in 2014 they Revisited that it was a broad preemption and they narrowed it to say that a jurisdiction cannot adopt any adopt or in or enforce any matter any measure that prohibits short-term rentals regulates their duration or regulates their frequency unless such regulation was in place before June 1 2011. in this jurisdiction I've looked at the issue and as it relates to another issue as it concerns short-term rentals your ordinances presently uh prohibit them in your in your districts uh based on based on something that was adopted before June 2011. this this body is is only in residential law yeah it's a residential Medium as no restriction so residential residential medium the condominium it has no restriction except for the condo association yeah and we can't we do not affect the the bylaws incorporating documents Association documents of any condominium or anything but in as much as in any zoning District it has been prohibited um or has been clear since before June 2011 you are right to consider whether you're amending in a way that may affect that and I'm not going I'm not in a position presently to answer that definitively for you one way or the other that's what this deliberation should be but I want to be clear for you so you know what your city can and can't do there's no like you can't play peekaboo with it and say like we're gonna see if we're gonna let them for a little bit and then say you know what we didn't like it and prohibit it again later um it's either you had it on the books now almost 12 years ago or you don't um in some jurisdictions they don't or didn't um and it was a um the history of that is is sort of besides the point at this point I just wish to make sure you folks understood uh what was being discussed so the Jeopardy is if you change anything there's the Jeopardy and since you said you can't address each specific item to know that it it would affect what the state was saying our point is don't change anything don't put us in Jeopardy on anything that has anything to do with that topic contemporary launching yes I think would be saying our vision is this remains residential bringing single family and we're not in favor of anything that promotes or supports correct um uh short-term rental of any sort we can't do anything about the ones that are already there other than if what happens if they get blown away what happens now that we get a we get a there's wait a minute wait a minute let's go back to that the chair would entertain a motion to leave the word totally in and right right stuck in that motion no I didn't make a motion I said I would consider hearing emotions so moved okay so move is there a second second any discussion no all those in favor aye aye opposed sugar next case I'm not sure yet okay okay so this these changes on page one are tied to a number of other changes which I will also remove based on the discussion the the clear consensus um okay so on page three number three uh my suggestion was to create a resort facilities overlay category so that if you chose to allow those units you could put it over your multi band hearing the clear consensus that that is not what you want so I will remove that language what's the difference between a hotel and time show and Resort Resort facilities overlay is the name of the category um temporary login refers to to hotel motels condo hotels and that is distinct from the vacation rental which is typically a house it can be able to take anything else of a temporary lodging is saying I will allow this property to act as a hotel under my local regulations and that's what this overlay would do if you wanted to use it but I'm understanding that that's not what you're well what time share come in because they declared themselves as time shares a lot of motels or hotels there's nothing am I correct are you talking about the condo that was a motel and definitely would not the motel is definitely a motel but the ones the North End of the city that have always stated to me lion scenes they were timeshares not a collage okay Harrison yeah yeah that's something I'll need to look up I suspect that's based on how the local government chooses to Define it that you could Define it either as temporary lodging or as residential because it's somewhere in the middle but I will research that and look to see our I know the motel is if it's not down it has to be built back as a condominium how about those do we have any wording anywhere I'm not I haven't seen any to my knowledge that says what happens to them if they get knocked down can they come back as a timeshare again or do they have to go strictly condominium and what restrictions do we have to keep it from going Sky High so we're crossing out number three completely yellow markings yes and that continues on page four okay Randy I have a quick question for you can we restrict Residential Properties to ownership by private individuals and not corporations no thank you and you can't you can restrict their use of them though as a Airbnb if you had that restriction on the books before which we won 2011 which it's my understanding you did in at least one District then yes but because there's the way you phrased your question is they with the pronoun and the antecedent of of the question being related to corporate entities we can't specifically regulate short-term rentals as they relate to corporate owned versus individually owned the distinction I've seen made is owner occupied which is sort of a different class but ours is a general blanket there's a general blanket prohibition but in the event your question was about targeting corporations not targeting but you regulating corporations is to seeing from individuals and ownership is ownership and private properties on page six uh that was another reference to that Resort facilities overlay category which will come out um I did add another sentence to um or a couple of sentences to 1.1.7 uh policy just letting you know it's just a reminder that if you do make any amendment to your future land you snap your local map you need to also submit it to the county so that it can be we have a countywide plan map that everybody has to be consistent with so if you make a change to your local future then you snap we have to make a change to our map as well and that's just a reminder that that's that's kind of my law problems no okay continue please okay did not just cover that topic of we took out everything in yellow it was impacted by primarily and totally right right okay so six on six we removed the resort facilities over Lake Resort okay right but we leave that other highlighted sentencing okay page eight uh is where I tried to capture I'm sorry could I provide so now you've gone past some point that I wanted to ask about the short page is fine and um this way you've got primary uses and then recreation facility semicolon public beach water access I'd like to add slash Merino open space where are you at uh it's bad by is that what your Marina is designated I'd like to do slash Marina I'm just checking the map to verify what designation you have today it's residential low if that's if it's residential low does that mean that a house could be built on that so that has to be something that's addressed in the vision as we talk about the marina then unless we want to see a house built there the reason it's allowed in residential low this is a little bit confusing because there are land uses that are allowed under each category and then there are land use category names and sometimes there's overlap between those so what we were just talking about is a the recreation open space category which is typically you would apply it to Parks or recreational uses but underneath your residential categories you're also allowed to have residential open space uses and a marina is defined as a residential open space use so you could put it either under the recreational open space category or under one of your residential chemicals so if we go to 1.1.7 that on page six you could potentially amend that land use category to go from residential low to Recreation yes yes typically the property owner is the one that initiates that it is possible to initiate it as a local government but it's more legally oh it's a city okay then you're free to make that event so if we if we change it from residential low to Recreation it eliminates any potential in the future for residential use depending on what the permitted use is within the recreational District you're contemplating on it doesn't mind there's no residential again yeah so is that what you're getting there what I'm trying to do is make sure the marina is recognized as a marina city-owned Arena and as this says recreation facility for you know we got public beach our public water accesses and the marina and did it always say the Marines that's appropriate does anybody see a big problem the board with aiding that Marina yeah I think it helps clarify the long-term use of that area there and it removes confusion if somebody comes in an investor comes in kind of offers the city four million and five million dollars for that because they want to put something residential this would prevent that from happening it would always be here to the benefit of the citizens and I've got no skin in the game I don't I don't use the marina both of us live underwater but if you're looking at the map of the city there's a significant number of landlocked lot lots on in the city and we've got one little facility down there with how many slips available 18 18 for all of those people I mean not only do I think it should be designated permanent where we're suggesting by doing this as it is but at some point down the road that the rental of it and I guess that's the city council that it'd be for only residents I made the same note when we get down to the marina here okay so for this point only that um my motion is to add slash Marina to the end of recreation facility there's been a motion made is there a sec check any further discussion would you repeat the motion but on Page Six um page five under Recreation Open Spaces recreation facility sinkhole and public beach slash water access after water access we add slash Marina any further discussion to follow that don't we also need to make a motion to change the classification or category no that is not something you can do during this process it would have to be done separately but once you get past this process I can help you with that all those in favor opposed motion carry day at the word Maria excitation uh we left off at page eight six somebody had something they're just looking at on page six it says um and we're talking about fars and isrs where it says a par of 0.65 on ISR 0.85 but on the previous page five it says no few sellers the afford area like far of 0.25 and an ISR of 60. under Recreation open space it's 60. the the 85 refers to the institutional category okay thank you [Applause] are there any other questions before we get to page eight okay uh top of the page policy 1.1.10 is intended to capture the discussion about preserving the marina that originally was down below in policy 1.2.2 that objective covers incompatible and inconsistent uses which was sort of a negative so I took the more positive statement about the marina and put it in the objective above that that's why it moved and it would that be where we put the language says in in effect you were saying Rudy is there's a whole lot more slips here than I mean a whole lot more people here than there are slips and and that at all times full-time resonance not just property owner but full-time owner residence should have priority number one priority on the slip period because you could I looked at it said well you could have an owner resident you could have a part-time occupied you could have a property owner non-resident and then a non-resident and it gets complexes I'll get out but it seems that I now listen to the council meeting the other night the workshop I thought Shirley's recommendation that you come up with uh here's here's the flat rate for that slip and give the owners the the option I'll pay that or I won't you know if if that's what the city is concerning but number one should be this is for a owner resident I you know here full time they should always have priority on that now it's for their benefit I'm not sure about that if you own property I think you should have the residents should have the right the owner should have a right to rent but he's doing it as an investment not because he's chooses we're in a word Smith situation here well now's the time to do it you mean almost slip no no no no no I think what we're talking about is let's say I come in and I I buy a house here and then I turn around and I run it out I never live there so I live over in I live in Tampa and I want to have a place I don't think that person should have some priorities of someone who is a full-time living restaurant can I add something I'd like to comment from one of um the crowd quick quick guidance hibiscus Drive West just stopped me where I'm out of bounds on that uh this this question because I don't know where the comprehensive plan goes in regards to death excited to hear you all are looking so far out and protecting that land here's how other cities deal with like situations one we all have limited number of slips per the number of residents name the city it applies you've established you want that land long term for that use perfect other cities don't go to the granular use or the language and I don't know if it applies in comprehensive plans or it becomes a council setting regulations and guidelines what they do is do use language like priority number one first but supply and demand dictates that you need to have safety nets and that means secondary would be property owner not primary resident and third fallback having those lists of buckets of people that put their names on every list in every Marina so you you want to be careful of just excluding yourself from residence because we have seen times in Economic Times and I can tell you twice in the last 20 years slips are empty so you're going down the right path don't know where Randy the exercise needs to be limited because some of this is Council decision I'm assuming so just wanted to add how others do it I'd like to refer to the attorney can we as a committee limit what type of Resident can rent this slip what type of property owner can rent a slip short answer not in the comp plan and that's not really the charge of this body what you're talking about has to do with administrative policies typically addressed in a resolution or something of the sort what you can do for example is and and I know that this sounds very high-minded and you know um esoteric but there is a value in doing these sorts of things in a comp plan is if you've already modified one thing on page five saying you wish for this is your recreational District having a policy or an objective that states something to the city shower being committed to the preservation of its res of its recreational infrastructure for the benefit of its property owners and residents period you've already lumped this into its recreational infrastructure otherwise presuming that's adopted and now you're saying like we wish to preserve generally speaking we wish to preserve this for the we wish to preserve our recreational infrastructure our Trails our Bridge whatever that is at pickleball Park whatever you have tennis courts for the benefit of residents and Property Owners a policy objective like that is more in line with how an issue like what you're discussing is addressed in a comprehensive plan typically and while I am not a planner I'm an attorney it's Believe It or Not There are distinct Ms Fisher is that in line with your understanding as a planner yes that would uh my recognition would be similar that you keep the language very high level and give priority to it uh to to Residents I don't have as much heartburn with including the marina but I wouldn't put it in the land use portion because it's really not a land use tissue that would go more in the recreation open space element so we can address it later on in the in the recreation you can when when you say address it you can address it in the manner that we're kind of talking about not addressing the demands of saying here's how we're going to put the the tier of the hierarchies and Order and flow that's for the commission and management to decide from my perspective the issue is trying to provide some sort of guidance to the commission to the city manager so that there's there's a clear way of working through who gets the slip limb and that it becomes static not something that changes with each each commission so if we can that was pretty clear yeah he said thank you carry on okay we're not at the recreation open space element yet but before we forget is that something that it's the desire this board to include in the recreation Recreation open space element foreign so that was policy 1.1.10 and um moving down to policy 1.2.1 there is an existing policy about Motel uses shall not be permitted to expand Motel is a pretty specific term so my suggestion is to broaden that to non-conforming Temporary lodging uses that would include any kind of hotel or condo hotel that doesn't conform to your plan oh I'd like to see that defined a little better not conforming temporary logic um I'm sure you understand that there's a professional but to me it's not confirming with what does it imply that there is conforming character launching series here well I wrote that word non-conforming in there because we've to go along with the potential suggestion for adding that Resort facility to Overlay that we're now not going to do that now let's put the word Motel back in motels last time Sarah slash anything that isn't Motown Motown yeah but we that's not all that we have we've got motels we've got time shares oh I know that temporary lodging excuse me I've lost my voice all of a sudden temporary lodging covers all those things okay um you don't have a definition section in your comp plan but I can add one to your data analysis I apologize for my voice um you would use the same definitions as are currently in the county-wide plan Again by countywide law you need to do that so if there's a question of how something is defined in your plan you can just refer to the county web plan but I can also take those definitions and put them in your data analysis that's all right so that's all seems the mind to me so far if you take out non-conforming and just make a temporary lodging doesn't that cover both conforming and non-conforming then foreign ostensibly yes I will tell you that that is a distinction with a difference generally ordinarily understood to be a distinction with a difference such that you're better off ordinarily addressing non-conformities explicitly when you're addressing non-conformities because they are an aberration from the norm you wish to make sure you are making it explicit to any party reading it that you knew that you were either usually conjunctive conformities and non-conformities or call them out specifically but just sort of saying I'm sure it's kind of clear we need to add that I think creates more problems on them on the back end so what are you saying we believe it as motel or non-conforming temporary logic I don't make policy recommendations like that ultimately that's as frustrating as that is I ultimately what you folks wish to do is up to you how how you accomplish that I can help with um but if the intent is to include hotels motels condo hotels anything of that sort contemporary lodging is an umbrella term that's an establishment well your definition of what non-conforming is in the rear wouldn't cover that and non-conforming is a use that is not currently permitted by your comp plan or Land Development all right sounds good that sounds fine okay okay so we're leaving do we need emotions on that no because you can add it to it this is not something yeah so we're just going to leave it the way it's currently drafted okay okay all right on page nine there was just a typo correction okay yeah the next highlighted term is on page 14. on page 12 before I get there um because the NPO should not be on number seven thank you all right um so page 14 this was just something that was mentioned in passing when we went over the subjective and policy last time about how to deal with e-bikes and whether they're different from regular bikes so I'm suggesting just adding a policy saying the city will coordinate with Ford Pinellas and neighboring jurisdictions to regulate the state term is micro Mobility devices and that includes e-bikes and scooters so that's suggested language can the city can the city if it wants see no mic what do you call Micro micromatology can you say no micro Mobility devices can it be more restrictive than Pinellas County's importance yes no yes um it can be done by ordinance in terms of what our code says we allow and don't allow and that's a more recent development as recently as 2021 was when we gained the ability to prohibit them for example on our beaches and in 2020 the ability to provide them on roads and sidewalks but that's an ordinance regulation not a comp plan regulation and so again it's it's the distinction between the sort of high-minded we wish to coordinate with Ford Pinellas and assert whatever statutory Authority we have to regulate and then later we Implement what that regulation looks like because this is these are not our Land Development regulations these are not our codes of ordinances we don't in our comp plan we're not going to say the skate park closes at four but we can later adopt an ordinance or resolution saying sorry Escape our closest four and in our comp plan we say something like skatepark shall be opened during maintained during reasonable hours for enjoyable Recreation and then you do the hard work later my experience is is Prejudice I haven't been over in Fort Lauderdale for 30 years and the e-bikes over there became a disaster oh people couldn't walk on sidewalks bikes couldn't ride in the bike lanes and the city tried to get them tried to get them banned but couldn't are you okay Linda Oh I thought all right I appreciate the offering I don't know I don't want to dominate this no does the e-bike bother anybody else or scooters I think it's covered by ordinances too law enforcement as far as I'm concerned and ordinances I don't believe that your community while I don't have an encyclopedic knowledge of all of your code restrictions I don't believe your community presently regulates it it does have the ability to regulate it whether it has the desire is it a different discourse and of course all of you as private citizens have the ability to say beyond the comp plan discussion to go to your represent your your Council people and say hey this is an issue I'd like you to take up look at whatever um you always have redress just as the broader discussion on on the marina and weightless and the like is happening outside of this context so the same is true for this or any other issue from a comp plan perspective it would if you wish to address micro Mobility at all um within the whether that be in the recreation or Transportation only wherever it best best suited um that would be it would be appropriate to address it if you wish to it's not inappropriate it's also not required it's ultimately up to you what you folks want in your in your company I think it's just there's so many ordinances in law enforcement to cover these things okay and again it's just a suggestion um I did put in the phrase neighboring communities because this these are conversations that are happening up and down the Barrier Islands um and so if you decide to go in that direction as a community you don't have to reinvent the wheel you can coordinate with what everybody else has done and before canals can help with that process by stating it this way it doesn't restrict us from being more restricted correct okay all right man uh so I'm sorry it's the desire to keep this language in or take it away I don't see anything wrong with it whatsoever is anybody on the board okay thank you yeah this policy 1.5.2 I really don't like the word benefit economically it's for we're not looking to benefit we're not what we're actually looking for is funds to compensate us for having to have additional police control traffic or security patrols or things like that because of that huge amount of track can we reword that just to not say we're looking to benefit economically we're looking to cover cost of probably having to have increased police controls and traffic controls and security patrols and things like that thank you for pointing that out because I I should have highlighted objective 1.3 and the policies under it in my page 13. yes Santa page 13 I apologize I miss highlighting that one but that did come from the discussion that we had last and I remembered I misnumbered the second policy so thank you for catching that um what you're going to do you're going to take that out let's if we can go back to page 13 right that objective 1.3 at the bottom and this was um again from the discussion last month the city recognizes that traffic congestion resulting from increased development on Clearwater Beach has had negative impacts on the mobility and quality of like its residents and shall seek means to address this issue so that's just it we don't want to get more specific because through no that's pretty sure yeah all right two out um we can um I'm just going through them in order and then 1.3.1 just says the city shall work with Ford Pinellas Pinellas County in the city of Clearwater to explore means of decreasing or diverting southbound traffic into Bellar Beach and Clearwater Beach and that's the same course issue that was in the minutes um and again the the question about benefiting economically that was the same discussion that came up in the minutes that doesn't have to be in there but that was a phrase that was used the the operative benefits economically is it it's not that we're trying to benefit economically from it we want to control right we've got costs we're in current and should we be the ones to bear that whether it's an inconvenient or additional cost in police or whatever yeah but what I'm just saying is the words benefit economically to me don't say that we're looking for compensation as opposed to benefiting control increased traffic or explore opportunities for funding to mitigate the traffic something like that rather than we're asking to benefit economically but you know you just keep talking about Clearwater but Indian Rocks Beach is building as fast as they can too so we're going to have to work with our Indie Rocks Beach neighbors I mean they're building knocking down little buildings and buildings as fast as they can go yeah isn't that just what we were talking about doing it falls right back on the traffic when you when the word toll popped up if I could change Clearwater Beach to neighboring communities that's what I would do we're getting hit from every angle okay okay um you know make the same change in 1.3.1 where it says city of Clearwater [Music] and then policy which should be 1.3.2 will say the city shall explore the means uh shall explore funding to mitigate the cost of increased traffic flows into Bellar Beach from neighboring communities all right so that's page 14. the next change is on page 16. and this was where I had a table of Swift modes projections for the city's water use that showed 100 seconds paid 15 subjective 1.2 there's a period in there is a it's a necessary first one minute effort to maintain comma at a period thank you okay um so on page 16 originally we had in the table of projected water use from Swift Mud that showed that the uh the city's actual projected water use was I believe it was 97 gallons per capita per day it was the wish of this board to go back to using the county adopted portable water standard which is 115 gallons per capita per day so this highlighted language from 1.1.4 just restores the original language you had in there and just adds a date so that we know what water what county water supply facilities work plan we're talking about now once we get to the data and Analysis I've still included that table in there just for informational purposes but it doesn't affect that policy all right okay on page 19 I just have a question on 17 and padding call you my band it says that we provide educational on 17 1.2 it says the city provides educational brochures so that the residents can Implement water conservation do we have brochures or is that on our website let me find out the county has more brochures available I'm curious if we're actually doing that or if it's all on our website now we should change the language I'm sure we can get it on the website if it's not but the brochure is may not be available I could change the word brochures to information that's probably better so we don't have to coverage a lot of sins yeah okay um so now moving into the coastal management and conservation element report 19. yeah okay at the top of the page policy 1.1.7 there was a discussion of um the current policy has boating speed limits in water less than four feet in depth and it was pointed out that that's not entirely inaccurate um place to have reduced voting speed limits so I just changed it to designated Manatee protection areas I'm still not happy with that a paragraph reduced speed limits will be set in they're already there called slow speed minimum wage zones and it goes out 300 feet from feet the issue is really enforcement they're already there the problem is they're not being enforced so um I was looking at maybe where it says reduce speed limits will be enforced and slow speed will be enforced and thank you foreign does the city have responsibility in poor centers that's strictly an ethical C issue we sold our vote yeah we rely on the sheriff and they have Sheriff so so is that even anything that should be in our our comprehensive plan because it took it's a it's already a long place no wakes are already established and we don't have control on I don't think we do so the policy is to coordinate with appropriate agencies so that would be if you think that enforcement is not sufficient currently then this means that you will reach out to the appropriate agency or the city will and let them know that it's not being enforced and are we getting too too uh too specific should we just say coordinate with the appropriate authorities for all boating regulations and then it covers whether you're in a manatee zone or a no wake or a slow speed or whatever we should just be able to call the the water sheriff's department or FWC and they should handle it from there try it I do it daily okay that's I I look on the very end of Belle Isle point and uh Belle Isle Avenues that finger stays out into Clearwater Harbor farther than any of the others so the closest traffic when people coming south from Clearwater area or north from Indian Rocks that is the point they go by and it's established the city has already established that from 300 feet out from the sea wall there's a buoy a line of buoys unfortunately there's three and they're about 200 yards apart and the voters totally ignored them and I've had offshore Racers come by my dock 20 feet off the end of the dock at 60 miles an hour rattling the windows that doesn't happen frequently but every day jet skiers boats fishing boats high-speed boats of all kinds are running through that zone and there are kayakers there might manatees so I called the Sheriff's Department they don't come out we'll check they don't say um water and navigation to put up more buoys bring more attention to it because that's really the issue nothing's happened so um so I keep saying one of these days there's going to be a serious boating accident there for people coming out of the fingers on both sides and here comes a boat bind just moving so fast that you can't react or that other boat can't react because the timing is going to be so quick that when it happens it's just going to be explosion so gotten that through syndrome I see it every day nothing that's happened to it so that's where I was saying reduce vote reduce voting speed limits which are already there don't need to be set will be enforced and does it end will be enforced in designated Manatee protection areas and slow speed minimum wages that's what I was trying to say earlier where the word is set wouldn't be enforced change to enforced and after Manatee protection areas and slow speed minimum wage zones motion I'm from a second coordinated with appropriate agencies to make sure it's enforced yeah does it because are we putting the illness then on the city to afford home and I don't disagree with appropriate agencies yeah we can talk about that is there a second now discussion if what what I don't disagree with what you're saying it is an issue but does this language is this language going to change what's happening in any way well it's to me it clarifies the situation and we're saying that in addition to manatees it should also it just happens to be addressing manatees that the city shall coordinate with appropriate agencies which means essentially the sheriff's department and and wc so the situation that you're describing is you've been reaching out to them as a private citizen and you haven't gotten results what this is saying is that the city will do it more attention on it as a citizen you can remind them that this policy is in there and and this has been in there in some form this is not a new policy we're adding today um but you can remind them that um they have stated that they will do this again um if you could read it one more time I'm going to start with okay I'll do an old paragraph 1.1.7 since 19 is occasionally frequent Clearwater Harbor near Bel Air Beach the city shall coordinate with appropriate agencies to ensure that reduced voting speed limits will be strike set and enforced in designated Manatee protection areas and slow speed minimum wave zones okay I have got all that any further discussion goes in favor aye opposed show mode thank you um the next changes are on page 24. can we look at page 20 real quick policy 1.2.3 this is talking about the marina again that very last sentence is that conflicting with the other change we just made on page eight except for the yacht club Beller Beach Marina this is basically saying the the city shall be residential except it can also have a marina but it's discouraging commercial uses or um or Redevelopment of okay actually I'm sorry let me read this more closely okay this is a confusing sentence potential except for that it's so cool right this one I would say this is Ambiguously worded you could read it as Shelby residential except for the marina or you can read it as non-residential units um shall be discouraged from redeveloping except from the marina which implies that we're encouraging redeveloping the marina so I agree this needs to be Rewritten why is it called The Yacht Club um yeah what a development the wells family right was that their name the wells development or Mills we wanted to build the Bellaire Beach Yacht Club you want to get into a a long ambiguous convoluted well I think that opens up the what's that land donated or not and I don't think it was maybe submerged land was but that's for another day that's how we're getting around point of order I don't have anything to do with this situation you're going to straighten it out with the logistics with the words yes so the desire is to preserve the residential character and preserve the marina and I will make sure this reflects that okay thank you are there any other changes before we get to 24. okay policy 1.9.5 it was capturing a comment that was made at the last meeting about undergrounding and utilities policy 1.9.5 got it oh and I apologize that should be 1.8.5 I need to learn to count I'll fix that okay um does that capture the conversation we had last time carry on okay well so are you looking at 1.95 8.4 I'm sorry okay I misnumbered that policy it is it should be 1.8.4 the second policy on page 24. I sometimes I'm a little indecisive with which objective best fits a policy and I move them around and occasionally I apparently forget to remember them so I'm sorry is this where we can add a the city it's foreign opportunities to obtain funding for these types of um it says seek opportunities so it could it could you could add funding seek opportunities for funding to relocate or Harden infrastructure like grants or I wouldn't be very specific but I think um seek opportunities for funding would cover that okay okay and on 1.8.3 this is a adult living facilities well we had talked about a group home yes and um when we get to the data analysis where we talk about housing I could not find any evidence that that group home is still here from the Pao is that that was the discussion last time too that I think that was the belief that the group home was no longer here in the city I can look into it as well yeah I didn't see any classification from the Property Appraiser's office that indicated there was one here in England so this would prevent them from being here in the future to it's the vision would be they won't be able to get them here in the future but the one that you thought was here if it's not there anymore then it would be non-conforming so it couldn't be rebuilt is that correct uh could be re-established as a Groupon this really refers to new such facilities um if something were here already it would be grandfathered right um but there is also a kind of an escape Clause at the end of that policy unless adequate Provisions for safe and efficient evacuation or shelter are insured I think we should buy so it's not a complete prohibition it's hot do we know the history Hunter because I don't I don't know how long it's been or how I even got there the group home I don't know anything so I'd have to do some information it was in the initial the one from 2015 or 2016. this uh that language was in your plan that said yeah that's okay okay at this point I'm gonna call for a five minute recess surprised not to discuss anything on relating to the public hearing during the races [Applause] Linda um there is one more change on page to correct the names of the flood zones to a e and v e and I believe that is actually the last thing I had to cover in the goals objectives and policies from last last time [Applause] moving into the maps section I'm sorry I added a map at the request of the board there's a map seven that is the structure condition map and that just Maps out the Property Appraiser's office designation of the condition of different properties we talk in the data analysis a required thing that we have to include in the data analysis is the condition of residential structures there's a statement in the data analysis that there are no residential structures that are below average and that is correct but this map does have a category for fair because there are um apparently some properties that came up as as Fair so um I need to do a little more work on this map because the Property Appraiser's office data is not complete in terms of how they've drawn the parcels so I need to fix those lines but I will this is just an informational map that the the board request can I ask you a question on the soils Max yes I tried to find out what matchler and Palm Beach reference and I present Maxwell is an island down off of Cape Coral it's 750 residents but there's no records anywhere for what Maxwell soil means or beaches Palm Beach by definition okay I can get those and have them and specifically is there any negative connotation to any of these soils if you would no it's something that's mentioned in the statutes this type of supportive data to provide um is it for hyperculation purposes and just for appropriateness of putting structures okay on the land but I can certainly get those definitions and include them in the data analysis yeah I'm kind of thinking for insurance purposes careful what we put in there yeah natural soil I might fall in the same category as somebody with a sinkhole under this property that kind of thing this is really not a critical map so if it's not the desire to keep it in here I have removed it for some other local governments because nobody really knows she doesn't care what this means so I can I can actually take this out if you don't want it in there leave it in yeah but if you could find those definitions who created this your company uh I made the map but the data came from the national resources conservation service their federal bureau okay so just if you want to do with this whole definition okay are we having General discussion we will as soon as Linda gets finished there's just a couple changes in the data and Analysis first one is on page A5 and that's just a reference to that new map oh there are four hours right so that is um okay yeah any questions on that yeah so that was the question the last sentence before the table five both are owned and maintained by Pinellas County and donate for work A4 and that is where I will add uh the level of service definitions and I apologize for missing that I'm sorry you're going to do what I'm going to add the level of service definitions yes but for them to say who who is saying I'm sorry who is who is saying both are currently operating below their adopted level of service at the adopted level of service is D there's a column for that and then and I I believe that is spelled out and your goal's objectives and policies well your question who was determined who who is the the body that has determined that we're operating below those adopted levels going back to your right the concern we've had about traffic they certainly haven't but sending out a little Gulf Boulevard and Bellaire Beach okay we'll say that so the city the city is the one that adopts the level of service and then the operating a level of service is calculated by the mpo forward Pinellas determines what level of service each road is operating at how do they determine them they count the number of cars there each roadway has a capacity for the number of cars that it can accommodate comfortably uh that's and um do they count on the weekends they do peak hour there's an AM and PM peak hour which is your the largest traffic flow that you have during uh during the um during the week is it an average of of the 24 hour seven day cycle or is it is it measuring Peak only it's measuring an average of the peak hour for every day of the exagger day of the year and to find people pressure so there's an AM and PM geek yeah when's the last time they well it says 2022 so they did it in 2022. well they published they published the report in 2022 I believe it's the data year of that report is a year behind um because they published it in the middle of 2022 so they used the last complete calendar year they had was 2021. can we request from the county uh counts all they do is put a meter with a tape across I mean a tube across the road right and it's got a camera um I don't believe they even do that anymore it's done by cell phone data research is done to show the um right the percentage of people that will have their cell phone on on an average roadway of that type and then they'll take the number of cell phone hits that they count and then add an additional factor for the expected people who don't have their phones we get it on a Hong Kong the the issue may be the designation maybe Z is not the right loss we want until we see the the definitions but maybe the Los is the problem and I'm looking in here and I'm not something that's worse is that how we're interpreting it yes is that the horse category yeah that's the that's the lowest um that's stop and go traffic basically but I have to I may have to amend that because I'm not seeing where it doesn't specifically say that your loss is D it just says deficient roads shall include those operating at peak hour level of service E and F so I I got adopted Los D I kind of back to that out there um so I convert that to match the language of the policy they'll be called deficient roadways though that's that is the light that's a county-wide language that everybody uses efficient to the traffic flow yes okay okay can she can we request the county do a actual account by putting one of those machines and take across the roads do they have such a I don't know but I can ask my co-workers who work on the transportation side all right who wants to do those kind of spring break I'd be willing to change if they'll let me let us put it across the road through our own account yeah we used to have a person that that was his whole job was to go lay those cables out on the runway major roads all around the county that he retired and we switched to the Bluetooth but Bluetooth is very accurate I mean that's what all the applications run off of these days so your map system on your phone that gives you that really accurate time prediction is from that data I guess I'm almost cool I'm sure they have numbers that they can compare but they couldn't a sheriff do that for us because everybody knows what the the lines are oh they have calibers on them the ones that the show should be your speed is yeah does that have a caliber on it it might I can ask the captain you can find out yeah I'd like to see some weekend numbers not just if it's all you could see Power it's only doing Monday through Friday ice and our problem is the weekends Maple which is one of our suggestions that we have an actual count I'll get more information I believe peak hour varies with the roadway so that if you have a roadway that is more congested and weekends then peak hour should just be the most active hour of the world okay you're gonna get that information for us including what the loss means including what are the weekend numbers if we don't have them can we get it okay all right um any uh questions before page A7 A5 um d Housing um that language is there still we have one residential group home yes and I didn't actually get a chance to update that for this version because I hadn't finished my uh looking into it at the time but I will um I will take that out anything on A6 okay A7 is just where I updated that language on potable water to reflect that the city is adopting the county standard of 115 gallons per capita per day but that the actual water use is projected to be 79 gallons per capita and that table that I originally had in Miracles objectives and policies I just moved it here why do we need the actual water use um just shows you're being good stewards of your water supply and let me take it okay that is all I have [Applause] that's excellent thank you is there any further questions if we had to blend of any board member so much okay yeah but look look that's a good shot the whole concept of we have a County Planning organization and each Community is supposed to develop its Transportation facilities in direct correlation to its density and traffic flow and what happened and we've got this source County called Belair Beach that has not increased its Road capacity one iota and since it started I mean it's always been two lanes all the way through but these high density hotels are still going up weekly there's a new one going up and it continues and they're not doing anything with the roads or the ability to handle that traffic other than just siphon it off through other communities so that's why I was asking Randy before who's the agency that looks at these comprehensive plans and says yeah that makes sense and they're following it and they're doing the right thing when Clearwater Beach obviously isn't so so you're saying clear water should be forced somehow to handle the traffic through their own area without having it bleed off everywhere else right and we're we're the ones who are on the shore industry because we said this is going to be the the the type of City we want to be like why should we handle everybody else's traffic we can't determine our own future someone else is doing it and my recommendation is again to speak with your Ford Pinellas representative you can come as Citizens to be heard at our Fort Collins board meetings you can come any month and talk about any topic um but the Ford canals is the countywide agency that does intergovernmental coordination and does Transportation Planning and land use so we are the ones that need to hear your voice so as I was asking Randy is there any governmental body or agency or someone that looks at these comprehensive plants and cease violations like that or sees sore thumb situations like that and can actually go and say hey you're not living up you've got to do something and do it now rather than we just talk about it all the time we don't have an enforcement mechanism so at my level we can't make the city do anything the State Department of Economic Opportunity has if if a local government is violating their own comprehensive plan uh and citizens raise a challenge then they have the ability to do some enforcement although and I'm going to look at you Randy I believe it has to be citizens of that local government raising the issue is that correct typically yes that's a release to consistency challenges and what you know just for clarity what you're considering a violation that is your subjective conclusion that it is in fact a violation it may not actually be violated of their procedures Maybe by leave of Notions of good neighbors or you know responsible stewardship but it is not that those Notions are not necessarily legal violations which is a different analysis altogether the reality is that you have various jurisdictions probably about 11 that I can think of that are all along the county road and so your ability as any one jurisdiction to regulate what another is doing on their little stretch when they're better than their own regard is admittedly limited your frustration is not that doesn't mean it's not valid I'm just telling you that you know the the idea that we have identified a violation is presumptuous in a general sense but in a sense of we can do better in Pinellas County she's saying please let Ford Pinellas know that give us that feedback but we are also the most densely populating in the state of Florida so do we think we should suggest a council that there be a committee specifically set up I've got a few ask the residents they'd say yes but but a group of people or a person um even if it's a professional personally it goes to this board and points out these issues and also you know get these traffic numbers real traffic numbers and take them and should we suggest the council that we need somebody or person who do this for us you should this is coming into our suggestions right let's continue with them yeah it can at the end when I want to hit everybody and have some issues yes okay uh this number four review of proposed ordinance through amends section 94 zoning [Music] good behind it all so it's separate and distinct from the comp plan discussion with all deference to the chair my recommendation if there's if there's any other input that relates to the comprehensive plan that we make sure that we've resolved that before we move to the next agenda item I think Jason bye so before we go to four finish up one forward yeah we're still on three there's still three for clarity in the record and for the for the benefit of the chair item four is a proposed ordinance that has to do with the Land Development code that is has nothing to do with the comp plan item three is your comp plan review um and at the outset of this discourse we suggested we need to make sure we have consensus direction we certainly got that on any everything this Fisher said I wasn't clear I don't think staff is clear whether any of the members had other things they wish to raise relative to the comp plan specifically because that was sort of the second half of this so I was saying it was backwards all right we wouldn't put that under suggestions and we can follow up afterwards just said with each board member making her suggestions on adding to the comprehensive plan from their observations right yeah so so the question is are there individual board members who have editions yes to discuss so I'll start right now with our vice chair well um yes I will the heart so I had a question or Capital Improvement should is that where we would what I'm specifically interested in doing is seeing that the city looks at renewable energy opportunities this is brought about by the discussion on the generator are there other things that that the city could be doing solar power on this building that long term offset our our operating costs and and give us better reliability and in the event of a power loss is that where this should could be is that something that that is in the city's best interest to explore um for those who remember when former mayor charged the planning a Tony's board with looking at all the property and productive Revenue we had a whole package in there where we had brought in a solar device company and [Music] that information is the revenue it would generate is then still in that package isn't that Friday I'd have to uh look at it but yeah solar to a battery Bank you know these new Tesla battery packs but we can even go net what's called a a net metering system which means you recognized the the Savings instantaneously in that in that in that month um and and the cost of going solar has come way down way down and and now with this new infrastructure bill that was passed the incentives I don't know if they apply to a city or not but there's a 30 percent credit um that that you're eligible for when you install these systems we did it at the house we put 73 panels on and we dropped from 650 a month down to 44 a month plus we get a check back because we're generating way more wattage than we use we'll get a check back every March and and if these things are available and we're looking for ways to reduce our our overhead is is renewable energy something that we should explore not not for Revenue generation I remember that I mean it's more to offset our operating costs and the battery if you went to a battery backup yes it could give you resource during Hurricane and power loss the batteries aren't we've got a ways to go I think before batteries are Advanced and affordable and dependable probably another five or six years ago yeah but getting onto the net metering could be really beneficial to the city's operating costs well that's just suggestion coming from you to look at at renewable energy options sure in in in our day-to-day operations clean energy that is a policy you can include in your Kaplan for consultment I would recommend to keep the language very general if I could drop something yeah that's what I'm getting at is it have to be General and then then get more into the details that you could even get into where you've got EVS on the we don't run miles on our rigs around here on our trucks and stuff like that and and so at the time we allocate reserves for for the next new truck should we be looking at something that's more renewable based rather than petroleum invasion okay Rudy I'm done yeah are you not ready yet I added everything I want to add today is there consensus endorsement of that policy objective of concerning the pursuit of renewable resources yes I cycled that no he can't do that I wasn't trying to I wasn't trying just trying to make sure before we go through and then vote on over one of them at one time this is a suggestion it's your meetings thank you now you had something yes you did that you wanted to emphasize no what what was it you forgot okay I mean I've covered so many points what was it something I said previously no it was uh in reference to the traffic that was that should be suggested completely yes from that board yes one that we have someone who's a direct contact or is direct contact or actively in touch with the board transportation and look for any ways the city can correct some of the issues mitigate some of the issues of the bridge yeah on the bridge on Gulf Boulevard traffic whatever yeah there are policies drafted already about coordinating with Ford Pinellas and neighboring jurisdictions to address that issue but if you'd like I can put it again in the intergovernmental coordination I would like to believe what your suggestion is there's a specific committee or person yeah within our city is rather than leaving it in here generically yeah okay or looked into a lot of times you you're working with these governmental boards or English governmental entity you need someone who's been there done that and is almost a consultant level and look into the cost of such a thing even if it's on you know very defined basis okay um I have relating to the traffic situation I don't know if we can do it just a thought uh traffic light at 22nd Avenue which is only to be used during high peak times the majority of Bellaire Beach residents can get in and out they're um I think 19th Street has access to 22nd so there there are some streets that will not have access to 22nd um maybe that would help the traffic flow a little bit Yeah 18th South with 18 to the causeway is they're just Loops they're going to have that problem but possibly until 19th exactly through Harrison right can use that light right the light would create a gap on on if this traffic's coming down this way and the light at 20 seconds comes on so that the people can come out at 22nd the folks to the to the south of that would get some benefit out of that depending on what's coming north exactly well yeah there would be gaps that they could make make that look into the material just let it roll around in your head and just shoot some holes through it so you just point to when I was on the bridge committee and the bridge was built the condos wanted a traffic light at the base of the bridge because they can't get out because solid lines of traffic they're elderly most of them elderly they can't get out to make petition the county to put a light there the county said from their traffic studies that it doesn't qualify to have a life if they can't get the light I guarantee when we can't get away based on whatever staff we go back it's just suggestion then we go back to those counting and we get we at peak times we're being impacted because of War infrastructure Planning by Clearwater and what's going on to the South that's forcing people around this way the issue is how do we get the county to support us and mitigate the traffic problems that they have allowed to occur and I think that's where your committing person or whatever might come in and talk into a Pinellas forward or whatever yeah okay um so the only thing I would just have to say with you yours and yours is that we explore the city Explorer funding sources for the traffic situation and undergrounding because I think you bought it at last time had had there been a discussion about grants or whatever for undergrounding I think we use Pinellas penny for Pinellas now for Gulf Boulevard then the president's already set for the residential communities to have to pay out of pocket if there's any way to keep that from happening I mean we bit the dust and paid for ours but there's a lot of people who can't afford that in our population is getting older and we need to think about that okay so explore funding to assist with the managing of traffic flow and underground and utilities the city should take advantage of control funding and grant opportunities and it's an implementation of long-term plan so that would be under Capital Improvement function where everybody we've done a fairly good job of that and we start to look at what grants are actually available to us have been in some of the cases what you have to give up for that Grant it really isn't worth it I know Lynn was very diligent about that and he was pretty knowledgeable about it for you would you agree yeah I would agree yeah so how's it look that I was involved no opinion for Pinellas to give us money for Gulf Boulevard is that well they have been given this significant funding for have the interpretation and looked under that was undergrounding we right so we have been getting is just our share based on 24 miles of Beach and who's getting the money and so forth is just okay we got four from there and I'd like to add one uh turkey Theory this is a matter of record uh it's in relevance to the traffic flow and it was there should be some way to put up some kind of a sign or something on the Gulf Boulevard to let the side streets come off yield something yield to that side streets yield to the residents so they can get out on the street the longer at that line and off the Record it's just it just surprised me to we get so congested and then they put palm trees in the middle of the street and it just wandered when you exit the city and with a hurricane you had three ways to go out three lanes going out now you got two I just don't understand some of the situations it looks pretty but if you're going to leave you've got to leave so plus what does an ambulance do who comes up on Gulf Boulevard and what's we got bumper bumper traffic in both lanes and it's trying to get to a street to get to somebody and there was an island in the middle of the country called the island with a tree staring at you what I'd like to do is right now call for a motion to accept the suggestions to the referred from this committee on our comprehensive plan well you're gonna put those in anyhow right so it's yeah [Music] subject to your consensus Direction and also subject to what a comp plan is and what that language looks like and I only say that because three of the recommendations were specific here's how we can manage the traffic what's going to light at this intersection or something like that and that's not what a comp plan typically reflects it would reflect division towards find innovative solutions and alternative means to address congestion and traffic maintenance in the city's corporate boundaries language like that um so she you know working together will find language like that um the the the the proposals that were closer to just general comp plan visioning was the exploration of removable Energy Solutions and exploration of additional funding sources or resources for you know traffic and integrative innovative solutions or undergrounding Solutions said so yeah I just wish to make clear that providing your consensus direction is like yeah we're generally good with everything we just said what the end product might will be won't be and put a light at 19 for example sounds like an attorney imagine the audacity we hope for consensus on the topics that were made and have forward Nellis and Patty draft him up and Randy and I'll just want to hear a second a second that much all those in favor opposed motion carry now I don't know what this review of coordinates of section 94 is only is on this agenda would you like to explain that to the committee Mr chair um so that completes the discussion on the comprehensive plan Ms Fisher thank you for all your time on that and for this body's meaningful discourse as a reminder there will be a third hearing on that which will be noticed in everything else this ordinance is some ordinances are bottom up which is to say a resident or some other need says hey I'd like this considered some are just the commission says this is what we want to do and some are top down as I would as I would qualify them this is more of a top-down uh ordinance you've received this shell for an ordinance to describe to discuss a policy change your management and Administration has encountered a few land use situations where permitted construction or potentially permitted construction has run into some confusion because of the way the code is presently written as it relates to the setback limitations most specifically for Bellevue Islands Bellevue Islands Estates and the way that language historically has appeared in the code and so management and presently for example there is one variance hearing where they built to what the city's contracted engineer interpreted the code to mean based on a plain meaning and they built within those parameters it was later discovered actually if you read this cross-reference this and cross-reference that you get a slightly different number and so to resolve any confusion by City staff Administration or Property Owners seeking to comply with the code trying to make the code more clear and explicit so this was I did not while I facilitated this this was not at my urging this was at the managers urging as the administrator for the town she could chief administrative officer looking at hey now we've had two issues in x amount of months that relate to the same provision let's fix this provision so we don't have this issue continue and that's what you have before you as to its specifics if you don't mind what you have before you um normally when we do a strike through underline that it's not called out in red text like that track change format given um the density of how this is written with all these tables anything you see in red is new everything you see in black is old if it's a strikethrough you're deleting if it's underlined you're at it so one of the issues you had in your code was Bellevue was spelled wrong in a few places and someone's saying oh this doesn't apply to me I live on Bellevue spelled v-u-e not v-i-e-w so this should even though there is no viu and so you say okay well then let's just fix that scrivener's error that's typo and then also there was a place where it said well this is for Bellevue Estates I live on Bellevue Estates Island um and so this doesn't apply to me well we need to resolve the missing word Island um to make sure it is explicit um and and then also the way certain laws were called out and the way the table was written was a little confusing so we we set that out a little better and then finally there was the way the way it read was here's Bellevue State's Island here are the numbers except these certain lots and then there was a provision at the very bottom that was like but also this um and it was not it while you could harmonize it harmonizing it became unnecessarily complex and to avoid that confusion of if you're the engineer which Bellevue Estates Island column am I looking or row am I looking at am I looking at as it reads presently there were three places you could be looking this tries to clean that up so staff and Property Owners alike could resolve this so this is management proposing a solution to avoid confusion in the code it's just a name change that's a name change it is it's a correction in some communities you might have a staffer say this is a housekeeping matter um I try not to say that because it does substantively change your code in the way it reads but it is it's tantamount to a housekeeping matter to allow for clarity in the code and Kyle you've defer to you so this is actually direct taken from the community code online we we pulled up the old ordinance and looked at the minutes surrounding the approval of it but that ordinance actually had Bellevue spelled correctly on it it got misspelled in the process of being codified so I don't I mean where it is but then that part yeah so we're gonna submit it this way so that um if it gets approved that um when we submit it to municode it'll make sense though because this is the current format um and there's a if you go to page three at the top where it says Bellevue Estates Island and it says uh first second and third Editions and then below it it has the um except the following Lots that's the only thing they're talking about great is there any downside to this I mean for somebody who's no it does well does this change anybody's uh one property to another or anything like that the problem we were having is this very bottom section where it says Bellevue is pretty violent and it doesn't it just is about to stay silent and lists the setbacks um that did not apply to anything but that's what got interpreted by the engineer so the new bill actually was given a lower a shorter setback requirement than it should have so the short answer is no it doesn't it's not more restrictive as drafted it is not intended to be more restrictive in fact it's removing the more the a provision which was applied in a more strict way and this doesn't affect anybody who has already done construction and been permitted this is for on a going forward basis as they continue to permit properties the setbacks that were already in the code the only place that we're adding editing any numbers is the final row Bellevue Estates Island which was conflicting you can see for example it gives a seven in the third column from the right um where that it's deleting 7.5 ordinarily you get a 10-foot setback in Bellevue Estates Island but then this other provision said well no it's 7.5 and the question became how do we how which one is it is it 10 or is it 7.5 you've got two there why have that redundancy what is that achieving if other than confusing people and so the code was intended to cut that this revision would eliminate that confusion so if somebody will now going forward have to abide by a 10-foot setback not a seven and a half unless their own dispensifies it says accept the following lots of Bellevue State silent when you use only a single loss and it gives a whole bunch of them and then says which shall be 7.5 feet for science setbacks which is already in here so the only thing that will come from this is that whatever homes are already there now instead of having a house that that hits the property line seven and a half feet in we'll now have to set back 10 feet the new one would if provided it is not on any of those enumerated Lots right with you um doesn't change anything if it's on those locks but let's say You're Building on lot 5 which is not on that list assuming there's a lot five there to begin with um assuming you're building unlock five your side set pack will very clearly be 10 feet but if you are on lot 9 your side setback will very clearly be 7.5 feet and we won't have to reconcile it with some other provision that says Bellevue Estates Island at the bottom so differently someone ask census is a recommendation from the county City attorney through the attorney sure I I prepared it at the request of the manager yes sir I see no problem with it does any of the board members see any problem with this I call for an ocean to accept the recommendation any discussion before you take a look you should take public comment Mr chair I can't hear you before you take any vote uh you should take public comment Mr Man uh because I'm an officer I I know he was here he haunts me he walks right behind me I will call from public comment before we kick a final vote thank you Bill Las caviscus drive only comment I have is probably for future and it aligns to some of the previous discussion you still have in here these requirements that fall underbeller Beach Yacht Estates is that something that the ordinance should have moved forward would again come back to the Planning and Zoning if their recommendations go forward to remove the marina as these designations on setbacks and I'm just curious how that ties in because there's language in here about the marina it's always been there but I like where you went tonight with your discussion is that something for future Randy that they would get another revision to this or does that always stay that way I I always like to ask my my boy first before I answer words um so this is addressing there's there's sort of a the weight land use law works is not always clean uh one of those clean things is this is all based on platted Lots you're plaque stating back and your plats might use things like Bel Air of each re-revise lots of one through seven and the yacht language I presume deals with how those locks were plotted if we do a rezoning if the city does Endeavor to do what this body has maybe suggested of resuming the property redesignating it and there's nothing else that meets that plot we would we would then address that um we would certainly have to harmonize all other land use restrictions applicable in that rezoning and make sure they're harmonized you could take it out of the code if if for example it's re-plotted well and there's nothing called that anymore now it's called the Ballard Beach Municipal District or something then there's no yacht district and we would remove it from the code we my firm's approach when handling land use issues or any code issues is while you're under the hood fix everything don't just change an oxygen sensor or something so with that in mind um that that question goes beyond the charge in this ordinance but yes if we went through that you would have to look at all land use designations in the code for a property thank you chairman you're welcome all those in favor signify by saying aye opposed request passed any other further information or requests Etc come before the sport very nice and caution have we done or said anything or suggested to do anything that would have any impact on the state ordinance same um any changes you're going to make will impact your ability to restrict the rbos I will have to conduct a comprehensive review once we have we take all these comments that we receive today there's going to be an ordinance that you'll consider at your next meeting that'll be duly notice I will conduct that review once we have that ordinance my my instincts is no uh based most especially on your receding away from from even weight you know pun intended waiting into the Waters of transient lodging definitions and the like I would have to make sure that I do a secondary and likely tertiary look at that as it goes to the commission um as I know that this community in every Community is honed in on that trust and believe editorialization here after the five hour meeting I had last week in another jurisdiction I'm not particularly interested in creating more For No Good Reason um I and and also Jokes Aside recognizing the policy priorities of this community at its residence its commissioned it's stated interest in that we will do everything to make sure that we are going to keep our eye on that issue okay thank you thank you all right we'd like to Patty when uh when is the next meeting uh your next meeting is it time consumer what's the time element well we're looking at Linda giving her time okay Randy to review right yeah it will it will certainly be at least three weeks out just based on running uh papers thumb print like they used to absolutely and and also having content for them to add advertise so um it will likely be in the next three to four weeks and we will follow up with you but do they have a regularly scheduled meeting time for no okay um so we will be staff will coordinate with you rather than pick an arbitrary date right now that we don't know we can satisfy but again I defer to the box but there's no time frustrated on us as far as our duty oh no sir not presently Miss Fisher is communicating with Deo it's my understanding so they're aware of where we are in the process I want perk Amanda for making it across the bridge and our neighbor coming in and showing his delightful input because he's helpful he cares I don't like that and a city manager and the attorney who's of less utility there's always that a little extra thing and the board members itself now if anybody uh does know a person would like to continue on the board in place of uh Rudy and he's not leaving until this is all done I got a promise of that or we shoot this dog and uh thank you very much I just cleared the meeting adjourned thank you thank you"
