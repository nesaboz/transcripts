    "transcript": "good evening everyone this is a special city council meeting it is uh 6 p.m on may 16 2022. let's do pledge and then we'll take of the united states to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice betty will you please call the wrong council member leslie notaro here councilmember lloyd roberts councilmember jody shirley councilmember mike sable your vice mayor glenn gunn mayor dave gaddis here city manager lynn reeves and city attorney randy mora and council member frank bankert is not in attendance yet thank you very much maddie okay we have one item once again uh this evening and uh immediately following this one we will move over to the regular work session it's item one to authorize the mayor and city manager to execute an agreement for professional services for city attorney first off do i have a motion so [Music] all right so that's leslie nataro and lloyd roberts i think it's appropriate this is what we voted last work session i don't know what it was but yes all right any other comments okay tonight i had just a couple of questions just because i was uh just a couple of things that stood out to me if we look at page one of the agreement uh item three b i notice that it mentions the uh let's see here special magistrate planning and zoning parks and rec and board of adjustments i believe that those are billable does that mean that the citizens advisory committee is not available the citizens advisory committee because it doesn't have the likelihood of having quasi-judicial proceedings would be within the retainer okay great and i can make that explicit in the draft executed with the manager excellence was drafted as i was learning you know it's going through your your rubric on your website of your various committees so that can certainly be addressed all right and uh let's see here the special projects item d i'm assuming that our sign ordinance would be considered a special project in all likelihood it would be i'd have to evaluate what work has been done today from your previous attorneys it's my understanding there's none we're starting from scratch and likely but i'm not going to make it a special matter if you're almost over the finish line and then say oh well that's buildable but it's my interesting that's not real i got you okay i don't have any more questions since anyone else mr gunn did we go back and compare their previous city attorneys professional services yes because i mean this looks like it's pretty cut and dry hey we do this we can paint this we can paint that when i go back and look one thing that i've been kind of uh for all along was because some things got off the rails with the previous professional services we had to go back and reaffirm something so it goes back to i pulled up a september of a 2020 email from fred ryan of the amended professional services agreement and the biggest thing that i'll just bring to everybody's attention is under uh legal services and if you pass this down it does specifically reiterates where the tasking for the city attorney comes it comes from the city council acting as a collegial body what comes from the city manager and all requests basically go through that now you cover it in the special projects but the whole purpose of this amended professional service institute was to prevent people from going off the rails or uh rogue and we saw that at one time we extended a professional currency and it kind of was abused and so we went back and specifically changed the professional services agreement to do and even during the interview you said yeah that's a problem you know i understand how that works but i guess to prevent any future questions about that i would like to go back and look at the previous professional services agreement and also there's portions in there regarding public records and that stuff that i think we all take for granted and i know your your expertise is in public records and that sort of thing but i just want to make sure that we at least review it and make sure there's nothing in there because i think everything in that updated professional services agreement that we did with fred reilly was written frankly i mean from lessons learned or necessary things i just want to make sure and i'm sure it may never come into question with this body and this city attorney but that's not to say something about the real things changing are you saying that uh in the future uh if we pass this tonight you would like to modify the agreement yes i would like to go back and look at the side outside as a minimum i would like to see number three legal services and those uh exact changes that we did with fred riley inserted into that movement so we know exactly who can obligate city monies when it comes to talking to the city attorney what everybody's obligation and your role is in this agreement and relationship with the city tournament okay so i remember this conversation and i also remember the the situation we were dealing with at the time and there were cases where it was heavily abused one of the things that uh that randy said to us was that he feels like any of us should be able to contact him at any time and if that there was if he detected that there was a problem then he would address it with the city manager and then bring it back to the council does that serve as the same function as what you're referring to yes i i the way i see it working is you know of course in the car so if somebody says calls up the city manager and says hey i've got a professional legal question dealing with council of things that i'd like to talk to the city attorney about then reach this fine go ahead and do it and it's just keeping everybody in the room there's no surprises when the billing comes from the city attorney and a phone call shows up based on a phone conversation between the city attorney and the council member i'm not saying exclude those services i'm just saying everybody knows what's going on i'm uh i'm a little curious if we ran into a special building would we be notified before that began i've always notified my clients when i create a special matter and i do that few and far between my practice the only one that i've had a community where i have an open special matter has been in kansas city where they've been in back-to-back years with their transitioning managers and clerks and the like i do it very sparingly but i would say that that question is sort of distinct from the question for mr gunn i would either disclose via email or at a meeting to you the manager has authorized a special request of this feature and that's almost certainly going to be a matter that we discuss unless we're talking about a matter of urgency for some reason you know you've had a sinkhole we're trying to do all kinds of things and require some urgency and response to that but as a general matter i usually tell my body i've been authorized to engage in a special manner for this purpose or i requested of you directly hey this supreme court thing happened we've got some more of this you know the pandemic has happened we're doing this special thing um so i i hope that addresses your question as a special matter yes in brief yes i disclose them i don't leave i don't want surprises on the building on when you're like we didn't know randy was off doing this we could have curtailed it soon or if i have one that's i expect to be discreet and gets much more involved i also advise of that so that i don't end up too far down rather to address mr gunn's concerns councilmember gunn's concerns as it relates to this language um you'd express um as you just stated during my interview you raised this question as a generic matter and my response to you then is as it is now i don't object to the language being included in the contract if that's the will of the body i don't think it memorializes anything that's different than my ethical obligations to counsel i represent an organization and therefore my ethical obligation is to keep organization if you want to memorialize workflow i think it's better from a from a codification standpoint that'd be in rules of procedure uh your code of ordinances or otherwise some internal document rather than the the contract so that you're not having that issue where you go contract to contract and keep having to memorialize hey by the way the attorney works for the council and workflow goes this way that's ordinarily something you would see either in an internal policies and procedures of the community or the rules of procedure governing the body and its use of resources just alongside what you guys can do with a copier and those sorts of other things this is how you use the town's resources as as officials and so um with that said i would of course defer to the body's uh will and desire in that respect i don't object to the languages i don't see it to be in consistent with how we deploy services the only uh concern that i have is all written responses for legal services from the attorney shall be directed to the council as a whole or the manager with a copy of the clerk i don't have issue with that some of my counsels do when they say well if i randy contacted you and i wanted you to give me a script because i'm going to uh terminate the the next manager you know what it's been four months and i want you to put it for me in text and i don't want that to everybody then people start to get uneasy about well did you circumvent that process um i'm just trying to think of a off-the-wall thing i had another scenario in another community where there was a council member who had a degenerative mental condition it was a very sensitive issue and you know the timing was written to whom and when was pretty critical um all public records but i think you can understand it's one thing to have a public record it's another to make it and just start distributing it openly and so with that said again i deferred it to what you folks think is is most wise it is yours it is your city it is your policy and the contract between the two of us vice american trying to codify this thing is like unobtainium we write policies regarding public records and they're they're not following anyway depending on the which way the lens is going and who the council whoever is so what we had tried to do was make the city attorney the last step of the check process was that if you receive a call from somebody saying hey i'd like to uh get you to draft a resolution for me to do this well you're the last step of the process and say well have you had this conversation from with the city manager and that's what we're trying to do so uh my feeling is trying to codify that may be a lot of work yep and realistically i think at some future date we need to sit down and come up with a protocol and code of conduct for how we conduct business what comes first conversation and debate then action not action and then conversation and debate that's all i was trying to and i think that hates his advice and sound about maybe we should look into russian elements adding into our code of code of conduct so to speak on how we interact with the city attorney and to be clear it wouldn't necessarily need to be an ordinance where you have a first and second reading and a publication in a newspaper for your internal administrative functions a resolution is perfectly appropriate one of the nice features of a resolution is it is a single writing and a single adoption and so if you have to amend it perfect it uh you have the opportunity to do that you know if we decide in september this works and kmb failed to catch one thing in october we can change it again uh with you know proper notice and re-adopt but ordinarily internal administrative guidelines are commonly done in resolution the the challenge the you know my job is to issue a spot for you the challenge with resolutions is making sure your city staff especially as you look to have some transitions are aware of those uh you know internally codified procedures so you have that continuity through personnel thank you very much anyone else uh yes i mean at this point i don't believe we should be putting this in the agreement that we should vote on the agreement as is to me it's perfectly understandable if i need to contact the attorney i can't i don't want to have to come to the council before to ask permission to go to the attorney for a legal question for example i mean personally i'm not going to go up and set up a complete project and you know bill phil cows come home i just want to have the ability to contact the internet for a question i guess we're all adults but going back to the process yes i believe we can't handle this process you know codified you know later date which we should we should go through not only this but other matters to make sure that the council can't run off the rails does anyone else have any comments no okay well i say we take it to the and let's let's get this done but the six years of motion and second on the floor to adopt the agreement as drafted i would consider the cac language a scrivener's issue that we can address afterwards you don't need to amend to that that we can just do that for weeks are you okay with that vice mayor okay all right so this is to authorize mayor and city manager to execute an agreement for professional services for city attorney the agreement is between the city of bellaire beach and transit danio llp for city attorney services patty would you please take the role mayor before we call rule we should ask for public comment if there's any public public thank you very much any uh citizen comments nope all right back to council all right hey please take the roll okay and mayor goddess of council member bankrupt is on the phone now just mr baker do you have any comments i don't have any comments but i have a very very hard time hearing that's yeah i mean that's every time though are we not on scene right now oh okay i got you all right um can we answer any questions for you mr banker not on this that matter can you hear can you hear me mr mayor yes i hear you just fine okay okay good okay okay now would you please call the roller yes council
