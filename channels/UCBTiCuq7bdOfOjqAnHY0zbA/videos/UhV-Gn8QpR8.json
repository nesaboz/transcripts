    "transcript": "foreign [Music] thank you would you please take them council member Belinda Livingstone president council member Leslie Notaro here council member Lloyd Roberts here council member Mike Sable your vice mayor Jody Shirley here mayor Dave gathers city manager Kyle riefler here City attorney Robert ashenfelder and council member Frank Banker was unable to attend thank you and council member Frank Banker here for the presence thank you Patty all right at 7 30 we're going to take a break as you know on these work sessions and try not to roll past 9 pm so that we can get a midnight sleep and not uh so 7 30 uh if everybody can make until then I would greatly appreciate it and we'll take 10 minutes and then we'll come right back and wrap it up all right so uh let's move right on into item number one a proposed ordinance regarding comprehensive sign regulations and uh we're going to ride over to Randy Moore's stand in Syria uh thank you mayor council members Robert Nation Felder um my understanding from Mr Moore is that Phil already had a workshop and gone through it so what is your pleasure do you want to go Page by page again or do you always want to individually let me know comment to him I got one question that's on the table and We Gather one of those previously in our packet which is for one that was on the table are do you you uh give us a rundown of anything that may have changed between what's in our agenda packet and what we have yes everything that Mr Moore changed between uh this time and last time is in red straight through on the line and so if you look on the one that's on the table it looks like we're all on the same page numbers it would be page number 20. and he made changes to the definition of portable sign s and what is not indicated to me he did not have feedback from the wall a chance to read everyone know it reflected away in one whenever I ran through the copy that's in our agenda packet it looked to me and the only thing that's changed is what they ran some language does anyone have any questions the general consensus from the Council on this island as everyone satisfied with this so we're fully aware of that Mr Baker uh I appreciate your opinion all right yes vice mayor Shirley it's fine issues in terms done in the city of Dreamland the definition of color is any distinct few or Shades including black white or gray so what is not color [Music] the purpose of it though it is to lawyers are interesting creatures and they will make arguments wherever they can to try to challenge and so if you use the word color to talk about signage and you don't say that it includes black white and gray then the lawyer is going to say well my my sign doesn't apply because my client sign doesn't fight because it's black and white on there you know something like that and so that's why we're just saying if you can see it is so that's why it's there any other questions sorry no everything else is a couple I think I think he said this thing out of the um it's on page it's 39 in the book section 86-19 [Music] so um it's a page of 39 of the one that's on the table and you know the council Woman made a good point that it's not the wording of it is the grammar that she would use however this I don't know if there's more I told you before but this comes right out of the Florida statute and so we want to not deviate from the words of the Florida statute because if we ever get challenged for this in terms of a First Amendment or whatever we're just going to Simply say this is exactly what the legislature did so if we follow the lecture Center foreign Flash you crazy [Music] [Music] I've put multiple flights well the only reason why I bring it up is because I drug passenger house and in order to see that work s yeah this is uh page 40 Flags so my recommendation would be maybe one of those instead of two three square feet Flags his favorite one so you want it to say one flag well what it is is my flag S three by five and then I have it whatever the next size it is in the space flag is the largest and then staying in two 40 square foot Flags anywhere in Miller Beach is probably so do we want to reduce one flag at that size and then something smaller the next may be a three by five is the second maximum why did we increase it for the 15 to 40 pieces 2015 it was 15 is lying down yeah originally it was and there's standard flag sizes for standard hole sizes and my hopes are is that there's three by five but I understand it you know that's a regulation plan coal size foreign because right now it says two Flags not greater than 15 square feet well see I don't have mine wasn't I'm looking at this I'm comparing the two right so if we allow it to just limit then to still like the 40 square feet yeah it's it's uh what the council wants so I I just wanted to bring up that wow and I'm looking at the big one over there kind of thinking how big is that is that on the other side of the bridge my recommendation would be the maximum in fact you could even take into that you could even take it to a five by 30 foot and 25 or last 35 do all sorts of things too and to really make any concise but I do know that and they were he doesn't live there anymore that flag makes a noise very very light and uh he wouldn't put a second flag on there but I was just thinking with the two of those things so what do you think three by five is the second and then another and so the first time yeah the second flag if so chose and that was really the only thing that I had what's happening everything looks good for me four actions is we propose this going forward into the next city council meeting I don't think it's going to your plan or yeah so it has the playing board because it's part of your language first after you come in once the flame board reviews it and provides you whatever comments and suggestions that it has it's going to feedback there'll be three more stops that the citizens can get and you know comparison I just want to return to Flags to make sure I got so if you want to say the first shall be no greater than five by eight and the second shall be no greater than three by five correct got it thank you that's all I had canceled anyone else okay let's move right on to uh item number two discussion of the 2023 comprehensive plan [Music] thank you yeah so I recently had to find hotel rooms for family and found that the rooms along the beach are rented nightly although we say we have no hotels on the beach they call themselves hotels they rent like hotels they act like hotels but we have no commercial property on the beach according to our comp plan the reason for bringing this up is we all know that the cities will need funds for future projects and just moving forward the last thing I want to do is tax our residents but if we have commercial businesses priority operating on the beach then maybe we should look at how that tax base might be infected if we did allow a future land use of hotels because they're already operating outside and as we got back from bed tax for those sniper devices just something kind of opening it up for discussion everyone to look at and think about I think it's a I think it could potentially be a good Revenue source that we are overlooking now I may you know a council might have a different opinion but it would not be nice to hear one of you know the legal side of that might look like and is it a possibility to you know can we all get on board of taking a look at it and seeing if there's enough to raise revenues a little bit without taxing our residents verification because I was told I think more than once when I asked about that particular building and what is it because when I first came up to register with the city and then I said on 20th Street pretty much across the street from the hotel and they said it says Hotel so my question is I was later told to the units our own personal similar to like a conduit and then it's managed from within so perhaps they do rent them out I don't know but what is that first statement is that accurate that each of the units like Mr Smith and Mrs Smith own 101 is not owned by one hotel owner is that true so I can tell you the Ballard Beach Resort has multiple owners there's one owner that owns more than 50 percent of the of the units to remember one bedroom one bath you can walk in there around by the night okay even the ones that are owned individually are still to rent by diamonds um right and somebody somebody at their desk manages that with respect to what's who's up next president it's pretty common okay okay and then the one that's further north the little blue Hotel I don't know that is strictly time sharing you can only get it by the week but it's still time sharing even right by the week so again I don't know if there's opportunity for bed tax or you know some way to offset because it is it is a lot of work for our staff the if you walk the beach it's busy especially on holidays and it's there's a lot of extra traffic on the beach a lot of extra trash underneath gelato if you go to the um our our only beach access with a bathroom and you walk in there it's disgusting and our staff has to clean it you know it's and that's from you know all this use of Outsiders use in our beach and I think that we just need to be creative about how to contacts that if there's an opportunity to tax it more we should yourself currently don't um and that has to do with the way it sounds the fourth analysis throughout some options which they call the uh Resort facilities overlay which was purpose its purposes of this category is to depend utilization and Overland for residential areas that are now better than having a look so the user characteristics of its primary use we attempt for residential temporary lodging but it's a different zoning requirement which enables you to charge fees from what we have in the presidential Virginia Maybe [Music] it's possible I don't know all the realities of it um well so two things going on forward Pinellas advises you on land use and so what they're proposing as as an alternative is a way to allow it and call it something in your plan because right now from what I'm hearing you know what is it currently Zone foreign desk you know and it's operating like a hotel you know I think the first thing is if you don't want that to be occurring then you need to go into the code enforcement and say I don't know what this is but it's clearly not residential you know and so you need to shut down the farm fast because you're clearly operating commercial that'll freak everybody out but if you don't mind then you know that's the to you all as policy and it's more okay it's here it's operating let's regulate it the way your reality is and let's start getting revenue flowing in because the reality is that the town is paying for like you said the restrooms and so forth then you would change the zoning and an overlay is is an option to do it I represent running controls and they did a tourist facilities overlay they called it same kind of a thing over a residential neighborhood because there's so many vacation rentals there and um but in terms of the tax revenue you need to turn to what is the legislature allowed to tax because as a municipality we can't tax anything that the legislation doesn't expressly allowed us to so the hotel industry and all its little subdivisions time shares and so forth are regulated under chapter 509 on Florida Statutes and and it provides definitions for each of the things what is a hotel there's a definition for it there's a motel there's a timeshare and then there are taxes that are required for that and then of course Pinellas County is overlaid its bed tax and so forth that then became so apply so if you wanted to go in that direction we could go in that direction as well so really you guys just need to talk amongst yourselves either to my area at some point you know wherever they want to go with it and then give us direction of where to go to break back to you what needs to change so Mr patient Builder um you are indeed better than my half my law professor okay so um the day you just want to get right now to it these are short-term rounds we are grandfather men right now and we don't allow children however if you go and we change anything in our ordinances that would impact the outcome of short-term rentals we lose it all is my understanding that is a very strong art there's no case that's held back yet and the reason why is because local governments who are in the beautiful position here in of being grandfathered in don't want to risk that grandfathering so they don't want to even change a DOT on the eye because then lawyers will come roll them in and say oh it's all done now there is a bill that's been filed this year that gives that little bit of a nugget to say that if you change your grandfather code but it is to be more generous you don't lose your grandfather's code the unfortunate part about that bill which is by a senator that we all know um also has a lot of negative things for Liberal governments and so a lot of my communities are opposing that bill but but I think in terms of what you're going to get the argument on with the lawyers because that bill was even filed even if it doesn't succeed the lawyers are going to say see here in this legislative session the legislature was thinking about allowing local governments to change their code but they didn't pass it so you can't so that clearly the legislature was thinking here on Earth you can't do it so so my advice and I think Mr Moore's as well is you're risking a lot if you change anything about short-term and I uh we're talking about 7-14 as we said correct correct it looks to me like that's a trap it looks to me like they're they're the language is So Vain and weird and the way that they're I mean they say the same thing three or four times differently and not only that but they but it's so rich I wrote the legislative update and and I find it interesting that it purports to to give us brand new power to set up a registration system when we already have them we already have that now so it is a trap in that way too because I can see that the lawyers are going to come and say oh well the legislature is now parceling out little bits of power to you so that means you can't do anything else with respect to Vacation Rentals it's a real terrible time they wrote it in a way that looks like we can make a little money off of this by forcing them to register correct and uh and even that is a restriction as much as I can't stand where we're at right now with this this whole debate is uh my recommendation would be to let's wait and see and see talk on the bathroom whether a passing through fails but they're going to be coming they're just going to keep coming after us more and more until they get their way it's the same bill it's been proposed last year yes what what about the basically at least seven years I think we've thrown something out and it's got ordered down spilled it up it's from the real estate law it's really pushes hotel rooms and they are hotel rooms but I don't I don't tell them some towns say if you live you're allowed the owner's allowed to live with that occupancy up to their engagement and they exceed that then they have to pay school tax you are owners and these will explain do they have to pay the school tax on each other it's Pinellas County Tax tax reformers commensured so that the yeah the county sets that and it goes by what the zoning is so if it's residential it's a normal maintenance commercial it doesn't matter if the owners in there 30 days so the the end up going to the time shares as well they're just they just get an annual whatever Amazon is whatever the value of property is do they pay the same taxes thank you and so and currently we charge a registration fee for 300. so all the condos are paying and it's so even if it's so it each condo pays 300 a year no matter how many times it's rented correct and the uh the bill is going to reduce that 50 and before let's say you have 20 and maximum uh bill would be one hundred dollars so would it make sense and just in if it's the answer is no that's fine but on the comprehensive plan if we do an overlay and then F down the road because once you've got this land use code you know that's it that's your kind of married to it for the next 10 years right you can change it there's an opportunity for out of cycle changes but what happens is if you if you do that that's going to impute greater investment value to the land in the overlay District because now more can be done with it and then if you take it away in the future now you're opening yourself to a bird Harrison Lane so be very careful about giving something because that's the issue can you change it as you can but then they're going to come after you and say oh well now you took away my potential for commercial use now I'm back with just residential I've lost my investment backed expectations anymore so do you see any opportunity for any further taxation on these vacation rentals that are out there are they are they are they coming in these units and registering for latest ignorance the ones that yeah when they're notified of being asked about they do come in there's hopefully they've got to be something or not we're not using and then the hotel the owner who's at dispute last year where he finally been paid his final registration fee for his units but he still hasn't paid this year so that's the resort yeah being paid if they calling for a title on it the whole of those units how recently the dollar Beach Resort when you say assessment are you speaking of the registration fees that they're they're uniform you can buy and sell that's not going to Cloud type so that the title search wouldn't even that you should call the city though for a clear they do yeah yeah right but but what our answer there is supposed to be are there any open code liens that have been filed you know that's really because that Cloud's title the filed lean means that somebody can come and take money off this property the fact that they owe a registration fee if we haven't cited before it yet and then gone on and that's just probably not completely fast yeah what we should do if we are aware you know is Code Enforcement say you know this you're required to pay to spare another fee here's your code citation there yeah so so right now I just want to verify the short term rental of my own yeah so short-term rental or residences is for homes and for condos there's a very light condo based on the condo association it's pretty much the association who deals with it okay yeah okay the city has no great regulation you can change your regulation right you can check the condo association can actually change it to daily rounds yeah [Music] see that's that's where we may have the resort where Phoenix the homeowners association of condo developers Association who's actually imposing more restrict regulations and noticing would you agree yeah and I I'm so curious about this entity like you know is there a common parking area so how do they deal with that like if somebody owns more than 50 then you gotta vote there's got to be some condo dock I would imagine that has been created because otherwise if I'm finally own one of those events how what are my rights to the Common Parking if a sickle happens in a Common parking lot are you okay to pay that there's got to be more behind the curtains that you know thank you may have worse neighbors than what what the single family dwellings have because now you know how noisy they're they're sharing the law so they're probably probably just need to obviously you were you could probably formal servant but your neighbors just ask them how they feel about it because ultimately you're in a smaller they're the smaller job there right right but I'm sure that it will is like you bring something to the association's attention we changed it with our association you know we do think the city does have a list of the contacts for every of these products along the beach perhaps we could use that list to inquire is to put their rental restrictions would be a bad idea to to gather that they are having a another meeting in a work session just to review the data and decide whether it's something that we can maybe have maybe have a fight and say hey we're aware that you have a problem and you would like to help by helping you get an organized Alternatives no Revenue those areas so if you're looking for a definition of the resort Jody what do you think it would be right now based on hotels and I think the other two are legitimately timeshare but you know so we have condos and we have time shares we have condos with timeshares and you know and then the two-time shares look like hotels everyone refers to them in the hotel No Vacancy yeah they have No Vacancy signs of you know but um and I think most of the condos are like where Leslie lives the residents are going to step up and say this is what we want and they're not going to allow us but you know we've got some situations where we have hotels do those other buildings the resort that they have associations do we know I was going to actually go to the public record and pull them and I just didn't work you know I've been knowing here I haven't had a chance to pull those but you know I was going to pull the dots and see what they say but you know if you've got an owner that owns more than 50 likely he can change them stocks to whatever he wants them to say without any other vote we would also bear in mind if he owns 50 of it of whatever even sort of an hour maybe that's where animal can't be uh probably make a lot of money probably is not going to want to get that but after eight individuals those will be the ones you have to have a greater percentage that would be against a handful that's definitely something to look into and uh talk and talk further about the last question I have is a cycling rather than a perspective is this really a problem in the city is it a problem I mean I think it creates some problems whenever we have you know when you get the police report typically it's non-residents so that tells you something right so does it create problems or conduct but you know but I'm always looking at how can we how can we increase revenues without tax in our residents right right I think the other thing to think about too is you know we all have every city and county has zooming for a reason because you're trying to say this fits with this and you know that and so to some extent knowingly allowing essentially a commercial hotel to be operating in what proclaimed to be residential is really doing what what the people request you to do you know it's like you're you're saying well we know that this is residential but we're letting you when Dixie operate right now a little bit or something yeah philosophically speaking we shouldn't turn a blind eye if someone is truly flaunting the zoning that they're in because it can create an argument down the road and I'm being somewhat hypothetical here but you know someone else within this come say when you start picking on them and forcing well what about that hotel over there that is in the middle of the residential if you haven't done anything for years and now you're picking on me because I have a home-based business or whatever so that's just something to keep in mind too it's you should ultimately I'm gonna say it's urgent but we should talk continue to talk through and decide which route you want to go do you want to go back to residential waiters and if so get code enforcement out there and say you gotta shut down that Lobby the lobbies have no place in residential or if you want to face reality and maybe get revenue and all that you go down fully analyze uh what kind of zoning they are in and what are their rules specifically but whether they get violation of because it's Revenue also and I would also just encourage everyone to read this compliment because the other one was brutaled with errors and things that didn't really apply and there's some you know uh this is like the beginning of our strategic planning right this should have some of those but we've got our Capital Improvement projects listed in here they should be accurate they should be it should be a hit that's what we intend to get done right and um the one in the past the um the flood budget was not nearly what it really was so there are just some things that we really need to pay attention to it's not just a check the box it's done sort of thing everyone needs to read it thank you okay education be on item number two all right we're all into item number three and this is actually a continuation brought up over to the city manager one of the assistant so the last time we talked about uh well well the subject of your confidence um I'm a member of the board that's reviewing the comprehensive plan and the one pocket tonight is [Music] to come to this line going forward when you're reviewing this comprehensive plan yes I'm just going to point out some things or pronounce this is the organization that is helping us review our confidence and plan to make sure we're meeting the state and County mandates [Music] they're also doing that for every city in Pinellas County State organization they are also the ones who are advising for those talented on their plan as you said that I'd like to skip to one point the next transportation and you go through this those replacement element when you read it it's discussing what Bellaire Beach needs to do to be responsible in its transportation system apply Clearwater Beach when you're being belly of each and Clearwater Beach and have they comply and have they met the standards principles um that's one of the points here development projects are generally between 15 and 300 new Peak power trips on the official Road shall be classified as Dearborn and required to submit a transportation management plan deciding to address their impacts while increasing mobility and reducing the demand for single objective occupant vehicle traffic I was one of the citizens Review Committee that on continues the construction of this marriage and all during those meetings we're constantly told the richness Tulane and Gulf Boulevard will be too late is that the state says they don't want greater density on the Barrier Islands because of the obvious concerns or storm and the cost the area is impacted by the store so the bridges remain too late and Clearwater had four leaves because they had four lanes coming in this is background the motels on Clearwater Beach a little modern pop motorcycles pursuing this all of this was constructed Clearwater Beach exploded and they're continuing every day to build high density High occupancy facilities but yet not one but road going in or after Clearwater Beach it's still all cars there's no high density in transportation and rail any other things being done to reduce vehicular traffic which all of you know is what is greatly impacting us so as you read this and understand what we're being required to do think about how they've missed the vote on doing those things themselves and where was the oversight and why are we asking for a review of the oversightful process for Clearwater Beach because I think that's about the only thing you can do to try and mitigate what's happening there will happen in my lifetime but there needs to be another bridge out of there and there needs to be heightened and contracted and how are you going to get that by asking why they didn't apply for the very things that they're supposed to and why are these people who are guiding us not guiding them properly to implement the things thank you Mr Davis Council I will let you know that I actually did speak to about two months ago and I appear at one of their meetings they I was invited by Christine Kennedy uh there of any wrong speech to come speak because it was her last meeting as chair of forward Pinellas so I which uh myself and two other Mayors in the big sea they were invited to come speak and we were asked if there was anything that we would like to see and I explained to all four canals today we were completely overrun with traffic and it's not just a holiday it's not it's just spring break it's you never know what's going to happen it happens all the time and I have explained it it takes 10 to 15 minutes to get out of our streets sometimes because the cars are so backed up and nobody nobody at all and I painted a real ugly picture of what was going on here and I I also said the reason why this is happening is because they're all heading to Clearwater Beach the most popular beach in the world and uh and I said so I appreciate you uh in finding this week and what I would like to ask for is a new bridge from Sand Key back over to Gold domain so that they can come in loop around and go right back out they did not like that at all they thought that was the dumbest thing they'd ever heard and then they they said that that's we had to put up with it because that's what we get for from tourism and I came home I was curious and I looked it up I I called Kyle I said how much how much am I getting you know for a pennies broken Alice from tourism he gave me the number and it came out to 600 a day over 600 a day this is what we get they they believe that they can solve all of our problems with rapid rail that will never make it here they believe in people coming here will get off that rapid Barrel hop on a bus they won't give them to their final destination and I explained that to all of them that you know you're gonna have some people that will do this but most people want to just drive in and go right in their hotel and park their car and they're not going to do this so whenever I explain this to all the other Mayors up and down the beach they they told me exactly what you're talking about all they care about is clear wattage and safety everybody else is just water in the middle and uh and we just need to comply and conform well I'm I'm not doing that I am I'm still going to be a thorn in their side and I'm going to keep going back I'm going to see if nothing else I can get some people thinking um there's a little bit of a bright side is it commissioner Scott is now on that on that board and he he knows all about buses and bus line in the private private tour buses and uh and he was very not very favorable uh in their eyes a while that he had actually gotten on board and they haven't had him removed because they didn't like we had to say in that problem to run for office and now he's over the accounting commission but uh I think there may be a chance to that we can get more people to listen or I'm like I've seen him very extensive photos of Gulf Boulevard where we are vocal of our Causeway Boulevard I got in the boat took pictures of the bridge completely backed up I showed him everything and he said oh my God I had no idea it was like that and so if we can get more of those pictures before Dallas maybe they'll help her picking on us and start looking at the real problem because uh it's just not fair what's happened to us and I know we've complained about this over and over and over but the type of complaints that are complaining system the past three years was not that great and I think that we can do a much better job I I approaching them a little more delicately they're trying to rank that approach that's your mission too um yeah the fact that well with an email I think it was last week and it got a lot of responses we were talking about you know what to do with the north-south rerouting ways that takes you off golf around through our communities and uh first of all those people don't want those but they're extremely upset and traffic then it's not only there but it gets rerouted in the community so you can also get emails over to Kyle without and send them on to you um things that had suggestions and just complaints about the traffic situation I think we're going to discussing that that uh that's taking a problem uh you know so we'll we'll bring that right back up anything else anyone would like to add about the comprehensive plan thank you for coming up yeah it wasn't discounting what you presented us but I think what Mr Davis is telling us as we beware yeah because there's a certain direction they're trying to steer everyone towards and there's a master plan and we're just in the way I'm no fan of forwarding us when they came out and wanted us to write you know they wanted to make a pipeline Lane and who knows it will still happen bring that downtown Largo median and bike Lanes all the way through to you know to the beach basically and drop the speed limit to 25 and you know we'll never get home if we don't have four lanes out there if they're too late we'll just have a nightmare it's gonna be a mess it got shot down doesn't mean the plan's gone I'm just gonna forewarn everyone they stay aware of what or analysis doing yep I agree they want you to park your car I guarantee it they're not no and they never will okay so that's it on this topic thank you Mr Davis thank you let's move on to item three again okay so the last time we discussed we sort of established that the priority for the marina I read upon the council that it would be for residents yeah I said um since then I've looked at a lot of information primarily studying uh the discovered that they recently did a uh they paid an outside contractor to do a survey of all the local governments in the area and the Grand Theft reporter and it's actually pretty useful information if you look at what their findings were what I did notice that um from our last resolution which was resolution 2020-19 uh when we the last time we looked at the marina and then we established what the rate increases would be and how the increments which we went up um the first year which was 2021 and then we were coming up on our next race which is going to be April 1st 2023 and then the final rate increase is April 1st 2025 and over that span of time it it raises the residents who are have a fee of seven dollars per foot up to the 10 per foot and for the non-residents who were at ten dollars worth it to the 15 per foot so that's just a recap but from this study that I looked at we are we're kind of on point for what all the other marinas are charging in this area whether they're charging my foot or charging my slip so one of the issues that's been brought up is with the wait list it was currently prioritized by the length of the vessel if if we're focusing on the residents in our community under some residents that have been on their perfect time and we don't plan on buying bigger codes so if our invasion is to um so the residents and that's what possible it might be consider rearranging the waitlist as far as the time we've been on there to be at the top so if you know Milwaukee is that you're next in line and I did some analysis just of the the current light suppose and if say in 20 years we accomplished this goal because right now we're at um we're a little over 50 of the slips are limited by our residential residents there's three non-resident and then the rest are non-resident Property Owners they own property but they're not actually so if you see me um over time if we reshape our realist policy and it slips open um we start moving more of the residents who are on there into the slips it will decrease numbers it will decrease the average length of the boat in the slips so in turn will ultimately decrease the revenue track that we're on there are there are options to uh to reshape the amounts per slip I I didn't draft up to different spreadsheet that just kind of laid it out and and showed uh you know how we could stay on track by charging um you slept differently if it was like uh by foot so it was 11 to 11.99 one price in the incrementally depending on the size of this so the numbers are there if you decide to go that route to bring in the same Revenue projections which would be this year we're bringing in 62 000 from rental Revenue per year and by 2025 it was projected foreign six hundred dollars so that is an option um we could do it the way we've been doing it which has shown to be on track but we also if we re-prioritize our waiting list and how we're moving people into the marina we're going to decrease our governance so we may want to consider appreciated you know each others another thing is I looked at the rental agreement of Dunedin and uh just a lot of the different ideas that they have and uh there's a lot of things that can be considered um besides just prioritizing there's a they've uh they have rules and regs that can deal with problems that we see in Marina um one of them would be they had like a regulation that says they'll do ones in the universe I'll connect one so let's begin in one full source they have rules that say you know if the slip is made in for such and such time it is forfeited our current goals are not that strict that's actually an interim code um they have deposits they have required deposits to get on the waitress I think residents will have a problem paying the deposits to be serious and mostly being on eternity that will decrease our maintenance costs on the waitlist because we have 50 plus non-residents they're just don't let anyone every place so that's something to consider um they have Legacy options someone who's been renting a slip for 10 years straight if another slip opens they get first get a moving to a slip before the next person listening to do that so that's something to consider um and then ultimately you know we're in a we're in a market right now where the demand is is high for a slip it couldn't turn because it was 10 15 years ago it was different they had trouble filling the slips so I would always um keep the non-resident option on the waitlist policy and then you know whatever price points we decided just have a multiplier for that if that it gets a timely no reason it's actually heart rate so I don't know how the council feels about all this information I can draft I can take it and I can draft what I feel would be a positive direction to manage the marina and then present it to you and then have your opinion or if you want to get involved with kind of each topic I've talked about then I would not have a problem with that if they're okay with that we could work together you're talking about residents and Property Owners right we're dealing with them separately yeah those are separate categories here if you don't live there you go into the property or whatever as opposed to the rest you know yeah that's what I mean I was looking at other things is I understand about the income and we'll probably address after you've been really whatever the slip costs that's what the slip costs the problem was that our resident owners were not so the thought was if you're resident owner the longest one on there you're given the option to get whatever slip is open if it's one of the larger ones you'll pay that then that's up to you you can declining it goes down and the reason you don't want to be very cautious and serve a president owner these are the people's skin in the game they not know they own but they vote there are constituents if you are a non-resident owner you have other opportunities you may have to split that your condo down in you know Boca Raton um these people that live in the Resident owners don't have that option with us so this is the only source that's why you're very cautious about that in fact I've got them go so far as being removed on residents look it's strictly this is a city use resident owners are on the list we paid a positive they're on and that's how we'll work for a you know this Revenue because it's your option look if you want the bigger one you know your next on the list you can accept it even with your little rowboat there using that option today I got to fill that up that's up to you but those are the funds but I guess all these considerations teleport area yeah okay all right uh anything else any other comments on this topic can I can I just add a couple of things one is I agree with Mike with the um price per split rather than price per foot um that's the slip accommodates a 50-foot boat that's the price of the boat this look um the other thing is we have the resonant the non-resident owner that has two slopes and we did kind of deal with that I think that there should be a capacity once you know as long as we've got residents resident owners that want to slip we need to you know maybe limit that to one slip I I know I understand it as being one family owned two properties but it makes it difficult when we have people waiting for you know you have the one family with two slips that's a difficult situation so I think we should kind of visit that when you're looking at it and then I don't even see a reason to maintain a non-resident weightless if we've got that many time you don't even maintain it I mean at some point if you need to open it back up fine but right now there's no need for you guys to go through the the hassle of dealing with adding them to list and coordinating and organizing all that information it's just I have an idea of how to address that and how much yeah but uh next week yeah just a comment I think of our recommendation I would approach this from like a blank piece of paper as if this Marina just fell into our city I think if you're trying to combine where we are today it just gets to the music the only problem with that is and so then once you have it set up the way you would want it set up regardless of who's there now who's not there now and then that there it is this is how he wants this contract to be in place and then deal with the specifics that exist today I mean we can even give time periods and say hey if you're a non-resident property owner and you have a slip we're going to give you six months you know I'm sure I mean I would ask counsel I mean I don't know what the contract says that these people currently signed if they've assign a contract but we could give them a reasonable time period to say hey you don't really fit into our new our new setup that wouldn't be defined everything so you have X amount of time to find another place yeah you're this you're acting in a proprietary capacity here so if you if you make a pivot and how you operate in that facility I think it's it's appropriate to give a reasonable phase because it's hard to find a place to remote but yeah I mean if you change the way you do business then you can just yourself no I think that's great though I mean this is the vice mayor said this is really resonant benefit I mean how many slips do we get from currently around 18 18 and how many residents 1600 I think and then you have one resident having two slips it would say ridiculous I mean and should be resonated as an owners and three that are just non-resident non-profit owners they're you know those three should go I mean there was a discussion about renters full-time renters being able to you know I I personally I don't have a problem with that because there are some people that promise yeah a task okay number one can I see your driver's license do you actually live here your license is out of state you know by really living here that's right you know you go yeah you're not you know a beauty I mean you're sort of kind of uh put in a lower tier and then um we've got entry Property Owners driver's licenses and renters do the same thing and you've got a property ownership and I think the goal is is to make sure that the top tier residents that live here they they if there's something available they get first dibs on it but we also want to be cautious not to ever have an empty so we just can't rent a thing go down the list and I'm offer it to a guy that does not do you disagree with the statement is uh you know it has to be a residential emergency they got the money they bought the house they are part of our community the renter that's what I'm saying if you can't run anything chances of that like you said years ago there was Providence and rec centers yeah years ago they had a lot outfit slips and I know that not everyone's got in he had two residents here so I think one city waited seven years he had slipped if I remember I mean we must be going back a few of us they don't go away generally stay for a long time is that right right yes especially around and that's something we need to address also that we do have to bring to somebody that's a non-resident and there's a living on how long they actually are the things they will cover yeah and I understand where everyone's going for this and I I think that uh we also have another resource that will have been sold Dragon into the conversation and see if he has any input once we come up with our the name of people any other discussion on that topic right along now finally sir I'm sure that Brooke has been waiting for a while we are now on to discussing uh conversion to park mode so let's say your council member is able you have the floor and uh Kate as the last meeting we had uh he wanted to see some numbers and we had an estimate built up um two things I guess before we go into that is not on this estimate is a cost of about I think it was like seven to nine thousand dollars that's expended by our third city manager in terms of time repair costs Etc and what part Global cannot put in the rest of it is the amount of time that instead of overhauling machines that Kyler is a replacement of will now be at City Hall if not do the city hall work instead of if you'll do the Machinery work and two this is the time see just what the paint threshold is for those that want to park here our residents are safe they have their parking decals they're good to go in fact Park Mobile gives us the ability to look and we put it in our assistance license plates they're clean they don't get charged but five dollars an hour from before hopefully in some ways reduce the traffic to these parking areas for you know the parking States as far as Citizens that would like to use these nice little mini farms and then we can adjust from their obviously it's very easy to do but definitely move it up to five and that said um I don't know how do we bring up a book I and I the problem is there's two Brooks by the way throw all these emails back and forth you went Brook bustle broke the creepers would you like to step up to the podium so we can see you and uh that makes you feel a lot better now yeah happy to happy to join it I have nothing prepared over here just to be a resource so you tell me what you need um I can give you kind of an overview if you want me to um so Park Mobile is the uh where a payment app so I started as an app is it just an app anymore now there's text to pay you can scan a QR code or there's a lot of ways to pay now so just an app but we're in Clearwater Beach we're in Clearwater we're in St Pete St Pete Beach Tampa and all over Florida um so I don't think you'll have any trouble converting if you even go that route I think we kind of spoke about it I think you should do more of uh a phased approach keep your kiosks out there add some stickers allow people to start paying digitally but have both options and then what they can do with the mobile app is if they've used anywhere else in the Bay Area they use the app they know how to use it maybe they already have an account but they can pay through any major credit card PayPal Apple pay Google pay so there's all there for anyone who doesn't have a smartphone of course the kiosks are still there but then there's also 1-800 numbers so what is the question of some people see as parkmobile kind of in a sense advertise hey you know come look at this this parking space there were fears that by going to Park Louisville we would get more people kind of overriding all our parking lots yeah so listening to the last hour and a half I realized we don't want more people coming here what you can't say for a lot of the beach towns that we work with usually we really want to we want to increase the parking rate we want more people to come here because it fits more money from the city but I realize you guys are a little different about what we can do for that is um so with the park mobile app um as anyone familiar has everyone kind of seen it used to what a payment app looks like um who has the app right now does anybody use it okay class three and that's yeah so we've pulled from Google Maps so picture your Google Map like you would use on your phone for a GPS and stuff so that's what we pull from so you're going to see all those same landmarks that you'll see so churches Library schools restaurants Etc and then on there are little pinpoints of those Zone numbers The Zone numbers uh equate to maybe a street block or a lot and or in your case and that's what the Zone numbers will be on the map so anyone who has the app will be able to see points for those different zones which would be your Lots but what we discussed is hiding those so what we can do is not put those pen points so someone who's just across the bridge or something will see that um otherwise maybe they're looking for parking they're circling around different areas but then they see your lots available they're coming here right um that might not happen but say it does what we can do is hide them from the map so no one else can see them but what that means is anyone on site so they pull into the lot the normal people who are coming here they can still see the signs and obviously those still be signs so people can still pay but we're not you know marketing it necessarily I also like the ability you have a dashboard so for if I want to throw a party and I really don't want a lot of people on the street bothering my neighbors able to again we're talking about the marina is it possible for me to provide who's ever running the dashboard here it's you know one of the sales people interface to type in the list of license plates and the duration and time so that they don't get charged just top eight parking at the marina and we've entered into the system I've got on the air for four hours well we have a uh four uh one of the citizens here just wants to host a party but hard people in the marina and that would be one of the purple abilifications but doesn't want to charge them for you know you're in the city so can they provide a list of license plates to the city just didn't put a Theresa for on this date for you know from this period of time these license plates will not be ticketed what we would do in that case is a comp parking promo code essentially that would happen so we would um you would work with our you know whoever your account manager is um and then you would say hey on this day um so we the way the promo codes work it's a specific percentage or dollar off to let's say 100 off in this case and then it's for a designated amount of time and then it's for a specific zone so a lot in this so okay so that it gives us the ability to take cars off our streets that we've never had before yep while providing the free parking to the people that are attending their heart yeah and that would have to go through the city so no one could just you know work with us directly in China it goes back to that dashboard really everything's being right here in the city they can do all the settings and changes and right well the city can but not a resident clinic but yeah so I have a question um it's been discussed that we are able to limit the amount of time that person can pay the park do they receive a warning before they do that that says hey not only can you only buy three hours but you can is that possible yeah yeah so we can mirror whatever policies you have so any time restrictions you have minimums or maximums so you can restrict that for the entire city so maybe you have a two hour maximum if they Park here they can't just go to another lot and you could have a two hour max by the entire city or you could have a two-hour marks for this lot and then they would need to go somewhere and uh about time restrictions uh and so you can't park here after oh yeah so maybe at sunset uh you could have a hard stuff yeah so whatever hours or um and then whatever that hard stop means to you in some cases it means free parking starts at 5 PM sometimes it means no parking starts at 5 PM so whether that's a No Parking Zone at a certain time or a free parking same thing for a weekend so if maybe your weekends are free you can either do we'll go partner weekend free parking on weekends I had to Sheriff's right now they're actually all able to do there's a number of experience with administering yeah yeah so we already work with a number of cities in Pinellas County so they already know how to use the um and then if you have any third-party handheld system uh probably tap into that as well see what the problem they were running into the reason why we're so strict is because cheaper to come to Bel Air beach and park your car here walk across the street with what you are charged at Clearwater Beach so people were leaving Clearwater Beach coming here parking their car lugging all their stuff over to the beach and staying there all day long and and we really don't like that yeah that's the point of information they don't love this stuff they drop their stuff off and another person takes the car over here the designated driver pretty much everybody you have a copy of the estimate with the order uh not in front of me because I mean that's probably the next question it's like okay what is the proposal so I do like your explosion explanation earlier where you said we could actually um kind of bring it in and keep some of the same system you have in place uh you had mentioned it one time early on that you were a little concerned I think that people that are familiar with and only bring cash and don't have the ability to have an app and all of a sudden poof it was a hundred percent already switched over so that could be a problem for them so if we could bring it in slowly or whatever term you used earlier so we're making me a hybrid of people could use your system as well as still use paying cash or whatever they needed to park is that possible yeah yeah we do that in a lot of cities usually what I say is it's great because you have it's just an added option right it's a no-cost added option but you're still you still have those costs associated with the kiosk so your goal is to get rid of those costs from the kiosk you're not meeting that goal but you are adding additional options which is open but we work with a lot of um I think you have IPS right so we work with that kiosk system there's a number of them and what that when I say we work with them we can integrate our enforcement so our transaction data and their transaction data goes to the same place so the team is actually enforcing on the ground has one unit that they're looking at not multiple things okay sure more expensive things in America that goes right back to the whole argument for switching to systems was that trying to solve a problem and what we're doing to create a problem by having two systems now not only do you still have to maintain the old system but also the Wreckers or whatever it is whoever's monitoring and making sure that we're behavior that the people that are partnering or behaving themselves the people that live here [Music] um it's just a matter of how we want to treat people that are coming to Bel Air Beach to use on the beach that's why we got a the political system I mean frankly I would just sprinkle over and do it move directly over to particle book and two five dollars an hour Council how do we get how do we reconcile getting paid print out every month with every license plate that paid an hour yeah so on the enforcement side it's instantaneous you'll get a constant feed of everyone who's paid too so it's even fours but as far as the remittance we process the payments we charge our credit card processing for that Merchant needs um to our bank and then we pay you monthly is pretty standard we know each license plate that particular I take Uber lift the line now I'm not a shy guy so I'll talk to him I got told by a lot of Lyft drivers especially with drivers had at the end of the month when I get paid I'm missing rats that I that I service and then they have to call lift up and then we get into arguments and some of these guys have just said I'm not going to do what I feel the limit anymore Uber's a lot more friendly so what I'm saying is how do I know that we're getting hurt we're getting Park Nobles being yeah so you'll have access let me know you guys directly but whoever's managing parking will have access to the back end system um so you'll be able to pull your own Financial reports and you can match that um typically someone in accounting finance and who could match that with what we were meant to you yeah right right over there I'm just saying are you yeah so you'll have access directions on the data um on your dashboard and then you can match that with what we send you um because we nobody really knows the numbers right now and that's really where I have a good benefit comes up yeah so um so I guess the overall cost um we don't cost anything for you to set up so we'll provide all of the signs uh the Integrations all of that good stuff so we'll set up the system for you our fee is on to the end user so it's 35 cents except they're doing five dollars 5.35 pretty simple math there um and then the only thing the city would be on the hook for is the credit card processing fees that we charge and that's three percent plus 20 cents which I think is a little different because I think what you currently pay I don't know if it's on here I think it was like a flat four or five percent so in some smaller transactions um is uh worst deal and then some of the higher transactions ones the better deal on average down to around four or five yeah so I think he estimated a difference of 125 to cover credit card processing fees based on the numbers from last year how are these machines there are some machines so it's all uh it's digital it's all in the cloud s solar powered or do we have to find electrical or something it's it's completely digital it's on everyone's phones so as long as someone has oh there's nothing there I'm still lost in the clouds systems yeah okay uh but yeah anyone can pay as long as they haven't internet access um and if they don't have internet internet access they can call them whatever [Music] the obvious questions are first of all how much did we make last year and then really the net um and then Westpark Mobile going to deliver in terms of Revenue and then remember what Delta that cannot put in there is the time that we're wasting you know we have cattle raise you've got that we're taking them out of the parking room event in City Hall so what was the numbers again that we have on there so we're projecting a total gain of six thousand two hundred nine dollars and that's just the difference of the maintenance because the credit card processing kind of is a wash there's a hundred dollar loss there um and then the gain is the which is your maintenance costs um but that was just the machine maintenance what you're paying directly to the kiosk company so I don't think that's factored into what you guys are paying for admissions [Music] about six thousand dollars going over the immune system then add in the same time um Auto you know paying the mileage Etc all that good stuff on top of that and then finally that's at four bucks an hour um the air was talking earlier involved sometimes we don't want people here fine paint threshold let's see what their local customers willing to pay move to five and then that increase just you know as we move back no we're just knowing I mean why wouldn't we move it to five dollars an hour not all practical goes on China fix the system in order to kiosk dude I hear you say there's a 35 cents an hour of feed that goes apart it's just flat so 35 cents for however long convention transaction I think that should be taxed if you 30 questions what is Our obligation with with high and spend we're obligated to try this system out uh you're not obligated to do anything um I think as far as what your time resources would be to implement the service no I'm just asking if we if we decide to go to this route how long are we committing to let's just say doesn't work for Miller Beach or we lose revenue or yeah you definitely won't lose Revenue if anything you'll increase it's just a question of how much because typically it's easier to extend your time because you can do it from your phone instead of having to come back to the Kia so you're going to see more transactions because of that um our standard contract term is three years um so I would say three years you can go down or up depending on what you do cities some cities do five some do a year just to try it out if you want um but again there's no effort cost so you're not really losing anything by adding it that's my salesperson well and you can have a contracts are to be negotiated yeah so it could be three years or ten years if you have a termination for convenience Clause you could give them their 30 days notice and they're gone not to undercut here no that's yeah that's our standard Enterprise obviously it's accessible of my uh my thoughts are as if we switch we won't switch back but uh we are we're on a heart rate 7 30. um can we take 10. all right we're back and uh we're right back discussion does anyone else have other questions before I surveyed have a consensus on this I have a couple questions I'm I'm making an assumption that these numbers these hours came from our actual data that we have data 2022 exactly it was uh the last fiscal years that I've ever used I don't know and we charge different rates of different locations right now is that right I mean it so I I thought the beach was a little more expensive it used to be not anymore now it's uh four dollars during the week I believe it kicks up the five on the weekends yeah you know all of our parking areas Florida and this this lot you can technically pay for you 24 hours every other line has restrictions what are the limits what are the marketing instructions so Memorial parks at nine o'clock closes it'll lose it um 6 A.M and then base that part is and please six to I haven't checked that I believe it's almost 11. do we have the I thought Morgan was going to have a limit on how long you could park there too is that not the case it does well it has a limit on how much you can pay for it one time you can pay up to three hours but people can come back with the thought process they could almost stayed through where I thought it was we were trying to get them and I just remember this being so we didn't have the pet peeve on previous Council on top maybe she really allowed them to stay a certain time we did we wanted to make it even convenient so they had it coming back right the part mobile you can actually limit total time that he worked during that day as opposed to with their cashmere could appreciate them another three four in Oregon Park maybe work because a coincide of the bathroom breaks yeah yeah and then what about holidays do we have an option to charge for holidays or no on the current meters yeah um we could have set that up in the program no yes so Kyle it sounds like uh so just making the assumption that the revenue is not going to be less than what would be how do you feel as a city manager what's your preference I lean towards um it makes sense it meant a lot of personal experience of dealing with the got it yes not to get off the subject but boring part wasn't it originally I think the voice memory was called the University of like four spots we had two we had two dedicated spots I thought there were two but there's none now that's right can't we go back to doing something like that before residents that were out there and put four dedicated spots in there I think the reason we didn't was because we had we got State money or federal money to fix it to fix your working part and so you couldn't discriminate I was told it was because of Victory nourishment and I like at this point if we're not getting me tree nurse make our spaces back that's right you'll never get that special about it I know that's the problem when you get something else after we don't do future nourishment and I thought those easements were oh well you're talking about the easements best forever yeah all right any other questions the comment um on break I checked with my resident expert about the credit card processing fee at Park Mobile serves as a merchant of record and my resident expert stated that's a good deal that locks in a rate that has luxury so the group was on and going with departmental versus and whatever but uh I think eventually everyone will use in our lives well they'll just download the app everybody uses ad for everything except now because anyway I'm I'm on this side I'm definitely in favor of it I just think we need to revisit power price and parking and I think you know we'll we have to vote on this anyway we'll have to improve your assignment contracts so we'll have something more definitive in writing and a 3D before how do you think will this be the next meeting or any longer do I think um we can well it depends on how you want to procure so you can piggyback off of any of the contracts going on right now in Pinellas County we're actually negotiating a contract currently that should be used done pretty soon in Pinellas County for the county parks so you could probably just piggyback off of that one or we can do a direct agreement whatever but obviously all of those options a different timing admin for you guys purchasing policy yeah yeah but if they already have that Global contracts in place yeah the next meeting if there's nothing restricting you I think like they're beyond real good once we have enough warning and we've been reading contract and uh [Music] I think that's great I just do we need to talk about how that what that pricing looks like so that uh pricing for your parking well that you're not committing to pricing through your parking to them you're just committing we get 35 cents whatever I know no that my question was along those lines and we want to implemented this quickly especially with spring break coming do we want to cash out those the cost of parking now so once we get the contract signed we can possible I think that's all done on the app which will be in there it just goes under the machine code right there needs to have a concession that's where um we don't want to do that during a regular council meeting we want to know in advance what we're doing so it's part of what fits on the next agenda you know in other words if we're approving that or approving the price of parking and just probably around trying to expose yourself to before right now 50 50. and some of them um uh some some of them six dollars an hour [Music] a little tiny after you've reached the point of commitment and you can't turn around maybe three hours then I'm good with it that is the biggest six bucks base yeah I mean 30 bucks a lot of them go through there um I uh Kyle and I were crunching some numbers if we moved the estimate to a five dollar per hour rate instead of the four dollar if you're following along on the sheet that first number you see in the first paragraph that 832 the average transaction um we would turn that into 10.52 so we're adding two dollars average two dollars that would make your total credit card Revenue 227 000 instead of that 181 that you're seeing um so less all the fees and all the math in front of you that's a total rep increase in revenue of 19 about forty thousand dollars that you can expect so your total credit card net after RV would be 216. of that 178. there's that's just based on the back I have no problem with the five dollars an hour rate except for the people that walk that walk in religion early mornings parking lots and they're doing something healthy and I I down there is another story but here I think I think that I was flying into these rate and wee hours of the morning while they're walking the bridge I I had proposed that we do like downtown St Pete does that you don't start paying until nine o'clock or something along those lines I got blasted by a residents so I'm just telling you that so just a practice of my facts I want to make sure that we're all on the same page so I'm I'm up for a reduced rate or no rate until right so uh thoughts I like that the radar okay but the residents were paying nothing right there thank you and would also give them the option to even provide a what's the license plates sure get so it gets people off our streets for free okay so um let's uh let's jot this down right quick beginning 8 o'clock uh Monday through Friday it's free uh before 8. free here and then after eight it's five dollars an hour Monday through Friday five five up to what time so this one's coming before isn't it yeah so I don't know what I'm saying a lot of things so what's what's our cut off currently at nine here here we don't have them 24 hours okay so when do we want to either stop or switch over to a three and then the rest of the time until four o'clock in the morning it's five dollars an hour and you should tell me we should have a substantial you know all right now yeah like 70 bucks an hour you know it at least ten dollars an hour is not unreasonable yeah holidays weekends ten dollars an hour would you go around you have reporting cards it's free from from 4 a.m to 8 A.M and then from 8 AM to 4 a.m it's five dollars an hour and on the weekend didn't want to change if we want to give a break just for here here in the beach is here separate here from there because it's really is two seconds but on the weekend they used this party for one reason to go to 12th Street or 16 other weekends on holidays an hour just so it's five dollars down there during the week we just make it all the same and then uh on the weekends it's ten dollars an hour and holidays because let's see what the paint version again because these people are not citizens all right we're a residential Community we don't have hotels yeah this Livingstone yes sir I see you laughing okay so what what what's your thoughts on these grades no I'm in complete agreement um you know we the whole idea of how to make a valid region and living here for the residents to enjoy so weekends holidays ten dollars into six okay and we have what is our operating hours at Oregon Park uh 6 A.M to 9 pm yes okay and okay so the weekends here because we're over 24 hours are you still charging ten dollars per hour all night long yes are you good with that yes we've got to try and see what happens okay I mean I know definitely at the beach and find the marina for overflow Beach parking but you know here I kind of know but it's still the same thing yes I'm going to say yes so Saturday morning at 4am the rate increases to ten dollars per hour Saturday morning the Walkers here ten dollars an hour we're still doing this morning okay so it's still the the four to eight and that was we said free right right using it out so do we do we have a time limit for three hours at this lot or do we a lot of us we don't have money problem here you know if we're charging ten dollars an hour and they want to pay it I don't want to stay all day we became friends yeah yeah if it turns out it's a problem we can always not sure but so it pays seven days a week between eight and eight uh four a.m and 8 A.M these two lots are free down there it's five dollars Monday through Friday but Saturday and Sunday it's ten dollars an hour after 8 A.M all day long until 4 a.m it's ten dollars an hour a year on the weekends at home we just and that can always step out of her right in the Hat um and that could be done by resolution um so we can do that um like a very as an agenda once I have the contract all put together so it'll be two separate lines if uh let me double check I don't think we did the department used by our resolutions I think last time we did the right moment um I would just want to make sure that they're expelled on they would have to be completely separate here because otherwise the other one would have to modifier okay uh any last questions for this group here we just uh Frank just brought up a pretty good points we talked about those overnight Runners they park over in the marina because there's no available parking there hey yeah gotcha yeah all right there's always something yeah a new way of looking at things by the way thank you for coming down from Atlanta we appreciate it I'll get out don't worry I'm not going to say oh come on she got a free trip all right uh so now so much okay yeah thank you again thank you very nice meeting you all right now we are all to item number five uh this one was placed on the agenda by council member Robert something about discussion and placement of Fritz at the community center Community Foundation brick program says I know I know this is not our particular project but I'm finally concerned is um and kind of so right now we have enough Rigs of people's names on them for one rectangular session is that correct uh yes yes so we've got that set up yeah what I want to avoid if possible is uh let's say Frank signs up tomorrow and it may take four months before we get a large enough section of bricks to take care of their rectangular removal of concrete so here's my new post because I don't want to see that happen so somebody's waiting I hate for my prayer why am I not seeing me you know we don't know how long it's going to take it's unknown but then if we're taking out a whole such economy right so here's what my proposal is to have something contract that said that the BBC young would not request a quick installation or more than one time in six months and that was for maintenance purposes well here's a suggestion that I think may work better um and I don't know exactly how the process is going to work for the people that actually do the engraving on the brick but if this is my world I would go ahead so right now we have a section we're going to take out for the sidewalk right yes so I'm going to put the bricks in there Beauty so that's perfect so now that we already have the six seconds and the reasoning for this being our first but we've designed it slightly different with the bbcf you know Memorial Middle this is a plan to have 20 of the regular size breaks plus an increase here um the reason we went with this idea is because a new program we didn't know exactly and establish something that's what it was sold on well that makes I think my thought better so we're not taking out a complete section of the sidewalk just the center of it basically facing that picture yes or at least the first set where it moved that was just the idea we can always change design all right right but what I would do then for that next statement I would go ahead and cut that out on the map put the bricks in there without the names on it so then Frank signs up we take a break out and take it to the engraver the engraver doesn't work [Music] and there it is that's how IRP is it yeah because when I got a picture down there yeah it was a scolded the problem is less than three weeks yeah I think it makes sense just so that um we're not waiting six months you know somebody's already four thousand or 250 bucks or whatever it is so now it's taken care of I mean right away because the uh Foundation has already bought the grants so they're put in place and then I'm assuming they have any greater right so you just pull the brick out okay I'm bringing a new brick over how we want it done they ship the bricks in grade so we didn't just have dummy bricks yeah okay so we could do that and again it's not that many breaks but we could have W breaks in there the tapping barns it sounds to me like it would be kind of sloppy because you're pulling a break down you're running one hand and then and they're going to be variations whereas if you did them all at one time it's a nice smooth it sounds like papers you just take a paper out you know because you put the sand in and you pack it and put it in the other paper right back there they're not they're floated No it should be tamped [Music] so let me get this straight you take the burden of the mayor's off of it and then you give them breaks back [Laughter] what am I doing she's got a lot more time so how many have they sold very now that have been done before 20. and that's going to take out that one rectangular yeah that's actually perfect sure they have more than 20. you know the United States maybe not big but they might as well okay I appreciate all the intelligence [Music] don't forget your grandkids all right just just an idea so thank you so you're saying the same company that we buy the bricks from also does the Great okay well the free ship there's a minimum amount of in free shipping that as well I wonder why we have both the bricks I can tell you why it's because that's the whenever they went online on the Foundation okay that was my thought I just wanted to speed up the process so um like we said that we'll uh we'll look into depending on how fast these bricks are selling it puts yourself screwdriver any other discussion on the brakes our last time okay we are on to item number six discussion of right hand turn located on 19th Street and based on Bayside [Music] a place on the agenda by city manager yes a place is on the agenda because I and I included an email correspondence with a resident who lives in the area in Bayshore Drive um I met three months ago for the first time said that he's expressed his concern about disappointment for a very long time his main thing is he he sees the cut through traffic um taking this right angled term as fast as they can a lot of times coming out of the ash land side of the road there's no line of sight issue with that corner of like speeds that he describes people taking the turn it does present the dangers of it was walking their dog you know discreet around the corner or another bar you kind of do the same thing and it sets up a bad situation so I told him I would look into it and um I talked to the Public Works departments I talked to the Traffic Engineers I talked to the smart contract engineer just it's ideas the general consensus was he proposed a stop sign where when I asked opinions to to the professionals I talk to they told me that it is not in the recommendation um for for certain that the national recommendation for traffic signs to use a stop sign or the yield sign as a speed control device so um my final reach out was to an engineering company and they said that they would in their mind and their lady haven't paid them anything but they said that they were they were not they would if they did a study there they wouldn't be recommending the stops so I was based on the information I had um I emailed back um I feel more comfortable to maybe get to the stop sign but it was really jumping right into it was ideal um and what I was basically recommending was something like this um and uh you know he was asking me about the speed I told him I don't control the 10 miles an hour see like a group like good speed you were describing normally data something that you didn't expect to happen to be able to stop and you made the attorney 10 miles per hour you could make it faster but it wouldn't be safe because it's it's just the left turn yeah pretty good it's white it did not but there's no right turn some of our streets those islands have created more problems yeah [Music] before I got a council 2020 which has which provides a host of different things to do you know curb traffic somewhere more speed tables which they don't want well you might want to do a speed table at the crossover rather than on the street so when you're turning on there you're gonna have to walk a little bit stopwatch it's our street I think it is f dot really get involved if we put a stoplight on that street someplace um [Music] they do fly down that road and there will be rolling shops across uh 22nd we had to just keep on trucking the problem is is that we've been down this road vice mayor Shirley we've had this conversation Frank has been part of this conversation this is not anything new but the limited you try to do something to occurs the speed people don't want it so they want everybody else to slow down but they don't want to be inconvenience with speed tables feed on speed uh you know anything like that they also don't want the the radar signs they light up whenever you're going too fast I figured that without value if you get access we did some survey if they don't like that the the idea of the no crew sign I think that's a good idea and I wouldn't mind seeing those more of our streets because there's going to be a maybe one vacation or a year who's going to read that sign and I need to it and go oh I'm not turning down there because it says no through but that's something to consider and as far as the stop sign goes I don't think that I would you're looking both the fractions I would not consider putting one making the right turn on the 19th because I don't think the majority of people are cutting through there to avoid traffic because it's an inconvenience to make a left turn off of Gulf Boulevard not getting enough fat neighborhood then head south and then you step by traffic and get back out into it it's only convenient for people heading to Clearwater Beach so if we did a stop sign at all only the one approaching a Bayside would be the only one that I would even consider and I said I wouldn't have problem that at all I'm really surprised somebody's not ran through that intersections yeah I think it's um I mean I live right on 20th Street so Kyle and I talked about it a little bit previously and I kind of look at it multiple times so I think everybody understands what we're talking about here so if you're coming off of there's there's actually two problems in my view becoming um coming north on Gulf Boulevard can you take a right on 19th Street and it goes down and there's a house around the corner and the only way you can go at that point is left on the Bayside so people have a tendency right there they'll also be going too fast and not make the 90 so they kind of expect so they just they just makes a soft turn into there so they have an opportunity to have a head-on with somebody coming the other direction right because they're not really thinking through well also you have somebody heading south on Bayside and they're making the right hand turn because Bayside dead ends into 19. so they also are going to trans typically and they're swinging too wide so they're on the wrong side of them and that's where the two head Islands can happen so I don't think it's 100 due to we have the Debbie drafted it's just normal times you know people just going home or whatever they're doing and they're cutting that corner in both directions and they could hit other cars and or they could hit people that are walking with their dogs so I just want to make that point that it's not really necessarily due to the time we have heavy Beast Graphics going through your water because that's the whole other issue when I was campaigning somebody said yeah people come down here and they're avoiding the traffic on the Gulf Boulevard and they're applying on whatever roads are parallel intercostal and they're just flying down that road and that's cool is talking to this guy somebody came by and like a two-stop Ford Mustang going about 65s right down the road I mean if somebody a kid when I'm from no way no way but this doesn't have anything to do I don't think with the heavy eats traffic stuff that's going on this is normal where he has a problem one thing I can tell you about that said if you're if you think you're doing yourself a favor by going down 19 making a right turn and coming out on the adult Boulevard and that's not the best place to pull out at I think you're you're going to get out and faster this time you're going north you go I could look this is it's good because it it's been there crossing just right it's difficult to get out of there anyway you can so I think the people that live here um are probably maybe some of them are going down there but I can't do that not like it is that's why I was in favor of one stop sign and not to because I didn't think the one at the very end was necessary unless the cars start running into the guy's yard there so you're saying put it on on Bayside or put it out until the end of 19. so you make your left hand turn yes and and that would be my recommendation but according to these kind of sources they're saying okay that's not going to help you think well it's not slow down traffic is they're just saying it's not recommended I you know feel like I can see your point you know you stop traffic and then it's a matter of like enforcing it as well and you were not in the meetings at the time but it's overlooking work but whenever we did have these conversations about well what can we do about the procedures um I think because occasionally this comes up you're going to have somebody gets overly vocal it's fully Justified what they're complaining about but their neighbors aren't they'll get fined from the neighbors and so the last time we had this conversation about changing anything where it was flashing line or a speed table or anything to do it's a it's a inconvenience to drive down your own Street it would require petition and they would have to to Lobby their neighbors and everybody would have to agree that okay let's take this to the council and let them vote on it otherwise we don't know what we're talking about and then would it make sense to do the traffic study I mean this is always a time of the year where we get these same complaints and but that is in an intersection we've got to study on there that could you know it'd be interesting to see what the average speed was going around the corner or something like that so you need to give me some numbers okay I'll share that with you that would be helpful to see I mean a little bit [Music] [Music] it could turn out tow trucks I think Kyle's idea of kind of stepping since you know so if you want to start with something that's less than a soft sign see if that has a positive impact letting them know they slow down to 10 miles an hour because you're coming up on a 90 return and if you don't slow down 10 miles an hour you're gonna have to deal with both of you making that turn cleanly without pulling in regular money and that's the problem or if you still have somebody's still going to get a big sign right right you know right there at that house where the walking path used to be here and that is true the warning side doesn't need to be exactly the stop sign does right you need further uh you know I definitely like the idea of the notes for traffic now I talked to the Sheriff Deputy and he said that um we can put you know through traffic signs and they can stop vehicles that are businesses that they're through traffic but they will not be able to issue a citation unless we change our ordinance for something that they can reference I think this Council would have no problem doing it to be in favor of starting out with the Sheriff's Office [Music] to uh two-section approach as you're turning into 19 immediately they see that no free traffic and then they get down to the end and you've got to slow down to make that left turn I think it'd be something worth looking into and then we wanted to change the ordinance to support the sign that they were in and I will not be those in that Council I like that I just like say to pick up uh [Music] only okay is that awful yeah it's all going to come in an enforcement right because the deputy is going to be like well you know okay now I got to make them prove that their resume and then they're going to say well I'm coming to visit my mom actually tell the story and say no Outlet there's no Outlet on this room I'm going to set up the type of business shows just worded but no if you put like non-non residence [Music] we have to encourage those people to buy this for each division of the quality it's an easy thing for a sheriff to say hey they've got the beach the rest of residential Road and so what are you going to do whenever Aunt Bessie comes to visit you and uh you know of course because she's not a resume and I'll just use Bel Air as I got pulled over in Bel Air going to my office you know because of that in the Rocks Road it's closed and they said I rolled through a stop sign and didn't even get my driver's license you still live on Bellaire Beach you know like he knew I didn't live in Bel Air probably the part of the reason he pulled me over and didn't give me a ticket but you know just uh you know two and that's probably we need to enforce they're rolling through the stop sign at Bayshore in 20 seconds I know you have that as an example that shows the left-hand turn yeah I mean if I'm coming down Bayside and I'm heading south that's the more difficult term that's the big problem making the right hand turn because the centrifugal force is pulling you after and if you're going over two speed you're going to try to make that turn your outlet is too late you're coming down 19 heading towards intercostal now again you're an outside Lane that force is taking you out here less of an opportunity I think I think the bigger problem is Bayside slow that person down because they're making that 90 degree turn that's that's a tougher term period I I mean I see what you're saying but also I mean if someone's trying to take a left-hand turn fast from the outside Lane they're just going to cut that corner they could shine to make things but that's that's a definite decision they made to cut the corner the person swinging that right hand turned to go 50 miles an hour they've already made the decision they're going too fast they're going to swing out they can't make the right suggestions what what is your recommendation where I was at if my recommendations with the incrementally and try to evolve D if it's not working I guess that's it I don't think the council has to vote is a sign somewhere so what what are you doing exactly which sign are you putting in and where is it going I would I would put a life return in a right term with a recommendations 10 miles an hour both both sides and then just because you mentioned in the first signs we'll get started putting those signs up conditions and what about this High basis well actually it was Westies it's it's a straight line through at Bayshore across ourselves but where do they enter on on Harrison or where are they entering at so because yeah so you probably needed Harrison and then I mean Nation as well I think we just tried one there for now I mean okay so you've gotta you have a stop sign on my business already stopping and comparison okay and watching uh if it's straight or you can make a right turn onto the hibiscus you probably get the I I passed and then across no I need to get to it's like you coming from Gulf Boulevard you have to take a feeder road to get to hibiscus so what is that feeder road is that no through traffic out it got Boulevard at the feeder Road or is it on hibiscus I would say to know through traffic like just any any uh anyone entering off of those Boulevard that's where they need to see the military drive right kind of like when we do the uh no parking on the street side yeah yeah and this neighborhood watch signs they're probably not doing much too while we're talking about signs I actually had someone on my street say could you tell my city to do something about these signs they're all curfew it's great we got signs but they're all crooked so I'm just laying that message okay I'm like why don't you call Kyle and talk to him about it my guys are pretty good so the the no-free traffic goes on Harris I want to make sure all right and if it's I know if it is not being the effect the desired okay uh we're on the iPhone 7 which is General business oh yes I'm sorry so we'll just roll this right in the general business okay that's fine a while ago I had asked the councils permission to meet with the county on the infamous intersection up here at Gulf Boulevard and Fosters so it did just took me a long time so kind of so I met with Tom Washburn and you know Tom right he had many good things to say about you so I talked about all the different things that I've heard from our citizens as well as things that I've seen personally in this intersection most recently I was coming from a new Rocks Beach and I stopped right at the traffic light first car there and when the left turn light came on of course we don't have any yellow lights it allows us to turn if we want to because so both lanes happen to be full and so I watched everybody as they were coming and making the left-hand turn and going to bridge not one car had I think eight account in the right handling and making the left-hand turn actually follow the 90 degree striking pattern let's see not one every one of them cut it almost made contact every one of them were the people on the left the people in the left had to avoid and go into the cross yellow stripes to avoid contact and then they were like behind the front all the way through no contact was made but I'm 100 convinced contact has been made yet before we've asked I know that deputies before if they have any record of it and say no and I know the reason for that Frank and I touch each other and we pull over and we call 9-1-1 they're going to say it's anybody hurts and they say no they say okay we're not getting involved there's no report you and Frank share your information on insurance and you guys deal with it that's it so every time we ask the deputy so it might be so they say yeah the biggest problem is and another thing I've been well I'm coming from 20th Street and I'm going to connect multiple times during the day to watch grandkids I'm back and forth different times of the day it seems higher left-hand side fills up before anybody gets into the right lane I'm all I always take the right lane because I want to experience that wonderful feeling and everybody looks at me and like flips me off you're not you're not getting it you know you're not going to get in on me because I see what you've been doing and I'm not going to let you so we both make the turn and everybody just gets Bumper to Bumper and we have like a 17 inch merge ring you know try to move over so it's just a disaster way when you happen so when I turn right now I'll get a great conversation so we talked about some different ideas he did say that it's about time in this study to be done again it was done like two years ago so they typically like to follow it up they also have cameras where they only have to come out here and so they could they could watch he can put a couple of guys and task them to sit there for two days and watch bars turn and they'll see how that is working we also all know that different times of the year there's different flow patterns through there I asked them specifically because one of the ideas I had was I said okay Tom everybody that I talked to wants me flashing yellow left-hand turn like that for obvious reasons we know we can't do that in two lanes so if we can get back to one single Lane and by doing so remove the medium that's out there with the palm tree excuse me and we could just extend that bi-directional lane all the way down so there's no rules against them so people would just start backing up in that lane as necessary hurt people coming one of those streets trying to make a left turn on well I talked to the Presidents about that before and they already handled that in this manner talked to the people on 12th Street that was as close to the medium already and they told me you know Glam closing we go down we go to 13th Street and come back to the other side and an additional block gives them enough space and he said and typically it was local residents everybody's pretty considered and letting them get across either way um so he said I said well how would that process work if the city decides to do something like that he said again it's simple he said you guys own the palm trees and you own the money and you only elected really those out there so you guys the city would come in first and remove those meanwhile everybody took the palm tree the big bump yeah um well that was already recommended in this initial stuff are you going to remove that old minion the crosswalker correct it would be just like Sixth Street we've all seen sixth grade there's a crosswalk there what he did say you know we could make that a get rid of the two lane turn that also helps the people that are going straight down towards in Iran's speech because they're the ones that used to get held up because the people you know it was that short left-hand turn lane by removing the median and the bi-directional lane goes to Infinity start moving over and getting in line and they could also put timing devices and change it based on the public traffic through there so they can make it last longer the left-hand challenging as well and you'll also have a breaking yellow left-hand turn light specifically for the presidents here because they're the ones that they're playing when they're going to work in the morning at 7 30 and they come here to make a left-hand turn and there's no attractive as far as they can see and they have to sit there for a minute which seems like an hour of course it's just you know maybe 60 seconds so if you're irritating and then just under first cup of coffee so it's not good so that that would fix that problem and he said Lloyd in a worst case scenario do you guys do that and you change your mind we just simply come back and put a curve in and he said but I don't think it's gonna happen he says Indian Rocks Beach offered this information so they're actually doing that now they have similar meetings with trees and lines he said they've called us come back in and take them out yeah I think those are dangerous because I don't think you can see around some of those trees across I once I'm an identity of this and the night I was coming down and I moved over to the bi-directional wedding for some reason I thought I was there it was treated and I had people behind the tree and also to talk about it yeah and so that's good so the meeting went well and in college I just kind of want to you know turn it over to you um I told Mom to get back and council's okay with that and you could contact Tom you guys could put together a plan uh he said you know obviously you're familiar with it they do the study they'll just do an update on this study and see the line of crowd that just making the returns and make him actually look through the cameras and seeing how many people are using the right handline I mean how many people are sitting there in the traffic like he kind of agreed that if we got rid of that and just extended that bi-directional lane people would just naturally start moving over and there's a lot of traffic they're just just looking out there and go and then you get over now well I think there are many times but but I think that's there now that eliminated it by doing what they did you take however many cars are stacked up right now and you double believe is what you're doing so um but it's not much it's I've seen it you know both ways I think that one of the arguments that and trust me I I'd like to see that thing go too but I've lived there one of the arguments was that that Island presents a buffer it guarantees there's a way that you can hop into at least now you're there so you can merge over and get into but the traffic flow whereas if you extend that further down and traffic's backed up you have nothing the only thing you can do is make a right and find a place yeah and that was a complain also would you leave the existing crosswalk where it is yes okay so you just tear the island in the trees [Music] you could probably you could probably put bleachers yourself to take us it was time to hear we I've chased I've chased cars down that actually hit people and taken off going over the bridge and chasing and I'm Donovan Bel Air especially on trailers yeah I made the turn it's like they said no one's giving any leader all right and it's it's comic order but um I don't know I think going back to what system is better because when I when I first got on Council I asked how do you beat up north get the hell out of your paper use it sideways it's probably a hit but uh um I think it's I think we can remove that I'm kind of agreeing with mayor that I'm got two lanes or jam up this time of year now they're all trying to make the left-hand turns oh they're too nice well if you're going to expand that link you're going to take the medium now right expand the left lane you're still going to have another length too oh yeah I would go back to be an adult strength system so three lanes we'll just have two lanes one going into Indian Rocks now still be five same Lanes so the bi-directional is the one everybody will get into the left hand so you just have one left-hand turn that's right but that I'm sorry what happens to say you're crossing the existing islands and all that structure there that would be an expansion of the turn lane to allow cars to pile up and that new pile up and it was well I just want to caution you because I'm open to trying anything sure yeah there's going to be some unhappy people we're here I mean it's just it is what it is that's uh and times it doesn't cost you that um that it could happen and hey if they say we can change it if the county doesn't mind restriping it there on the street 10 times I think it's worth a try and they said that it was they could you know they would set the queue deeper based on the time of the year you know so they could have that left-hand turn green for a minute and a half spring break time you know so that thing you know when it turns red it may not take long to back up but then as soon as it turns green it's going to flush I wish you would stay nice to create another problem two lanes going Southbound on Gulf Boulevard and then that far below the causeway and one of the right is to merge was a problem because but now we're getting traffic that you can test it oh all the way in the First Street back up on the weekends to make the right-hand turns you see the right hand in turn yeah 125 minutes not at lunchtime this was about 10 30 to get from the south end of Indian Rocks Beach just to the capacity interception there I think a lot of people now are using that other Bridge it's a mess well that's something you see also when they're updating the study they can look at you know issue so that's I don't know it's a new issue coming from the south of the north and they can look at that and perhaps change the light cycles the numbers from that study here you take the vanilla score look at the amount of flows okay this was given to me by Lynn because your participation was you said well the final thing after the study was done he said it was actually the whole thing started with the previous mayor I said you mean Dave and he said no so um and and so he met with the city manager and the study was done which was great because there was a bigger problem just like you mentioned with the people coming from Clearwater or Largo whatever and coming over here to get to the beach so the bridge was bad enough does that include any it seems like we've had residents get up on the floor saying I made a mistake I went to Home Depot Saturday at 11 o'clock and I need to pass right I have pictures how bad it is and and there's no Rhyme or Reason to because everybody just decides let's go to the beach yeah well he said that he said that that's uh they had that new information or information again they'll change the light side so that ideally whatever the volume of traffic coming in here is that right hand turn they'll keep that they're all green for instant period of time just to get everybody off the bridge but they'll have to they got another Bridge coming up so they got to change office right you could put weights in there but then to attack the residents when they leave here you know make a nice long delayed that bridge and clear up the boulevard if you have to go to college or something like that um depending on it actually gave me eight and a half by 11 and said these are the times yeah so it was great I thought he was feeling it first but he wasn't getting it yeah at school it was the right turn uh we'll come back here yeah so it was all backed up this morning and then um [Music] once we get we start getting serious and just take a little survey down this new series because they're the ones that are gonna they're gonna feel the end result that's it any other uh General business I have some that I want to talk about just quickly happened today um our last couple places feeler is a dock Builder he's been building a dock on our street I would I observe them offloading their truck on the bridge on Harrison Avenue they had the barge out there didn't say anything Let It Go probably should have but she probably shouldn't snapped a photo enforcement I think today they were floating pilings all through the intercoastal they just had them like laying out there my husband went to leave with the boat and he had to work around these Pilots I did call code enforcement about that they finally did bring them in time into the sea wall but they these guys do whatever they want to in the city they've been warned a number of times about offloading their piles onto their barge on Belle Isle on Harrison Avenue anywhere they came towards Second Street on the bridge yeah they are the worst and the easiest way for them to get it because they don't want to come to the marina and unload them like everyone else does they don't they won't it requires more than just their standard cars with the bubem on it that's not what that's going that's for driving the pilots into the ground or pulling them out but they need a separate one [Music] consider no you can assume you've got code that addresses it you can get a code citation and you Zoom because every city does has in your code enforcement a nuisance preference and instruct us to file suit against them for creating Publications foreign [Music] if you where are they offloading do we have jurisdiction so another thing you can do in addition to the nuisance is create code that says you're not allowed to offload that any dock Builder must offload their pilings or whatever they're called here over here call it out don't we already have that time I thought we've already addressed this because it we have signs I have to check the new code Okay so yeah um but I don't think there is a designated place that we'd recommended we don't allow them to in the city restricted yeah probably I mean are your residents going to get mad that they're not going to be able to have a doctor well they can they just have to bring them in from and other companies do that most companies yeah and they float up and they float them next to the barge too that's okay yeah yeah but but to just float them out and then it was uh it's the canal that goes to our Marina they were floating and just tied off and it took a lot of effort to tie these piles off in the middle of our Waterway there and I guess that's our jurisdiction it's not really the intercoastal so it wasn't you know we don't have a police boat we don't have a any sort of means to go out there and now they knew that because they've seen nice pictures Kyle since they knew they were safe yeah so just something Food For Thought I don't know if next time you know when we need to make sure our code covers this but next time they pull a permit they probably should slam them on the hand I know there's nothing you can do more than give them a hey by the way we're going to keep an eye on you we want to know when you're in the city because you guys aren't following our code well and even if it's activities that are occurring in your jurisdictional Waters you have jurisdiction there was water so for instance you can say there no the dock Builder is allowed to float their pilings or whatever unless they get a separate piling movement permit from us and any other coordinate it's got to be only these times a day you've got to do these things and it's more regulation but if you're having a promise well they are the ones who chop the piling off and just let it float out in the canal and I think I called them and said hey come get this or maybe I maybe I call the city and we were able to grab it in a time yeah yeah they chop the top of it and just let it go one of my neighbors today's Foundation they mark it and then left it there all right any action items on that one other than just raising awareness and then Kyle's going to look at code and then discuss with legal replacement pursue one little quick thing that I did talk to Thomas so ask is there any new technology out there systems with alerting drivers on our crosswalks because we know we have a yellow flashing so it said two things that have happened that they put in a couple places they have in front of the crosswalk or the flashing lights go on as soon as somebody hits the button like a 30 feet in front each way there's an additional flashing device kind of tells the driver hopefully hey there's something going on here then you see the second one and they stopped in addition to that I think the app is called maze it was about and he said they're working very closely with that so that when you hit the crosswalk button anybody that's within X distance it automatically comes out to have the radio on it it'll tell them alert alert somebody's Crossing whatever it says they they don't stop unless you walk out into the street [Music] like like and he went down yeah it was a good big payday foreign I think the local residents well yes it's talking about the Clearwater traffic yeah [Music] I have one more question what is the cost of a parking ticket but if we are reading our rates in [Music] [Music] [Music] guy comes in March at 12th Street resident says hey you have to stick reviews [Music] yeah and he stayed there got fine and lots of our sheriffs don't actually walk on the beach ask anybody are you in this car or whatever like that give them the opportunity to leave which I don't think we just went through this in Bradenton Beach and the rates went up to 100 first offense two or another second offense 500 hours yeah right now there's people they Park in every bridge around here and yeah you can tell hey just give your heads up if a cop comes by you're going to get a ticket yes drive by five are still there yeah but uh I think that would also occur into actually announce what defines so I think much bigger fund and we publicize what it is ASU 3. is that working I have a more basis but it's nine o'clock and I will postpone it until the next work session anything else I just want to thank everyone for the flowers and being supportive during the loss that's it well Mike your cake has been a major distractions no problem all right do we have a motion adjourned a second all in favor of God"
