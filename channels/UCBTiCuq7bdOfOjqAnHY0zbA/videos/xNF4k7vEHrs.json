    "transcript": "good evening everyone welcome to the monday october 18th work work session for the city of valor beach please join me for the pledge of allegiance i pledge allegiance to flag the united states of america and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice madam clerk please call the roll council member robin aki council member frank banker here council member glenn gunn [Music] council member leslie notaro vice mayor dave gallis mayor joseph manzo yeah city manager lynn reeves city attorney fred riley and council member rita slope has not arrived okay so we have frank vanguard on the phone we just spoke at 601 is not here okay we'll begin the meeting so item number one is a work session first before we start um typically uh we're not voting on anything tonight but we typically do open it up the citizens have anything they wish to comment on um during the individual items so vitamin one two and three does anybody have any objection to us opening it up there's no objection so i'll call for citizen common citizens just so you know we may talk about something for five minutes we may talk about it for a half an hour at some point when there's a breaking point i will come and ask for the citizens to come up when you do come right up over here by the podium okay so number one is discussion of ordinance 21. we don't have to it's one session i was gonna i'd like to actually know that that's possible i i think we can or you can just bring it at the end but go ahead this deals with uh meetings and uh and how we how we address the council yeah um this is in particular section 2-64 reason why i'm asking the difference first is because we're about to have a meeting and i'd like to just get clarification i will see indeed exactly what they mean and just make sure that we're all aware of what those mean and how they work you just want to take it two a different section this is 2-64 and this is addressing 2-63 you see what i'm saying yeah but where do you want to bring it in under i would like to move it all the way to number one and just slide everything down so it's not on the agenda at all it's not only enchanted okay it's real this should go quickly okay so then we'll call it item a 2-64. okay so item a then is 2-64 dave going to turn it right over to you okay um i can't hear you though i'm sorry about it okay all right last week there were some questions that came up after the meeting and uh and they were from me um a certain member of the audience uh made uh citizen comment and they were referring to a particular council member uh they weren't speaking directly with that council member but they were referring to that council member um for some reason it was my understanding that we were not or that was not allowed so i pulled the code up and i read it again and i'm still not 100 it says all remarks shall be addressed to the city council as a body and not to any particular council member i understand that this is and was not speaking directly to that council member but was calling that council member out by name this is so great to me because sometimes they're not allowed to mention anyone's name i've seen many times where they've they tried to call you out directly and say your name and you called point of order but last week um everyone on the council allowed it so i'm not sure exactly what what what's the correct what are we supposed to be doing here it needs to be all one way or the other and we should agree on it can we address that one first and then we'll move yeah but just so we're all on the same page what were we what are we i mean there was a lot that went on so refresh my memory what was the interesting i think i know what it is but this was uh it was it was a call to our attention about radius a real estate transaction so i i just wanted to find out what what are we supposed to be doing here in this case i'll tell you my guidelines and that i followed pretty much religiously from the get-go if you're speaking of fact maybe the fact isn't flattering to the person you let it go because that's fact it may not benefit you it's a fact if you go into a person's motives that's against our rules that's against robert's voice order that one may have crossed the line the person themselves didn't call point to border so like you said i will usually call point to order if i find something going against me you called point of order but we had a meeting the last work session and i said it's everyone's responsibility now if you're not gonna call a point of order and you're being attacked if you don't feel it's an attack then i don't feel it's an attack either you know i'm not the public defender here so if you you know it's up to you somebody comes up dave you're this you know in fact dave's this day's wearing a red shirt i don't like red they wore the red shirt to make me mad wait a minute now that you shouldn't have said you don't know why dave where the red shirt they wore the red shirt because that's what he saw in the closet and that to me would be a valid point of order and i haven't stopped it so that's my guidelines i think that comports pretty well with robert's world's orders but if you're speaking factually i mean we always speak factually you are supposed to address the body but when you address the body you can be speaking about a person it's just that you're not supposed to and this happens sometimes when people are speaking right to a person dave you tell me that's not supposed to happen it's really supposed to be i'd like to know what council member gattis was thinking you could do that but nobody should be having a one-on-one conversation that's the way it is i mean we don't get real formal with everything has to come from me because literally if you had a question for lynn you'd have to say mr chairman you know we don't do that they do that in the house of representatives but we don't do that here um we could if people want to but i think it's just counterproductive particularly you know during these meetings but i do try and limit the cross-talking and the direct stuff but if you have a question for the city manager just ask it up that's the way i do it i'm open for you know if there's anybody wants it changed or anything but we will be consistent in how we do it but you gotta fight for yourself if you're you know it's not just yeah glenn no i i don't buy that argument you are the presiding officer and when somebody is addressed sometimes literally you are caught so flat-footed you're bringing shorts out and it takes a impartial person to sit back and say wait a second that's right it's not how we apply this stuff so i would appeal to you to exercise your duties as a presiding officer whether or not the person who is named takes offense toward or that's not our rule that's the one we went through last time and i'll be happy to pull it out but in addressing the council i read to you how it's everyone's responsibility to preserve decorum and i need to see more of that because i'll tell you i don't see it i see people sitting back waiting you know i don't mind being heavy sometimes but i want to have a nice reputation sometimes so i don't have to sit here and call everyone out if i see it it was a close call okay if someone if a point of order was called i'm not sure how i ruled on that one very well could have said it was well founded not because it's a fact that rico smoke sold the house that's fine you could say that but when you start to say why she did it now we're we're into the wrong territory so that shouldn't be said okay but anybody can call that anybody and i understand you get hit between the eyes but i get hit between the eyes all the time and i call it so you can't be snoozing at the wheel if you know if somebody's attacking you and if you see somebody else being attacked jump in you can call a point of order it actually makes it easier if somebody else calls it and i rule on it instead of me ruling on the border no i'm kind of a dave sometimes it feels great because i remember when that was said i was like does that count and then i'm in my head by the time i had the mental debate whether it was you know valid or not it moved on so i think we all need to [Music] step up and try to defend everybody and to me you know reflecting on myself maybe i should have said point of order and if it turned out not to be a valid one well then okay i just stepped back and but at least i tried and it was valid then it was made so i don't think it should all rest on him i think it should equally rest on all of us that we need to police it and kind of if it is great i'm not sure maybe call it out because sometimes it's better to say something than to be a bystander and let something happen that shouldn't and i don't think anybody would fault you if you said something out of benevolence and protection and even if you were wrong at that point be like okay well my intentions were good i tried so i'm ready to understand now that that wasn't the right time so i think we all need to be better about that you don't get marked a point against you if you hold point of order and it's not well found you don't just work no it's not well-founded sometimes i'll actually say no it's just factual we're okay again there's a lot of facts that don't benefit certain people and we want to hear those facts every fact isn't going to help the person because then all this is going to be is a nice session and that's not what it's designed to be there's going to be negative facts but i am gonna always support a point of order if you start to get into a personal attack you know your mother wears army boots well that's a personal attack okay you know you sold somebody's house and didn't tell people that's a fact okay um you did it for this reason and i'm not so sure about that one i don't think so so but call it if you're in doubt call it and if nothing else a little hint from people who do litigation sometimes it just breaks the momentum of the person who's just tearing into a person it just gives a little pause because then i have to rule on it and uh or i have to call for a ruling and uh it takes a break in the action so you're free to call it i don't sit up here and say you made a bad point of order it's there's no bad ones if you think it's wrong say it um but that's kind of if you're asking for the way i weigh it that's the way i weigh it and i try to be consistent with it i don't want a personal attack is when you're there's no fact to it you just don't like the person and maybe you don't like the person but you can't get up here and attack them because you don't like them and when we start getting way off the thing and there's no facts behind it you know your mother wears army boots well you know we're not gonna have that i don't know if that helps you well i think sometimes too the line of demarcation is decorum as well as fact so i mean julie noted that you know obviously fact trumps it but i mean there are times when the tone or the verbiage articulates a non-compliance with the decorum but that's any part of order as well yes and i found it here you know i'm just refreshing everyone's memory section 2-66-a council members while the city council is in session the council members shall preserve order in decorum the council members shall not by conversation or otherwise delay or interrupt the proceedings or peace of the city council disturb any council member while speaking or fail to obey the orders of the city council or the presiding officer so that's our rules um yeah i get the last call but even i don't have to take the last call i can submit any one of those to a vote if i want and if it gets really iffy i will i mean you know usually it's pretty clear-cut going to a glance that i agree with you sometimes it's fact that's how it's said so i think in those cases even if it's a point of order and it's fine because in fact i think it kind of breaks up that buildup and maybe then the person speaking it could just take a mental step back and be like okay let me stick to the facts and take emotion out of it so i still think i mean i'll try and do better myself when it's a gray line just say it and then you guys can either tell me i'm wrong and educate me why and so i know next time or if you say hey that's a good point let's follow that robert's room's water says that you can disagree or disprove or object to something in the strongest of means so you will hear if you watch any of the um legislative sessions people arrange their voices and stuff like that so it to a point it's okay i mean you know we had some sessions that got a little rough your veins don't have to be bulging out of your neck but you can raise it and you can't tear into somebody you can't say i'm disgusted by your behavior and that's fine that's fine okay but you know let's stick to the facts and you you can show your displeasure with the person and i'm that's what were here for um but the personal attack you know everything was wonderful till you came along well no i'm sorry everything wasn't wonderful and none of us are the problems individually okay so that that's a personal attack if you can prove it that's fine you can't prove it most people can't prove it so does that help somewhat let's see how it goes going forward the next uh his next topic is d and uh and this is this is pretty cut and drawn during the city council meeting audience members shall not make or cause to be made any audible or disruptive sound or noise that's enough about that i think we all need to we need to point whoever it is that's doing it how to call a point of order alternating and have it stop because that's happening way too often also um that's it you should have heard what so-and-so was saying okay so-and-so is not supposed to be talking okay so raise your hand point of information for the chair address it to me i'll have you come up here put it on the record and i'll tell so-and-so to stop we had somebody a couple meetings ago that thought it was funny to make constant interruptions with some kind of cell phone or something juvenile just absolutely juvenile okay asked once for it to stop it didn't stop at twice for stop didn't take the person out get their device turned off and then they can come back in i have the ability to remove a person from here if they're disrupting it so if you hear somebody in the audience just chattering doing a running commentary this is not the nfl there's no color commentary you go home and you can talk about whatever you want to talk about but don't do it while we're here you're coming out on the tape you're disrupting other people but i can't hear what's happening out there you know i'm trying to run and watch what's going on here at any point we just heard something called point of order i can't say well what did you say i wasn't paying attention i need to know what everybody was saying what the last comment was so i try to do that if there's something going on in the audience say and i will absolutely get to it i guarantee you dave anything else on that i'm good thank you very much um citizens it's opened up does anybody have any comments on this one before i close it out okay that one's done so let's go on we did not move one and two so one is still still saying that's number one and one is discussion of ordinance 21 is this right zz amending chapter 86 signs yeah actually uh we haven't assigned it a number that's why it is correct okay so i asked fred before the meeting i said did anything change on the sign ordinance and he just took out some of his changes um not his just red line changes and stuff like that so we're back with the sign ordinance and um we're back with the sun so where are we at then brought some visual props i see so well there was a lot of discussion about three by five two by four this that and the other so what i did i took some old core class and some of it i cut out this is our typical size sign you know for most things this is the typical sign that we see uh guard sale campaign sign campaign sign it's 18 by 24 and that's that's the size of it uh there was a recommendation to do a two by three and that's what this and that's what's written into the ordinance right now when you flip that around i want to see what the print looks like here oh it's not that much okay all right yeah so this is a two by three yeah okay two foot by three foot okay and then there was talk about uh three foot by five foot which gets let's see let yeah so that sign just to give you an example would be about this big which i don't think you're going to see a wire kind of sign sticking in the arms so and then there's some discussion about realtor signs this is a typical reel for side size might be this way it might be that way what's the dimensions on this um do your favorite put that against that what we call the campaign sign the first one that you showed that heavy yard sale you mean normal people yeah yeah the one that we the little one the guard sale one that's the standard i call it a campaign sign okay yeah so this is a realty sign it can be different directions uh one that says 24 by 24. and then we went out and got some signs did some measurements on some signs for contractors and most of those were in this range which were about another three or four inches bigger so you know they're pretty pretty close but similar to the realtor so i guess the real question tonight if you don't have any changes to the coordinates is sizes of signs and where you're going to put the comment with the three by five sign i don't think you're going to put that on one of those and even a two by four this size is pretty big for for that i mean you know unless you're going to put some stakes to it there were some bigger political signs though some of the the you know the bigger candidates or the events had it so yeah they're about that size they were mattered probably not so much the wire but you know we're a strong person so that's all i'm okay i was trying to give you some visualization because the sign sizes were everywhere and uh is it the last session i think that's was pretty much the only other comments to determine there was and i addressed it with fred and thank you for bringing the visuals because i think we'll be able to pick something from that tonight um the one question well frank i think had brought it up and he kind of said you know this thing is this ordinance is too big it's too long it's too complicated and i went back and took a look at it and i don't think that the legal part of it you should mess with i think it's it's been very well thought out there's a lot of detail in it and there's details in it for a reason but i was speaking with fred earlier tonight and i said my only suggestion if we wanted to cut the size of this down is there's a probably the first six or seven pages has like the legislative intent and typically you don't put that in your code in your ordinance itself that's in the whereas is it's in the legislative discussion you usually have to search for that and you know i wish everybody did put it in the law but they don't and usually when it's at the legislature you got to go find it okay this could be if we want to try and pare this down a little bit you probably can take about six pages out of this the beginning thing where it talks about the legislative intent some of the key cases and stuff i think it's all good but that can be moved into when we actually pass the ordinance and that's the only place that would show it wouldn't show up in the ordinance itself we don't have to lay out our thinking in our ordinance so that's one thing the other thing i didn't cross-check all of this but i know i was the one who said we need we never defined sign and then fred went back and defined signing defined a lot of different signs i'm not sure if all of those are applicable for us so maybe some of them can come out or be somehow limited and we don't have we even have illustrations on some of them which is great but that's you don't typically always have that in legislation so that i think is 13 pages of this i if we need to look to chop something i'm not saying take it out and make it disappear but maybe that's the area because i know frank made the comment that because i can't vote for this and that would be a shame because i don't think keeping our existing sign ordinance is going to help us so i think this is good law but maybe we just want to pare it down because it is it's a long ordinance but with that said i'm more concerned with getting it right than having it short and bite-sized i just don't think you're going to get this bite-sized and get the constitutional protection you're trying to look for so that's my two cents i'm fine with it the way it is i don't care if it's 30 pages i like the visuals because that helped me because the political signs i think the 2x3 is too i think the little yard one is probably more than adequate for political science personally but the argument was made like should a real estate sign be bigger than my political sign should the construction be so i don't know if we want to make two sizes standard or make one size that's up for us to debate but i'd like to get it more uniform and keep it easier to enforce that way somebody's not like okay wait a minute which side okay it's political so okay let me get my measuring and just say it's all all two by three are all 18 by 24 inches with uniformity it could be up to that sign and you know so if you want to go with what i call the standard political sign because that's the most affordable one if you're buying them then put that in and they've used them in elections over and over again but you might have the option of going a little bigger i just think that the minute we start to say that the realtor has greater rights than the politician who has lesser rights than the construction guy why and i'm going to come at you and say why i'm running for mayor of the city and you're telling me some guy who's installing the new bathroom has greater first amendment rights i think that's just not a winning argument so be consistent and you can give up to a certain size believe me if you're self-funding your campaign you're not putting in you know three foot by five foot signs you know they're just unaffordable but pick a size you know and it can be a little bit bigger realtors have a lot of information sometimes that they're putting on telephone numbers you know open houses that the other thing so i don't care if it's a little bit bigger but everybody should be the same size or up to the same size and then you make the choice you know what we have to pick the size that we can live with i think that's keeping us in the law right frankly if we if we're consistent from user to user without discriminating against the different users unless we have a good reason i would do the 2x3 and do it uniformly across all categories 2x3 is the that's the bigger size than the campaign sign can you hold that one up again that's a nice sign what size is the other one they open up i agree with fred let's keep it up to two by three and then if you construction company size to two by three and a realtor decides to do eighteen by twenty four that's fine but it's up to two by three yeah and every you go up to it as big you can make it as small as you want you just can't go bigger i'll agree with it if it appears in our next council meeting to vote on well i i frank banker is on the other line so i'm going to ask frank i mean he was going to say about the size of this and i haven't heard anybody else say about the size of this thing so i don't want to bring it in and then frank you know i want frank's support on this too and if it's if the only objection is because of the side of the size of the length of the ordinance then if that's something we need to address but let's address it now because i don't want to bring it up and we've been dealing with science for eight months here so frank yeah so i i gave some options if it's too long or can you just live with the fact that it's just a long thing here now oh i'm talking pretty loud actually can you live with the ordinance the way it's written now or do you want to i gave in the beginning some ideas to maybe pare it down by taking the legislative intent which would be about six pages the first six pages or so you could move that into the whereas as when we're passing the ordinance and it wouldn't appear in the final code that would save six pages fred could always go back and take a quick look at the definitions of the different signs if they don't apply to us he could strike them but otherwise i think we've really beaten the verbiage to death here with what's allowed what's not allowed but you're the one who voiced the objection so i just want to see if it's still a concern for you is the cone of silence not working here frank he just won publishers clearing house no response glenn i the last time i kind of sided with frank so maybe i can fill in the void here i'm having a hard time figuring out why we're in the swamp here and i've kind of forgotten i think leslie brought it up at one time what's wrong with the old one i think what brought this to light was apparently at one time a resident any concern about the constitutionality of his political side so other than that what has been the issue where we have to take a sign ordinance that has worked for years and can be kind of readily understood by our resident because it's only a page and a half and now we have a 25 page document with eight pages of definitions and yet we have only a half a page of exemptions which is where the wicket's going to get really sticky there because somebody's going to go into those very vague exceptions and say aha well there's my exception right there and yet we've got eight pages of definitions in a 25-page document but again i think the uh president is going to find a loophole in the exemptions there i i'm just not sure i understand why we're going through this drill anymore i do remember why i think you do too and i'll refresh your memory on it i mean we actually had a resident on your street hang banners off his roof that were so big they actually were the size of this roof you could see them probably from clearwater if you were boating and he basically threatened us and said go ahead tell me to take it down that's what he told me and i told him i don't enforce that and then we had mr alfa doulas have his sign pulled from his front yard by our city manager which were political signs turns out mr alfondulos was an attorney for a major i think michigan law firm and said you know i can sue you right now and he said i'm going to use this as a learning experience and we suspended the enforcement of our sign ordinance because there were various issues with it most of them constitutional i mean here's a good example the the construction guy has more signage rights than a politician i'm not saying it's going to be challenged but if it is challenged i don't think you're going to win now how expensive a learning experience that's going to be it could be very expensive you can't bullet proof it you could always get challenged but if you know your ordinance is wrong we didn't pass this sign ordinance this was passed by prior councils with prior legal direction but we've got something now that hey two by three is your size i don't care if you're construction i don't care if you're running for sheriff i don't care if you're running for council member mayor that's your son do what you want with it and now nobody can come back and say well you're favoring so-and-so construction why is the construction guy get more rights than me and that's a valid question that's why we're where we're at and that was the attempt to try and fix this before we got into a problem had mr alfandulos pushed that issue that would have been a federal lawsuit and it could have gotten very expensive i don't want this city manager or any other city employee pulling up people's signs unless there's a darn good reason and it sticks constitutional laws i doubt that's me saying it as mayor ask your city attorney i doubt that he's going to tell you that's okay that's my feeling so the way i read it is the portion that deals with political science still has the same caveat as the existing one which basically says hey we're not we're not arguing with your political ideology we're just saying that it doesn't conform with the 45 days before a campaign i remember this one distinctly i remember some people running going oh do you count the weekends and they were all worried that they were going to put their sign out one day too early meanwhile we have people in this town just go around the corner from you have trump 2024 hey i hope 2024 is a reality but right now mr trump is not a declared candidate and there is no 45-day rule within 2024 we're two years away and yet people have political signs out there so we either have a 45-day rule for everybody including president and council members and you name it but we don't the problem is now we've got that rule for council members but other guys are sticking in their trump signs or abiding signs or communist party signs or whatever they want to stick in they're like go ahead do something about it it's a trap i don't know i know the one on your block was a trap i was just hoping that we were going to take action and we were smart enough not to bite but had we bitten i don't know this guy right in the corner by you he said trump's on forever that's good i'm glad he does but it doesn't complain it doesn't comport with our stuff i don't see code pulling it up i don't see literally he's going pulling his side out libraries would never pull that guy's side out like frank disconnected do you want me to get him back uh yeah let's just pause a second we're disconnected frank bancard at 6 33. hmm [Music] he calls in just raise your hand and i'll stop it and we'll get back in okay so frank banghart is out at 6 33 due to technical difficulties i think i just said what i was going to say the floor's open well i'm thinking that the the old ornaments or ruling was more made and more subject to interpretation more gray so to me this just kind of clarifies things and i i mean i'm obviously in medicine so everything's a little more black white there but in law i my understanding is there's no bulletproof there's always somebody who's going to find something but i think this at least tightening it up a little bit and protects us more i think fred has done a great job putting a lot of work into it is it long and lengthy but hey i mean it answers a lot of questions and yes in reality one page is easier to read through and understand but it also leaves a lot of stuff out that could be open to interpretation i think this the more detailed it is the less you can interpret your way and just read it and this is what it is so i'm i'm for this one thing i i would like to clarify though as we keep throwing out this expression that's going to be very costly for the city so i mean even if that one case with the political sign had gone to litigation is the city of bella beach on the hook are we covered by the florida city's insurance laws you are but i mean i'm covered by auto policy but my state farm agent is going to drop me tomorrow if i go down the block and hit every car just for the hell of it you know i mean there's a limit i would think and then there's an experience rating which probably goes into our how much we pay each year so yes we have insurance but you know i've got fire insurance on my house but i don't play with gasoline in the living room so to me this was an attempt to take care of the glaring errors can a good constitutional attorney try and poke holes in it even a bad one can okay it doesn't guarantee you that you're going to not get sued but with something like this i just think we've kind of closed off a lot of the escape routes and the obvious stuff where people can come and say this isn't good you can go back to the old one but the old one i'm telling you as far as i'm concerned has a ton of problems i'll hear from the city attorney if he thinks it's good but if it's good then we'll stick with what we got i don't think it's good it wasn't good and that's why we suspended it we've been kind of suspending it for a year now so i think it's time to you know kind of get back into some kind of an ordinance i mean when it's been suspended for a year and nothing's flipped on the radar so i guess that's that's my point i mean the other one's stood the test of time it's been around for decades and we had one blip that was dealt with at a tactical level by the city manager it went away and uh so i guess that's my point but if you let one person get away with it because they're loud and holy but then the other person who's a little guy you can't get away with it that's not beautiful that's not fair so what you're saying is right now i can put a big sign as big as i want in front of my house which face is yours you put glenda stinky or whatever anything and it's okay right now because we don't have anything enforced so i think we need to have something that we don't suspend in order to prevent mean neighbors which i would never do that um from doing that or harsh political statements or attacks or something we just need to be able to protect the city there's always going to be that one little thing that's going to sneak in but that's going to happen regardless of the old one being suspended for a year or not so we can't we can't protect against those little tiny things but i think against the vast majority this covers it glenn i think do you say we haven't had anything in a year we won't because like 80 of this town doesn't even pay attention to what we're doing here you know there's a handful of people that follow it and they're up on it they know the code they a bunch of people don't never put a sign in their yard for anything at any reason they don't want to put a house number on their house so you know they don't care okay but it's that one that does the one that's going to put that big sign or like you know like robin said some obnoxious sayings directed at your house you got to look at it now we're so worried in this town that we have ordinances that say you can't put a bicycle in your front yard more than 24 hours and you can't put a beach chair in your lard more than 24 hours well then we're going to allow someone to put a sign and i don't care if it's for my candidate next time it won't be for my candidate it'll be for somebody else you put a sign the size of your roof and then you put two of them and you put three of them that's trashy and i don't care if it's my guy i mean there's a point you know put that little what lynn just showed us the two by three put it in your front yard you can have it there 24 7. you do have the right to stick a sign in your front yard you can even put a sign in your front yard that says bellar beach is wonderful bellar beach stings whatever you want to put in but for trump 2024 absolutely i don't see why you can't put that in but but a banner the size of your house i mean you know you wouldn't like it if there was space in your house i bet you know i mean and it doesn't have to say trump it could say a lot of other things a lot worse i mean there's a city in new jersey that i would tell them not to do it if i were their city attorney but they there's somebody with you know used to drop in f-bombs and it says f by him he's got a whole uart full of these things and they're finding him on the code and they're going to wind up in a federal lawsuit and they're fighting it out right now but you know you could put that in your front yard but we're going to give you one we're not going to give you a 20 i don't know how big that roof was but 20 foot maybe maybe bigger that was a big matter those encounters they put up at the at the rallies that's what this was for if look the count if the council doesn't want to do it then we don't have to do it there was a lot of effort put into this i helped fred with some of this we did a lot of research on this based on our input we kind of hashed it out so i think you've got a better one if the council doesn't feel that we can turn it down and go back to what we've got and start enforcing it and see where the chips fall i mean that's the decision the council makes we want to move this i guess the key here is to move this forward because we have assigned ordinance so if i can frame this thing we need to move this potential change forward you can vote against it when it comes up right but we got to get it out of as they say get out of committee because it's been in committee forever so is it good enough to get for those who are supportive of this thing is it good enough to get out of committee i wish frank was on the line because i know he had expressed an issue about the left but i don't want to make any more effort making more changes unless you know if i don't have a problem with the length you know but i'm an attorney i read these long things all the time so robin doesn't have a problem leslie i think was okay with it i mean this is an attorney too you know the attorneys don't have a problem with it but that's we're used to reading pages and pages of stuff sometimes so i've got one question and i'm looking at page 18 article 3 standards section 8661 flashing activated sign shall be prohibited and yet i go back to the definitions and i can't find the definition that okay you're looking at 86-61-1 that's correct okay if it's not defined then it's the plain meaning of the words clashing activated signs i was confused about this also and i believe that's my interpretation was it was motion activated that's what i that's because we're discussing floodlights and things like that i maybe it detects a car coming by it activates i'm not sure flashing and activating no i was with fred on this i mean in war and contractual law the interpretation is always plain english and flashing this point that's flashing so this it would if they wanted and they were not i'm not i'm not picking on you if they wanted to say motion activated then they would right so that's why it's just a little yeah and that's the way a court would look at it they say well if the legislator wanted to say motion activated they would think motion activated then they said flashing so i mean it is plain english the problem i had what started this whole monster was there was no definition of sign and that that was confusing to me because really what is the sun you know and that was a more basic question because is that banner considered a sign i think it should be you know um you know if somebody made a big neon sculpture or something that says you know i love bellar peach it's that sign i think it is you know so we that's where fred was tasked with come up with the meaning of some of the signs that he had some you know a lot of detail in here which i don't know that it's a bad thing i really don't it doesn't bother me if you have to read through 30 pages um but i don't understand what a flashing activated sign is i'm used to flashing signs flashing lights flashing morning caution lights by flashing and activating the sound it's activated that's the question for the activities i guess that's is to like light bulbs as opposed to one of those that shiver like as you move by they change color and shimmer as they catch the light so activate it to means like electrical folds let's just say flashing signs that takes care of i assure you it's not a term i dreamed of yeah it's a term i got from another uh city that or it may have been i can't remember this may have been in the original ordinance i simply don't recall i i think you could take each one of these definitions and probably try to figure out a different way of interpreting it so i think like what fred said if it's just drink forward leave it just if we have anything that has to be edited i mean you know this is a concern now you know we've had two council members say i don't activated understand question necessarily what it means but if there's anything we want to change even though it's a 30 page ordinance we can't change too much of it and still get through with the first reading so i guess what i'm saying is if we're going to change it tonight is the night if there's any questions let's change it now if we want a better definition of that clint then let's ask fred to put the better definition put it in for the thing for the next reading but what i'm trying to do is say do we have enough consensus to move this out of committee up for a vote if it fails you keep your you keep your side orders that you have and you go from there there may be a definition in another ordinance in another city and if y'all would would like a better definition to make sure there's not uncertainty as to what it means and the easy solution is to define it and that's where i'm struggling with this and i understand why blaine called it out is because okay what activated it yeah you can define that well that's that's what you're talking about if you turn your turn flip a switch in your house and the thing starts flashing you can't have it i'm not sure i don't know where we're going should we define it is there anything else that anybody picked up on listen um on page 20. towards the bottom of b placement authorization no temporary signs will be erected on any property without the authorization owner or residence thereof and then down below that it says no temporary sign should be erected on any property without the authorization of the property owner or residence thereof and i'm trying to figure out what you're going to accept on the first one you see what i'm talking up bottom and page 20. that would seem to be extra don't seem to be external yeah i think we got an extra thing in there fred did was there special meaning to it i see at the bottom of page 20. where's the other reference you're talking about there's in b placement authorization no temporary sign should be erected on any property and then underneath that in its own paragraph says no temporary signs will be erected on any property it's unnecessarily repeated so one of them [Music] and i'm in favor of making everybody a two foot by three foot sign um let's see can i just cut in for a second are we all good with two foot by three foot for the purpose of this i'm really not i prefer the smaller one i know we're trying to simplify it but those are big size that's going to be everybody though if we do that i mean every the realtor is going to have to cram their thing into the 2x3 and i'm not i want to hear it you know but they can't fit in all their information i mean well i didn't uh i don't necessarily think that uh it's whatever the council decides but as far as standard yard signs go the garage sales the political signs i don't want to see three by five whatever size they but is it two by three i i want those all over the neighborhood especially if we have a storm or something like that they're giant sails well i mean but that's the way it's gonna be there too for construction ones too so you're building this big house you're gonna have to put a dude i have no problem as long as we're consistent i don't i think it came out smaller than the um well i call the campaign sign the first one i think that's the smallest practical but and even the construction signs i have an empty lot two locks down from me and they had a large sign and that thing was blown over knocked down in disrepair within a month after they put it up and then every time they would come back and make repairs i just think it's it's too much i agree with the construction signs and i'm trying to find it we're considerably larger than the two foot by three foot it doesn't matter to me i think standard i call the standard campaign sign you can put your message on it i've seen plenty of construction people you know drywalled by johnny and you know has the telephone number and get your message out but some of these construction guys they're putting these signs that are literally four by fours you know that are mounted on four by fours that are huge and you know this is another project by you know joshua mogee well that's wonderful but you're gonna have to put that on that little sign now i mean i'm i'm kind of a day on this because i don't want gigantic signs either the only part of leaning towards the 2x3 is the realtor signs on that wood you know would that little sign be visible enough for them i don't want to hinder anybody selling their house because their sign is not visible but i also don't want two by three foot construction really so i don't know i'm kind of but then kind of to me it's like nowadays in the digital world all you need to do is put the name of the realtor company the name of the realtor and the phone number and that to our website and that should be plenty on that yard design in fact lately the last few homes that we've seen go on the market and then immediately come off the market never even received a sign but remember this is an ordinance that's going to last for you know hopefully decades too so you may not always have a market like this so does this include the signs with a post in the ground swinging or is it just the stick of the yards on this the size that i gave you the 24 by 24 that that was the sign that's swinging on that post with the real then maybe we can change it to 20 up to 24 by 24. so that will cover the real term and not be gigantic kind of the middle hey if you want a special or a 24 by 24 political sign for a yard sale side we'll pay for it can you hold up the 24 by 24 next to the 18 by 24 just so we can all see all right here's what i would suggest so we can move this forward without miss tell me if i'm wrong on any of this frame we can leave that size open for discussion at the next council meeting put that in and vote on this having bring the two sign opportunities we're missing two council members tonight it's not binding what we say i don't want to limit anybody as to what the sign is going to be so leave that part open i don't think we're misleading the public say it's going to be up to two foot by three foot but that's something but a little asterisk that this is subject to discussion at the council meeting and when we bring this up for discussion we will somebody will come up with an amendment to the ordinance without causing us to have to do a reread or re-advertising that's if not we have to pick it tonight we're not supposed to vote tonight so i don't know what we do well i would say let's pick it tonight put it in and then if the other two have a big objection to it change it at that time because to me that's the whole purpose of doing it here so we limit all of this drama the other meaning and to me if you feel strongly about the sign then you need to somehow get to this meeting by phone by zooming by something you make an effort or you just need to lose listen um i found the reference i was thinking to on the construction site on page 20. it shall not exceed 15 square feet in area do we have a 15 square feet in area sign there [Music] yeah all of that's going to have to change so you know what before we do a quick little consensus vote let's open this up to the citizens can i make a few comments and then i'll open up the citizens okay the couple comments are i'll start with the size i would strongly encourage you to make it uniform regardless of what you end up choosing because if it's if it's uniform that it takes away the issue of you're favoring one class over another in addition it makes it easier for enforcement purposes so you know that whatever you guys decide is fine having said that the the discussion that you related about um shortening it by including the legislative intent in the recitals is fine okay there's a reason for me putting it in the way i did it as a code provision to me that makes the code provision stronger because you have made that an express part of the legislation but having it as a recital in the ordinance where you adopt it is another way of doing it and to me it's not quite as strong but it's it's a degree lower in strength it to me if there's a key thing that is important for you to understand in evaluating where we are the stuff that's related to legislative intent is to go to the point of this is what is important for this city and as a home rule concept this city is state stating very clearly in the legislative intent that this is not u.s 19 with all the you know hundreds of signs in every block this is a residential community there's no commercial there's no real no [Music] commercial no retail and you value the aesthetics of your community the conceptually the purpose in putting that in there is that you ever have to go to court to defend it you are in a much better position if you have stated the basis for for why you made these kind of decisions you made the decisions because we we want this to be an attractive aesthetic community we don't want this residential community to be a haven for people putting up signs in the political portion of it it's only for 30 days you had said 45 so i'm i'm correcting that because i if i don't somebody will leave here thinking it was 45 it's not the 30 is what was there's a case that i came across which you know what's hard to do um it just takes time to look at all these different things the 30 days is a standard and you're not going to get in trouble with that if you lengthen it to 45 or shorten it to 15 you're likely to have problems with it 30 is a safe harbor number so i would encourage you to stick with with that the when this all began mayor manzo kind of explained how it evolved initially the changes were to the political signs and then the question was raised aren't there problems with other parts of this and you know my answer was there's other parts of it that you can if you can change and you can modify and a lot of this stuff uh i think was likely written i would say at least two decades ago maybe more like three or four and believe me in that period of time there have been countless cases in the federal courts on signs and constitutional rights and freedom of speech and one of the most maddening things about this whole process is that in my opinion the court opinions are not consistent i mean every law review article i've read on how do you structure a municipal side ordinance starts out with the same thing this is a quagmire the court rulings are inconsistent so when you read that over and over again you know going in that is what you're dealing with so i again will will circle back to the legislative intent the the object of the legislative intent is to say these these are what things are important for this community and you if you ever go to court there's a severability provision in there towards the end if you ever go to court you you get to say to the judge we made every reasonable effort to put in place something that reflected our community's values we live in a residential community we value aesthetics we have uniformity and the sign size and we don't want a bunch of clutter and if the judge says that's fine i hear the rap but at the end of the day i'm going to rule it's unconstitutional then hopefully you will be limited to ruling one provision unconstitutional and the rest of it will stand that's the object the taking the definitions and moving them i would not encourage that because it's i think you could do it but i would not encourage you to do it i would encourage you you if you're going to try to shorten it in some manner then take the legislative intent and put that in the body of the ordinance keep the definitions because the text and the legal standards that are outlined throughout the changes to the code are certainly dependent on the definitions i didn't come up with the definitions i looked at a whole bunch of different cities around the state of florida and looked at how they used used their definition provisions and i liberally borrowed from other cities within the state which is typical of what lawyers do so i could we add things you can add all sorts of stuff i actually believe it or not i know you won't believe it i'll say anyway i tried to change as little as i possibly could and you know still it went far longer than i would have ever liked but i think it's it's as sound as you can get um or it's a sound as you can reasonably get there's all sorts of things that i could have spent you know hours and hours and hours more researching it and i would have come back and said the same thing the case law is inconsistent and what you're really trying to do with this is be able if you were ever challenged on something you before you ever get the challenge you would do what we did first with mr athan doulas who was actually a extremely reasonable guy and you know and when i talked about it lynn and i talked about it lynn talked to him and then i spoke to him a second time and he he did not want to cause an issue other than to suggest that we needed to look at changes in he was extremely reasonable about everything and we found a way to go forward without there being a federal lawsuit that's what we did in the future if you pass this the way it is now once you make the decision on sign size and somebody else comes in that does not mean somebody that puts up a 20 by 20 foot sign you know they they may if they do that and says do something about it then you know you bring an enforcement case and you prosecute the enforcement case and if you end up in federal court over that that's you know the guy wasn't going to comply no matter what you did and in that situation um then you hammer on we we put in place stuff that is consistent with our community standards and we went through a lengthy deliberative process to get here and we did stuff that was reasonable and i would hope a federal judge would agree with you i wanted to just clarify one thing um when i say 45 days and i look back over here to what you're referring to so that says temporary political signs shall be removed within 30 days i was talking about their initial place we used to have an old dodger that you couldn't put a sign out until 45 days before the election now we very smartly and i think it was one of the things i brought up with you we pulled that okay because you may have a political belief you know pick your favorite party and you know go whatever go democrats go republicans you want to put that in your front yard okay you know it's not really for an election it's just you're supporting your party so that allows that but we used to have 45 days before the election and um that barely was enough time uh because of early voting and other stuff like you said this was made 10 years ago or 20 years ago and now if you look the prevalence is on early voting here so if you're putting your signs out you know too close to the election half of people have already voted it's no it's not going to help you so that was what i was referring to i have no problem with saying 30 days after the election it's time to take out you become free sign you know the election's over he's not going to run again that's that you know so let's go to the audience after golovkin yes i remember when i was running i put a sign there was a corner lot right here on causeway and one of the side streets and i had one on the side street and one on you know causeway that's the best visibility and i was told i could only put one per property is that in here i think so i think it's but i don't know if we had that with one per property one you know one per property per customer for candidates like i can't put two of my signs one each three one is that in here i'm just careful i think so there's something about quarter laps that you could put one on each street well it's not in there because that was one of the cases somewhere along the line that i read over the reason is that if you have a family of four you may have four very different political perspectives in the family it doesn't help with family harmony but for political purposes they all should be able to to exercise their voice and you know what really shouldn't happen is somebody puts 100 signs in their yard that that to me is um that's clear inconsistent with you know being a reasonable neighbor but technically not it's discouraged for neighborly but technically you could you could have one for every candidate you know you could have if there's three people running for council and one person running for mayor you could have four signs in your yard four different people but yeah but like a quarter lock and i do one on each order so i think you could have one pick the road you want that's what i did that was specified against i remember someone pointed that out yeah i didn't know if that was still in here well this is is like the path of water okay the path of water is always going to be the same it's going to end up at the lowest destination it can go because of gravity the this is not bulletproof that was said it is i i readily agree it's not bulletproof and there may be people in this community that will spend nights um devising a way to circumvent the intent and you know if that's the way they spend their time so be it i actually the longer i observe this stuff i sadly will tell you i know there are people that do that that is what they do but you know you're trying to put in reasonable standards that reasonable people will comply with and will there be outliers i guarantee you there will be outliers hopefully they will be at a minimum well then i would say my my opinion would be to keep it as is and change it to the dimensions to 24 by 24 so it covers realtors and doesn't get too garish and big and then maybe add the flashing activated definition just for a complete query [Music] 24 by 24 is a good size to go about this 24 by 36 now he that was dave said he thought that was too big so then we went 24 by 20. i mean if we're split on it we're gonna have to put something in to go to the meeting with so how many went 24 by 24 20 and the other choice was two by three yeah sorry leslie it's two to three so it's not binding but let's go with 24 by 24. and that would be all references then change i do want to hear from the citizens though before we find out this okay okay leslie temporary signs 86-64 says within 48 hours after the culmination of the event sale election etc etc the um [Music] the owner shall remove all posted temporary signs and then under political signs it talks with it about removing them within 30 days of the election does the fact that it's a temporary political sign override the 48 hours because it's more specific 86 64 what so a verse 86 65 33 i i would suggest we delete election from from that and that way you you were addressing completely political science political departments and lynn i'm going to say this officially when we passed this but um i i know it says about impounding signs and stuff but you know we just had to think about code being about compliance and education i use the education route before i use the impound route because nothing's going to set up if you know if we want to find that person who's out there to test us impound a sign that's going to get them riled up but if you say listen you know like robin's question there's a legitimate question i've got a corner lot i've got gulf boulevard and i've got 22nd street both of them are high traffic areas which one do i want a lot on both well you can't have both take your choice and if your code officer says that as opposed to pulling one we might be in a much better way you know so i would just suggest that it's not going to go in this ordinance but in terms of enforcement before we pull anything because once you pull it now you've got theoretically the violation if somebody wants to see it so i've used that as a last resort well most of the times when you pull the sign it's a sign that's been left as an example somebody put an open house sign out on the street on sunday and didn't i don't go to boulevard and didn't pick it up when they left or somebody puts uh and i know everybody's seen in the signs that say stucco call this number those are the things that danny picks up really [Music] [Music] things like open houses or somebody did a room you know two weeks ago you know it shouldn't be there after the project you keep them for a certain period of time citizens i promised you two pencils [Applause] [Music] um i agree with robin um that it should be up too so what if you you're just putting a regular sign you didn't want to spend the expense of buying the baker's sign i mean why do we why does it have to be that big why can't you go super saying number two so up to the the language in the code provisions of say shall not exceed right so that's what it would be based on whatever choice you end up making and you know i like the square foot thing so if you want to have like two inches stretched out be my guest i mean we could say two by two or we could just say like we did with that construction sign no greater than 15 square feet we could say no greater than four square feet you split it out however you want to do because if you've got some long name maybe you want one foot by five foot i don't know but maybe you just want to give a maximum square footage okay you know you don't all have short names but roger mall 115 causeway boulevard dave i think i got an answer for your question roger can you just either pull the mic up or down there you go i think i have an answer for your flashing sign uh nationally uh there's been enough incidences where either flashing lights or flashing signs have caused neurological disturbances and precipitated seizures and migraines and bipolar disorder for neurological disorders so i think it's probably well placed in there because we want people getting the neurological event the you are dealing with free speech and that's a well-loved amendment so i you know every time you give an exclusion then you open up a pandora's box so i would i would advise that you're not putting your names whatsoever i think where we stand now is that we don't have any exceptions i think we said everybody the same size as other two up to four square feet if that's what we want to go with and break it down thanks everybody anybody else yes deputy mall one one flying cosplay um i just have a couple i guess a number of questions um so this sign ordinance it's going to apply to the motel to the combos i'm assuming is that correct apply to everybody both sides so now they can put in digital signs are we going to regulate that at all are we going to say they can flash they can't flash or do we already say that can't have flashing signs are we going to have hours of operation they have to shut them off at 8 o'clock like we do with our construction [Music] i think those are things that we should be discussing as well and what what's their sign restrictions size how they have assigned and they put one out like we did in study hall we have two just so you know we have two different we have the permanent sides and where's the temperature so we've been talking i think mostly what we've been talking tonight is temporary signs but so you're only going to change this no there's in there so i haven't heard any discussion on that at all so i'm assuming that everything you've been talking about thus far only replies only applies to temporary sciences i think at least i've spoken about i don't know about other people but yeah i haven't heard the delineation but i think that that should be an assignment that says well i think we need to look forward obviously we're going to get digital signs put out throughout our city and and to lynn's point with the people leaving their open house signs and things like that up i agree that we should be able to take them in the ones most of the words i see that are left around the eastmans anyway and you're not supposed to be getting signs on the eastmans anyway so i don't i'm not a lawyer but i would assume that we have some protection they aren't having much money because for the most part thank you david so what uh anybody else in the citizens before i turn back here for this discussion so we have a couple questions about the commercial signs versus the individual signs and then with removal um you know obviously if it's abandoned we take it down that's an easy one the signs on the eastman we're all over the place with this it's not evenly enforced you've got a violating sign right on crossman park right now within one foot of the sidewalk so we should follow the same rules that we ask everybody else to do and we permit people to put signs in the right of way outside city hall which we're not it's i know it's county property but it's long so unless you want every open house every joe stucco and everybody else putting their signs there then either we need to step up the county enforcement the county sheriff can pull those signs but yet we kind of turn a blind eye i think sometimes if we like the message or we don't like the message they should all be confiscated i'll stick my law firm sign outside city hall i'd love to it's called split boulevard but that would be confiscated but yet political signs aren't confiscated they shouldn't be there and i can tell you the people who put them so that shouldn't be there at all and you know if we're going to do a you know the dog show that's wonderful we should advertise it but let's be consistent with where we advertising and that goes for everybody we need to follow the same rules we ask everybody else to abide by if not again you open yourself up okay i'm not gonna keep harping on it but open yourself up okay that's an equal protection issue if you don't enforce your laws if you hold it um as for the big signs for small signs and commercial there's not i know there's a set commercial section i haven't reviewed this in detail you know that i memorized it so like there are different sign requirements for commercial businesses versus regular and that is a differentiation i know we can make and the law is with us on that but maybe i'll defer to the expert fred and see what he has to say all right i'm looking at section 86-62 which is permanent signs and it makes a distinction between the residential medium rm district one and in the institutional land district um and both of them i i don't think i change this look forward to signs which inclusive of bases shall not exceed 120 square feet an area or three feet of thickness so they based on the way this is written they are not going to be required to do a two by three sign and i don't really know how i mean you you can decide and this this i always remember boca raton because if you'll remember the history of both raton boca raton was a city that basically to my knowledge was started in the either late 60s early 70s in between or north of fort lauderdale or near between fort lauderdale and miami i don't know which side it's on but boca raton was a new city and it was incorporated and they started fresh with a fresh slate and they decided as a matter of course they did not want it to be comparable to us 19 or what is now the road that runs through kissimmee is the same way but um you know you're not starting with a fresh slate and i i think it would be a mistake to have the idea you're going to go to some of these places that have a large sign and invest a lot of money you one way of dealing with that is to grandfather existing stuff in and from a certain day forward somebody has to meet the new standard that's one way of doing it but i again looking at these provisions i do not think i changed these at all and those that's what was on the original code provision we started with and if you all want to modify that somehow then we we probably need to discuss it further fred is best i remember we never were talking about the commercial signs to answer jeffy's question i remember bringing this up when we were talking about the sign outside um and i said well everyone can get digital and i think the city manager said they can right now if they wanted to so you know you can get a digital if you're if you're a motel owner they've chosen not to yes they can if they want as long as they stay within these other rules that we have here so we're not going to limit i i never intended that a motel owner be limited to a two foot by two foot sign that wasn't this was really prompted by citizen issues that we had particularly the banner guy and the uh some of the political signs that were going away early um and then you know this incident with mr alfandullos and his political signs and there was other signs i mean there was a gentleman i remember coming here he was told to take his stuff out and he was a pretty strong guy and he said you the city manager told me to take one out and i put two in so we were going to get into a problem okay to think otherwise is just really fantasy land okay that guy was challenging us and he even i remember he came here and he held up a black lives matter signing tell me to take this out and that was of course during the height of all protests i don't think anybody here would have said take that out so you know we yet it wouldn't be allowed by our then existing side ordinance right so um that was what prompted all this was to clean up this trap and like fred said you know are there people that will sit up all night to try and figure out a way to beat you at this yeah there's people who go around and make their living just finding cities that they can you know find a lawsuit on you can't defend against that but by putting through what we have here we've done a good job like i said closing off some of the exits here so well i'll add one more thing when's next afternoon i think robin too if i understand the tone of the discussion over the last year what concerns the city council most is what happens in your residential districts and the neighborhoods and if you have a and i'm just picking two by three for for purposes of example if every sign that's in the residential neighborhoods is two by three regardless of whether it's realtor sign political sign yard sale doesn't matter is all the same then the basis for somebody to file a federal lawsuit against you i think is absolutely minimized and that's that's likely where you're going to have the biggest exposure so you're being reasonable you're being uniform and i think that's probably the best you can do let me add one other thing we cut out the content-based restrictions absolutely that was another area that we had major vulnerability okay in one respect they you know they keep talking about the political person versus the contractor well if you go to a court i'm going to tell you something the political person is going to win out every time over the guy advertising his business you can't stop political free speech with all wars over that and you're not going to win so this cuts that out because in our city the way it stands right now the political person had the least amount of rights that's where we're talking about that actually in the next item too that can't be that cannot be glenn and rob yeah to debbie's point you know during my research with electronic science and stuff i mean he may have missed the mark on this thing because the people who are going to have the outrageous claims are going to be the commercial people because everybody had the money i mean that's tied to their advertising and stuff it's not necessarily the guy back on a media drive or something complaining because he restricted his political side it's going to be a commercial enterprise out there on boulevard say you're restricting how much revenue i could give you when i researched electronic signs many of the municipalities and large cities that i looked at all have commercial sections in their signage thing and it ties electronic signs primarily to the access roads in other words it's a high volume road that you're allowed to have an electronic sign on not necessarily back on the later drive where you have maybe 10 cars a day it's it goes to planning and zoning and planning and zoning you have a cut into stuff and that's those are the people who sit down and think about this kind of stuff i think maybe we need to think about that you know the best practices with strict things like brightness during the day brightness at night you know how long a duration you can maximize a screen change you can't have like screens things like that and we may have missed the mark on some of this stuff we at least need to address electronic signs in here period i think because that's that's grandfathering in that way you don't go back and say hey you don't need our standards or knock down your sign build a new one i see where you're going with the electronic sign but i mean i think the only entity that would put up the electronic sign would be the motel because i can't see any of the condoms doing it so i think it's just one entity and i mean i can see you know covering your butt right now and trying to put something in but pardon me means like is it going to be an issue should we wait until it becomes an issue should we do it before so i'm kind of iffy on that one but i do agree that we probably should have something in there to circumvent the problem before it starts listen um there is a provision in here for pre-existing signs any sign advertisement or attention attracting material or device in the residential media district um i think he was grandfathered right and this existence prior to the enacting of the ordinance shall be sent if they need if you want to replace it then you have to comply with the current order but we didn't change anything which they could probably obtain the grandfather even if they had to go before the planning board because that's something that's typically always given if not you wind up with the takings clause issue which i'm not going to get into preaching law but you can't make illegal stuff that's been legal for years so um not without allowing them to do it you know we could add stuff i just think that again this has been kicking around in committee forever you could always add to this um i do think we've opened up a pandora's box outside here i raised that issue with the citizens i said everybody's going to want one and you know well when they see artists maybe they will you know they didn't want to up until this point the motel didn't come and ask for if they could have they didn't but now they may that was one of the cautions that i urge this city not to go down that road because it doesn't belong in our city but yeah i mean you may have to put something in but can't accept ourselves and tell them they can't do it so then we're going to be back into this whole thing well why do you get to do it and we can because we're the government it's not but the point isn't an exemption the point is to bring it into alignment with the critical thinking that we've done in applying best practices and standards to how you employ or implement that so and i don't think looking back over our photos saying well i've warned you about this no i mean you're dealing with it now i mean maybe you need to insert a placeholder or something with some thought or to be developed at a later date or with a deadline on it not just kick the can down the road to be determined i mean to be inserted by a certain date well i mean this was one of the problems i've had in the past with bellar beach before i came to council was passing a law and say we'll fix it later i mean i almost fell off my chair when i heard a prior counsel do that and it wasn't this attorney it was a different attorney and i was like that's not the way he passed law so if the law stands fine the way it is then let's bring this out of committee if not it could sit in committee for another two months but we're i mean now if we're going to write a digital sign piece we cannot go to first reading for november so we have to bring it back for a work session and now we're looking at at best december january at best and that's if we could agree if we even have a november sometimes we don't even have a november work session but that's if we could agree in november and [Music] i'm just trying to move this thing out we've been discussing it for an hour and a half i'm trying to move it out of the committee up for a vote if we want to add more to it we can but it's not going to ever get done at this rate so i'm not saying passing complete law you're right you did bring up about digital signs apparently you can bring it up do it now so if now we want to start addressing it specifically then that will be a whole nother assignment for fred to start researching and what do you advise friends as far as digital well in the definition section it has digital or electronic signs defined you don't have specific parameters and that that relate to that so one of my questions would be which is a question i've asked you on other things how big of a problem is this right now and is it a problem if it's not a big problem now is it one that you feel is uh is imminent if it's if it's an imminent problem then fix it now we're the only ones with a digital sign i think right now right right again my thought process with all this really always revolves around what were you really trying to do and my understanding is what you were really trying to do is keep the clutter out of the neighborhoods and there are certain places along gulf boulevard where there are uh the businesses or the hotels whatever they are and they have existing signs so are is is that what you expect you're going to have a problem with yeah that wasn't what generated this what generated this was an almost imminent federal 1983 civil rights suit for removal of a political sign and a threat by a citizen of come on take my trump sign down my banner that stretched my house that's why we got into this we're talking past each other that i'm talking about the electronic science issue is that a uh on its own is that a problem right now and is it a problem that you think is going to be running rampant in the near future if it is let's you robin asks what should we do if you think that is a problem we need to address immediately then bring it back to the workshop a month from now i'll find a provision that addresses that and then you can hopefully go to the first reading in december we seem to be speaking out both sides of our mouth here like hey this was an issue at this point is it a rapid problem now well i'm looking down the road and you're concerned about constitutional infractions and cases and i'm saying the person who's going to get eat your lunch is the commercial guy whose revenue is dependent upon advertising i'm just looking down the road and kind of bringing us in alignment with uh you know the 2010 decade and say this this could be an issue and uh we're not changing anything on commercial this is pretty much i don't i don't think we ever had any discussion about changing the commercial we actually i think we said we could continue to enforce the commercial it was the citizens where the problem was coming up that that's what was driving me on this thing i had i've never had a complaint or heard of a complaint from any of our businesses saying my sign isn't big enough they've been here since the 1950s they're happy with their signs i mean but we're using terminology like we have a rampant raging problem here and all we can say is we can point to two specific issues that were resolved or within the last year it hasn't rarely done yet again and yet i think marius stoodley a resident is saying hey if you thought about this and it's like well no reality i'm saying that that's the person who's going to raise an issue with the commercial people not necessarily well again i think technically there's only one commercial entity that could put up a digital sign and that's the hotel because the condos i've never seen a condo with the digital side but they couldn't [Music] this is really a massive discussion that you bring up and it's fine if you want to have it but they can do it now they can put up the digi they don't stain with our existing ordinance they could put up that digital sign now so nobody would say they couldn't do it if the condo wants to say vacancies you know we read by the weed call such and such number flashing sign right now that is not prohibited if we want to be proactive and say again we get into this whole thing can we say no digital signs i don't think so we got a big one out sprout can we say no flashing signs yeah we're promising not to flash you you can't flash them you know but can we restrict the hours well we haven't even worked on that for headquarters yet but maybe you know and i agree with you let's get proactive and get ahead of the issue if you've got this much time invested in this thing and you've got a 25-page ordinance let's finish it let's do it right go through this it says what we put down the city hall has to go by that too because as far as i'm concerned right now that hotel can certainly put up a digital sign and as soon as that one popped up if i was that owner i'd be like time to start investing because we opened that window for them and there's nothing prohibiting them from doing that 10 years ago 15 years ago so i don't have the idea yeah we gave it an idea so to me i'm like well we set ourselves up for that so give the consequences um a sign advertisement or attention of training i can't hear you you're not talking to that money i'm sorry this is the bottom of page 22. assigned advertisement or attention attracting device or material shall not be placed or located on any property located in the city which is owned for residential medium district other than in strict compliance and conformity with the applicable provisions of this article so they can't they couldn't put up a new sign it was a digital sign if you consider that an attention gathering attention attracting device they couldn't put a new one up if it's already there they're cool it's grandfathered in and if they wanna if anyone wants to replace them or put a new one in you have to abide by the provisions of this argument so that is covered but you can be a digital song what you can put up a digital sign this doesn't prohibit that would that be an attention attracting device every sign is that's the purpose so i think this basically says you know what you got is fine if you want to change it you get to abide by what's in the code but to glenn's point and it's a valid one we have been focused i'll say we i have been focused in all my comments on residential because that's where we had the issues we haven't had a business owner come down here now he's bringing up the idea of hey you know what you may get some pushback from some in a business community saying i want a digital sign do we want to set some rules parameters and stuff and i'm with robin whatever we put we need to live by ourselves but if you want to have fred draft the digital sign portion of this it's another month i mean we went what a year without this so it'll just be another month um fred might want to kill us for making him draft more to this thing but it's not a big deal just come up with the parameters and i think what glenn said which is duration and hours of operation and all that kind of stuff and technically it could be as big as the one we have out there now it's not just the digital screen it's the whole monument so they can put that one there now too so like i'm always about fair if this person can do it then this person could do it if you don't want that then don't let that person do it i've always been black and white so i don't know if right now we can restrict anything because we always already opened the door so i don't know i'm up for if you guys want to put that in to try i'm never going to say no but i'm just saying i think we've already passed that point from their return or we can bring this in and then we can be adding the other stuff as an abandonment i mean you'll at least have a sign ordinance for again i don't want to do what our predecessors do which is past stuff that we know is bad this isn't bad but the stuff that's in that's going in here is good but if you want to put more attention into a digital then go ahead and do it you'll have a sign ordinance in place by december if it passes and then you can amend it as you see fit for digital and just two readings and you add that little beast to it so working on all the commercial side of things i i will need a better understanding of the zoning and how each location how it's held and and basically residential media is the west side of gulf wall of our residential lowest east side and going to glenn's point i agree with him that don't kick it down the road if we decide to pass this and then come back for an amendment for electronic which i'm not against um then i say we need to set a deadline let's have that for a first reading by such and such time maybe consider the holidays in that just so it's not cram session but i'm not against that what i'm against is stopping this whole thing delaying this month to do something that we kind of created a potential problem where we didn't have it a few months ago um but pass this as it is and then get to that hopefully in a reasonable amount of time because i'm certainly against kicking cans down the road this will allow us to at least address the neighborhoods the majority of us but yet i agree go back we go back and we can even put that in our resolution that we are to revisit it i mean we do have the holidays and sometimes we don't have work sessions during the holiday so if you don't want to come out on christmas holiday we can do that and talk about electronic signs but you know we may not get to this until january realistically and you know and actually kick it around in a work session so that's up to us we can hold a work session any time we want but you know some people have better things to do on the holidays well i will say for the purpose of the the discussion the commercial and electronic signs was not the focus over the course of the last year the focus again was on what happens in the neighborhoods having said that what i think you really need to bear in mind is you you have an election coming up and it would be helpful for anybody that wants to be a candidate in the election and anybody that wants to back a candidate to have clarity with some period of time prior to election season starting and to me election season really starts in i would say no later than february 1 probably before that so that i think it to me is really relevant and there there's no i have no problem with the adding the electronic sign part of it this this provision my gut feeling is without too much effort i can find another city that has addressed this they've already written in a tried and true uh provision and the the one the interesting thing about looking at this stuff a lot of the cities end up having almost the same provision from one city to the next related to a specific topic and i'm not going to say it's uniform throughout the state of florida it's not but it is often handled in a very similar manner this one i would expect you would find that's the way it works i may be surprised but i would and fully able to do it whichever way you all want just give me direction as to how you'd like to proceed all right who wants to move this out of committee the way it is now coming back to circle around for this electronic signs within short order i'm saying within this council's term that means it's concluded concluded and voted on before march so whatever it takes okay first second reading would be no later than couldn't be any later than february so that's our deadline if we'd have to have it before february i'd prefer we have it for january december if we can that's option number one or option number two is send credit back change this thing and then we'll have first reading in december maybe if we can meet on this i say we change it to 24x24 add the flashing activated definition remove that redundant word election and your extra line and then bring this for first reading when november yeah yeah i'm with you that's that's this it's time we both have this this takes care of all the residential stuff you're coming up on an election to your point election starts the minute that my qualifying means it's patty's desk unqualified candidate that's it my signs go in i'm not waiting with anybody at that point in time so if we have this in place it's in place and if you don't have rules well then it's like australian rules football then there are no rules okay we do whatever we're gonna do and i don't want that okay so you can have people with gigantic billboards and that's not our city so i could live with it two foot by two foot or whatever four foot square so that's two votes to move it forward leslie move it forward that's three it doesn't really matter dave yes glenn touch your lungs and get down with it no okay one time okay so we have enough to move it forward we're going to put it on the next thing this is not a binding vote free to vote on it when it comes in front of us let's move this forward with the changes i think robin summarized all the changes fred um i've not been writing them down i would suggest to you if that's the direction you're going to take then in the beginning before i see you again i will work with lynn to come up with a a provision that relates elect or that addresses the electronic signs for the businesses that's fine but just don't put it in that first reading yeah i was just telling you oh that's fine that's something that if we can get that to you before you next meet in two weeks then it makes it a lot easier to say well that part's on the way okay and we may look at that and say that's fine and if we just put the amendment in and we could theoretically be amending it as we're passing it which is crazy so i'm not suggesting that yeah i'm suggesting you do two standalone things right you still do the the one related electronic signs in in uh workshop be that in november december january and that will not affect your election cycle clan can you live with that no later than january so this council is going to come yesterday or nay it's going to come to a vote on the digital portion of it and we address it because i don't think it's fair to toss it to a different council next time we're all very familiar with this let us vote on it no i guess that's why i'm saying touch it once we're all in the mindset we're doing it but i mean we're going to move this this is going to move forward the way it is now i understand but you know we're going to move it forward you can say no and that's that's what you probably will say you know that's fine but if if you don't get it that way would you be okay with it going to what we're talking about as an alternative i don't want to ignore you brought a valid point i just want to get some residential standards here before i start putting up you know che guevara bass or something on their house okay are we done with one number two anybody need a break number two um discussion of ordinance 2108 amending section 2-63-d addressing city council this was tabled last time at fred riley's suggestion maybe i should just go directly to fred reilly because he wrote a memo that everybody um had in their packet here and uh you might have to go to you first on this one i've spoken with you i don't have to repeat what i told you you know everything in our discussion so you understood where i was coming from and i told you that there was a certain portion of that that you were free to convey so i'll turn it over to you okay um in in the memo that i sent out to the city council prior to the last meeting where i asked for y'all to continue this the primary focus that i had was on the the sentence that was deleted so for purposes of everybody in the room knowing what we're talking about i i will read directly from my memo it which said the following sentence was deleted by the amendment to section 2-63-d the city council may discuss prospective litigation provided that the city attorney has first advised the city council concerning admission against interests and other legal safeguards end quote okay that sentence was deleted the uh there was a minor modification to the prior paragraph and the prior paragraph incorporated the the shade meetings statute which is section 286.011 subsection 8 and so the net effect of all that is that y'all adopted on first reading an ordinance that made a change to 263-d which net equals you cannot discuss prospective or pending litigation except you can discuss pending litigation consistent with the shade meeting statute which is a 286.011 subsection 8. okay so the real question or the legal standard is what what scrutiny should be applied because it's a potential constitutional law issue this in my opinion would be strict scrutiny and strict scrutiny means that you are if you're going to regulate free speech then you choose the least restrictive means when you by by deleting that i i would not say you're choosing the least restrictive means i searched you know quite a few different ways six ways to sunday to try and find a case or try and find how another city was handling this in a better way and this happened to be one of these times for whatever reason i did not find a case that i thought was particularly relevant and i didn't find a another city handling this provision in a particularly relevant way that gave me something that that i could point to and say this is this is really the way to go the the reason for the me to ask for continuance is i had some hope and some optimism that you as a council could discuss it in in a non-voting type situation and see if there was some way that you could uh find a compromised language or position so that you you didn't end up with what what i felt we ended up with the last time this was really addressed the place where i thought we ended up with was you had um one council member who wanted me to to give some assurance that there's no basis for a federal lawsuit and you had another council member that was concerned that this would result in a federal lawsuit and those are two polar positions and i try as i might i would like to thread the needle but it is extremely difficult when you have two polar positions so that's the background i've spoken to several several of you i i don't have not spoken to everybody but you know my request is that the council again discuss this and see if there is some some way that you can uh find a combination that will work and that won't um you know touch off world war three having said all that a lot of cities don't have anything like this they don't have a prohibition on discussing pending their prospective litigation in a way bellar beach is somewhat unique because you do have a provision so that's where that's where we the the issue stands and i i'm here to do my level best to help you find a way to solve the issue so um i'm the person who brought all of this up because i've been directly affected by it twice okay so the council member who brought this up and said she wanted to prevent a lawsuit that's only by my grace i've already i've already been wronged so this isn't about me being wronged i'm going to do it mr athan doulas let's use this as a learning moment and a teaching moment and move this thing forward the right way as a city okay nobody on this council passed this bad law it's unconstitutional it's unconstitutional with the changes you agree with me and i'm glad you did i read the strict scrutiny rule into the record last time verbatim and asked patty to put it in it is strict scrutiny what that means is it has to pass the highest level of scrutiny that the court can give it it has to be something that is absolutely necessary and in its least restrictive means it's not absolutely necessary we heard from glenn gunn we have insurance okay and it has to be least restrictive means well if it's so important that why do we allow people to come up here from the citizenry and speak about it but yet we can't rebut them as political elected officials now i'm gonna fight for every single elected official's rights whether i like you or i hate you i'm not gonna have this city squelch anyone and particularly me okay so in terms of a federal suit you already could be in a federal suit whether you change this or not but this law was passed in 1999 and i looked up i went to the newspaper i looked up some of the people who were on our council i never heard of half of these people william attenberry stewart scott charlie parker burke cutler david fishkeller john williams and charles chuck and elizabeth parker or something i don't know any of those people except for chuck so we don't know anybody anything it was bad law maybe it was good law at the time maybe supreme court cases came out afterwards maybe they were getting bad legal advice i don't know i don't care it's bad law now so here's the way you fix it the reason why you can't i'll submit to you why you can't find other cities that have this is because they're smarter than us because it's unconstitutional the way we have it that's why other cities don't have it legislature legislature has given us the provision for speaking about current lawsuits in the shade we don't have to share our strategy or our settlement negotiations with the public that's called a shade meeting and we don't even have to put it in our ordinance because quite frankly the legislature has already given us that right okay it's florida section 286.011.8 it's already there we don't need to say where we have a problem is this is what's known as a limited public reform you can come here but like dave was talking earlier you can't make noise there's certain things you can't do okay some places allow you to make a sign we don't want to make a sign in our place so we have certain rules that you have to abide by we have to abide by the rules you have to abide by you can't get up here and start screaming from your seats like it's a wrestling match you don't allow that you have to come up here and speak after you're recognized but what we do now and where i have a major problem with this as we allow citizens and this happened to folks this happened okay jules chandler came up here and just ripped into me i was on the road glenn gunn was temporarily chairing the meeting i made five points of order she couldn't complete a sentence without insulting me and i wanted to rebut it and i couldn't rebut it because we're not allowed to discuss lawsuits so he followed the policy and said i'm not allowed to let you speak on it more recently we have a legal situation i wanted to bring a motion related to that which was for the city's protection and i was told you better not do it i don't hold it against the city attorney who told me i shouldn't do it he just advised me as to what the ramifications could possibly be probably there shouldn't be any ramifications i'm an elected official i have the right to bring a motion now the fact that somebody may say something that's a declaration against interest doesn't seem to bother us this is not a personal attack when the city manager makes a declaration against interest in the newspaper because that's what you have a declaration against interest on a pending lawsuit yet there's no prohibition against him speaking that way what have we just been talking about with science do it for one do it for all if i can't talk about it and i'm an elected official that no citizen should be able to come up here and talk about it in this forum and the city manager shouldn't be able to go out and do a newspaper interview about it you make declaration against interest i'll submit to you i think any attorney will get rid of this completely if you do want to permit citizens to come up and i hate to limit any citizen's right to come up i think the citizens should come up and say you know what we're sick and tired of these lawsuits we're sick and tired of this whatever we're sick and tired of let them come up but then the person on the council should have the right to rebut it with the warning always from the city attorney like okay i know you're mad watch what you say because you could really hang the city here but if your justification for this rule that's all i heard was declaration against interest which is a financial consideration and glenn gunn said tonight and two council meetings ago we got insurance for that it didn't cost us anything for the slip and fall we don't care if our legacy is even saying we don't care but florida city is going to pay for this tell me about why it's a financial concern of course and if financial concern you think is going to make strict scrutiny i will maintain to you it will not you will lose if this gets challenged and it will get challenged whether it be from an elected mayor who's squelched twice or the next public official you don't lose your rights by getting elected here we play by the same rules that the citizens play by and if they can come up and talk about a lawsuit then we should be able to rebut them rebut some of the nonsense that they heard some of the incorrect assumptions that they've heard about that about lawsuits and be able to give them the information again i have no problem with city attorneys saying watch what you say but if somebody says the wrong thing oh well that happens we can always say the wrong thing we're privy to a lot of information so i don't think this is going to hold water i think the other cities wisely don't have it and either you cut it out for everybody or you allow it for everybody and the warning goes out when the city council is going to speak from the city attorney and it's very easily fixed by simply taking i don't care whether we leave the pending litigation florida statute and that's just repetitive to the state statutes but what we have to do to fix this to say the sentence that we took out the city council may discuss what we should add is current and perspective litigation providing that the city attorney has first devised the city council concerning admissions against interest and other legal safeguards period if you want to say something that's it if we're going to discuss strategy city man the city attorney should shut us down then i will shut you down or the mayor should shut you down and say wait a minute we don't want to disclose legal strategy just like when we start talking about security wait a minute this is shade meeting we don't talk about this that's my pro my proposal you change let's say we discuss current and prospective litigation then you have a concept i think you have a constitutional thing which allows everybody to come in and speak about perspective and current litigation leaving us the option of shade if we need it that's it all right here's my concern i do agree with you i understand where you're coming from however there's a level of trust that that we must have with everyone on this council and i'll give you a good example you wanted to bring up pending litigation and use it in a certain way sort of weaponize it and it's not correct well well that's that's what it looked like to me and um and it was stopped uh only because of only because of uh this particular section but under normal circumstances i would not expect that to happen instead i would expect uh refrain and uh the council's best interest at heart so i i hear you and i understand what you're what you're what you're doing but um it's this level of paranoia that's been created because of our history together it's been bad it's been very bad and whenever we started reviewing this absolutely not i didn't want to change it and for a good reason and i think that the people that did vote on it felt the same way in fact i think the people that didn't vote on it felt the same way or they were at least teetering on the edge of whether they wanted to uh to push this through or not so [Music] i know where you're going with this i i don't see me winning this for good reason i understand but you must understand what my reason for uh for wanting to change what was what was proposed it was fully justified and i was looking out for the best interest of this city and the council and i see where this is going if it if it's not dropped all i can do is raise the white flag and ask you to cease fire and let's move forward and fix it okay i'm not firing at anyone let's understand something i hear you what you said i understand remember one of the things we talked about with robertson's board is you don't go into what a person's motives are so you know we just had dave kind of saying what he thought my motives were which weren't my motives for the same reason why we actually had this was that so no declarations of interest could be made against the city a council member i'm not going to get in particular with names said we value first amendment rights this is post lawsuit you do you think you're going to get a question on that my guess is you will that's what i was trying to afford saying you know what anything you say can and will be used against you by people this is not my lawsuit folks there's people listening to every tape and they're going to pee through every little thing and they're going to say oh you said you got any first amendment rights well such and such happened and did you value first amendment rights that was what my idea was short circuit any more damage stopped the bleeding stop to damage that's what this was all about um but you know what to your point let's just let's take for a second argue for arguments say let's say i did have a really bad motive i want to get rid of all the people on council you know all new people three new people you guys can vote that down it should come up for discussion and you can knock it down you can't stop of all people an elected official from speaking his mind in his form or her mind in her form you're you just can't not for this issue because this issue personally affects you forget about this issue any issue maybe i have the worst intentions or the next person has the worst intentions in the world okay expose it you can't talk about their intentions but expose why it's a bad bill exposed by it's a bad proposal it has to get a motion it has to get second it has to get four out of seven votes if it's no good it probably won't pass this may have not passed my sense that it might not have passed but it may have i wanted to speak why and if people were convinced then they would go forward with it it was non-binding so it wouldn't matter in any way we can't force anybody to step aside so that was the whole point behind it now this isn't a bargain this isn't change this or else it's you have to trust me as i said this is a mr assandulos okay and you know how mr afternoon worked out i thought he had a clear path if he wanted to proceed um i don't want to teach lessons the hard way okay but i will fight like hell for rights and if you don't know that about me by now go look up at the pending lawsuit in better shore okay i'm not going to let anybody try and build elected officials rights be yours be agreed be it mine i just won't let that happen and i will let it happen if i'm not elected official when we lose that lose our democracy i'm not gonna have some city tell me what i can talk about when they left the city and i'm not picking on lin he was pulling within his rights have given that interview it should have never been done should have never been said if i can't say that here why is he allowed to say it on the outside he represents the city you don't think that's the declaration against interest what he said that the city was justified in doing what it did i think it is go ahead you know i'm i'm with dave with you on this like i want everybody to have equal say the ability to say what you're allowed to and i agree like they shouldn't be able to come up here and say their opinion and we can't say it back that's not fair but then i understand the whole trust thing because sometimes when people you know when you get heated we're all kind of on edge like oh what's going to come out in a bit of passion or rage or so i think it goes back to trust that we're going to have to trust you to listen to the city attorney's caution and to listen to your internal caution because i'm italian i get it once i get heated i go but you have to learn to and you know when it comes to you individually if you say something that's going to affect you you put yourself in hot water well that's on you that's just you'll have to deal with that but when you put something you may say put the city in hot water not all of us have to deal with it and that i'm not okay with so i get those points like i would never want you me the mayor the next mayor anybody to be restricted in what you're allowed to say but i think it goes back to that meaning where we had that we're just gonna have to just trust each other to get along and maybe in those instances like i have in the past where i've interjected like all right you've done two like let's take a moment let's calm it down and give you and give all of us a second to like reel it in take a moment to think and then proceed so you may get a few of those interjected that anybody who gets too compassionate myself included so that's my thing i understand both sides of this but i would go in the more of the side of caution and not restrict anybody's rights with that being said with an immense amount of trust that nobody's going to overstep that bound including myself the the very first topic you all discussed today which they brought up i i could have made this same comment there and i almost did and you know it's not ironic but i i will say it because it's applicable in both things when citizens come forth and make comments you you don't know what they're even going to talk about i mean i have to be tell you honestly um frequently i sit there for two-thirds of their presentation and i i don't know what they're talking about they don't they don't present it in a way that i immediately understand i'm here to talk about topic a and my opposition to topic a they don't do that none of them do they don't do it anywhere they talk and they're passionate about things and the reason i'm explaining it this way is that what you all do as a group as you sit there patiently and give the citizen the courtesy of explaining why they're they're talking to their elected officials and for the most part you give them the the ample room that they need to explain what's on their mind okay at times there has been a desire to quickly cut some money off if it's perceived as a an attack on someone when it's directed at me i may not like it i'll tell you that quite honestly i probably don't like it i probably like to say lots of things but i don't i simply listen to the comment and take it in as much stride as i can um but y'all extend that courtesy to citizens because you're trying to understand why they're there talking to their elected officials okay having said that in this discussion in in my opinion y'all bring in other things and you often use examples and the examples to me always seem to complicate things further because you're you're now using a specific example it may be very enlightening but you when you bring in the other examples you're not focusing on the core thing so that's just an observation i've seen that the whole time during my tenure here in miller beach the the issue of trust i find that extremely interesting that was brought up by several of you and you've discussed that because that in some ways is what it really comes down to is trust and there are times the the better action as an elected official or a city manager or a city attorney is to sit here and say nothing or to thank them for their comments and move on there's plenty of times i again if it was something that had to do with with me or my scope i could give the person an absolute broadside but that's not the time to do it and you know just because it says you may do this to me doesn't mean that that was the best time to do it so i you know i i told you before um in the other city i worked with there's no prohibition related to prospective litigation and as a matter of course when something comes up that i think they are vulnerable with about that is really related to the elected officials i go talk to all of them about it and say this is what as your lawyer i'm here to talk to you about a area that i think is potentially problematic from a legal standpoint and here's why and i have in that city five different conversations i say that the same thing five times i don't share the comments from the five individuals they're compartmentalized comment uh discussions and that's it but then the elected officials know about the issue and there's never a need to discuss it in a public forum so you know i i have great misgivings about discussing some things in a public forum because you you simply undermine your own strategy if you do it and that i'm using strategy instead of admissions against interest that's another concern of mine but you know if there's a um something that's a strategic type decision that is is not the the public forum is really not the place for most of those type of decisions or some of those i won't say most some of them but i i just want to point out regardless of how you do it just because you want to allow somebody to do it doesn't mean you as the elected officials should do it there's plenty of times the better course of action is to not have a discussion of a forum so circle it all the way back to you you know this is it at hand i i did think it would be beneficial and y'all are having a a very uh good discussion about it so i'm still hopeful and i know several of y'all have not commented so i'll leave it you know i agree with you that just because you can say it doesn't mean you have to say but that's an individual decision you always have that that's our prerogative here you hear stuff you can let it fly you can comment you could just do whatever you want to do um we have to trust the elected officials that they're going to do what's best for the city you know we just heard dave say he thought he was doing best for the city and on the same issue i said i think i'm doing best for the city who's right and wrong maybe neither of us maybe we both think we're doing best for the city okay but i'm going to draw the line when you say and i want and by the way i'm not advocating that the citizens not be allowed to speak the citizens should be allowed to speak this is their opportunity to come forward and let us know they like or dislike what's happening litigation perspective litigation what what are you guys thinking how come you didn't control such and such that's that's they should be allowed to do that but to say we can't talk about in the same form we've got a mismatch over here and the reason why we can't do it is because declarations against interest when we're hearing well we've got an insurance policy to cover all that well there is your financial argument so what's the other reason you're not going to let your elected officials speak this isn't north korea this is bella beach and you just can't do that okay so my proposal really this is very simple this already passed first reading as amended and it wasn't a significant amendment um to the point that we needed to reread it so it's past first amendment first first reading we're on second reading it goes as it was as amended we have to decide in council here we're going to do that or i'm throwing at you the option of saying you go back to first reading okay and what i think is constitutional hey don't listen to me listen to your city attorney okay the city council may just this is this is the ordinance okay it's real simple 2-63-d now becomes the city council may discuss current and prospective litigation provided that the city attorney has first advised the city council concerning admissions against interest and other legal safeguards period you don't even have to talk about the state law that allows sunshine discussions but you certainly can do that if you want obviously nobody should just be discussing legal strategy and settlement negotiations that's what the whole shade uh provision is for that state statute that should never be discussed in public and there's this we don't have to pass anything we've already been granted that right but this takes care of prospective litigation so if somebody slips and falls and says i'm gonna sue you we say hey wait a minute lynn come on we're only asking for a thousand dollars let's just take care of that one or turn that one over to the insurance company you know and we could have a discussion about how to avoid something or do you have we fixed such such a condition again subject to your maybe we don't want to disclose any of that stuff subject to the city attorney saying you know maybe you don't want to talk about fixing the condition even though that's not evident true so you know it gets complicated we listen to our city attorney we stay out of trouble but it doesn't it gives us the option to speak and if somebody up here wants to get here and just bury the city that's their prerogative too the election comes up you kiss him goodbye that's my proposal if you're happy with it the way it is bring it up i mean we don't even have to do anything tonight we just this is the alternative proposal but if we're there's no point in doing an advertisement and a second reading if people hear what i had to say and what fred had to say tonight if you want to go forward with the one as amended last time we're on second reading and it'll come up in november and it may pass or it may fail we'll bring the same discussion up on that one before we take a vote thank you but no i my belief as we should move forward with the second meeting as we commended it the first time i see no upside to this for the city or for the residents i spoke with the florida league of city's attorney who's representing the city in these other lawsuits and his warning was very specific that most attorneys including municipal attorneys don't quite understand the complexities of admissions against interest and at the end of the day the only people who decide missions against interest is a judge and a jury and his bottom line was don't do this there's no upside to it so especially given the existing context like i think davis indiana i i believe this is not in our best interest and my uh my goals was to move forward with the second reading as we admitted it the first time my my concern is you know from what fred said no other city that he found has this so why are we i mean i don't think we're the pioneers of you know city litigation and provisions and stuff and we're so my question is sometimes too much overkill and you get us into more trouble than less you know what i'm saying so i mean to me i'd like to go with what fred thinks that fred thinks that we're doing what's constitutionally free speech whatever right by going to the second reading then let's go but if he's telling me no other city has this provision so pardon me it's like why are we getting in trouble i did some looking around at other cities codes and they were very smart about how they did it they did not put it in writing any rules all they state is the council may set any rules they see fit in that way other than the normal code if they say if they agree as a body we're not going to do this well then they pass it and it's it's not it's not in writing anywhere and they they all agree they disagree or not they agree and then that's now the rules they follow i don't i don't see us doing that but that's what i'm finding in other cities code if there's anything you did on the fly if an issue comes before and they decide whether it's going to be spoken about i have no idea because i don't understand how they do that and wind up with any kind of semblance of consistency and stay within the constitution i think they all agree to it then that kind of is written even even if it's just public record on the file so i mean it kind of it's always written that's that's one thing bad about public service it's always written down at some point what we've seen in this code of ordinance is that there's been multiple multiple sections have been violated repeatedly i don't have a good answer for this i'm just trying to find a middle ground compromise where we don't violate anybody's rights but we also don't get ourselves in a hot order so i don't know what that is but i'm always about to compromise so frank what would you suggest is the conqueror and i'm so sorry to put you and make you help me decide but what is a good compromise where we're not infringing on anybody's right to speak but we're also not going to put the city at harm or or is there one that's not very [Music] as i said earlier you your two polar positions and how you find a middle ground with two polar positions is extremely difficult so i will tell you i don't know that i have a magic bullet that does that i um i really don't think i do one i'll give you one idea delete the whole section and if you delete the whole section then you don't have a prohibition and if somebody steps to the [Music] citizen steps up and starts talking about litigation and the council members engage in a discussion about it that may be lead to problematic results but it won't lead to a constitutional law issue and the the thing if you deleted this provision this provision was deleted right now and the next time you met somebody came in and started talking about this uh prospective litigation thing i would dutifully raise my hand and suggest that the council needs to tread carefully and would be best served in all likelihood in not discussing this in a public forum the the problem with that i hate to say it [Music] i've said stuff like that before and y'all uh discuss it anyway and the temptation is there and it's something that you feel strongly about and you all want to talk about it i understand that but i again say sometimes you have to temper things believe me there have been many things i i really wanted to give you my thoughts on but i don't because it's not the best place to do it so the the if you want a middle ground delete subsection d and don't have any provision and that way there's no prohibition and you you would take things on a ad hoc basis as they occur i mean the thing i would say to any city council is be mindful of what you're doing and the potential for doing or saying things that may put you in a worse position and that that to me sound legal advice whether it be heated i have no idea this is all directed at mayor joe this is 100 directed at him and it's fine because that's currently where it is but my fear is what happens in three months it's directed at glenn and now glenn would be the one affected by this or me what happens if my rights would be affected by this so we can't just think okay how are we going to control one person we need to think how this control can be used on you in the future me anybody and so we have to stop making i'm just thinking of this when he was talking about we need to stop making this personal we need to make this general and we need to make this because this would stand maybe for the next 10 years so this is going to affect the council way after we're done you know being on so my thing is do i agree that the mayor gets heated and sometimes i feel like sometimes he's going to step over the lines absolutely do i feel like sometimes glenn has said that or myself or any of us not leslie she hasn't been around this council long enough to get there but you may um but so my thing is not i'm trying not to think personal i'm trying to think big and i would not want your rights glenn dave joe blessing me to ever be affected so i'm going to try to go on the goal meet in the middle you just have to trust us you have to and trust me it is hard it's hard trusting some of these people in here but i'm taking that step forward and trust and i expect all of you to do it as well with that being said he's going to throw up you know the car the yellow card and say be warned and at some point one of us is going to have to step in and be like all right you're about to get a regard you need to stop before it gets really out of hand so we maybe need to police each other more or decide just let's not get into that slippery slope and just not engage at all but so the suggestion to take this thing entirely off the table that's that's absurd to me you're talking about the wild wild west and absolutely no restrictions whatsoever by your own admission you just said i give a warning and then you guys talk about it anyway so that's precisely what we're trying to say here is take it completely off the table you don't talk about it i mean you don't talk about pending litigation you take prospective litigation off the table you take it entirely off the table billboard and just like by your own commission you talk about it anyway no let's not go there i agree i think we need to do it for the citizens they can't go there either taking it off it has to be eliminating this eliminating this makes it like any other topic people are free to speak about it again i began this by saying i'm going to use this as a mr atlanta very much okay he kind of nailed the city to the wall and he didn't he exercised the supreme restraint quote one of my favorite movies i'm trying right now i'm trying here i'm trying to exercise with spring you see it's unconstitutional robin just told you what it's all about no i don't think people in 1999 knew i was going to be the mayor but i've been wrong about this twice how many more we wanted to get you over the head with it your city attorney agrees with me it won't withstand strict scrutiny you don't care when your city manager goes out and speaks in the newspaper makes declarations against this city's interest there's no policy that he can't speak on pending litigation or any of our employees which by the way that would be a constitutional law that would be constitutional you can restrict what your employees said but you can't restrict what your elected officials say and robin's right i might be here for three more months i might be here for three more years but there's gonna be somebody else in this chair and it could be any one of you and it's not just the mayor that's respond that's affected by this it's every council member you're an elected official how dare the city of bellar beach attempt to limit its free speech of its elected officials if claim gun thinks that's okay with all due respect my guess is you will be on the losing side of that argument if it's taken before a federal court if you want to be on the losing side of that argument as i said to fred riley let's try it then because i'll fight this battle if i have to not for myself i'll give every damn penny i make to charity but i'll fight this because you will not trample elected officials rights the reason other cities don't have this is because it's wrong wake up eller beach wake up while you still can i'm counting on this council not to reaffirm this piece of garbage that was made in 1999 by a council that probably had bad information now we've got good information constitutionally valid information i'm counting on this council to rise up and say nobody just gave me a solution just get rid of them citizens can come here and speak about it we have the option of speaking back within the rules we're not supposed to have a dialogue but when we get to the end of the night we can speak back if we want and correct any wrongs that they sent if we wish to sitting then the city attorney can give us a warning say hey watch what you say don't go too far i could hold a press conference tomorrow and bury the city on pending litigation so can any one of you somebody already did it so guess what you don't have restrictions you can't restrict i don't lose my rights by coming here neither do you citizen can come up here and speak about it and so can we and i'm telling you if you have any other arrangement you sell that one for money and you just told me that well partly the cities is going to pay for it by the way you've got litigation council did litigation council counsel each person every time there's a lawsuit because that's standard practice and say you know what don't talk to anybody about this lawsuit don't do a newspaper interview if they ask you the proper comment is no comment or like somebody said i want justice done can't go wrong with that that's what you want to say okay do what you want to do i do want to move this forward it's 8 30 so i guess at this point we can have any final comments but then we kind of need to know we're going to bring this forward for a second vote as is do we wish for fred to amend it at all or do we wish to pull it out entirely and just table it forever this isn't a binding vote so we can do whatever we want to do but we need a consensus on what we're going to do that's why this was table to begin with it can die a table death forever so you know it's up to us i'll hear from each person everybody knows where i stand i don't care whether we kill it for good or change it the way i suggested either one has the same effect they say change it or kill it just to protect all of us into the future it has nothing trust me like dave i told you i i'm with you i have the same trust i have the same fear my anxiety gets riled up the same way and i'm not thinking about one person i'm not even thinking about this counsel i'm thinking about the future decisions you make today affect the future and i'm i'm just looking at it leslie in the comments dave and glenn and that were if you want to talk you don't have to i'll make one more comment dave has just soon stationed and that's what i heard is that change this or else and i i mean the writing is on the wall i as much as i want to i want what's best for the city i i don't see i don't see a good win either way i see one way we're jeopardized we're we're in danger for saying the wrong thing at any any given time this council loves to say let's have a back and forth conversation with every topic that comes up puts us in jeopardy and on the other hand do it or else which is pretty much what i'm hearing or else something bad will happen in court that's not a good solution either i'm hurting for the city right now i'm hurting for what we're what we're facing for something that's been in place for 20 years and never been challenged until now i'm i'm heartbroken i don't see a way to win this argument i see no way out of this except for to concede your next one when he finishes one possibility dave is to take this completely off the table in other words we kill it and it's already off the table so it's just a matter of number that's what i'm saying and it's not our house we haven't amended it we haven't changed it let the existing ordinance stand and if there's a challenge or concern about it it's with those six people that you made off of that basis it's with the city it has nothing to do with those six people nobody has individual liability for a bill that they pass but i guess the point is and the elephant in the room is people being named in federal wall seats okay that's the other walk around the room here and that's the concern i think that we're stirring those issues here it's clouding our judgment in so many issues coming before this council that we can't even have intelligent conversations because things get turned around or there's a lecture involved or available thread of some sort so what i'm saying is kill it let the existing ordinance stand and it can be dealt with when you have that it's fine that's your prerogative let me clarify what i said because apparently it wasn't clear enough but i thought it was crystal clear the damage has already been done you cannot put the genie back in the bottle the question is where do we go i said it again and now i said it before i'll say it again mr ethan dulos used his particular situation the damage was done then the city manager pulled a sign the damage was done and he used it as a learning moment for the city i think we have learned we came up with a 30-page um [Music] sign ordinance in response to it and we suspended it so the question is are we going to learn anything as a city are we going to go forward saying gee what a bunch of people did in 1999 let's just keep going with that if that's where you want to go with it go with it i'm not saying what i'm going to do i'm not saying what the next person is going to do you should be jumping up and down screaming your lungs out that somebody wants to stop an elected official's free speech that's purely what this is we don't like what you're saying it might cost our city some money we'll stop your speech but city manager go ahead say whatever you want to the press we have no rules or regulations on you but what you said is really responsible no it's not it's worse than anything we've ever said here on this desk there's no regulations whatsoever so in one hand you talk about talking out of both sides of your mouth on one hand we say well we're concerned about the city's potential liability in the meantime we let our employees go out and say whatever the hell they want that's not called a point of order just because you're directing that energy towards the city manager has nominated the newspaper nothing to do with what we're discussing has everything to do with it there was a declaration against interest on this very topic okay i'd like to point the border i'd like to make a comment wait a minute if you're calling first off he's made a point to blur well glenn was just talking to him and it was i couldn't hear what he was saying okay this is not an essential rule in his point of order there's nothing wrong with me saying the city manager said something in the newspaper it's right here if you'd like to read it i'll read it into the record he said in my legal opinions it's a direct violation of everything we're trying to stop here which is a direct declaration again declaration against this city's interest he spoke about an active lawsuit and he gave his legal opinion he's not an attorney and he doesn't does represent the city but he doesn't represent represent the city legally and he said that something was permissible his backs are gone and his law is wrong that's what i base my thing on okay i'm not here to pick on lynn i'm just saying you you're permitting you're saying well you're a it seems like the only people who can't talk about a lawsuit are the elected officials our city clerk if she wanted to talk about it hell the dpw people could call the press conference and talk about it the citizens surely can do it but the mayor hello no he knows a little bit about law we don't want him saying anything well it's not going to be the mayor next time it's going to be your council member or your vice mayor or whomever i'm telling you it's unconstitutional you want to sit here and say we're going to continue to go with it go with it go with it it's not a threat the damage has been done even if you fix it the damage has been done the question is where do we go from here do we learn from our mistakes as a city we didn't make this mistake but now you know now you know it's wrong you heard it from your city attorney he told you it doesn't withstand strict scrutiny go back and listen to the last council session before he ever came to that conclusion i read you the rule patty put it in verbatim i asked her to put it in verbatim what the rule of strict scrutiny was i knew what it was because i had done some research on it and again nobody challenged it in 20 years who was our attorney for 20 years and upset okay this guy is giving it to you correctly you want to listen to him listen to him he said sometimes he gives us stuff we don't listen and we get ourselves in control i'm trying to stop you from stopping political free speech in the city you can't do it ever that's exactly what this does citizens come and talk about the lawsuit city manager go and talk about the lawsuit elected officials no better not say anything we can shut you down no you can't no you can't and no one will shut me down as an elected official no one can be your friend yes sir yes ma'am the first thing i'll say is i i've made it clear to y'all before i'm not the referee so in order for y'all to have a discussion about things you need to have a discussion and don't count on me to step in and separate people if that's what you want stop the meeting on this topic and talk about that and tell me that's what you want to do because i will be residing tonight if that's what we're doing because i'm not given that that's not my role having said that one of the things that is is completely troubling about this whole situation with me is i look at standing and you don't have a prohibition against a citizen talking about an issue okay so it's because there's no prohibition the citizen can talk about it their rights are not uh infringed in any way shape or form they have the ability to speak freely about something okay if there is a lawsuit coming out of the current provision or a future provision the people with standing are the city council members that's who has the ability to initiate a lawsuit a citizen does not have the ability to initiate the lawsuit to vindicate your rights that's up to one of you all having said that i i have never been in a situation working on a team with people where the most concerning people i'm working with are the people on my side of the table just saying as honestly as i can tell you and in this situation that's what i have thought through i can't tell you how many hours i've spent thinking about how to find a solution to this problem and i'm normally a lawyer in my position advising the seven of you is shouldn't have to be that concerned about one of the seven being the plaintiff in a federal lawsuit just telling you the counter that and this is now me i i will say what will seem to some people to be an inconsistent statement it's not but you'll have political free speech rights as well and no no should not be infringed so you're trying to find a way to ensure that people's political free speech rights are uh allowed and they have the right to express their thoughts and on the other hand you're trying to work with people and the the biggest conflict or the biggest problem i've had in my tenure here is there is extremely deep conflict among the seven elected officials and i have been unable to bridge the gap on that try as i might try as you all discussed it numerous times i i hope there's a solution to this it i'll go back to rob and ask me the question what what is the middle ground suggestion it's delete subsection d and then in the future everybody rely on their better angels and not take the bait when something comes forward and use discretion and use it wisely and that that's to me the best thing that i can suggest to you because that that is really the only middle ground solution i can come up with i think it's the smartest thing to do personal feelings aside just law first amendment rights if you're not going to make them not come up and talk about the lawsuit then you can't make us not talk about the lawsuit because if you're infringing on their rights if you tell them no you're infringing on my right you tell me no i'm not in any lawsuit i certainly can talk about it and i can probably get into hot water for the city too i'm not going to because i'm going to show a street okay this is a personal thing i feel like so many issues we bring up on this council is personal it's not city business it's personal business i don't like this guy i don't like this girl so i'm going to attack him with this unless maybe organized to make his life for her like miserable get the stupid personal feelings out of this politics i think that's wrong with the whole country in politics it's personal it's not personal it's business okay i don't have to be friends with any of you i wouldn't mind being friends with any of you i like all of you but my whole point is dave you and i butt heads on something i still you think you're a great person and after we're not elected officials i'm hoping to hang out same with you let's see all of you bleh all of you i have no lasting personal grievances i've argued with all of you and it's been actually fun to hear your personal your personal views versus mine and come to the middle so i'm saying i'm going with fred elvis i do not think he needs to be the referee i've never seen him more stripes once don't ever wear stripes because we'll make you referee um so he he should have to be our babysitter and right now i feel like we are expecting him to go put us in the corner and timeout and that's ridiculous so what's going to end up happening and it's going to be all our faults is he's going to finally decide to leave us which i would blame him in a bit and then we are going to be so screwed compared to this so i think that we should just  up be men be women pull up our big girl big boy panties and just get the personal out of this and just do what's right constitutionally for us currently and for the next councils going forward so i'm going with fred and his legal advice which has always been good and saying get rid of this it gets rid of the problem that's three people want to get rid of it the other two folks here dave and glenn any comments i mean glennardo said he didn't want to get rid of leave it intact right that was your comment unless it changed i think the fallback position is you stay with the existing parties so you're saying keep it as is and dave i i'm going to have to uh disagree i don't see any good way out of this i feel like that we are going to be we are going to be having to defend this decision and i i have no choice but to feel that way i feel threatened by individuals in this room and um i feel like that i am being forced into doing something that that i know is probably not in the best interest for at least this sitting council and once forcing you to anything you should vote your conscience whether you pass this change it repeal it leave the existing one intact doesn't change a thing it's just a question of has the city learned anything from this episode the episode has happened already now the question is what's going to happen going forward are you going to say yeah it happened go ahead sue me that's what i'm hearing from one person here or other people are saying get rid of this thing no other cities have it for a good reason they know it's unconstitutional it's not like we're some great you know visionary we're not this was bad law when it started it wasn't our law and so no one's forcing you otherwise this we've got three people who want to kill it um let's promotion uh to um to repeal this on the next agenda and if somebody wants to can we can we have no you can't do it that way no no it's scheduled for second reading it was continued until right now it doesn't have to be brought back forever but you'll need to address that at the next city council meeting okay so that motion can come up to kill it basically we'll have this discussion all over in general it's on the agenda for the next city council meeting and all seven people are here then you should decide what to do next okay unfortunately we don't come up with really a binding consensus because we can't so you can't anyway okay but we don't really need 10 years but that's i mean you you've done what i asked so i i can tell you i'm extremely appreciative because there's a good discussion it was a discussion that needed to be added fair enough anybody uh we didn't ask the citizens there's two people left anybody nothing okay so what will be the agenda agenda will be goes to second reading and then there is at this point there's three people who feel that this should be um repealed and the emotion would be to uh counter motion to repeal it but now we get into an issue of reading so all we can do is kill it we can't we can't do a repeal no it wouldn't go forward we'll just not be passing the amendments that's correct to the old one well they're sticking with the old one that's different than your field we haven't passed this thing yet right but but what we're saying is the one that we some of us are saying the one that we currently have is a big problem so fred's proposal was get rid of it so we can't if somebody made a alternative motion saying by motion to get rid of this thing i don't think at that point we have done a proper advertisement for eliminating pain no if you go to second reading and it does not pass on second reading the amend the ordinance which contains the amendment simply fails at that point if the there was a desire on the city council's part to do a to delete subsection d then we would do create a new ordinance and the new ordinance i would recommend to you would go through a workshop because it's a better place to have the initial discussion and then if it got out of the workshop then it would go to two meetings before the city council that's how you make amendments to the ordinance or to the code you have to have two readings so this discussion in that route would be absolutely clean we didn't accomplish anything that tonight [Music] otherwise you know i mean you've been at it for probably an hour plus and i mean again i i had hoped there would be a a good compromise i don't know what that would be we have a three to two compromise but it you know the question is i mean did this should keep it going immediately you have to follow these steps that i've outlined that's what that's where you're at three people have three out of five have indicated that they want the ordinance repealed in its entirety we have no repeal the original one yeah that's what he said repeal the original that was his compromise no i said delete delete subsection d right delete subjection d which is the presiding officer on request of the city council show a lot of order any discussion by the city council of matters that are the subject of any pending or prospective litigation except the council may discuss pending litigation in accordance with section 286 well that's not the current that's that's that's not occurring current just stops there it's out of order period but on second reading which is it's this was the interim step that you agreed to do when you continued it second reading should be at the next city council meeting and because of the the title it is still the amendment is going to be consistent with the title and that does not contemplate at this moment in time that you are deleting it it's complete you're passing an amendment to it so we would have to vote down the amendment of the second reading and then come back and discuss that's what i would recommend healing or changing or whatnot or the meeting of some other fashion it would be different with that coming up but you're not you've already passed that okay so then it goes back for final that we have so we'll have this debate again twice probably we'll have it at the next council meeting and then we'll have a work session and and i'm sorry i wasted your time but i mean i don't know what we accomplished because quite frankly we could have i mean i understand you want to have a discussion but if it was going to go to a second reading we could have just had that discussion at the second reading it's not your fault but i'm just saying you guys asked you did what i asked you to do okay i would prefer to have this conversation tonight yes rather than hearing that yes i agree and then we may of course say things you've already said tonight the other two were present people save a lot i had a crystal ball and knew what everybody was gonna say then i wouldn't have put you through the ordeal but i i don't and i i thought it was the best effort i could to try and find a way to solve the problem okay anybody it's we're now on three hours with no end in sight here we still have you know leslie's a timeout so um it's 8 54 how much time we need 10 minutes 905. i note that we have seven items here and we're just getting to item number three how late does this council want to go and do we want to prioritize what we want to go to i don't think a one o'clock meeting for our sessions in order so um so then shaking his head did we have certain ones that we want to prioritize i know like the buoys was an issue but this might go quickly but you know frank's the expert he's not available so i don't know um you know these are long discussions almost everything here so [Music] just needed um decide yes which version i can get through that quickly [Music] but i can tell you number four's probably i have something to say about that number six is wild and i have no idea what that is um five may have some discussion so we can take a time and we'll just keep going or we can prioritize what we have left that's i'm totally open for what everybody wants to do [Music] that's an hour okay so of the anybody else 10 10 fair i think 10 is fair robin's going to get a park of my time then if we stay anywhere um i think we could do things right i think we could take care of three fairly quickly because i was the one that has had some issues with that one too and why it's back here so i can get through three quickly and then maybe we'll just pick the next item how's that okay so three discussion of ordinance 2109 amending section 30-141 belfort mexico safety zone let me clarify this because i understand some comments that i heard last time maybe my comments weren't interpreted properly in no way shape or form by advocating that motorized vehicles people could be allowed in swim areas period not going to be allowed okay sorry i even gave the example we were talking about dave and i said he might be responsible but the next guy with the cave of beer isn't and i don't want motor motorized vehicles this was a real simple thing and i was trying to elicit some response right now the way friend has this written it basically broke if it's all vessels and i think we kind of got through that and said it's basically pretty much everything okay you probably could have a raft or a tube or a you know a little floaty but you're not gonna have anything more than that my point was do you want to have anything more than that you can't put your paddleboard out here you can't put your kayak out these are self-propelled items they're not winning the pedal they're self-propelled do we want to allow people with an ore or a paddle to put something in the water do we want more than that or do we want to say nothing is allowed and i got very little response from everybody so it's really it's either good way it's written or we allow very limited amounts of propulsion okay hand propulsion i had leslie i have um robin and then so that's the order plus these are my inclination would be to allow you know human-propelled panels kayaks stand-up paddleboards things like that rafts i mean one of the things that you can define a vessel is a raft to be a break your inner tube i also um i'm not in favor of allowing of prohibiting all motorized vessels in there i think the no wake zone is a more appropriate um you know rule because people come in to bring their boats in to pick up the family that's on the beach and go out but if they if it's an awake zone that works that's my thought on that i'm with leslie because i know my husband and dave you said you've done it where you go and you pick up the family and you know they take them off we've done that with my involves when they've been in town do i agree that some drunk is going to take advantage of it yes but truth is even if we have zero motorized powered in there that drunk is still going to take advantage of it so let's not harm the people that are going to do it responsibly so zone for the motorized but then some a citizen brought up that um it's not well kite surfing and then the other one would be uh the sail the foil that's kind of a gray area because those can be very dangerous i've seen the wood surfers go and they if they don't have control of that and are really good at it so i don't know if self-propelled vessels taking out wind because guys who are really good at wind surfing can fly i don't like that because if you're swimming there and somebody loses control you're dead i think manually propelled would be with a paddle right but i'm with you just manually just leave it at that i can't endorse maybe if we could put a zone where it is a pickup zone you could somehow section that zone off where you come in in a certain spot as up and then we could have this and then you know like don't swim in that zone so you know a jet ski or a boater can come in and no way you can do it but you wouldn't swim in that zone we would have to manually section that off if at all possible that would give the best of all things and then the rest of the beach swim and don't worry about getting hit in the head with a i don't want to be hitting the head with a 30-foot boat because the guy's picking it up even coasting something yeah sure do they have they don't have buoys to tell us i'm not talking about from the beach so technically right now anybody really i mean not saying us that we know but i'm saying a tourist from bellaire beach can walk to butler shore and their family can come pick them up that's not hard you'd still be breaking the law but it's not there's no notice i was just trying to [Music] coming in but my preference is for awarding their vital tolerance rather than a weight you know the wave zone people have different concepts of what no weight means how much power is it i'm talking about if it's an island just dropped into and uh just idle speed and total exclusion here's what here's the potential for that someone rents a boat they take their family out they want to go to the beach they see those markers and think well everyone get out we'll just go to the beach from here so they drop anchor jump out of the boat and it's 12 feet deep and can't swim i i don't know i'm just saying there's some that's isn't a lot of seriousness opportunities in every situation there's bad things can happen but um you're what you're doing now is you're restricting anyone from even coming to the beach that happens to have a boat and i i don't see a good solution i think the idle speed is probably as good as you can get but then what's going to keep them from dropping an anchor right here on the beach there are people who enter their boats out there overnight i assume living along the beaches we'll anchor that out there overnight i guess i look at it from a swimmer's point of view and love red todd came this year i was a swimmer and i like to go you know swim from here to indian rocks which is a fairly long swim and i go deep because i don't want to be around fishing lines and people and stuff like that and i've had boats that got too close and boats scare the hell out of me i mean you can't necessarily see me you're you know i'm in the water i'm just my little head is sticking up and i don't want to be hit with a 20-foot boat and i don't speak i mean i'll get hit with a kayak that might give me a bruise of you know i i can deal with that i'll get hit with a raft that leslie's up cool with that um i'll get hit with a paddle board because those guys are standing up and they have you know the worst it's got but i'm gonna get a little gash in my head which i don't want but i can deal with it it scares the hell out of me with your boat or your jet ski or something like that forgetting about the irresponsible people even the responsible people i just either we have i'm just saying either have a section for it limited in a certain area and all of this comes down to enforcement i will give you a piece of information i got because it came up i think frank brought it up last time there's like no enforcement because he takes pictures of it all the time good news lin's laughing he knows him right sheriff just got more patrols for the boats boats and they've got apparently they've got four full-time officers now that are going to be patrolling unfortunately the bad news is they've got four full-time officers and they've got all the water on the east side here and all the water on the west side so it's not gonna be great but you're not better than what you've got right now so there will be a little bit more share of patrol um i don't know i you know again i hate to hurt the responsible voters but it's the ones that just aren't paying attention and i'm getting hit in the head with a boat scares me well i mean i agree it's hard to see a you know to imagine i don't have a dime flag with you because that would help but um i i mean i would be fine with the marked zone for going in and out and dropping off picking up family i'd be fine with that but i'm not fine with zero motorized votes just for like you know like dave and my family we can do it responsibility so i i've been okay with the work could we do one of them no we don't have them no we don't have it but could we do it if you said let's say 19 well i'll just pick two streets you know 20 to 21st street that block is the you know we're going to put buoys up there that are going to say those are permitted and that's your that's where you're going to pick your people up can we and everything else swim in peace and don't worry about it you if you come in on you know up at 20 we have a 24th 25th you're too far harrison you're too far you coming on this one block i mean do we have that many people drop the people off i don't usually swim up there so i don't know that you well first of all it'll be very hard to enforce uh all of this is hard to enforce and you know we're just trying to correct the wording on our buoys and i i think the realization is that people want to be able to bring their boats in but i think if you look at b on page 3 of 12 the slow speed area where you've got to be pretty much flat in the water and creep along i think that's a potential uh but like rick schack said that we whatever you do you're not going to stop it they do 327.46 is the florida statue with voting restricted areas and subsection one one addresses an ordinance establishing an idle speed no wake voting restricted area if the area is and then it has a couple different things that none of those include a bathing area a beach or a bathing beach or swim area the reading down further in the or the statue that says an ordinance establishing a vessel exclusion zone if the area is a designated as a public bathing beach or swim area the vessel exclusion zone is the several different categories that i have had highlighted in the memo those are the options for vessel exclusions so what i'm saying is no weight or idle speed is really not an option not an option idle speed is not an option no no because it's listed in the uniform waterway markers in florida waters it lists idle speed no wake or idle speed means a vessel must proceed at a speed no greater than that which will maintain steerage and headway that's not for swimming though okay that's not for a certain area or beach and that's what fred was saying that's like if you're going under restricted area if the area is a within 500 feet of any boat ramp hoist etc or waterways more than 300 feet in width or within 300 feet of any boat ramp or a hoist marine railway or other launching system b within 500 feet of fuel pumps see inside or within 300 feet of any lock structure so none of those are applicable to a beach so basically back to what i was thinking initially manually propelled vessels only all vessels other than those propelled by ores paddles or poles are prohibited from entering the marked area that's that was that's that so or they're mutually exclusive i mean you're trying to you try to create a swim area that allows vessels to come in at higher speed maybe just creating an area and it's idle speed only it's a de facto swim area also if you go to clearwater beach you know they go out so far with uh posts they don't use buoys that's their swim zone beyond those those markers if that's nowhere close to the beach i was just there i swim that that's you're you're 100 yards from the shore well that's typically what it is right so no books are allowed period i mean not that somebody's not going to choose to break that wall but you know nothing that's swim zone period you're not really not even supposed to now while we were there that's where we learned about inflatable paddleboards i didn't even know it was such a thing but i was like yeah we inflated you know like i didn't care it was an inflatable paddleboard he was full off and more than he was staying on it nobody was having a problem but you know so his option is number three an option [Music] [Music] h4 i don't see a solution for boats if if we designated a swim area i just don't see it i mean unless we did as you said but that's somebody's citizens will be screaming if you think they're blocking a lot of swimming so just turning around the winds blowing those boats are going to drift into the swimming areas um i say we uh probably go to number three or no vessels at all i mean that's basically your choices well i don't want the novice [Music] of vessels [Music] so do we have a consensus to move this forward with i as page 4 of 12 item 3 manually propelled vessels right now you can't bring anything in right i think the way it stands right now it's no vessels at all so we're actually giving a little extra right right yes and if you're going whatever you decide to do if you're going to change it from what we have now then the the thing that lynn and i have done now twice was submitted to the state agency so that they approve it in advance so that we know conclusively if this is what you implement they will then approve it after the fact and then you're going to be uh it will be legally sound that's one of the requirements of the statute anyway but to me it makes sense that fly it by them before y'all vote so if i hear you correctly before we do this for a third time okay you're not bound by your vote tonight we can't vote on it but let's not send these guys for something that we're not really good if you're really gonna vote for this if it says three manually propelled vessels only and we'll task them with going forward if you absolutely will not vote for that and you wanted to say no vessels at all then we have something we could vote on right now so we kind of need where each person stands non-binding of course but we can't vote on this the way it is if we decide to change it from none right that's the way it stands right now they have it set up as no vessels and if we go to manually propelled only then you've got to go back to fwc get the permission and then we can make sure that we're going to be okay and then we can vote on it i say that correctly right yeah we have to send it to them get their approval and then we once they say it's good then we've got a long process last time what was absolutely we okay yeah because we had to set it back two times i think a couple changes i i just needed clarification if you can you create an idle zone according to the statute you cannot create it you cannot create an idle zone and designate a swim area that's that's what dave was saying basically we would have to make that beach not a non-swim [Music] right well yeah but i mean if if you're gonna let boats come in i mean i'm gonna swim someplace else i guess most people would if that's the designated boat area then you know yes it's a no swim beach we're not gonna arrest you but there's a way today you have the whole length of the beach as a swim area okay you could designate a and i'm just picking a number like a 100 yard by 300 yard segment of the beach and have that be a manually propelled vessels only you could then have a 100 yard segment that doesn't have any designation and then you could have another 400 foot segment that said manually propelled via vessels only so there would be a place where families could come in and um you know idle and or do what's prudent and there's not going to be a marker that tells them how to do things i mean that that to me makes sense as a solution if you're really concerned about having a way for people to bring a boat to the shore bunch and then we've got an awake zone and we've got a manually propelled no wait zone's not an option oh okay what do you call the one where you can bring your boat in no there would be no buoys no buoys no restrictions okay yeah and what i see island [Music] and where i see the problem with that is okay so who's wonderful beachfront condo are we going to tell us the boat zone and you're really not supposed to swim there because we'll have however many people they have as residents in this room screaming at us what the hell are you doing you know you just killed my beach because most of them are not boaters right most of our beachgoers and we're taking away their beach so i i want to help the folks who you know i mean it sounds like a nice thing they're not doing it legally right now it would be nice to do it but i mean the alternative is just keep it the way it is right now and which is ban everything but i i really wanted to try and help the people with the the oars and the you know the people learning how to you know paddle board and stuff like that but if we can't do that easily then let me suggest another thing that could be done you could direct us i mean we know the no vessel ones already sound they fwse looked at that you could direct glenn and i to change it and i'm just picking one to to change it for manually propelled vessels and we can send that to fwc and get them to approve that and if they did that in a week we could come back and say you know next time you all have a workshop city council you have two approved options from fwc the seven of you now decide which one you want you can do that it won't be the motorized one but it'll be the two options and option three or we all know we want manually propelled in which case we could just skip the next work set i mean it seems like i think glenn was saying he's okay with manually propelled well we're trying to get the motorized one in if there's a way of doing it it doesn't look like there's a way to do it easily so i'm only saying this because frank has always been very dialed in and focused and my guess would be although i'm reluctant to guess what he want but the tone of the discussion with him is he he doesn't trust anybody with a boat coming close to the beach at all so fine but i don't know that he had a problem with a paddle board or something like that i mean i'm saying we would probably pass manually propelled vessels only if it came before us so i'm saying skip the next bring it back to work session bring it to a vote if we get manually all good with if he could get us manually propelled we're not going to get power quotes okay we will try but it doesn't look like we're going to get that i'm not telling you what to do you want to go and bring your power boat in you run that risk but you know um manually propelled makes it legal for the paddle boarder it makes it legal for the person with a little raft with a paddle i mean and that gets us in and because i don't think anybody wants to ban everything does anybody want to ban everything no right so i think it's option three fred i will ask for the citizens if they have any comments none yeah rebuilding to shore many times because the dock can be kind of i want to say hard for some people to get an honor alone so the the option if you all could find a way to allow boats in would be maybe at the far end of bellerin beach where they could their family members could park at the marina and walk through that easement and then so that we don't have boats in or you know it's at the very end of our city down there and we have a lane right there at the end of our city for the boats to come in and they still could pick them up from shore uh it's just something i'm doing out there then you don't have it broken up and it's not confusing where a possible accident could occur it's a set designated area not in the middle of all these other areas and and make it confusing the situation is still the same thing i don't know whose condo is the last one in our town but the minute we say you can't swim well you can't swim there but you're gonna have motor you know motor boats come through or this is actually designated to no swim zone they're not gonna like that i also fear that if you allow boats to come all the way up to shore you're going to start an epidemic because all of a sudden bellaire beach will be known that's where you can go and we'll have we'll have tons of boats that are there all at bel air beach and nowhere else i think it's leading towards number three everybody nobody wants to ban it entirely right and we get what limited rights we can for manually propelled vessels only we're casting lynn and fred to go forward with that is that i'm not putting words in everybody's mouth is that where we're all about yes robert yes leslie yes yes me yes glenn bless okay we're that's what we're doing if you can get it city manager you have a preference five is is really just uh uh the only thing that's really changed from what the planning board recommended to move forward was he added the electric bicycle which is at the very top of it that's a quick hitter maybe does anybody okay that's the one where the electric the legislature gave us the ability to ban e-bikes on the beach because originally in their wisdom they said bicycles and bicycles included electric vehicle electric bicycles so people were coming up and down the beach where it's a danger and they were zipping up and down and we all recognized that that was a safety hazard the c was talking about and everybody in the legislature's finally said okay the legislators finally said okay you can ban them on the beach we're not banning them in the city we're not betting them on the sidewalks we're not banning them on the streets just on the beach so i think that's everything like this moves this forward which with the ban on the beach so unless somebody wants it um to allow this we probably can move forward but i'm not that's just me talking i'm totally in favor of banning them on the beach they have no place there this is actually a county-wide movement all the municipalities all this time and then the other thing that's in there let me just dispose of that one first there's anybody we have five people here anybody in favor of allowing the e-bikes to continue on the beach i'm seeing no one citizens no one okay so we move forward with the e-bikes then is that we're okay with the ban on the e-bikes to vote on that we need to send the ordnance two readings and publication a whole bit well there's one two changes that are highlighted in red page four and six and this really pertains to vice mayor's comment about you know this repair of docks and whatever i was fine with this i just i don't know my definition but i'm just sitting here going well who decides if it's in a state of disrepair i mean i know we can say we know it when we see it glenn's nodding i mean it is a board missing they stay i mean you could trip and hurt yourself so what's the standard you know that's the only thing if i look at this when is who calls it you know i don't want it to be too subjective like dave was talking about the dilapidated ones that have fallen in the water yet clearly no one's going to disagree but like when our dock on 7th street actually wasn't structurally sound it looked great to me you know you you did the research with the engineers and they're like no that's no good it's got to come down i would have been using that thing for 10 years it looked great okay so you know what i'm saying i mean so there's one that visually looked good but it wasn't right so how do you make that determination because i don't want to get that our code officer goes out and says you know you got you got your board is down and you got to repair it and the next guy's you know it's falling apart underneath it we don't catch it so and we can't do engineering studies of everybody so that's i'm fine with it if we can just define how we're going to enforce it it has to be clear to the citizens the uh i thought we were covering the page four change section yeah yeah okay well that's that's concerned with uh votes right that one i didn't know there's no issue i didn't have an issue with that i was [Music] provisions that the city of clearwater uses so it's it's not me making up a standard it's what somebody else has used and it's a neighboring city with a lot of experience with this type of thing i i would submit to you this this is a code enforcement issue and the the code enforcement inspector will have to make a determination whether it's in disrepair or not if there's there's a board missing and it's a keyboard then it's in disrepair i mean the process is to send the people a notice asking them to comply with the code and if they don't then it's to send them a notice that will come to the code enforcement year room and does etcetera cover about this because it's not called out specifically that etcetera is left for interpretation uh page six h four h uh where it's it starts with if any dot dwarf pile etc um i i i would think that that would mean vote left but if that might just add voters i'm still having a little problem with this for being vague though it's not your fault i'm just looking at this way somebody who's challenged so the code guy comes by and says well your board is no good and then i go we'll say look at you know johnny's down the road and he's got ten boards missing you didn't hit him and we our code guy is i mean he's good we like him but he's not a doc expert it's an engineering thing not a police thing so how do you make this my answer to that would be when the code of officer goes and looks at a house and he's not a structural engineer either but if there is a dangerous condition that's obvious because the the roof is being held up by a two by two then you know most people can assess that a two by two is not going to be able to hold the roof very long and you know that that's where they if it's if the situation is severe enough then it is a life safety issue and the code officer has the ability to do something about it and expedite it if it's a minor thing then my understanding is they typically would address it is a minor thing i i've never have liked using etc in anything in a legal standard the only reason i used it here is because that's what the city of clearwater used i don't think anybody and ancillary structures because that's really what we're talking about fred if you're okay with the wording i just bring it up as a challenge because that's me but if you think it's sufficiently clear that's fine i mean i don't have a dog in the fight it doesn't matter to me but i just i don't want somebody saying you know again you enforced it for him he didn't enforce it from me he's got three boards missing i got one maybe your report is critical maybe i've been doing this too long you're always going to hear that argument anyway it doesn't matter what the legal standard is and they're always going to point this why didn't you pull that guy over too and the the the object is to get compliance and not to have dangerous situations they didn't notice that guy down there with the three but they'll get told eventually well i mean we go back to playing english meeting and it says dangerous structure creating an unrisked reasonable risk so you know if somebody's just busting somebody's chops because a screw is missing that's not going to fly that's not a dangerous situation but you know if your railing is missing and you're good dave and i have seen plenty of doctors going out to the intercoastal where it's so that's the only changes that we have uh page seven we're needing some numbers of days oh yeah all right and unfortunately [Music] this is one of those situations where i don't really i know people that cruise yeah and some of them cruised for three days some recruits for three months and if i had giant boat and big pockets and was retired i would probably do that too yeah i don't want to have to go through city hall every time they decide to take a cruise but by the same token if we get guys that are just parking slips and really not using them that's that's really what this is geared for is the guy who really just is holding up a slip but is he paying for it he is but you know like if you're just if you're just going to bank a slip well that's that's we got 40 people on a waiting list no i agree it's not fair but hey he's paying it i'd be mad if he was holding it and not paying it we're saying put a boat there you know basically like he's paying the bill if he chooses to pay a bill or not if he went through the protocol and waited his time on the waiting list and he's paid the whole paragraph comes out then basically yeah i mean i don't think you should penalties if you want to market you can park it for 20 years as long as you're paying what happens if it's in repair and it's at the marina getting fixed and they can't find the part or pull them out that was here like dave said how do you pick a number of days because somebody might want to cruise around the islands for six months and i don't want to have to call in for hey i'm gonna go away for three months you know just just pay the rent just pay around so i'm just taking it out of here so we take that paragraph out well let's it says uh discuss with lynn reeves lynn we well here here's the just as an example and this happened to us during the pandemic we had an individual just before the pandemic he sold his boat well he went back to england he's got a condo here sold his boat went back to england couldn't come back well he kept paying for his his his uh slip he had a lift on it and you know we told him to you need to get rid of the lift well finally he did get rid of left to turn the thing in because he decided i don't want to pay for it anymore but the other issue is we've had a couple people and i think we need to have some standard for the maintenance is more the bigger thing when they take a vote out to get it repaired i would think that in most cases the maintenance place is going to tell you how long it's going to take to get repaired so if we established a reasonable time length that's that's what we need to do i gotta say i agree with glenn on this one if you're paying the bill who cares what you're doing with it i mean you know i know it's not right if i'm sitting here and i'm on that waiting list and i'm seeing a guy just banking a slip but maybe he is he's banking the slip he doesn't have the money for the boat yet but he's gonna buy one in two years and he's he is paying you the rent you rented it to him there's no requirement that you put a boat there and he just wants to go to the dock and listen to the water i mean it's like it's like renting a property it's like well you're not using it well okay but i'm writing it i'm paying again we're all current right we're cool not my fault you know you care about yourself i think the most proven thing in those situations would be to after a reasonable amount of time it doesn't have to be written down you call up and say hey we notice you haven't had your boat slip filled for three months everything okay we're concerned you know oh i'm just feeling keeping it but i'm gonna put a boat in but i'm paying okay do you want to maybe give it up to somebody else or you know give them the option but i don't think we should if they're paying then they get it but if you want to reach out to them to make sure everything's okay and give them the option to give it up to somebody who could use it but if they say no i want to keep it well then okay as far as repairs go um ever since the pandemic supply is terrible on everything you could be looking up to nine months maybe a year before something comes available so i do understand that but what do you tell the citizens of bel air beach that are in line and they see that thing empty for a year nine months that's that's where i wore with it because i know that there are slips there that people would jump on if they could so here's an option how long does our typical rental contract go for it it's it's automatic renewal let's say we don't make it automatically so basically if it's vacant pick your time if it's vacant for a year we'll just give you a year that takes care of i understand you could take the city maybe it's two years the city reserves the right not to renew your lease at that point we're giving you like two years i mean you're really not a builder if you're waiting for a park for two years i get it but you know to the point i mean you see in a vacant slip and there's a limited number of them and you're really not using it so sticker you could stick a kayak in there and be fulfilling your obligation but you're gonna have to put some kind of a vessel in there maybe the vessel you can't bring to the to the beach but there's something there i don't care if you buy a robot we saw one at the auction you could have got it for like 400 bucks but stick something in there because it's probably being overly generous i can see a year yeah but dave is right i mean there is you can't get something i mean i don't want to penalize them because they're they're legitimately waiting for a part or they have to do an engine overall or whatever that's where i think the after you know three months or whatever you reach out and see what the situation is and go based on that because and use descriptions i think if they're paying the bill then they have the right to it it didn't the contract doesn't say pay your bills maintenance and occupy the spot which is what i'm saying is you can amend the you know contracts come up we can amend each one of them saying we reserve the right to be like hey what's going on right what are your circumstances and then give them the option hey since you haven't been using it for the last three months we have somebody on the waitlist if you don't want anymore we'd be happy to whatever help with the transition to the next person well the provision written on this is it's up to the customer to notify city hall that there's a problem that okay i've gone past my number of days whatever those are since we don't have anything plugged in yet and then they can actually just get an extension on that time it's of course that's based upon uh again interpretation but hey you've got a legitimate problem with your boat they're boats they break all the time in the crews i'm not going to feel sorry for somebody that's on a three-month cruise but we're going to give you a year or so i mean how many people are going out for a year from our beach's thing if you really are then you call the city manager like hey i'm on a cruise [Music] [Music] that gives you a year there's nothing stopping we don't have to put it in the ordinance that you call if you see a vacant that's a that's a management decision by the city um lynn can call anytime and say what's going on you know well the cruise thing i since in most cases i haven't seen one be gone for longer than 60 days and so i think having a bat for the cruise is not a big deal putting something in there if somebody doesn't doesn't let's say somebody comes and rents a slip you know we have kind of a requirement our policy that says you gotta have a vote to be able to put it there so in our policy it states that so realistically if a person wanted to rent a slip he's supposed to put a boat in there as soon as he rents the slip that's that's the recurrent requirement as far as repair and maintenance it's a different animal right now you've got to give them time to repair and maintain it so i would say that should be you know i'll go with a year on that we went through 65 you want 180 again this says maybe it doesn't say shall be so you have some discretion you have a lot of discretion here i mean if a guy tells you like they just said hey i'm waiting for the part it's taken six months it's going to take another two and you let them keep the thing and you see what happens if the guy has nowhere to be found never put a vessel in never did a thing like you could take that one back and give it to somebody else yeah and then that's what i'm saying about the first one i think that needs to be a shorter period because if somebody doesn't put a vote in there you know if they say i've got to vote i'm going to put it in there and then they've paid the fee and rented it and then they don't put a boat in there they really [Music] looking for a boat you know what size you want but you don't have a place to keep it there's nowhere around and you basically the clock starts ticking the moment you find a slip then you go find your boat you can't pick a boat and then go find a slip it doesn't work that way so it's kind of backwards and it it's unfortunately it stays that way for the only people that can have a slip are people that already have boats and for the residents of bel air beach if you don't have property big enough to hold that boat you'll never get a slip it's the same way with airplanes you don't want an airplane until you have a hanger but if you were paying rent on a hangar do you have to put an airplane in there or they just say we'll take your money and it's okay you have a big hanger most places uh work are waiting that's just like that you know you're waiting five years unless you actually show them that you own an aircraft no what i'm saying is the point most people you wouldn't buy a nice airplane until you have a place to keep work it's the standard of the boat if you don't have a place to keep it or pull it out of the water but could you rent the anchor without having a amazing [Music] see that's to this point is you know i mean the problem is we have this big waiting list so how can we be fair to the people that are let me ask you this how many people are actually doing this i mean are we solving a problem that we don't have right now it's starting to sound like euclid that was that's a glenn a glendale but really is this a problem i mean do we have a lot of vacant slips that people were just abandoning actually you know other than what i told you about for the guy from england uh for the most part people don't don't abandon them uh we don't have a problem renting slips at all i know we don't have problem renting but the question is are people the renters using them because if i'm renting to glen's point if i'm renting a hangar and i'm putting my car in there well you know meanwhile there's a guy who has an airplane that really could use this i could park my car in a parking lot and i'm really abusing the resource if you will yeah i'm paying the rent you know but i'm not doing anything wrong but i'm really taking it away from somebody who could use it so what we're saying here is you know if i if i get on the list today it's my turn oh great what are you going to get your boat in five years you come back in five years we got a guy who wants to use it right now i mean that's all this is about fairness so yeah and really what i'm saying is we should we should make them at least a time frame for them to put a boat in there as well what's your recommendation even though we don't really have a major problem 180 days yeah but six months dave can we get a bubble in six months any boat will do right i can stick them [Music] as long as it's sea worthy we're good not the one that had the plant grown out of it by robin's house the tree we're not sure if that's sea worthy i don't want to find out all right 180 days we all cool with that this thing can go forward for a vote next month next time any other changes dave citizens anything nope okay three all right so three blanks yep the first one what's everybody 180 right [Music] 60 that covers every eventuality you're going to go a long ways that's that's three months at sea and they all they have to do is call you and let you know they're gonna go for four months and you're not gonna unreasonably withhold it i mean and hopefully you call and try to contact them before you just give away that's right well in most cases people have put like i'd like the guy in england they've got a lift there so the city's not in the lift business until i got my waiting list i got on the way to this i give you six months to buy one that's a lot of time okay we'll vote for it okay anything else we're good all right that one's done uh we got three minutes we're done i had i have one thing not that's in the agenda uh november 11th is a thursday and that's the holiday and i would like to ask the consulate to give the staff the 12th office because a lot of cities right now are giving staff that uh through the candidate they're giving them money they're going on days off cities had counties analysis got a proposal to give every staff member that got vaccinated 750 those girls doing it some some of the beach communities are actually giving people money and days off so we're small city it's coming back to work for one day so i'm asking the council to close the 11th and 12th it's an extra holiday just one time it's not really it's a it's a gift to the employees as opposed to what some other cities are doing you know they're given five or counting 500 or 750 plus days of vacation there's a resolution at the next meeting i will vote on it and it should probably pass i don't think we can pass it tonight because i'm giving you a holiday i mean that is we have we have to hear from the citizens on this because we're really getting an extra holiday they used to do this in new jersey all the time and it used to i never had a problem it was the day after thanksgiving yet a lot of people were like they get x amount of state holidays already and now we're given another one and it became a big political issue for the people so i think you bring it up to a vote we see where it goes and we hear from the citizens and if there's no objection it should likely pass they just won't be able to make their plans for the law well yes not a bad idea you'll pitch it and i'm sorry to go over okay so again i mean if we have a room full of people screaming then yeah and the one last thing i have is i'd like to use the citizens advisory committee to discuss and review the underground new project on both boulevard and the american mercenary funding so they can make the mix of our nominations to consulate there's no problem with that i'll ask the community chair to set up a meeting anybody have a problem i think that's that's what they're there for so that way they can provide some room yes okay and i mean to that end that that american rescue fund money is it can be pretty diverse like you said i mean you can even give it to citizens to encourage vaccinations and stuff like that so let's think as widely as possible it doesn't have to be we're going to use probably a good chunk of it for underground and our for um control and stuff like that but we have other you know we can give incentives to our citizens and maybe we should with the age of our population to incentivize people maybe some people are against that i i just think we should do everything we can to combat this thing okay okay this rest of this stuff is tabled we'll just put on for next month okay we will probably but we normally i think in november we're iffy i think on um december we didn't okay i remember we skipped one of the months so [Music] vaccinations incentivized vaccinations and one of the wealthiest demographics in those counties and the average age is the population is if they're smart they went out and got it anyway that was one of the things that was in there and i'm like well i don't believe in incentivizing i just like to see people get vaccinated because it's in their best interest you know but i mean maybe i said i don't know you know it's in our best interest too because when you're not vaccinating you're spreading so we've got a doctor you can tell us we're gone folks that's it have a good night thanks for playing [Music]"
