    "transcript": "good evening everyone welcome to the monday february 7 regular city council meeting in the city of delaware beach please join me in the pledge of allegiance [Music] councilmember leslie ontario here vice mayor david goddess here mayor joseph manzo here council member rita smoke was unable to attend okay thank you madam clerk ladies and gentlemen i just want to i'm going to have him introduce himself a little bit later but the distinguished gentleman here sitting next to lynn reeves is andrew saltzman he's our city attorney he's standing in right now and we appreciate you being here andrew in a couple seconds i'll just give you a chance to introduce yourself when we come to the city attorney's spot okay thank you okay so first uh item of business is the approval of the agenda may have a motion please so moved from my plain gun a second talking by leslie detero any discussion yes yes from bankert uh is the resolution made at this point is that's why you can't hear him fred and i met a week ago last friday and of course everyone knows he's going through some things he looked at it and he thought it needed to be an ordinance instead of a resolution because it's changing uh addressing city council so he what he he does have it it's just he's kind of been detained the last few days he's looking at that plus section 94. he's going to finish those things up for us he already told me that well the resolution was clearly just before when our citizens address council instead of the council have to vote whether we can address them back resolution would just give us the opportunity under our free speech to address those citizens lots of times these citizens have to stand here stay here all night long until council you know interacts with them or gives comments so bigger neighborhoods bring it right to the people now i've heard like some people say it might take all night but if you serve on council then you should stick with them i don't know why we have to be resolution or i mean i don't know why we have to be embarrassed i think it and i haven't seen your resolution but i think if i understand what you just said correctly um right now in our ordinance it prohibits us to have a back and forth dialogue with citizens so to a change in ordinance you have to use some notification on the ordinance so it's an ordinance change which means one vote a publication one vote a publication a patty a newspaper and then uh a second both mental attention charges but what we can do i mean it should be addressed i you know it i don't want to just be tabled for you know or not forever so if we can get this addressed in the meantime um you can make a motion tonight to dispense with the rulings agree with that i don't think that there'd be any problems i'll limit the back and forth so we're not going to go on all night long i mean you have three minutes on your mark here so it'll be you know a reasonable discussion but we can't have you know i agree suggestion rather than change the agenda why don't we just bring it up in congress or unfinished business right that's what yeah we will and then um because we're not going to be able to because i was just saying i think it does require an immigrants change yeah [Music] any other comments on the agenda test test test all right welcome rob in 605 rabinaki's present now um right so any other comments on the agenda citizens any comments counsel all in favor of approving the agenda as is i i anyone opposed this passes we have six people here six to zero next comes citizens comments each person may come up and address the council on any item that is not on our agenda if it's on our agenda i'll call you later to speak on that item when you come up please come right up here to the podium give us your name and address and please observe the rules of conduct they're on that podium and they're all around in a nutshell basically just speak in a nice civil manner and that's the kind of reception you get back with that does anybody like to let everybody like to speak with council boulevard it's not really addressing council so to speak but i just wanted to commend patty on her handling of all of the paperwork for the election and things she's i think done a fabulous job and she just gets things out so quickly and i know that's part of her job but it's not part of her everyday job and so it's on top of what she has to do every day so i just on behalf of hopefully all the citizens of bella beach i just wanted to say thank you to patty thank you thank you other citizen comments there being no others on the closest and comments at this time we have the presentation by the pinellas county sheriff's office we have law enforcement and code enforcement i say we have two deputies here so deputy sergeant right i'm sorry doesn't matter they both were good for the month i think so [Music] the analysis that i'm going to present is going to be for the month of december 2021. it looks like the ucr reporting crimes we only had one assault which through my research was a domestic related incident there were a total of nine people arrested in there uh for that month and most of those arrests came from traffic related stops of the deadly activity leaving that were 195 traffic stops direct controls throughout the city of 116 a month and traffic control is 52. there were five crashes in the city and the majority looked like they were right here at the intersection of gulf and causeway and somewhere on the bridge and then there were a total of 243 citations and warnings issued and i have to break down here in my head into a 243 two were voting citations there were 24 traffic citations issued 22 parking citations and the rest were warnings of we've been speaking quite a bit and i know frank bancard's taken personal interest on the whole safety issue do you know anything about those boating incidents i don't i was assigned to the marine unit back in the early 2000s and a lot of it is just traffic cars boating safety enforcement out there usually coastal waterway just looking for safety inspections what not obviously speed zone collaboration quake zone violation maybe efficient license violations etc well this is another excellent month and congratulations to the many women who all the citizens who keep their eyes open um i did note that today just came through the sheriff they have the county has reported where you can sign up for what any citizen can and i noticed there was two burglaries they were out in gulf boulevard area so i'm just guessing it's probably the same old routine stuff where people are going in cars so i don't know if you're seeing any more of the you know lifts you know what they call the lift ups or whatever where the people are lifting up the handles and stuff but i don't know if you have any tips for us over here but i did notice just two in one week here well i'm glad you brought that up it actually happened on the same night and the deputy on this ship is the one that actually went and investigated the call as usual it's the doors that were left unlocked so the reason i'm black about that was because i was going to and i was going to just remind everybody to make sure that they locked her i heard it from the sergeant folks lock your doors council any questions comments citizens any questions or comments thank you appreciate it code enforcement council members staff citizens a lot of contractors work in the city without permits and as of today when it came back at 17 as of right now it's 9 19 because i got two more this afternoon where people are actually not pulling apartments they're hiring contractors coming in doing the work and then of course nothing's coming through the city so we don't see anything in the city but we didn't have money to last and was not licensed i was not a licensed contractor and thank god it was not because of what electrician did but because of a couple of squirrels they just decided [Music] like i said it's my second month doing this and as like right now like i said uh [Music] um [Music] i did notice a lot more of that you know with the contractors and then you finding that so that's excellent um two questions how's the reception that you're getting i know danny was quite popular and you're new how is things going out there i will tell you that everybody that i meet is just happy you know yeah and we have been and it might be too new at this point to even say something but we had increased the enforcement hours to about 20 per week at the recommendation the city manager how are you finding that 20 is it just right too much too little it is sufficient i mean there are some days like that last sunday or this past sunday um but during the week months he's changed the face of cold enforcement he brings a lot of experience and uh look forward to working with you and hopefully we can put a lot more uh spotlight on the after hours of the weekend stuff as well board reports we're only going to have one tonight because the board of adjustment has no report planning and zoning has no report park and recreation tammy lavender had a personal issue she's not going to be able to be here tonight i don't think there's any replacement person who came in a short note to start patting you know so just citizen advisory committee do we have someone here ron mayor council bronson citizen advisory committee so we've had three meetings here beginning november 16th we met to discuss capital project budget items regarding the gold homework underground as well as the american rescue plan act funding and the recommendations for that on december 8th we met to be the digital sign awardments and then we had a citizen raise a matter with concerns over the height of hedges walls and fences and we agreed to talk about that in our next meeting so then on january 20th we met to review the citizens concern and we are in the process of making recommendations on that and that was uh this individual bodies home 20 years ago the height one that was four feet back to your setback which is 25 feet from the sea wall more from properties and then that coat was changed to where it could now be eight feet you know it's only four feet high uh from five feet from the sea wall and so the panoramic that's the this gentleman had when he was home is no longer there so we'll work on some recognitions there and then we also on that january 20th meeting a review of the side movements that city council had taken the night before and so we're working with the city manager to compare you know the primary issue is around how do we protect a constitutional rights first amendment around political sides that was the main issue so those are the big topics that we've been working on any questions you found out any questions citizens we have any questions thank you thanks for the hard work on this we're looking forward to some of those reports at this point we would have the city at 9.5 as the city attorney's report as i said i'm going to have attorney saltzman here take some time and just introduce himself to everyone we know you from the last time you were here but look to some new folks here and quite a bit of citizens so if you could just take the floor andrew and tell us what you want to tell us thank you mayor council certainly sorry the circumstances said i'm here um i feel terrible to be in this situation i'm happy to help and assist the city anyway i can i have spoken to some of you before i've practiced law in house county for 35 years the last 30 roughly in municipal and labor employment some of the issues that you've talked about signs changes in ordinances and resolutions i'm very familiar with and i've been doing it for a long time i certainly am happy to help any way i can i right now sit as the city attorney for all port so we have similar some similar issues that you all have but i had served for indian rock speech for almost 18 years so i am very familiar with kind of the issues that you have and i'm happy to help you as a city attorney andrew i just want to thank you thank you already when i saw you tonight but i mean i i think i can speak on behalf of whole counsel of our citizens this was a unforeseen tragic circumstance here and i'm just so glad that you're able to do this on short notice you have for the folks who don't know andrews he has an incredible background um so i'm going to do just fine over here and really appreciate you then thank you that you're here for very impressive resume okay thank you now city manager what is the first month of our kind of paper report that we started uh just highlighting it uh the drainage project we're in the final design review for 12th and 13th street uh the audio visual uh changeout started today that's why you see all these lists and stuff floating around city hall so they've started that project it'll get done during the month of february uh we received the designs back for 16 city hall and 7th street the boat ramp there were a couple things that the engineer missed on the boat ramp so we sent that back to him to update that and get it corrected uh we submitted a hazard mitigation grant that's not on here for the generator uh we asked for 180 000 of the 240 we expect pills county we ranked eight out of 12 projects but we've hopefully we'll get some tier two funding so that could help us out with the generator and not cost us as much uh to kind of uh the sign i've heard so much about it and there's been a lot of misrepresented prices and this that floated around i'm happy to tell you that the city actually only spent a thousand dollars for the sign we got thirty four thousand dollars back from the insurance uh we had a new discussion of the adjuster and he's already paid us we were paid uh thirty thirty thousand two hundred and eighty nine dollars and thirty cents uh and then we got four thousand and forty dollars previously so the sign ended up costing us a thousand dollars our insurance covered it and our deductible was a thousand so it worked out great for receiving uh i'm just gonna interrupt you for a second i don't know what you did or what you said to him but that's absolutely outstanding i mean we were talking about getting 5 000 or 10 000 back you basically got to pay for almost the whole thing excellent whatever you did excellent he negotiated well he negotiated well so yes and i will say we've had a lot of positive uh comments about the sign and i think we've toned the lighting down i hope most of the residents resident's satisfaction and uh so actually another city has contacted me to ask you about our sign so that's where we're at with the sign has our insurance premiums going up since we've had insurance and justin go after that money uh it may go up minorly but it's going to go up i mean we have lawsuits and things like that it's a little there too so it's it's negligible i think in the scheme of things i'm just saying i mean my experience is when you get insurance adjusters in there yeah you do get the windfall you pay it back over the years not at this point but we haven't had any claims for years either so that's positive for the city we haven't had clients for years so and that's all i have counseling and questions on the seventh street boat range um you said they had to back out for um there was an engineering problem they missed some stuff is there gonna be a total project with the dock put back in with that boat ramp was that going to be bid separately that's done separately there there's we've got funding in the budget for a new dock the boat ramp and the sea wall are separate and uh really the issue was he didn't extend it far enough out the water because he uh didn't realize it went as far out as he we know it goes can we not do a combined bit on that it's really two different really two two different types of contractors and i think we'd be better served if we went to a dock person specifically and go to a seat ball specifically does the person who's designing the ramp need to know what we ultimately desire for the dock so that it's coordinated you don't want to build the concrete ramp and do the changes and then find out you know oops we could have done such and such and made it better or better designed well the the dot dot person really see what's going to be uh final in the front new cap and the boat ramp where it's at now it's going to stay we're just asking them to take all the broken concrete out and put a new ramp here so the dot design actually shouldn't happen until after that's finished to make sure that you know it's set out far enough because it is going to go between 12 and 18 inches further out than it is currently because of the seawall replacement do you have any target dates for both projects at this point well we're as i said on the report we're going to get the bid out the first part of march for the seawall and shortly after that we can go go ahead and talk to the dock builders at the same time so i don't think it's been a delay of much over april and may and delays i think that was your original estimate again what i've been getting feedback from residents about political signs appearing on accounting property manager uh yeah i've got a couple and what they're talking about is the signs on the storm water pond across the street our ordinance does state that any sign it doesn't matter what it is political temporary or permanent is not to be placed on public property so you know i guess what i would ask is the candidates that have them there to stay within the code if they just put on private property that's that's you know that that's in the code it says any sign and i i don't want to pick up signs i just rather ask anyone that's got a sign to deploy on private property i guess so great job on the side i'm blown away i can't believe we got that signed for a grant great job thank you very much what else citizens we have any comments hey lynn thank you howdy gentry city clerk report item seven again my projects are not as exciting as city managers but right now i'm working on the municipal election documents scanning them and converting them and finding them digitally and then going through [Music] our last ordinances that were passed by council and codifying them to include them in the code and as far as public records at the time of this report i just have one outstanding citizens i thank you and i'll echo what said in terms of the election i know you know it comes around but there's a lot of extra work associated with it and you seem to knock it out as fast as it comes in so thank you all right now we have the consent agenda we have items 8 9 10 11 and 12. i'm going to read them all we'll make a motion in a second and we'll pass it all as one unit there will not be any discussion there will not be any citizen comments on it because it's consent agenda so item eight is approval of january 3rd 2022 city council meeting minutes out of nine is approval of january 18 2022 city council work session minutes item 10 approval of city attorney monthly invoice for legal services item 11 city council acceptance of city attorney fred riley's resignation and item 12 authorized city manager to advertise for legal services for the city attorney but have a motion second second by glenn you're done again there's no discussion on this so at this point okay so the procedure would have been to take this out of the consent agenda we could have moved it back when we put the agenda can i ask what the error is that framed voting twice patty let me ask you this i i i don't want to have inaudible as you said i can't hear councilman baker very well so page three page three he's he has him voting twice on an issue oh okay yes that's just the script nursing you can correct that on the after we approve this and yes i will does anyone on council have an objection to that correction so the governments are accurate i'd like clarification on which way he voted which frank january third page three go ahead and tell us exactly the broadband issue is motion the table for discussion of the resolution that the next city councilwork session and i opposed i remember you that you did do that but patty will double check it before starting okay so with that correction does anybody have an objection as corrected okay so then we have item 8 9 10 11 and 12 item 8 will be corrected as as you just said council member from banker is presently shown on page three in favor of the motion to table he should be opposed patty gentry will double check this back to the original tapes and if frank is correct which i believe he is he'll make that correction then with our approval correct okay so then all in favor aye aye is anyone opposed six to zero consent agenda passes with that one change okay we moved to the regular agenda item 13 to authorize the mayor to execute an agreement for interim legal services for the city attorney so mr salesman here will be able to continue and be paid which i think is kind of important he's nodding yet do we have a motion promotion mentioned by frank van gaard second second i'm talking about dave gatt his friend came before speaks for itself we need an attorney yes it comes with a higher qualified resume it absolutely comes with a quality highly qualified resume so yes anyone else on council citizens any comments back to council and frank you'll get the last word okay so what we have on the table right now is to authorize the mayor to execute an agreement for interim legal services for the city attorney for mr salesman here i'm all in favor hi hi anyone opposed six to zero i will sign that this evening before we leave item 14 is unfinished business is there any i'm hearing none move to city council comments this is an even month so we begin with [Music] uh just to compliment patty as the citizen did you do an excellent job you're underpaid mind you we are we are blessed to have you thank you frankie glenn just to recap on the significance of this electronic signal our old monument sign blows down and we've got to replace it with a lot of recommendations on how to do this thing the communications committee gives a recommendation we go out for a bid and we get bid back for 55 000 and although all of the council members unanimously like the product we all believe that it's priced a little too high so we send it back to the drawing board and we get a scaled down version for 35 000 never 65 000 as information has it out on the street never was that number ever consumed 65 000 debate comes back with for 35 000 with essentially all the elements that we liked on the original sign at the time that we were discussing the new price of 35 000 product we're getting some initial feedback from the insurance companies that we might get somewhere between 11 to 14 thousand dollars or the sign that moved down and while we go through the pros of trying to decide whether or not we want an electronic sign we received an insurance check for four thousand dollars and later on as this electronic sign debacle progresses we begin to think that we may not get any more than four thousand dollars well we send back our city manager to renegotiate an insurance center and he comes back with an additional thirty thousand dollars on this electronic sign the city ends up paying one thousand dollars for state-of-the-art technology and a aesthetically pleasing sign that basically we've got other cities asking us about right now and basically falls into the vision that this council had the vision the wisdom and the courage to vote so i would like to not only express my codes to kudos to city manager lynn reeves but all the council members who have the courage and wisdom to move forward okay i've got something i'm going to pass out everyone just so that you can read along with thank you so so all right i included a letter that was sent off to a senator and a representative and was carbon copied to other elected officials in our state asking that uh that they created a bill that in my opinion is pretty much an encroachment on our home rule i don't want to blast anyone for trying or anything like that but the purpose of this is just to make everyone aware that we need to be careful about what we're asking for so i'm just going to read this to you and i've given everyone to hear copy home rule is the authority of a local government to prevent state government intervention with its operations i'm going to caution all members of this council to carefully consider the possible repercussions of any request for new state regulations before asking for state intervention please ask yourself the following will this regulation have an impact on our homework will this regulation affect our city today could there be a circumstance in the future where we would no longer want this type of regulation if created and passed this particular request would impact our home rule further it could plant seeds for heavier regulation than the author originally intended everyone in this room has the freedom to make these requests before considering state regulation i ask that each of you consider every possible outcome not just what you intended you may get way more than expected please do whatever you can to protect our home thank you very much all right thank you dude um so i'm gonna i didn't have any comments but after that comment i'm gonna actually say something and add to it because i think it's important that you understand the full idea behind home rule home rule is local government making the rules for its locality it's generally the thought that people up here are in the best position to make the best choices for valor beach because you elected us we represent you you don't want someone from tallahassee doing that with that said we're under assault from tallahassee i've previously spoken out about tallahassee he's trying to ram down um short-term rentals down our throat we don't wanna but there's representatives every year they're doing it right now trying to ram that stuff down um so when i i'm not the person who reached out but i will say that the person who reached out reached out over the issue of shade on the beach now home rule is a great thing when it's exercised properly but when it's abused then tallahassee steps in it takes away your ability to regulate yourself when you're going to trample someone's constitutional right and medical right to make a decision as to whether they protect themselves from skin cancer then yes you're going to get tallahassee involvement frank banker you're the person who did this and by the way okay uh well i'll see if we can if the count it's only 6 30. i'll see if the council will open this up to a little discussion here but frank bancard did it and i want you to know that three months before that june van scoe did it she lobbied in pacific didn't get anywhere was it maybe if it was short-term reckless he would have done something for us but um we tried folks okay if you're going to abuse your power your power will be taken away so home rule is not to be protected at all costs it's to be used and used wisely and so that's what mr banker did that's what june van scoye did it's part of your right to lobby your elected representatives right now it's legislative week up in tallahassee the um the suncoast league cities which i'm a member sends a group every year to lobby the legislators for all the points of interest that we have so unfortunately this didn't make the cut for bills this year but it will be tried again and again and again because no one in florida should ever be forced to suffer in the sun without protection it's your choice you make the call not some guy who sit in a five billion dollar mansion with that my comments conclude however um frank you i understand you might want to speak it's up to the council we have to dispense with the rules it's only 8 40. i have no problem having a brief discussion if you want to rebut this but if they don't give us the okay then this meeting is going to come to an end so we wish to dispense with the rule and have a brief discussion here all in favor aye i got two in favor of three in favor anybody who's against i'm against one two i have two against how many of four two and we're going to keep this brief okay yeah um i received uh two state senator state rep is trying to get a bill passed uh for cigarette they want to try paraphrases as quick as i can they're concerned about a lot of cigarette butts that are on the beach they're considered cigarette butts are one of the most hazard or bacteria trash items that are on the beach so you have a senator and a state rep that's very concerned about people safety kids picking up cigarette butts so i wrote to him i said hey i think it's a great idea and i got this i got the email to my city account all right so i wrote back and i said right now we're being under attack because we can't put up shade i consider florida one of the highest probability for skin cancers that you can get because we are the sunshine state so i said why don't we look at creating a bill that would prohibit towns from prohibiting putting up a beach umbrellas on the sand now i am really sorry mr gaddis that i offended you by doing that right but you're the guy that promoted a resolution after people stood there and cried this is a personal attack [Music] one of our councilmen presented a resolution okay that when women were up here almost crying for help okay and we said no we don't want to get involved in a lawsuit okay that would protect your yourselves your kids your grandkids all right and we probably would have this whole shade thing resolved by now but this council didn't this council decided to promote a sign okay whoa great you look like a car wash out front but when it came to your safety and your health all right they burned it down that's right it's funny we talk about this i i just have as i'm looking over to frank to talk to him about point of order i don't think you can get this victor this is the cover of our book it's taken from our city services it's from our city website umbrellas they're legal in bellar beach folks we protect you here but um some people don't do that so if that means you lose your home world power then it means that and if we can succeed the legislative way that's fine we're going to try and succeed the legal way because people don't want to talk they've had five opportunities they can talk to me anytime they want they've got my personal cell phone so they can call but they don't we almost had a solution in the summer two of our residents tanked that our residents tanked it by putting up signs all over the city they ruined it for you you would probably have this settled last summer we're moving forward depositions start next twenty first apply at the same time city council any other comments anyone want to be heard okay okay can i guess i don't understand the point of this what was the point of bringing this up i think banker emailing our elected officials with the concern is valid i don't see this doing anything home rule this isn't talking about sign ordinances is it talking about other legal momojo's is talking about a health crisis and being a physician being a surgeon who has done wide local excisions and removed big chunks of people muscle tissue bone for melanoma i can certainly be in support of shade because like it says in his email children my children's age right now having too much sun exposure they'll be almost guaranteed to have skin cancer by the time they're young adults so i don't really see this as sufficient justifiable something to bring up at a meeting i don't know if you're just trying to make yourself look good i don't know what this is i i don't understand the point of this so i applaud you for trying to bring up a health crisis that could be happening on our our shores and um yeah i think this i don't understand i'd like to be part of it yeah this is going exactly where i figured it would go but nobody is arguing the health benefits of this thing dr google nobody has ever argued this thing but nobody has ever argued the health positives or negatives of this aspect it has always been an issue about how best to address it and who is best at addressing it and how we go about it and you know we started down one path as a consensus of the council which was directing our city manager to negotiate and work with her that before tonight who came back negotiating the digital sign and walked away with us sitting up in the plus column it's always a bit about how we do it how's the best way to do it it's never been about who's who's against skin cancer or who's foreign it's always been about what's the best way to solve this problem what the hell what the email was about kids people getting skin cancer it's a pretty known fact five bad sunburn i think that's your total parents and that's what i'm saying hey look i have a lot of respect for a city manager i think he does a great job but he did say an insurance adjuster got involved okay to get us to 35 everyone needs to go home tonight okay and try to get your your homeowners insurance that nobody wants the right policies down here because the home because the insurance adjusters have ruined this state by replacing roofs that don't need them etc etc etc that's why your insurance rates have gone through so so um i want to address something glenn dunn said negotiation is wonderful i do it all the time it takes two people to negotiate and when you send a team of people not just the city manager you yourself went virtually across the street along with me along with jody shirley we all spoke on our individual topics and spoke very nicely there's copious notes in the minutes of bellar shore for july 21st 2020. it's online you can go read it and it was a very accurate transcription um and when we got done with that they not only voted to uphold the law of banning our umbrellas they said and i'll quote council member steve bloom said you wanted they wanted to talk with bellar beach and he said well i'll listen but i'm not changing my mind i have the tape folks okay now on top of that okay the council did send the city manager over and perhaps you forgot the memo that i read into the record how the city manager went one week earlier and said he was going to held bellaire short said that they could make laws right up to the water which is legally incorrect and call the people who were complaining about it rabble rousers that was not written by us folks that was written by their city clerk to their mayor and they had no idea that it would ever be discovered in litigation that is not negotiating for us that is negotiating against us eller shore was given by me and i'm looking at deborah mall and rick shock each of us said letters they had upwards of a well a month but they actually had two months to come back amicably and do something about this ordinance they did nothing then on september 28th i sued them and they still have done nothing so what you may have heard there are standoffs there's no standoff i've got an expert report that just says what robin aki just said about the dangers of skin cancer they produce no expert we go to depositions at the end of the month this case is moving forward to trial i'm going to get your umbrellas back okay they can negotiate anytime they want they can negotiate with anyone they want negotiations in a lawsuit are privileged you can't use them as evidence in court of law so the law encourages negotiation i've tried five times i'm not going to keep asking them the next loop is theirs if they want to negotiate but i am moving forward and the case is headed right now right where i wanted to be going if they want to change their minds change it it's not just about umbrellas by the way folks it's about bicycles on the beach it's about parking lot abuse it's about food on the beach it's outreach and fiduciary duty this is no longer one issue they were warned if we went in we go in on all the issues we have i believe a 12 or 13 count lawsuit not one county it's not just umbrellas anymore and there's two years worth of damages for 43 people assumed to be 45 people that's all i want to say anyone else i'm sorry the whole point of the letter was to warn everyone be careful what you ask for it doesn't matter what you ask for it's about the way that you go about doing it and what the outcomes are has nothing to do with your lawsuit has nothing to do with skin cancer has nothing to do with frank baker's intentions what it is about what it is about is anyway the whole point is is that we're worried about home rule and every time that a letter is fired off to congress we something could be changed because you're mad at another town and the outcome may not only be smacking us but every city in the state of florida and that's what i'm asking that's what i'm asking you to stop and think about before you get on your keyboard and start sending emails out to everybody asking for the state of florida to step in and control us and everyone around us because we do not want that that's all i have to say there was no place in my email asking the state to control everything my thing was if the states aren't concerned about cigarette much i'm not saying they shouldn't be all right why aren't why doesn't the state get involved people kids the elderly myself my grandkids okay being exposed to the harmful rays of the sun by a town that we can't control in our home rule okay establishing we're not establishing the beach and that's all i was saying this council did not do its job by protecting the citizens from 20th street south all right i'm not saying all the people [Music] any other comments i know it's funny right blind skin cancer is a funny topic so you can't break into the comments if we're having a discussion but then you can make you'll be first up to make that motion to a journey we're not by the way our and uh so i'm not going to find your point order valid i'll tell you why our rules say that you're not supposed to be making any noises or comments or disruptions why another person is talking i don't believe anything i said is funny but if skin cancer is funny to you by all means the red the export expert report was filed yesterday afternoon and read it and learned how funny it really is or maybe have a little sidebar with robin any other council comments okay now leslie motion to adjourn second zero good night everyone"
