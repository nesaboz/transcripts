allegiance council member robin ockey here councilmember frank banker council member glenn gunn council member leslie otero council member rita swope here vice mayor dave gaddis mayor joseph manzo yeah city manager lynn reeves yeah and city attorney fred riley thank you first item on the agenda tonight is the approval of the agenda we'll have a motion i got a tie here i'd like to move to the regular i have one brief addition to that number eight or nine i'd like to move to a work session i believe there's a lot of discussion to be done on the date and some discussion on item nine i'll entertain a motion if anyone else feels that way if not it's going to be a long night i promise you emotion approval of the agenda all in favor all right anyone opposed i'll be opposed so it's seven six two one and patty um well okay in the minutes we are not showing the descending votes that was my problem with them so this is a six to one and it should reflect who's dissenting that's not a new

address also you have uh three minutes if you need more time then you need somebody to give you some more time you can get up to 12 minutes and people give it to you anything that's on the agenda we're going to have time for citizen comments for each one of those items so don't come up and speak on that or we have to ask you to come out you know come back later but if it's something not on the agenda you wish to speak with us on please come right up here okay anyone like to speak to the council yes good evening my name is jolie rodero and i live on 113 12th street and i'll have i think my husband's three minutes and barry grace three minutes to help me out if i should meet them hang on one second mr barrow is that acceptable three minutes from two individuals so we have nine minutes okay uh good evening i have uh two um primary issues i'd like to just bring to your attention my first one is the parking situation at the axis of lots and if we can remember and think back um those lots are lots 21 43 and 66 which is the 12th street the 19th and i think the 6th street lot in reading the bellashore ordinance this is barely ashore not our ordinance it states that only and only bellar beach can issue parking permits for those access blocks and this is a set ordinance 30-57 in belgium has now been in the habit for the last two three months now of issuing their own letter or quasi parking permit for whatever cars that they feel they want to allow to park on those lots this is a false permit in violation of their own ordinance further ordnance 46 139 3 says that there will not be any recreational or commercial vehicles in those access slots well again failure shore is allowing commercial uh park vehicles to park in those lots more specifically uh trucks and vans and forklifts and the construction on the 12th street home of the rodriguez house on the corner as well as commissioner bloom's landscaper can park inside the access law and his own mechanical business trucks are allowed to park in the lot so now there's a second ordinance that barely sure is violating and the reason my husband and i purchased here instead of indian rocks or a day excuse me madera or anywhere else was that we could walk right across the street and we have our beach right there i won't go into the rest of the ordinance because right now my concern is this parking situation but it is the driving force for us for our property values and for our property rights per the interlocal agreement failure beach is responsible i believe for all the wear and tear any repairs any maintenance of the parking lot the sand dunes the rails etc yet commercial trucks parking in these lots cause extra wear and tear on these lots can cause more damage and yet who will be responsible for those repairs we will what is being done to address this issue and this i asked the council members because obviously we i can't do anything but something needs to be done a few weeks ago the pinellas film company obtained permission from belly ashore to park close to 50 60 cars in lots 43 and 66 practically doing 66 completely and half of the 43 they parked vans and cars and trucks to film a private home again illegal parking permits by failure shore were issued the sheriff did absolutely nothing even though they were called and barrier beach failed to take any active control of the situation the final issue with the parking lot is liability it is my understanding that recently bellaire beach insurance company settled a slip and fall that happened at one of the access lots that means that any injuries that occur there is our responsibility where they're going to look to us to sue us any car that gets damaged a wall that gets broken or a child that runs in front of a commercial truck and gets run over because they can't be seen again parking permits by better sure will be meaningless because the person the entity and responsible for that liability will be bailar beach again something must be done that is my primary concern the other concern is the sheriff's relationship which i think deborah mall spoke to last meeting the relationship between the sheriff bellaire beach and failure short in the sense of our mutual law enforcement i would like to request a copy and please let me know how who to address my request to of that excuse me that agreement that indicates what are the percentages between bellair shore beller beach and the sheriff just to see how they compare in the sense of use and payment um i'm personally disappointed with the sheriff's office for selective enforcement i listened to the baylor shore meetings and on two separate occasions i heard regina kardash their legal counsel the one that helped write the ordinance tell them that the ordinance applied to the entire beach their property and below the mean high water line and that if it wasn't like that it would be an an equal protection plan well the sheriff's department is not choosing to enforce that the property that belongs to the homeowners it can be used at will with anything but the rest of the residents which of course it's us are harassed as a resident of bellaire beach i expect this council to act to preserve my property rights and my privileges so i would ask how are you doing this and specifically in the parking situation at this time thank you thank you can we talk back we typically don't we can do it at the end it must cancel which is to address it i mean this council have a problem with [Music] if she would like to make a public reference yes [Music] which i think we should but anyway just going back to what you were saying what is the my question is what is the rule of law on parking in their local agreements okay um i really would like to know that because last night just last night there were three illegal cars parked between six o'clock and seven o'clock at calls and we walk the beach all the time and i think you can leave right now and find at least three illegal cars parking those three lots okay commercial parking the gross weight of these vehicles are five times sometimes more than cars they do tear up the lots okay who repairs them us where do we get the money to repair we used to get the money from tickets and residents of course but we stopped ticketing not correct anything i'm saying please somebody here okay i can say a lot i'm just gonna i'm just gonna watch this council member baker i'd like to go ahead and pop in on a couple of those things um since the property is owned by belarus they direct the sheriff's department and as far as the interlocal agreement it always spelled out in there and i'm not even sure why the issue permits to begin with on their own property but as far as you know the vehicles being parked in there that is totally up to the sheriff's department to take it down that we don't have any control it's not our city i mean i'm not even sure why we're discussing that or sure to begin with but as far as some of these commercial vehicles i bought the town of bellar shore for allowing the pinellas county film festival in there as because it also involved the nfl life dspny cruz because it was for tom brady a super bowl champion of this state i mean what community would not have allowed that i mean tom brady and charles woodson was both there so i really encourage people to get some background information before they start saying something does want build your the city that says tom brady and his crew are not allowed i mean seriously the wine's being drawn so ridiculously anymore it's just crazy yeah i agree there's cars parked in there with no stickers on them and some of them are even the battery to residents that park next they don't want to come up here and while they're getting a sticker i get that and i know you can leave right now and go and find some of their hearts is there that way all the time i mean that we also have to be neighborly we've got to respect our other communities so i mean i'm just i'm appalled that the whole pinellas county feeling thing was even brought up tonight [Music] hang on hang on hang on council has to think and speak let's let council speak i will call for more citizens to speak up okay but mr dara you go you got nine minutes and that's it it's not back and forth so actually this is rare what we're doing what was kind of a special thing i'm back opening council i'm just running the discussion we're going we're going back and i'm talking about commercial work i'm not talking about the film fest or whatever it was done i'm talking about daily parking and sixth street and closely right i mean it's clean and cut so if anybody gets injured or responsible the share your question on the sheriff everything should be time recorded with them so it shouldn't be hard to find out if there's truly spending 15 minutes to shift i believe their shifts are 12 hours i might be wrong there's two of them there right now i could answer that um in the ordinance who would be brought up about them controlling the whole beach to the water i refer to the state constitution article 10 section 11. i refer to the public trust doctor all right clearly says that land is owned by the state which we are part of the city i hope i answer your questions thank you to respond to part of what rita said to me and maybe i'm black and white i guess but if an ordinance says you are not allowed to park there that you are not allowed to give an order or a parking sticker i don't care if it's tom brady joe biden donald trump or me tom brady yes he's a great football player but you know what i'm a doctor i say a lot it's how he lies as he said so maybe i should have a film about me and how awesome i am i'm gonna build my video trucks there because i'm sure everybody would love to see that video but you get the point he's known better than i am he's no better than anybody i don't care who it is rules are rules tom ruggy breaks a rule if he goes and murders somebody he should get arrested if he he should get a traffic ticket so i don't care who filmed it i think that's ridiculous second of all you know i saw these parking lots filled and i you know emailed lynn and i was like what the heck is going on so yes i think the city does need to sit here and say what is allowed and what's not allowed and stand by it we can't do hear the rules but if tommy boy comes over he wants to film something it's okay because it's tom no it's i don't care if you're bella beach i don't care if your dollar is short everybody follows the rules again i mean this is like going back to middle school there's no teacher's pet there's no bully we all just follow the rules so i don't know as a city how we can make that happen other than here's an ordinance follow the rules and if i'm not mistaken there's already an ordinance so why aren't we following the rules [Music] i think if you go back and look at the state constitution it talks about access for the public and i think one of the good things that's going to come out of it all of the litigation that's going on is we're trying to get some detailed interpretations of how this is all supposed to be interpreting the unfortunate part of this is we're asking questions we may not want to hear the answers but we're going to get a definitive answer for this and rather than go back and forth with this is my interpretation i've read my lawyer doctor mr dr google is your favorite i think dr doom you know i think it's going to be resolved so let's see what happens i think we'll just sit back waiting for the legal john hansen john hanson 22nd street i was actually not going to say anything tonight but this discussion just kind of set me off so i want to dovetail on some comments that have been made regarding the parking we have ordinances there are signs clearly posted at these parking lots that tell you who is authorized to park there and what's required and again to quote a council person is black and white bellaire beach residents decal required now if i was law enforcement there's no interpretation it's black and white and you don't spend your time perusing the beach to find a violator you see a vehicle that doesn't have a decal you write a ticket sorry about that pay to find spend five bucks or whatever for the decal if you're a resident of bel air beach it's cut and dry rules are rules you can interpret gray into some of them others it's black and white discretion there are time there are times and situations for it but when it tells you plain as day what is what isn't it is not open for interpretation or discretion and you take an oath to uphold that i certainly did for 24 years thank you thank you mr hansig gentlemen back blue shirt good evening my name is richard hagerty 1199th street my wife and i have only lived here for just over a year so i'm relatively new to the area i was retired after 30 years of service in the army and took a job after retirement so that my wife and i could afford to live in a an area as pristine with private beaches like bel air beach and that was a choice that we made several months ago when my wife and i were approached by a sheriff because of we had an umbrella on the beach and i'll say that the sheriff was completely professional about it we had a great conversation i was very taken aback that there is actually an ordinance in the state of florida preventing an umbrella so that set me on a course of study and i've read deeds in our local agreements minutes from previous sessions florida statutes municipal codes talked to council members lawyers and i don't claim to be an expert in any of that so i don't know what will come out but a comment that you made ma'am with all due respect about be neighborly in all of my albeit short investigation i still can't find a single instance where belair shore is being neighborly back i see situations where our parking at least my interpretation of it seems to be taken advantage of i see situations where my health and my happiness is being exchanged by elitists who don't want to ruin their view and i see a whole host of other areas so i don't quite see where the neighborly is coming in and although i'm not a lawyer having spent 30 years in a lot of countries in the middle of a lot of conflicts i think i am an expert when i tell you i know exactly what it looks like when the big guy picks on the little guy and i know that in every country and in every culture that doesn't stop until the little guy makes a stand and i do mean the pun draws a line in the sink so i know speaking for myself i didn't spend 30 years fighting tyranny so that i can be bullied by a bunch of elitists who don't want to ruin their view of the beach and i'm deeply troubled by all of these situations that i seem to have found myself in when we moved here we're also building a house right down the street in bel air beach so we intended on spending all of our golden years which is why i'm here and which is why i'm always going to be vocal on this issue i'll continue reading i'll continue getting myself educated i'll continue to fight because in this case again i don't see where the neighborly is coming in and if i'm wrong then i'm wrong and um thank you for your time thank you for your service to this country so following along with what's been happening with bel air shore when he's building his house he should be able to park as many construction vans in the parking lot so that's good news for you right i'm just saying black white sorry citizens jim fans voice setting street first of all the last time i checked everyone that was on this board was voted on by the citizens of this city not that they're short and we should you should be doing everything you can to back these citizens not those citizens upholding our laws our rights not other cities rights okay second of all commercial vehicles i don't know if you know anything about construction but i know the city manager does anytime you take a vehicle with any amount of weight when they go to gross vehicle weight okay the stress of asphalt there's a different grades in a parking lot that are applied those parking lots are not set up for commercial vehicles there has been damage already done in the corner of i believe that is 12th street parking lot at this end okay whether or not it was done by these vehicles i don't know but there has been damage done but those those parking lots are not made for commercial vehicles at all second of all we had a cancer patient asked for a temporary temporary pass to park there and they were turned down but yet we can turn star struck fans parking lots open for them i mean come on a cancer patient doesn't have any more rights than some some superpower star he could he could actually have a limo take him down and drop him off he's a multi-millionaire why are we granting those kinds of things third of all the city manager offered that same group parking here for a fee and it took revenue away from this city i don't know if you council members are aware of that he did try to talk to them about that so we have lost revenue on it that's 30 vehicles three days think about what we charge to park how much money we've missed out on the city but yet we took on the live building in those parking lots for those vehicles worst worst thing we ever did was sign that inner local agreement thank you thank you yeah um i agree with you we do need to look in our local agreement and maybe just go ahead and give our 60 days and back out of it we are granted access not ownership to that property so i mean i hear so many people complaining about the internal agreement so maybe that's what we should think about doing as a city is just putting in our 60 days we don't have to give them any reason they have the same right as we do and i do realize that we're all up here because of citizens and i also understand that you know everything should be black and white but yet when the previous parking record was holding against they wanted to open up parking and they did on the first private streets we had the parking ordinance nobody cared about that parking audience at the time we didn't lose any revenue because it wasn't our event over there that happened it was there again so we lost no revenue yes the city major offered a more parking lot but it was their event so i mean i don't know why we keep having to talk about the time about our shore and being they really involves really different things i mean but you guys are sitting here and you're talking about you going out of the international agreement i understand people are tired of this breaking the beach well we can quit ringing the beach cancel the interlocal agreement people are concerned about the sheriff's sheriff's service we can cancel that our budget will go up 36 000 a year for the sheriff's department so i mean what are you guys looking for you're looking for our expenses to continue to increase for better beach residents not having any parking on their own i mean all we're granted is access we're upgraded if we cancel that arrow but we're not regulating parking does everybody totally understand that i am looking out for the belt of each residence but it's just getting to the point where you guys are lying so much and you don't realize that there is a downfall to all of that i mean you're asking for more than i think you're going to ever realize that you're going to get it we keep going down this path i'd like to make a correction also um we did not welcome a film crew with open arms um they came they asked they went elsewhere um we did not give information that that was we didn't do that so to say that this council is welcoming people in with open arms is totally wrong very much incorrect um if we cancel do you think this is a question for the solicitor we cancel the interlocal agreement does it take us back to the currently pronounced from 1944 up to 1970 because that's a conveyance that was given to us those three lives and the way i read it is forever the second part is it's more like a trust in florida as a trustee you cannot make a dime as being trustee it's a written statute it's clean and cut so we're canceling this interlocal reagan dentist is can you comment on that uh the first comment i'll make is i'm the city attorney and i'm licensed in florida as a florida attorney i'm also an english solicitor so i'm glad you're meeting from the queen i'm glad [Music] i'm glad to bring that up but it's not relevant but you can call me that if you want i want to address a number of things that have been said i've been waiting patiently [Music] for the opportunity to do this the council needs the opportunity to hear from the citizens and also to just discuss things amongst themselves and to answer try to answer some of the questions the things i want to tell you is uh are facts based and they're in some ways you'll probably conclude these are superficial comments they're not they're the initial things that are fact-based that everybody in the room needs to knows before you sort into considering other things several facts there are a couple deeds and the deeds create a trust relationship and the deeds are very lengthy they're also written decades ago and the interpretation of the deeds is of course a question at this point in time the deeds in in simplistic terms create a trust relationship for the benefit of the citizens of bel air beach with respect to the beach access lots so that that's the foundation of everything in addition to that there are is a interlocal agreement that i have certainly read although it's been several actually several weeks ago since i last looked at it the interlocal agreement is i want to say it's about 20 years old somewhere in that neighborhood so it's it's not a recent thing i don't think anybody on this council had anything to do with that interlocal agreement like any interlocal agreement between two municipalities it can be terminated it can also be amended so if there's a the other party's willing this city can always initiate the process to try and amend it in some way if that's desirable having said those two foundational points there are also city code provisions in bel air beach and city code provisions in bellair shore that relate to the access lots the lady that spoke and i is your name mrs romero [Music] okay you you mentioned that the specific statute sections i i don't have that in front of me although uh several probably two months ago i did look at those i pulled up the bel air shore code ordinances and read those specific code provisions and if belair sure is not complying with their code provisions then bellair sure is the one that has jurisdiction over their code provisions and if you feel that they're not in compliance then i i would recommend to you that that be the starting point with is is contacting belarus shore to ask why they are not complying with their own code provisions so that that's another thing that i would say is a you know factual thing it's important to delineate the who has jurisdiction uh the city of bel air beach uh arguably uh and i will say very much arguably does not have jurisdiction unless it's a component of the interlocal agreement to demand that they better sure follow their own code provisions so that i would recommend you consider that i am also aware of a lawsuit that is has been filed it's the lawsuit initially related to the umbrella ordinance that the city of bel air sure enacted and that ordinance was has been was was challenged by citizens of bel air beach and i'm aware of the lawsuit i the the city of belair beach has not is not a party to that lawsuit as of this moment in time and the citizens who brought the lawsuit are litigating that and other than knowing that it exists and knowing that it's being litigated i'm i'm really not that dialed in to all the specifics of that case and i the appropriate answer for me to say is i'm aware it exists i don't know that much about it and i hope the court system or the judge that has that case ultimately reaches a resolution which is consistent with the law several people mention the rule of law and that is what should be applied across the board you know if they're they're not complying with the law then you should raise an issue with them about not complying with the law the you know the issue being brought up i'm not sorry it's being brought up i've heard personally about it for weeks that there's a lot of dissension in the community about it i i will say i would fully expect because of the era we live in there's a lot of stuff on social media some of which may be accurate some of which may not be accurate it also causes trouble with the community because it's hard to figure out which what is accurate what isn't but the uh i know this is a hot button issue with many people and uh you know i i hope there is ultimately a resolution of it in the appropriate forum and the resolution is it's reached in the not so distant future how long that takes i have no clue because i'm not really uh privy to the status of the litigation so you know that that's i hope a fact-based explanation of a lot of things if the city council wants to consider you you have another number of things you could consider if you want to consider joining the lawsuit for some reason then city council can consider that if the city council wants to consider either amending or terminating the interlocal agreement that's something that you sure certainly could uh consider no matter what you're going to do is i'm now talking directly to city council the appropriate thing for you to do is be fully informed and have all the cards on the table and the cards on the table are the underlying trust documents the current version of the interlocal agreement the statutes and it would be helpful if you were going to make any decision about joining joining the lawsuit for for you to consider what what the arguments are in the lawsuit so i would suggest that be something that you you consider my job is to try and uh in working with the city manager and working with the city council is to try and shield the city from liability from all sorts of different angles and you know my job is to uh i joke about this with the people the other city that i represent my job has morphed over the time period that i've done this i've been a lawyer for 34 years it is a lot a lot more risk management today than it has ever been that's what a lawyer is trying to do and risk management to me is not getting a city in a lawsuit that will cost the taxpayers a lot of money unless there's a very compelling reason for the city to get into the lawsuit that's a decision that ultimately would need to be made by the city council i suggest is if the city council wants to consider that or consider a modification in some way to the inner local agreement then you have a meeting where all those things have been provided in advance and y'all can discuss it with everybody having being fully informed and having all the relevant information in front of you again cancel the inner local agreement would that still keep those three lots open to us because you said it's a trust so we don't want to lose it applause that's the most important thing um i don't understand how all of a sudden just within the last year or two that we gave up the rights to rank tickets there i was on council then we lost that revenue so again chancellor had interlocal agreement because when you say that we're not part of this lawsuit number four the anti-local agreement says the real property owners are responsible for the damages in the interlocal agreement so he's not going to sue us all individually they're going to see us by the town is that correct or not the the city has an indemnification provision in the inner local agreement and i'm not trying to dodge questions all right i'm trying to be responsive i'm just trying to get educated the best i can to serve these people that elected me or whatever i'm here to serve and i want to do the best interest for everybody including myself so canceling the interlocal agreement what does that mean i would encourage you to cancel it out as a as a reactionary thing i'd encourage you to schedule either a work ideally a workshop session to have in everybody's hands and to review what the interlocal agreement says and then review whether it's time for some kind of modification or change i i don't think it's a good idea for me to give a direct response to what happens if we cancel it i would feel much better giving that response after everybody had it in front of them these are these are very complex issues and there are a lot of fine nuances that unfortunately what happens is we all start studying individually and we all have confirmation bias we latch on to something that kind of confirms our initial impressions or whatever to the exclusion of something else these conveyances easements all of this stuff is very old if you go back and you start looking through some of these things there are some very uh interesting things about 15th street who's allowed to really have access to those properties north of 15th street south of 15th street it talks about property owners it doesn't talk about residents it talks about property owners and the other thing is jurisdictions you know the constitution allows for access but there's some fine lines about jurisdictions and how far out those go it gets very very uh nebulous when you start talking about you know how far out these property owners go out uh you know hey we have a picture of somebody sitting under a tent drinking a beverage well yeah but were they on their property just because they were beyond their sea wall doesn't mean they weren't on their property so i mean there are some very fine jurisdictional distinctions that need to be uh interpreted here so i just want to caution everybody unexpected consequences you start you know knee jerk reacting to some of this stuff but we may end up shooting ourselves in the food on some of this stuff and getting answers back that we really didn't want to hear those answers to things have evolved and i don't think anybody in this room has a solid draft of how all the dots connect here because i mean there's just so many moving parts to this thing a lot of gaps have been filled by tradition ordinance of change and not necessarily address the specifics of the old stuff there so i'm just just saying you know make haste very slowly on this thing because there are some very complex movement parsers and i just want to make sure we understand everything and how it's going to affect us maybe just move slowly let the legal process do it by its course and find out how this thing is really wired together instead of everybody making different assumptions and what applies and what doesn't you know some counseling we're going to back up the floor certainly jesus good evening uh i'm kenneth's tag me i i apologize i lost my voice okay so you will just talk yourself close can they hear can everyone here kind of just say hello hello we're good that's what you want to talk yes sorry about the voice um i have appreciated this minion here on some of the comments some of the discussions one of the things i really want to make sure that we all understand i've been working for the us department of justice for over 20 years i spent 10 years in dc with the main justice and as part of my job up there was to talk about native americans and their natural resources whether they had been neglected whether the uss federal government was supposed to pay them back money i dealt with millions and millions of documents from 18 42 47 you name it historians who went through them so just because we have an interlocal agreement that's 20 years old that is an irrelevant environment completely and same thing with the obvious deeds and other transfers that i've gone through in this one so just because documents are historical doesn't mean they're irrelevant and we need to pay really close attention to the bigger concern is what you're talking about that you have different names for different work or you know descriptions for various things that have evolved over over the years but that is something that can be made black and white it's not such a new on situation here so i just want to make sure that everyone knows that when people talk about the age of documents oh there are so many nuances here however two grass draws away from the mean high water level it's not nuanced this can be resolved and this should be a result we've been here for over 12 years now we've seen this crop up on occasion every four or five years this is when it's actually coming to a head we all have to fight for this a huge part of your property values are tied up on that shore in that sand we paid a lot of money for an extra money when we came down precisely so people walk here and like you were saying gentlemen in the back the beach is our right and it's a huge part of our property value and one last thing when it comes to the separation between bellaire shores and biller beach and the police officers i appreciate them they do a great job they always say hi and if you have problems they come and help out but the way the numbers are working out for baylor shore who supposedly other rich fancy people they should pay more not us and they should not be allowed to um put contractor trucks on our street but we live on 12th street we have granted some of them are you know local contractors not for belair shores but if i spell our store trucks working there someone mentioned something about the uh how they asked for this stuff well they park in the grass the grass is completely destroyed outside my house so i want to close with that thank you very much and let's just fight for this one thank you before i go to council comments somebody has some device that's making tones please turn it off it's very annoying council the other citizens i see no other hands on the close citizen comments at this time item three on the agenda the presentation of the pinellas county sheriff's office is our sheriff here who's going to present good evening to all of those who don't know me i'm sergeant at the palestine sheriff's office um looking at the monthly report off the month of april uh the most recent we have at this time uh there was a only one ucr prime uh that was listed on the report which is a assault it was a minor incident there was no charges pressed in that matter uh most of the activity there were 655 events in the city of baylor beach during the month majority of them were self-initiated by the deputies being direct patrols traffic stops house checks uh vehicles illegally parked with 47 of those and 35 ordinance violations uh we did have six crashes in the city we've seen uptick in crashes in all of our beach communities with the increased traffic we've had over the past few months we've been working on that uh trying to find ways to minimize those as we know as we get more cars we get more crashes unfortunately um we did have a 131 citations in warning issued in the city in the month of april i looked at the reports from the month of may and there's no significant activity in the month of may that you guys need to be concerned about this time okay thank you um congratulations one one incident one assault and that wasn't the arrest that's pretty good yes um you can't get much better so once again next month and

aside let him speak into the mic and then come right back okay perfect name and address and then whatever your question is yeah uh ken blanches i'm on palm drive right around the corner here um just had a question actually they can ask a question to the sheriffs um i appreciate the you know assistance with the traffic control and all that um what we noticed the last couple days we liberated on palm drive so we therefore we just walk across the street to go to the 12th street access and what we found is the traffic control box is right there on the sidewalk and a chair sheriff's vehicle has been parked on the sidewalk so that they can sit inside the vehicle and control the traffic light to control the traffic and it's turning toward clear water but what it does for us is we now have to walk in the street into oncoming traffic to walk around the sheriff's vehicle so i just wanted to bring that point up and um see if that's something that could be addressed thank you sure yes sir as i previously mentioned i worked at night so that i wasn't aware that was occurring um and i went off the last two days so i didn't know where that was occurring um we have been dealing with a traffic issue uh backing up across the causeway i'll always pass the light at main rocks road um you know especially on the weekends i know that we've been working on that uh i don't know why they've been out here running the light i didn't know they were doing that but i will bring that to the attention of my supervisors and the day shift supervisors uh to you know so they can be aware that's an issue okay great citizens any other questions or comments see none counseling afterwards sheriff thank you again yes sir thank you and sheriff did you get some information if you could relay that to our

21-0-2 in order to the city council of the city of delaware beach florida providing for an amendment of chapter 86 signs of the city code of ordinances providing for incorporation and recitals providing for the approval of the amendment to chapter 86 signs of the city code ordinance says providing for a copy to be kept on file fighting for severability providing for the repeal of all ordinances in conflict herewith and providing for an effective date this doesn't say it but patty this is the first reading correct correct okay so this is first reading there needs to be two readings do i have motion moved by going upside down going expected second big gadgets floor is open glendale first sorry i'll defer to the city manager if you want to go right in the case yeah uh fred and i worked on this together and we brought into a court session we had just gotten out of discussion and there's some comments that were made and fred revised those comments at this point other than if there's questions about it to a work session this didn't come back via a work session and i had the most significant amount of comments some of which were integrated into this and some of which were not so we'll take it what is this that's what we want to do page 10 86-61 general provisions this is a sign ordinance and nowhere did i see a definition of what a sign is how do we reconcile that and i'm looking at this by the way in terms of what a constitutional challenge is going to look like so i didn't see a definition of science there's a sign of banner it's a sign of paper sign there's a sign temporarily talk about temporary science but let's sign the next topic will be item one flashing activated signs i don't know what flashing activated sign is because i'm gonna keep going streamers and ribbons page 11 that's no big deal there's just two periods that just should be that's a little tight but we'll just clean it up um i don't ate his historically i debate on page one okay it's 86-61 um you've had a general lack of enforcement of 86 86 61-8 it says any sign placed on public park property except as otherwise provided for when this code may be removed by the city department sometimes it's removed by the city and sometimes it's not we've seen it outside city hall here with election signs i'm not going to name names but some are permitted and some are confiscated leading to uneven enforcement was what somebody was talking about before about equal protection issues if you're going to confiscate signs that confiscate all of them don't confiscate the ones you don't like that has been unequally enforced over the years and i don't like the way this is worded right now i think it should be shout not may if you're going to prevent signs in front of city hall here then you permitted for everyone including the gentleman who i'm looking at the ones that build a pool service and somebody who has a lawyer a lawyer and maybe the hairdresser the name of the construction guy maybe the person's running for political office i'd love to outside in front of city hall can i do not temporary construction signs what's interesting here is that this city um gives more deference to construction people's free speech rights and political free speech rights and i have a real problem with that item 86-63 number one talks about construction and trade signs and then number two says those signs should not exceed 12 square feet okay i'm all right with that because if you look around our town construction people have big signs but then when you go to the very next page when we start talking about the residents and their signs we're not about five feet i didn't realize as a resident my right was you know subordinate construction guy it's nice to know that the guy who installs you know your deck gets to say more than us as elected officials and people trying to help the city work for free so i have a problem with that um 86-64 talks about temporary signs being permitted for a um an event and i said this last time and it didn't get addressed in these changes which is again why this should be done in a work session what if there is no event right now there's a very popular cause called black lives matter it's not an event it's a clause so as jesus saves and has robin's favorite i love my chihuahua okay these are not events they're just statements and yet if i read this there needs to be an event in order to have a sign because our sign ordinance is exclusionary everything is prohibited unless it's permitted and why am i going through all this i'm trying to save you from that constitutional lawsuit that will be coming if you pass this i won't bring it somebody else will we've already had two threats last summer from people um we talk about uh then we go to page 13. and it talks about a temporary sign may display any message so long it is not harmful to minors well maybe you should meet some of the minors that i come in contact with in my practice i don't think there's anything that could harm some of these kids they have stuff that could make what little hair i have left curl but we reference section 847.0116 and that does not match anything that i see that has any reference to uh children in fact eight four one six six says put every act thing or transaction forbidden by the section shall constitute a separate offense and shall be punishable as such i don't know why i'm the only council member who picked this up but i did read this and check it back so it's not ready this ordinance then we talk about what what i read uh i read that yesterday um um i think it's so vague that [Music] but there's no real point of order here you just want to have some dollars okay so we'll pull down the point of order and we'll come back to you next okay um we talk about being one time of n i don't know why one is the right number so why not one might have two one three why up seven one on twenty two and a half i don't know what the right number is but where did we come up with one okay and i'm asking these questions because these are the questions folks if you get sued that attorney is going to be asking you except the stakes or a 1983 suit then we're talking about confiscation of signs here which is abridgement of your first amendment right when we send the city manager out to do that which he's done in the past we had an attorney here who came i think last july and was really nice but was threatening to sue us badly and it would have been ugly because that was his specialty so size and height residents um five foot is our maximum sign and um and we can't have uh including the support it can't be higher than four feet in height it's pretty low some so again more restrictions on residents than on contractors i paid taxes in this city so as everyone else out there i get a bigger sign if anyone gets a big sign um i just spoke about it the removal of unlawful signs we're putting the discretion in the city manager's hands and i will call out mr reese it has been uneven we have had residents complained to me they complained to me when i was campaigning we had residents come in here last year to complain about it we had one resident they pulled the sign out and the guy said i told you pulled it out and i put him too i didn't see him go back out and take it out okay so uneven enforcement is going to get this city in trouble i don't like the idea of confiscating science and i don't like giving that that power to compensate sentence and i did real this detail here as to why it's beneficial but you have to understand the minute you confiscate the sign you cut over free speech right and that's enough to trigger the lawsuit nothing more there's your 1983 suit that's an expensive federal proposition political signs are not defined what is a political side what is it republicans are great republicans aren't great support the congress don't support the cop is that a political sign according to us um it has to be a ballot issue and qualified candidate well what if it's not i just named three things trump 2024 clinton 2024 i'll be equal here okay um they're not candidates right now we had a gentleman in this town i think there's trump 2024 is out right now in our city um we had a gentleman who had trump uh signed two years before trump even ran we had another guy who put banners as if i asked the science to be defined on the back of his house that was so big you probably could have seen him for largo you were just hoping we were going to do something that's what prompted us to say let's hold it off i don't know why it has to be a ballot issue in a qualified candidate i'm not a qualified candidate yet mayor for manzo 2022 why can't i put it on my house mayor banzo for governor how about that i can't put that on my house either you don't have to be a qualified candidate i don't know why we're limited um then we say that they have to be removed within 30 days of the election i don't know why that has to be i know it looks ugly to have your uber humphrey sign up there but you know if you put it out there you can put it out there to your property i don't understand it okay we talk about aesthetic standards of the city so we put a realtor's sign up that's okay but we're political sign on just i don't see how this is constitutional i think that's pretty much most of my key comments we can debate this all night long frank bankert is up next mr van gogh the problem i have with this is every time i get's a part of this process but we went from an eight ordinance to network 15. and all due respect mr mayor if you get done with everything you you're interjecting will probably be 80 pages i'd like to just leave the other one alone and we've got a great city bank that uses discretion that's why are we gone i'm going to go ahead and agree with councilmember banker i don't see any wrong anything wrong with our current one it's warped it's working so i'm totally 100 in agreement i have a question um uh mayor you you have plenty of time to go through this and you know absolutely where the problem is point out uh the shortcomings of our uh our city uh turning uh however i don't know i didn't say that okay well i'd say it's a short time well this is very difficult this is there are a lot of laws in this uh in this particular set of code my question is rather than dragging all this out in the middle of one of these meetings why didn't you just give him a call and oh because glenn dunn said i can't call the city attorney and you all voted for that remember i believe you want to go to public i actually believe you can go through lynn reeves and he will contact the city attorney well if you think i'm gonna explain constitutional law no defense to mr reeves i'm not doing that okay and that's why i ask that this be done at a work session and you all turn that down my thing was move item five eight and nine to the regular agenda not one person's wet with my motion so we debate it in public which is the way florida wants it to be done we air our dirty laundry this was not done to embarrass mr reilly in any way shape or form number one most of the comments that i had put on he had recognized he also if you go in here and i've actually one of the people who've read most i didn't read all the cases most of the cases that he referenced these are 40 30 page 50-page cases from the supreme court they're not all in mock step it would be nice if this law was cleared at the federal level it's not he's done the best i think he can with cobbling it together but i'm telling you and listen to this and cameras make sure you record it okay when you get sued for a 1983 violation whoever the attorney who's handling this will ask every one of these questions in probably about 20 that i didn't because they're gonna know why do you allow a contractor you're talking about aesthetics so i could put jon jones construction in 12 foot letters 12 square feet but i can't put manzo for governor in six square feet that's illegal how is that how is that there's your own constitutionality the way i see it there's your challenge and you're in federal court for two years energy money so that's why it's here anyway mr gaddis and mr governor um based on the city manager's experience what is the reasonable level of specificity what's a reasonable burden that we should have on this i mean we have a very thin staff here we have a city attorney who doesn't staff this out to his constitutional law staff we've got one guy working on this thing so my question is what is a reasonable burden for which we should be doing this this kind of stuff and i'm i'm in favor with frank i'm in favor with rita is you know there's a certain uh we pay this guy to be risk management and if something comes up and we figure out how to deal we may back down entirely which is the way we did it before somebody brought up an issue we backed up said yeah you're probably right i'm gonna go back out we've done a reasonable job trying to answer this thing but we cannot write every ordinance to the detail or specificity for a constitutional defense we don't have a staff we don't have the time and my god we certainly don't have the paper to print this stuff so i guess what i'm saying here is a lot of questions were asked previously the seat turns on back and reworked some of this stuff we've got it and i think we need to move forward seems like we continue to circle the drain on many many issues it keeps going back to committee goes back to work sessions there aren't enough work sessions in the month to discuss how many times these things go back to committee so i think it's time to give it a reasonable effort let's move forward and we'll deal with it on an exception basis rather than trying to cover every constitutional defense i don't think it's necessary um i kind of agree a little bit with everybody i think it seems like to fix a lot of this it would take more paper than we have but some of these seem like they could be easy like the double period maybe a mage shell um and i kind of agree with you with that the construction 12 feet but we're only about five feet to say how much i love my dog um i really love my dogs um so and my my suggestion with that is just split and make everyone hate scorpio regardless of construction or dog loving or political um so some of this i think can be resolved very easily and normally i would agree whole world would bring a but after that one gentleman came up and had the case and was very nice about it i definitely want to patch up any loopholes but honestly i think no matter how long you do this there's always going to be a way so i say we just do some easy fixes like the five feet the 12 feet make it eight for everybody and the double periods and whatnot and keep our fingers crossed and again if a big problem arises we'll just have to back down and fold it and say hey put whatever you want up until we figure this out again and hopefully that won't happen cancel any other questions to the citizens you know this seems to be overkill that we go back to our original one um sign ordinance we've had in fact for a long time and gave a very nice letter to the city saying um how he was partnered in a michigan firm and this was his specialty and he was ready to basically take us in a 1983 student he said you know i don't want to do that to my city i'm going to give you the chance to rectify this and we made a decision as a council you can have your sign back and um we were gonna just temporarily not enforce the sign organs and that's what led to this so the good old days aren't that good because there was problems with that sign ordinance and there still is problems with that sideward so whether we patch it up correct it go with this one it is no matter my comments have been placed on the record i'll stand by every one of those and there's probably ten that i missed but um you know i don't know that pat keeping the old one just saying it's good it's probably not good either that's what got us into this so we actually suspended enforcement of it for a while so i don't know if that's right either um that's why i want this into a work session sometimes you know process is typically work session for this stuff you hash it out you hash it out some more you bring it to council when it's ready to go and to me this one wasn't quite ready to go we could have had a work session last month nobody wanted it so it gets done here tonight so um i'm not going to make a motion if you want to if somebody wants to table it they can table it we can vote it down and then it'll leave us right where we're at um if killed we'll just the city attorney reworked the old one and i'm sure he worked closely with the city manager who's got to enforce it and manage it so what's your level of confidence in how well it's written and are you ready to enforce your city manager i mean is at a reasonable stage here where we can move forward on this thing manager or city attorney i'm not seeing both of them the city attorney amended the original and he's answered a lot of the questions and concerns and we still have those concerns i mean are we at the 90 stage where city manager are you ready to enforce what we need to vote for i'd like to answer your question that i'd like to say a few other things for sterling why don't you go first city manager i have a choice to make and i could i could choose to be limited with the comments i've heard or i could go a different direction and i'm going to go a different direction the different direction is this is exactly the way things should go is y'all should debate various things you have talked about this in a workshop you talked about it in the city commission meeting i will tell you what i've done based on the last feedback i got uh or i received i i went back and listened to the tape and i went through and made the changes that were itemized in the last session that we have i'm not offended by the comments from the city council from anybody and i'm especially not offended by comments from the mayor just so everybody's clear on that the the object is to get it right and i've said this every time it's been discussed that this is a complicated area of the law the as mayor manzo said and he nicked this line off of me as i said it before the court cases are not consistent in both the supreme court and the other appellate levels and trying to sift through and figure out the answers is is a challenging thing having said that i did the absolute best i could based on first the initial ordinance that you had in place and then i brought in various other aspects of the organ the current ordinance that you have the things i added were not whimsical on my part the things i added were very deliberate in response to one of the points you you've raised mayor manzo about the size of signs i based much of that on what other cities did so it wasn't me picking a sign size out of the blue it was based on i looked at quite a few different cities and they had residential or political signs in a residential zone would have a square footage of x and commercial signs would have a different square footage those were all based on the different things that i looked at in trying to come up with a coherent ordinance for you having said that if you all want to change standards which is basically what you're doing then that is exactly what you as the council should should do is debate how the standards should be changed i you know if there were only one or two things i would say let's debate them and have a resolution to those things based on the number of things you you pointed out some of which were new and i was hearing for the first time then i i would not recommend that you go forward and pass this as it is i would recommend that you make every effort to try and get it right and get it right i mean to me means that you'll have a very thorough discussion and to me the thing i will do if you want to revisit this on another occasion is i will go back to the various points that were raised and go through them methodically like i did in other sessions this is a i would say for the second time this evening a complicated area of the law and it is it's one where if you get it wrong then you will be in federal court in federal court cases um i'm saying this example primarily for folks in the audience i've said it to the council when this broad was brought up before in the other city i represent several years ago we had a group that contacted the city and was ready to file a federal lawsuit based on a existing city ordinance related to churches in residential areas and you don't need to know much more than that other than when that group contacted the city i contacted their staff attorney and we addressed between myself and city manager we addressed the various concerns that that group had they were legitimate concerns the last time that particular ordinance had been revised was 40 or 50 years ago in the space of 40 or 50 years there have been several supreme court cases federal cases that related to the exercise of religious affiliation that might that should have resulted at some point in the city modifying its ordinance the city had not done that yet these folks that contacted me pointed out the basis for why they were contacting us this is what that group does and we went through the appropriate steps not to cave into them but to address what was legitimate concerns from their standpoint they gave us the opportunity to do it in a very methodical manner of simply changing the ordinance and that's what we did and everybody at the end of the day was happy because the city didn't spend 50 to 100 000 defending a lawsuit because on the other side was reasonable attorneys the the attorney that came here last year was uh last summer was also an exceptionally reasonable uh man and he pointed out to myself and to win what he thought were the concerns and um you know he did say he did not want to initiate a case against his own city he wanted us to war one addressing what he thought were deficiencies and i would agree with him there were things that needed to be revised and that's what we've tried to do so my recommendation to you is i i'm not uh it's y'all's decision to make i'm not an advocate for simply keep the existing ordinance i think it needs to be updated i at this point would be an advocate for address the points that have been raised this evening and go back to the drawing board and continue the methodical process that we've been doing and i i will tell you i will do everything i can to address the points and you know some some of them i will tell you that i'll just pick one for for existing uh example purposes and i'll go back to what mayor manzo said you know it that the way you characterize it i i disagree with you characterize it as the city's making a decision to um that commercial signs are more important than political science in the residential area that isn't has nothing to do with the thought process i had in writing it what what i did in writing it was use look at other examples and try to be in many ways mirror what other examples were of other cities who have tried to do the same thing we're trying to do y'all it's within y'all's purview to determine what the standards are for the city of bel air beach and you can to some degree make science size uniform but that's what you choose to do across the board i mean both were atoned when they as a city passed a lot of ordinances when that's that city really came into existence they were known for being very [Music] uniform about sign size across the board and in some ways that resulted in this this is a long time ago this in the 70s that they had lawsuits because they some people argued they were too restrictive and you know the the thing i will tell you about raton and the difference between there and here is boca raton had a lot of commercial property and you can imagine why mcdonald's didn't want to be confined to a sign that was five feet square bellier beach doesn't have really that problem you don't have a mcdonald's anywhere in the city you you don't have anything like that you have residential districts so you know you have some basis for restricting sign size and i'm only using that for purposes of an example but my my comments and guidance to you are continue the process that we've been working on for a long time i i will tell you i'm not somebody that wants to keep going back to the drawing board over and over and over again i at some point you hit the point of diminishing marginal returns but as i i will say consistently with every time i've spoken on this issue this is important that you get this right because if you are ever subject to a case you want to be able to say that we went through a very long torturous deliberative process to try and get it right a lot of the thing i mean to me that the length of things is not anywhere near as important as content a lot of the stuff that i added to this was oriented around one central theme and that is that you have stated a legitimate basis for your regulation and that is the aesthetics of your your town it's very important to the city citizens of bel air beach and to having read your code and to the city council that you maintain certain aesthetic standards for your community you want this to be an attractive uh community and you you really don't want it i mean you certainly don't have blight compared to some other communities but you you want a certain level of standards and that's fine for the city to have a certain level of standards a lot of the stuff i added to this was to buttress why you are that is so important to you and i know that took up several pages and again page count is not that relevant to me it's what what is the purpose of doing that it's not filler it's to put in a basis for you to so strongly adhere to a certain level of standard so that's that's hopefully some insight into um you know how this was put together i again will will close my comments by saying uh my feelings are hurt by anything that's been said i simply want to get it right and be responsive to the city council and also ultimately the citizens in having a strong sign ordinance that minimizes the opportunities for the city to end up in court i hope that's helpful mr riley i want to say something you know i went through 10 minutes of issues that i had with it but i'm just going to pick one of the items you just mentioned which is outstanding in here okay because again i read these constitutional law cases and um you have actually you need to show a compelling reason when you're estate to why you're doing what you're doing rarely do you see it mentioned in an ordinance and if you do see it mentioned half of the times it's wrong mr riley's taking the extra step of putting it in several times and in each section why we're doing what we're doing so this is not to toss this whole thing i just went through i don't know 16 pages of ordinance and really if you pull my comments down they probably fit on a page so i think overall we have the nucleus of something good and i would hate to see us toss this out more than that i i can't agree with you more going back to the old ordnance you might as well just get ready to lawyer up that's the reason why we wrote this one because the last one was probably going to be called unconstitutional if it was challenged and we didn't want to find that out motion to table number eight on the agenda um i don't think we should just toss this i believe we can start with the mayor's comments um i hope you were able to keep up with all that and if not no it wasn't due to the volume of them but i will listen to them we should be able to get a copy of the video i'm sorry guys um my mistake i think i wasn't sure i just looked it up there is no discussion on this one so i'm gonna pull point order i'll call pointer on myself for not knowing it but also well i'll just have to cut off the conversation so what we need is a majority vote motion to table motion table is going to set this aside until the city attorney comes back with a revision and my recommendation if you want to amend it that's fine with me um bring it back to a work session so we can hash this out instead of cashing it out at a formal session let's knock off any issues that we have bring this thing here and pass it that's just a suggestion it doesn't matter to me i'll do this all night up to you as the banker yes just one comment we did bring this to a war session that the consul gave the city attorney comments he revised them and did what i think he felt were the changes that were needed and it seems like uh that at times i'm going to use a word that we used to use in the army we're pulled manure because every time we come back we come back with something else so if we're going to have a work session i i you know ask all the council bring your changes and let's fix this and finish it he started this last october we brought this to the console but this is the third time i think right uh and and here we are we're gonna bring it back again and you know concerns me that right now you suspended the sign ordinance okay so there is law enforcement and i get complaints every day about why is this six foot sign sitting out in somebody's front yard and well i can't enforce anything because really the sign ordinances shut down so you know i implore you to when you come back with your comments come back with them all that's all i'm asking because we need to resolve this and move it on as you read things you see other things there's seven people on this council another attorney two away from me i'm not the only person because you stopped me from making comments and now you're well i'm sorry that's right you are you're right you're right there's no more comments so i don't even know why that comment was made no i'm just asking all of these okay there's no debate on this okay so your point though is well taken everybody come with your changes now we're going to do it in a work session you want to do it in general i don't care well i i can tell you because if you change your recession is the budget and we can do that as part of that we'll have another one next week i'll have another one in three weeks whenever mr riley is ready i'll have one every night if that's that important to this city i don't care it's up to mr riley i'm not going to put undue pressure on him to write a constitutional sign working so mr riley how much time do you think you need to revise this don't tell me six months that's my point that's what i'm trying to say um if you give me a couple weeks i would certainly appreciate it okay as into okay so we'll do this we have several budget sessions coming up but mr riley tells you it's ready we'll schedule it for after one of the shorter budget sessions not the first one that goes on all night but like one of the simple ones that goes for like half an hour let's do it that way is everybody good with that okay so mr frank banker has a motion on the floor to table this we need a majority vote and nipple table okay i'll go all in favor all in favor of table this all right anyone opposed we have going down post let the record reflect that so at six to one it's tabled and we'll move on to item nine anybody need a break before we do this good okay consideration award news 2103 or visit the city council of the city of baylor beach florida providing for the amendments to section [Music] e8 section 2-247-b section 2-350-a section 2-350-b and section 2-350c of the city code of ordinances providing for incorporation and recitals providing for approval of the amendments in section 2-45 e82-247-b section 2-350a section 2-350b in section 2-350 of the city code of providing for a copy to be kept on file providing perseverability providing for the repealable ordinances in conflict here with and providing for an effective day planning and zoning board city review uh city code review is where this came from this is the first reading it was not mentioned in there i'm putting that in um and this this explanatory is this is consideration of the board's recommendation amendments to the city code regarding administrative procedures including authority for expenditure so i have a motion can't do that yet but thank you leslie and tara appropriate any um any city council comments besides so what we're doing here folks that was a bunch of numbers and i'm going to explain it to you this is to increase the city manager's purchasing power so what we're doing is we're increasing the uh the purchasing from it was originally where you didn't need to come to council it was originally three thousand up to ten thousand and now we're gonna go for um i'm sorry it was originally it was three thousand and now it's gonna go up to five thousand okay so in other words he doesn't it gives him greater autonomy to split spend on his own um same thing the second part of this it was 10 000 and we're going up to 25 000 as the minimum that would require two bids correct and the city council is approved right okay um and then there's some other changes just with how enforcement is to be done on certain things with you know with regards to um we have a fine and serving process and stuff like that it was just some technicalities we had stuff about the city police which we don't have a city police force so we eliminated some of these references it was something that was more ministerial um i had one question on this page three section five b i'm wondering why section five b it says the city council may authorize expenses for ten thousand to twenty ten thousand one twenty five thousand upon receipt of those three written big books and then it seems to me that it looks like that should be i don't know it looks like it should be in the next section it was ten thousand original in the next section i'd say so no well i was a little confused what what the ten thousand to twenty five thousand we we don't have to send it out to bid we can get proposals bring them to the city council and as you know doesn't have known in the past couple years we've had a few bids of like 16 000 or 17 000 that was much more cost effective to use those bids and suspend the bid requirements so what this will do the minimum bid requirement will be anything that costs over 25 the city council they'll have to go out to bid if something costs over 25. if it's less than 25 between 10 and 25 the city council can take the quotes that we obtained the staff obtains and approve the purchasing whatever that is i didn't have a problem with this in terms of raising limits with you as my city manager i feel comfortable but i've heard stories about how it used to be prior to being here and i can hear good stories i heard a lot of that in stores and i don't take an opinion either way but i hope you're here for a long time but if someday you're not i don't know what am i going to get am i going to get and we're changing this authority and we're giving it to a city manager to spend money without our approval really so i'm comfortable with you i sign this right now okay but that's my worry is what if we don't get somebody who's quite as honest what do we do then because we won't see it we will not see it on council whatever the council that's going to be here won't say well you're actually only increasing my authority two thousand dollars really everything else the constant's gonna see so that's part of how it was set up or recommended i mean the three thousand dollars was probably 20 years ago you don't buy much for three thousand dollars today jeremy okay i i would just uh standard of that comment there i mean when these original values were written were how long ago how many decades ago and certainly that's not keeping pace with the current cost of negative cost increases the i mean realistically this guy needs the freedom to move forward on things quickly and not have to wait for a counsel session every month to come forward the other aspect of this is hey someday that the race will have somebody else standing or sitting in that chair and we deal with that in the vetting process we don't have to deal with it in every code and everything so let's keep pace with what's going on give this guy room to maneuver and daily execute his business and rely on what we have and we'll deal with the next guy in the vetting process sheriff can you detect who's making that nars in the audience because i've asked once nicely if you find it please point out the person he'll ask you to step out okay all right yes actually the first one is about the city manager ultimately we are accountable for the city manager so if we have a city manager who is out of control he comes back on us it's up to us to pull back the reins in case there's a spinning issue yeah the other item is it's kind of silly but what happens if it's 50 cents between 5 000 and 5 000 come to johnson well the way that it's set up is as an example if you approve something for purchase of the budget you know we just used i guess you could use five thousand and one cent i think if you wanted to uh here's a whole i'm not saying but the way the 5 000 to 10 000 is set up is if it's not in the budget then it comes to you if it's in the budget because you've approved the budget then we can go ahead and spend it and you have discretion mysteries you've used that discretion what 80 months are you about 200 items for one hour of discussions to this council so you have the discretion to bring anything you wish to counsel so if it's 50 cents off or whatever that's your prerogative you bring it here you could bring a 20 expenditure if you wanted to if you felt that it needed council approval okay the point i was making was it's not a 50 cent item it's something that there's break points of an even dog and there's no i i know it's like i said i know it's kind of silly but hey it's in here and uh and so we don't have clear direction on what we do between five thousand [Music] well you can correct it one way you can say i have authority to five thousand and one dollars or you can do the other thing and just make it five thousand eliminate the one guys if and i don't that's this is substantial correction and we're going to have a problem with passing i mean you can take it from the reason i did that is because in the code review was to try to clear it and actually that's how the element is breakpoint that creates an argument whereas in code if it's down to a single penny now there's no argument well then the solution is make it five thousand so at ten thousand it would actually be five thousand and one sam would be the starting point and then the same goes for the ten thousand mark would be ten thousand and one so we're gonna okay so we have to do an amendment first so uh vice mayor you wanna go through a facebook page and [Music] under warehouse from 5001 to 5001 a question i don't find anywhere in the financial market for the word 5 000. 5 000. it's 5 000 what is the difference between 5 this man can spend that money and if you get in that area where we disagree and we're fighting with each other i'm not saying it's going to be us but in the future that could happen he has a clear direction anything over this even to the penny he needs to come to the council whereas now it's but that's the beauty of government the government says this is an ordinance in place if the next guy is until the han that we hire okay and he abuses that then we pull the ordinance his issue is that right now it's up to five thousand and then the next one starts at five thousand and one so on the crazy thing which is not crazy okay if lynn did some proposal for five thousand dollars and seventy six cents he has no guidance as to what to do so he's just correcting really what's coming back has to go back to the yeah yeah you just have to say more than five thousand days that's all you need to make it more than five thousand on the purpose okay so that's good that's page one so five thousand words five thousand one becomes five thousand yep okay next page all right uh let's see here we keep going to page three and we will change uh section five b to five thousand also yes uh it appears two times then there's a ten thousand and one it should be ten thousand and further down the page section six twenty five thousand uh should be more than twenty five thousand [Music] in excess of 25 000 but i believe it would just be 25 000. yes thank you for the correction let me see if i got this right you i'm going to say it because i'm going to have to call it and then you tell me what you want to do okay so page one last sentence five thousand one becomes five thousand correct page two twenty five thousand one in the second line becomes twenty five thousand yes no other changes on page two page three five b five thousand one becomes five thousand correct second line five thousand one becomes five thousand yes further down the paragraph wait hang on i'm just seeing this ten thousand one should that be ten thousand that should be ten thousand would be getting up may authorize expenditures in excess then 6c 25 000 becomes thousand forty five thousand one becomes twenty five thousand correct second line twenty five thousand one becomes twenty five thousand experiments correct and then the last um the last line of that paragraph in excess of 20 it's a 25 000 one it should say 25 000 yes all right so that's the motion do i have a second second by leslie matero anybody want to discuss it you got to call it again so please make sure i'm going to call for the amendment only this is to amend the ordinance only amending the ordinance you're not passing it yet okay um citizen comments

the first page 5001 would become 5 000. patty i hope you're getting all of this um page two which says there's the whereas clause the second line in the second line 5001 will become 5 000. in the second to last line of the paragraph 10 0001 will become 10 000. excuse me that's more than in excess okay no more okay so in excess of 10 000 up to 25 we should put another label in there okay so in excess of 10 000 up to 25 000. and then 6c 25001 becomes 25 000 [Music] and then second line it says 25 000 1 it becomes 25 000. and then last line of c 25 0001 becomes 25 000. those are the changes

city manager that's in in place that's out of control what are you going to do i'm just thinking ahead every time i'm hearing you all supporting 100 and that's good okay that's absolutely good but

was brought by vice mayor this is a resolution clarifying that the city is not a party to manzo v town of belarus or lawsuit first we'll have a motion so [Music] motion second there's potential uh conflict with me carrying this return to the city attorney and ask him for a discussion of the potential conflict and then i'll make my decision as to what i will do in terms of passing the gavel prior to the meeting i discussed with mayor manzo section 112.3143 subsection 3a which relates to conflicts of interest and both him and i uh in discussing it and agreed that well i'll first tell you the standard the standard that is in that section relates to private gain and him voting on this issue will not result in a private gain to him so he based on that statute he should vote on this issue having said that he has made an independent inquiry related to his ethical stand standing on this particular case and it's my understanding that he will uh remove himself from the discussion based on the ethical advice he's been given by i i assume some of the the commission on ethics that is correct mr riley so first i agree with your interpretation of section 112 this is not a voting conflict for me this does not encourage my benefit in any way shape or form um i don't even know that it's necessary but i'm i'm going to say that at this point in time i am going to recuse myself and i'm doing it on advice of ethics counsel from the state of florida okay ultimately the people that would decide if there's an ethics problem and i need to put in the record why i'm doing what i'm doing so bear with me patty this is to go in verbatim and you will be getting a form eight after uh maybe after this meeting or sometime this week i have 15 days to get it to you so on june 5th uh june 7th 2021 city council agenda item 11 is consideration of resolution 2021 a resolution of the city council of the city of valor beach providing for a public declaration that the city of bellar beach is not a party to defending lawsuit um there is no conflict under section 112 3 uh three i've been just under section 112 okay however part of the law of the state of florida is when there is any perception of a conflict even if somebody can get it wrong which they would if they said this was a conflict you need to step aside or you should that's the best practices and that's what i was told by council from the division of ethics and that's what i'm going to do the section references section 286.012 it's extension based on appearance of impropriety i am this whole plaintiff in that lawsuit there is no one with me at this time i brought that as a private individual and not as mayor at this point i'm going to step aside for this only i'm not resigning as mayor so i will be handling the next item on this schedule which will be item 12. so i'll be back for that and you'll miss me for this but i'll be back now i need to pass the gal under the rules here mr uh vice mayor would normally take the gal but the vice mayor made this motion so you can't really run your own motion and we just came back into play with that with regard to um because i just got the right to make my own motion so we said you have to pass the gavel so when the vice mayor can't do it i must go to the next senior person on the council it doesn't define it mr riley but it means i'm a senior but i think it goes by longevity and service to the community on council and i believe that would be leslie montero having completed two at least three terms that i know of um on council i think she's in her fourth term if i'm not mistaken so that's senior to anyone else here because i think glenn gunn has two and everybody else is on their first term so i will pass the gavel to leslie and taro unless i'm told otherwise i do have a question about that um actually i just requested the resolution i have not made a motion oh you did make the motion that's what just brought this to the discussion motion by date of gas yes [Music] whatever the discussion is there you go and i'm going to just give me a minute i'm going to stay mr reed is the conference room open no i'm going to sit in the conference room okay and somebody will come and get me at the conclusion of this thank you okay we have a motion on the table by um vice mayor jazz the second from rita [Music] okay this on the outside appears to be something controversial but it's really not basically uh we have a mayor who as a private citizen is suing another city a neighboring city anyone that is not intimately familiar with this case would automatically assume that it was the city of dalaran beach that is suing the town of ellershore also across the street there's been signs rallying the public to join in on the lawsuit which is directly across the street from city hall yet another example of it looks like the city of bel air beach is suing the city of fellowship this is not true and the city is not involved in that i have really no opinion one way or the other on that particular case and what's happening however i do have problems whenever residents from other seats and within our own they come to me and they say why is your city or why is our city suing that city and i have to stop and explain i only come in contact with so many people in a day okay that means that there's there's no telling how many people that don't have correct information and they're just making gross assumptions that this city is suing another city therefore i ask this resolution to be written and i ask all of you to stand behind me with this clarification this is not a for or against a lawsuit this is strictly for clarification that we are not part of that lawsuit that's all it's about well whether we're part of it or not part of it um real property owners is defining the recital of the interlocal agreement anxious um people that live between first street you know it's i would say 16th i'm not trying to be disrespectful when everyone goes beyond 16th street they pre uh they're pretty much aware of who's suing and why the suit exists i have a problem with city council not doing something to protect the citizens of ballarat beach between 1st and 16th street and like i said don't hold me to 16th street and we haven't tried to file a temporary restraining order against the shadywins that we buried our heads in the sand literally on this topic okay this is a health concern this is a private this is a public beach portion it can't directly shape any type of a shade structure it flies in the face of the public trust doctrine of the state it also flies in the face of article 10 section 11 the state constitution all right um i want to be a good name but good neighbors have to be good neighbors together now going back and maybe our attorney can help us i read all the minutes they were virtual minutes back last year because of the code you spoke at a town meeting john spoke the mayor spoke [Music] now we bring a resolution does that interfere with the sunshine because not all councils spoke at that time there's council members that are no longer here i did not speak at that meeting well there was three meetings that i believe you were recorded in one fell out short yes but what i'm saying is there's other council members that spoke we have citizens here that express that beach is an important asset to our property all right and it is and it's one of the reasons or probably the main reason i moved here all right i really believe telling people we're not part of this lawsuit is immaterial it doesn't need to be safe okay what needs to be said is what are we doing to protect the citizens of belair beach [Music] against the harmful rays of the sun the infringements of our of their rights my rights and that's what i have been concerned about say something as well um i have to um vice mayor has been approached by a lot of new residents in town that have were contacted and encouraged to join this thing um a lot of them do feel that this entire lawsuit is baller beach against talendo shore and i agree with this 100 we need to step up and say we're not part of it because this could cost this city tons of money on legal fees getting involved in all of this all of this would have probably been resolved if everybody would have backed off at the time the city manager was given direction to work with that community to get the umbrella thing removed or at least accepted in the abscesses they couldn't speak about it because they already received intent to sues from two citizens and then the third one feel about theirs as well but we need to stand up and we're not saying we're not here to protect our citizens we're saying we're not here to get involved in this lawsuit that we have no part of and if it works its way up that adds finance with the people that are assuming that i i know that vice mayor yes when the city manager was direct directed by council he was approaching belarus shores to put umbrellas up in between the barriers of their streets all right that's ridiculous all right anything from the high order means mark okay west is public beach if you really want to get into it there's a supreme court case stop the beach with nourishment okay bellarmi shores has never taken nourishment that i know if they didn't take a nourishment okay once they happen they've now taken sam from indian rocks beach and belair beach anyone after the renourishment has pictures of the beach okay you see this i call it a crate gradual storms will fill in that crater gradual movement of the oceans will fill in that green where is that sand coming from public sand okay so they taken the public sand and now they're saying stay off of it after we paid for it this is just bad behavior and it's not good behavior by one town to another the other thing is back in 2018 they had no problem when the red tide came in by using the county to clean up their beach all right with the dead fish i witnessed a front end loader and two laborers picking up dead fish on their top on their so-called property now just justice scalia back in 2010 wrote in that decision if you're a beach front owner you have the responsibility to maintain that beach if you don't and you lose it by emulsion of hurricane all right that land is gone forever so if you really want to get into this and look at the eclipse and control they might not own anything west of that bulkhead or beach beach building and like i said the behavior here if you read into the minutes i find this this is just bad behavior on one part and i don't know why we just keep cal talent i i really don't can i say something else um i agree with you i think this is useless because to me if you want clarity it says manzo versus town the fellowship i'm a lawyer said that many times to me as a doctor i can read this and say manzo versus town of bel air shark does it ever say manson who happens to be a resident of bel air beach it's not confusing at all i think this you guys are always talking about wasting money wasting attorney riley's time and using it for no good reason here's an example waste of our attorney's time and our money on something that doesn't need to be clarified because it says manzo versus town of for sure and i mean who knows maybe something will happen and in a couple months bella beach will decide to get involved so does this do something against us and that happens so i i just again i'm black and white so manzo versus tallahara shore now thank you you haven't had a shot either either way this train has left the that we're concerned about perception that we have to pass the gavel and yet the mayor says he can take off his mayor hat and sue a neighboring city as a resident and an individual well then to me the litmus test is any council member can take off his council number had and have a shaved discussion with another council member as a resident i mean do you see the irony here i mean when you become an elected official the view is you are an electrician you don't just tape off your head and say it's you have you had citizens and individual rights as a resident but it's a very fine line and to say okay well we're as justice mental services mayor city of miller beach joseph is individual capacity and i think it should probably read as a president this is it's moved this thing has left the station the perception is there anyway so i mean i understand the point trying to be made but i'll support it either way all right um first off to uh you just read something that many people have not seen or have heard of all i hear is bail orbeez so you just proved my point about it needs to be no who is suing who this is not the city of valor beach no matter how bad you want it to be that it's not this is the mayor suing bel air shore so um correction it's not the banker okay it's joseph right yes it's not named even even my perception i forget it's so blurry and grey so that would um if we passed this that somebody would have to read this in order to be clarified that it's valid well then you could say hey but in the minutes it's manzo versus down the dollar show i'm sure somebody's on next door put it on next door done that's about five seconds [Music] i just have one question what's the anticipated difference in the end result if the city suits the town of bel-air shore or it moves forward as an individual what's the difference in the anticipated outcome i think there no matter how it goes we are we're going to be damaged no matter how it works out there's damage that's being done and the more that we the closer we get this and we get closer and closer to that joining the lawsuit line um the harder it's going to be to ever repair the damage so you know i'm not saying that i agree with anything that the town of baylor shore has done on the other hand they are our neighbors they're just like indian rocks beach they're right next door right across the street and they're not going anywhere so councilman who shot the first sight that's irrelevant you are not dragging me in this [Music] or anything like that so let's keep it to discussion i would like to make a couple comments all i wanted to say is um just a reminder i know the mayor has stepped out that he has set specific rules for people that come in here and you guys are laughing and cheering on him it's very hard for us to have a conversation so out of respect please let us finish our conversation yeah okay so um that's what i wanted to say to the attorney go ahead okay i want to make several clear clarifications one this the discussion is on whether to adopt this resolution or not i'll come back to that section 2-63-d of the city code of ordinances says the following the presiding officer or on the request of the city attorney shall rule out order any discussion by the city council on matters that are on the subject of any current or prospective litigation i want to make a very important clarification [Music] the city is not a defendant in the lawsuit so the city is not engaged in any way in current litigation we all know that i'm going to say it anyway prospective litigation typically means would be a situation where the city has received a notice of a claim and the notice of the claim is going to lead to a lawsuit being filed the city has not received a notice of a claim related to that lawsuit so we don't get that category either so i'm making it exceptionally clear to everyone in the room that that the section i just read does not apply to this situation so that's that's the first thing i want to state second is um there's several points one uh joseph amanzo as an individual has every right to file a lawsuit to protect his personal rights if he chooses to do so so the fact that he is the mayor is in with respect to that to be irrelevant times that i have spoken to him about the existence of the lawsuit he has always stated to me i am talking to you telling you about my private case i am not talking to you in terms of i am the mayor of the city so there's always been that distinction in the conversation with me and that's what i have personal knowledge of so i'm relaying it to you the way that the resolution was written it was written to be factually accurate it is a thousand percent factually accurate that's one of the reasons it's so short there is nothing in there that is a interpretation of in any way shape or form regarding the merits of the case it is simply clarifying that the city is not a party to the lawsuit and i used as little space as i possibly could to to make that clarification i i will readily admit this is a unconventional resolution in some respects but i i was asked to do this and i asked lynn if we were following the normal procedure and the answer to that was yes we are and i then went forward and prepared the resolution you have in front of you so that those are the things that i want to to clarify i i will not just what leslie said the i would not i this is a the issue before you is a narrow one should you approve this resolution or not i would confine myself to the discussion of that issue narrow issue and the the other you know merits of everything else i would simply not address it this time and that's my recommendation to you maybe a technical question do we need to change the approved from joseph manzo mayor i wrote this as i normally would um i i mean i i have to tell you this is now personal comment the the things that at times i have to think through are astounding so you know i wrote the resolution as if it was a normal resolution i didn't factor in all the complications that have you know are involved so that's what i'll actually have to think about i haven't really considered that i had no idea whether he was going to step aside or not i'm glad uh mayor manzo called and got an ethics opinion because it to me as i mentioned earlier him and i did discuss the ethical issue because it's something that he he should be very concerned not very concerned he should address just like any of you should and when there's an ethical issue that comes up the city attorney should give advice i did that of my initiative although him and i talked about it when the agenda came out and i spoke to him very briefly by the way which is an unpainful call so when you see it on the bill you won't see it on the bill because i won't put it on the bill but he i told him i would look into that and i discussed that briefly with him before the meeting so i i have tried just like i think he has to do everything that is ethically appropriate with respect to him having any involvement in this issue um city council so two things so the initial conversation you had was that there wasn't a uh ethical thing and then the state comes back and said well yeah there probably is a perception no that's not what i'm saying well i mean with the initial advice the same as what we've got back from the state me clarify what i said i i today looked up this irrelevant statute it's 112.3143 3a i looked that up when i spoke to him last thursday i said i'm going to look into the relevant statute about conflict because this relates to him so last thursday in a telephone conversation i i brought that up and he agreed that that would be the appropriate thing for him and i to talk about that so that's one thing today i looked up the statute prior to the meeting i spoke to him about the my interpretation of the statute and my interpretation of the statute that he did not have a conflict and thus he should vote under notes to me before the meeting i don't know when that he spoke and called a commissional and ethics staff attorney and he discussed with them independently uh his concern to make sure that he was handling this the in the appropriately ethical manner so when we were talking to see prior to the meeting about section 112.3143 he told me he got a uh independent ethics opinion from one of the commissional and ethics councils and he was going to step aside based on the advice he'd been given that's factually what took place well i think so because it sounds like it was just feelings there second point is this was handled in a normal protocol and yet this is the first time i've seen this when i opened up the package it seems like this conversation should have taken place before we got to this stage well i can comment about that or when can comment about it you tell me which way you'd like to do it well any time a council member asked for something i wrote down and uh you know it wouldn't matter who it is constantly and in the past i have you know if someone sent me an email and said hey i want fred to look at this i've sent it a friend to have him look at it or whatever it is because i work for you i think if any of you ask something then i should proceed with it i just want to close with one their own layer indicate this could be a constitutional problem by putting that shade on it so he recognizes that this could be a legal bad ordinance the one more comment is uh in my role of city attorney i have a ethical obligation which i have believed me tried extremely hard to fulfill in being responsive to all seven of the council members and i will look each one of you in the eye and tell you i have made every reasonable effort and then some to try and be responsive to the seven of you not one of you and i will also tell you at times doing the role that i have is extremely difficult under the circumstances that we have citizen thomas the gentleman in the back i think he was the first one who stands us show rich shock 11513 street well there's a lot of things i'd like to say but i'm hoping for the judge rules and the interveners i am going to be a critical member in this particular case and i just want to remind you you can pass all the resolutions you want but if bellar beach gets drawn into this lawsuit you're in it you're in it so if you want to rub the mayor's face in it a little bit go ahead and have some fun but if judge meyer determines that there is culpability on the part of belarus beach you're going to be in the lawsuit so so you know thank you respectfully miss spoke i was at both virtual meetings i'm addressing you because you said i was disrespectful and i don't want to be disrespectful i was at both virtual meetings with elliot shore neither of you well mr reeves was there and so was mr manzo and they were not neighborly and they were not in agreement or even remotely wanting to agree or reach an agreement with us that's number one as mr shock i was all i'm also an impr prospective intervener and i have spoken to many residents who are shocked that failure the city of belarus beach is not defending them the city is not in this lawsuit and you're not there to make a statement for them now i agree with the the council members that have stated that it is obvious the city is not there it is just manzo in the lawsuit this to me is a meaningless just meaningless uh effort and a waste of resources for a pontius pilot move of it's not our fault we're not involved thank you mr shank i think you'll be called in gentleman over here my name is bob angelo i'm a 101 palm drive i've been here for about a little over two and a half years and i'm a frequent visitor to the beach on the weekends occasionally during the week i i'm finding it real hard to understand that this beach has been used for the past 60 years okay and this is just now coming up there's such a thing called past precedence okay how can you let something like this go on and all of a sudden last year throw a sign up there says my seven-year-old can't have sun protection such claims this resolution it's not i understand that i'm just i'm making a statement i'm here i'm also signatory of this suit because i think it's wrong i can't believe you guys are representing all these individuals that live here and i don't think that it's right you should be supporting me yes yes ma'am thank you for reminding me and i know this has been really tough for you guys i'm very shocked i live at 115 13th street i appreciate the council and all you guys do i'm seeing a division here because i see the people that are on first street to 16th street are supporting us but there are people that if you're on sixteenth and two up to up to the other you don't have a problem with this because you can have umbrellas and we can't and there are council people that definitely i feel are not on our side this is bel air beach you guys are bellar beach councilman and i'm hearing a lot of people that are not supporting bellar beach but bel air shore and it's kind of scary it's very scary that you're sitting on the council and you're not supporting balor beach we're not bellar beach is not the enemy and bellar sure is not the enemy the two council groups should get together and talk you keep saying that we're being not be neighborly they are not it's because the two of you guys the groups need to work better at talking to each other and i apologize i'm kind of going off but um i just hope that you would support baller beach and his resumes i just want to say for the record 22nd i support all right just for the record i live off 22nd will support valerie thank you john hanson 22nd street i've listened to the comments back too this is what i've heard i've heard implied assumptions that's the city suing bel air shore we don't have any numbers about all these people who have supposedly contacted council members as to what's what numbers wise so there's been an assumption on the part of some council members that's the case you know we we're not smart enough to figure it out i really don't know if this uh resolution is that necessary because it's clear as day it's already been mentioned by one um council member it's uh manzo versus town bel bellair short something else that i've also interpreted in some of the comments some council members have already raised the white flag you've given up and that disappoints me that's not what i voted for probably the smartest thing i've heard was a question from a council member new to the council wants to know why an injunction hasn't been filed against the city of belarus or so i posed that question in general to the council i've tried to follow this i've asked questions about compromise dealing with bel air shore and this relates to the suit why we can't have umbrellas sun protection on the north and south sides of the properties of the parking lots bel air sure doesn't want to give us that now i'm hearing more about what that city owns and what they don't own so we're sitting here doing this and we're just i feel like we're just trying to push this to the corner i understand what's going on it's one person suing as a citizen as a resident not a member of the council the other lawsuit that's another implication there's an assumption that that sign across the street has things to do with this it's on private property it's not here in the city property you're getting off track for the subject of this no man i'm not i'm but i'm done i've made my point but i still have a question that i'd like answered at some point why hasn't the council pursued an injunction against the city of bel air store first of all when you took an oath you took an oath to defend this this city including anything that comes before us so if somebody's questioning you as to what is going on and i know that the city attorney will tell you you say this is a private lawsuit and i'm not allowed to make a comment the thing says and i'll show you on my phone that's what you say to them it's the city of bella shore versus joseph manza point blank and i can't make a comment why we are going through all these hoops to basically i feel walk away from trying to defend by by voting on this issue we should have never ever brought this forward to even vote that we're not involved in the suit when in fact i know numerous members on this council have commented on this in writing to people which is now a public record so if this city thinks that they possibly will not be involved in the suit i don't think so some some point whether they are or whether you try to denounce or say that you're not involved in this suit you're going to be brought in as soon as the city so suck it up and move the hell on and do the city business any more comments from the public yes sir uh ken blanche's 1021 home drive i'm just talking specifically about the motion itself i wanted to reiterate what the council member said down here and try to understand how there's this perception that's out there that you guys are involved and the documents that are in place like she pointed out specifically says joseph manzo versus the city of belair shores so if this document this motion that you pass goes through how is that going to change that perception to these same people are they now magically going to know that oh here's here's this other document that's somewhere out there that we're not seeing but now we know that the city of bel air beach is not involved in this because that's what i'm seeing exactly what she said you're going to pass an ordinance or pass a motion or whatever you're calling it i'm sorry i'm new with this whole commission thing but i don't see how that gets out to the public so that the public knows do you plan on doing a press release that states this i mean how are you going to get the word out that's going to tell everybody hey we're not involved in this i am i i'm involved in this because this affects me you know like i said i'm right here where i walk across the causeway and go to the beach you know i can't go and hop in my car and drive somewhere else to another beach access so that i can have an umbrella to save myself from skin cancer so this does affect me and i just wanted to you know say i don't see how anyone is going to know this other than the council any other we're all very aware that mayor manzo is bringing this lawsuit and he stepped out so that he doesn't have to deal with the unethics of what's been going on the whole panel is not sticking up for their people in all honesty he should have sued the city of bellar beach not the city of bella sure for not standing up for him he should not be suing bel air shore he should be suing feller beach all of us in our in our documents we have been deeded access to these beaches which comes from bella beach who's taking that away from us is it bellar shore or is it bella beach who's taking away our rights to those beaches with umbrellas any other comments the issue is [Music] well maybe the resident should be suing beller beach instead of bellar shore yes then to council mrs shock brought up the point well the council should be working with one another right well yeah that's what we wanted to do all along and that's what was in progress when the city manager was trying to or strike up some sort of agreement and then a lawsuit was filed and guess what happens when that happens the shields go up all discussion ends and it's not only on this issue it's affecting many many other issues where we interact with failure effective budget issues police issues taking care of public spaces that sort of thing where do we intersect it's affecting a lot of different things there's a lot of moving parts here so yeah toss on this thing once again i think that in some ways it's blue because i think the outcome is going to be the same a legal decision is going to be made regarding who's in the right who's in the wrong where did certain rights begin we're in certain rights and so i'm kind of and i think i understand where the vice pair was trying to go with this thing and uh i'm not ready to make a decision on this thing i'm not going to teach her because i want to think about everything i've heard and i will toss out a motion to table this second comment since my name was brought up please no excuse me you're making an emotion motion to table this resolution do we need a roll call an emotional table i think you could do my um it's up to you you know which would you prefer um why don't you follow the rule council member banker all right council member gunn all right council member notaro [Music] vice mayor goddess name [Music] it doesn't fail [Music] so we now have the resolution before us any other council comments before we vote on the resolution my my comment is going to be that if let's say this passes i think it's going to cause more confusion than clarity because now there's going to be a rumor that there was a resolution passed from bel air beach about the umbrella thing oh wow there are beaches in this now this is great oh my god finally i think this is going to be way more confusing if it passes because like i said then somebody actually has to read this resolution to understand what it's saying and if people didn't read what the suit was actually about the first time then they're certainly not going to be a resolution so i think it's going to be more confusing so if you're trying to clarify things by doing this which i appreciate the clarification but i think it's gonna be more confusing than um been clarifying that's my final thing i have a couple final comments as well but we certainly up here appreciate all of your guys's passion your thoughts and your opinions is we're not you know dismissing it but we also hear from a lot of other members of our community and but we all communicate regularly within the community and we get their feedback when we hear it now just a little quick note on the perception at one point you know i'm gonna go ahead and state this my husband was doing surveys on certain things and it was mentioned in council that people could be perceiving that that was coming from me and not my husband and basically asked it or just insinuated and commented that he stopped doing that and he had stopped on social media with that because we didn't want the perception that somebody with thought steve's full is rediscovered so there is always perception out there it just depends on how people look at it from one moment to the next so i just want to say we appreciate your comments and all of that but we hear from the rest of the community as well so please understand that this is a big community it's got 61 people so we're going to get all kinds of different information and opinions and bonds well i would just like to say it's over three hours since this council meeting started numerous residents have stayed for this particular department and it is said when you have a service that's served this country gets up here okay and because of people like you i sleep well at night okay but now you can go on the beach and fry and maybe get skin cancer and this council cannot get jointly involved to protect you and everyone else out there i'd like to make a moment i think i think basically the litigation got ahead of negotiation and basically halted it as councilmember gunn stated earlier i don't know how much clearer it can be we were working we were going through a process and trying to reach a resolution i even i recall speaking in this council meeting about wanting to go and negotiate and was advised um by our city attorney not to go do that because um because it was it was the wrong long way to handle things uh and so i refrained i stood back now others did not and um now we're a lawsuit so i don't know i [Music] that's what i'm saying this is this is ludicrous behavior on our part i mean [Music] you know a month down the road somebody might sue the city you know that that certainly could happen does this open the door for that now no i mean sure it doesn't change anything it doesn't change anything exactly so why are we going over it it's hot we're clarifying it that you're not clarifying it who's confused out there i know i'm confused at this point i mean this i don't think it's clarified i think it's going to muddy the waters more can we go ahead and call for the question yes whenever this started i mean you weren't on the council right so my concern is you're making inferences that we we may not have ever gone to a lawsuit well we never allow the process to run its course because somebody immediately jumped to the hammer technique well i have to correct you wait a second let me finish my thoughts here because what i'm saying is you're making inferences that we would never end up as a city of miller beach or going after the junction you're making that inference and my point is is we passed that market that that train left the station as soon as litigation was filed by an individual and the shields went up hillary shore doesn't want to discuss any of these issues and well yeah who knows where this is going to go yes no did does bella become a party i don't know this is this resolution is a statement of fact if you read this thing it is a statement of fact the city attorney wrote it as a statement of fact every paragraph is a statement of fact and its cases its fashion am i correcting that yes sir so really the question before you is is this a factual statement or is it yes that's why i interpret it now i disagree with this as a factual statement because because of the recital because of number four the interlocal agreement i don't believe is actually well and what even if it's a factual statement why does it have to be made i'm a doctor do i need a resolution now for the city that way everybody in the city knows about the doctor [Music] you see what i'm saying i think it's a little lush less comments by the movement i'd like to call the questions okay um this is resolution 202106 resolution of the city council of the city of bellar beach florida providing for a public declaration that the city of valor beach board is not a party to a pending lawsuit in establishing an effective date about a yes vote it except passes this resolution and no vote does not have what you call council member swo aye council member aki no council member banker no councilmember gunn aye councilmember otero i'm vice mayor gattis the resolution passes four to two [Music] 9 15. i bet about 9 7 right now consideration of resolution 202105 a resolution of the city council in the city of better beach florida providing for the approval of the wall manual pursuant to section 90-138 of the bel air beach city code and establishing an effective day the description is consideration to adopt a sea wall manual for sea wall specifications applicable to sea walls within the subdivision of the city first motion moved by glenn gunn second checking by dave gattis i think it's a pretty straightforward manual i think is pretty much from somebody else but it hits all the high points it seems like it's more informational than anything else and i think the demo will be in the details and drafting importance that lists the proper references and ties it to that manual as guidance not just an informational kind of thing okay thank you any other council comments yes i think that this is a very very much evil uh many people don't they have no idea why their uh seawall is getting kicked on or why they're getting citations but uh this makes it very clear and it even makes it more clear whenever they're rebuilding so i think it's a great idea and uh way way over here right one thing i'd like to see um it's not the pins aren't numbered in here but like under judicial construction and that [Music] when you drive um when you drive sheeting when you use a whale head or whatever like that that should stand as its natural source whether it's cheating whether it's concrete it should not be painted it should not be any type of material added onto that can cover the cracks it depends today have epoxies on them so when you're trying to inspect them when someone's blowing the house they should stay in its natural form you should put like you have to suggest a change to add to this or we just because we're out to pass the manual tonight so resolution passes on the first read which is tonight so if you have something you want to insert that's fine if it's something you want to give to us then you have to make motion to table [Music] if you have a chance to color the concrete okay uh whatever it is but you cannot add onto it later by painting it put it in epoxy the next owner comes out does a quick view the realtor doesn't see any crack or whatever like that comes back makes sense um you can okay um your option too is to i mean you clearly submit this it's easy enough to invent we can try [Music] [Music] so you know or whatever stays the same that's just that's a statement we could add to this this adoption of this is the first step in the because we're going to reference it in the ordinance you know to amend it to just say that whatever the surface is stays in its natural state that's what i'm hearing is that yes it can be ordered by paint epoxy right no alterations to the original uh yeah i mean that's easy to facilitate the ease of inspection yeah [Music] so why don't you make an amendment a motion to amend right now they would sprays it kind of like you want it i think gets it um and then we can add that amendment to this and focus on it if we can streamline by just building that into the ordinance instead i mean jesus has a guideline but when you craft the orders you can specify i mean these codes are a liberative process your senior wisdom to amend it let's go [Music] we that the natural state of any type of sea wall stays as it is installed no pain no altercations after installation discussion on the amendment only right now i'm deferring to you on this one you've installed them you sold them you know them so this just sounds comfortable to me but yeah maybe maybe just a short follow-on justification saying hey is to facilitate ease of inspection and monitoring the structural integrity of the structure no no because you're you're not specifying what you're amending what page is a multi-page document i think it will be confusing and because it's a annual setting of policy you're simply going to create a situation where you you'll have disagreement about what it went to so that might you you would suggest it either approve it as is or approve it as is now and then come back with revised language at a later date i i think you can do either one of those i wouldn't do it the way you're kind of trying to do it now so we have the city attorney has not recommended that we proceed down this line we do have an amendment on the floor council over comments stories city residents no comments back to counsel mike banker do you have last word on your amendment finished you want me questions okay so the question before us at this point is strictly the amendment only it's an amendment to the manual itself that would say that all seawalls need to stay in their natural state for example no painting no alterations no epoxy coatings things like that a yes vote will make the amendment and we will see whether the manual itself passes so uh madam clerk would you please call the role for the amendment only councilmember aki no council member banker council member gunn name council member notaro no council member swope name vice mayor goddess nate mayor mendo nay so the amendment fails of six to one so now we go back to the consideration of the resolution for approving the manual in its existing state i had one question how'd she give you two questions um first question is is was this manual prepared in-house or do we well we had the benefit of plagiarizing it a little bit and adjusting it yeah it it's a manual yes obtaining the inspiration from uh well actually councilmember bean when he was a council member uh brought the information to me and we uh went through it and i had the seawall engineer that does a lot of stuff around the area look at it he said this is a good basis so at this point the code review board recommended that we make this adopted and then put it as part of the ordinance when we update the ordinance for the sea laws which is in the future so adopting it at this point is you know it's finding i think to go and adopt it and if we want to make modifications we have time to do that because we're taking the uh what i want to call the the code ordinances a little bit of time instead so you know we're just going to take it through the process so the second question then is more directed to the city attorney this has a lot of suggestions about maintenance and how you should do this and how you should do that and what's best what we think is the best practices what i didn't notice and i could have missed this was a liability disclaimer i don't want somebody following this manual and something doesn't go right or they try and do something that maybe they're not qualified to do and all of a sudden they're coming back against our city saying you told me i'm paying 12 emanuel here's what i'm supposed to do and he didn't do it so i'm wondering if maybe i think it would be a good idea to have a liability disclaimer but i will refer to you as a city attorney i think it's a good idea to have a liability disclaimer the purpose of this was to have a policy in place and up till now you've not had a policy and i think this is a good start if this is something the the amendment from my perspective did not pass not because it wasn't a appropriate amendment it was because it wasn't specific what i would recommend that you do is if you want to either table it and have the changed language put in that has been discussed in a disclaimer that would be fine if you wanted to pass it as is and to come back and get very near future with additional parts of it that's fine as well can we pass it and hold off on the issues mr reeves i mean i have no problem passing it tonight with making those two changes i think mr geinberg makes it excellent to do that because if you're putting in place a policy make it a complete policy uh halfway over the fenris policy okay so um i'm not passing together so if somebody wants to make a motion to table if not we can vote on it tonight okay um no discussion on motion to table so this is not being permanent on your table it's going to be very temporarily i would expect to see this at the next council meeting okay i don't think that mr mr reilly any liability will work if you want me to draw it i will but if you have a standard one that you'd like to use i mean just a standard liability disclaimer if this passes um [Music] meeting with uh council member bankers consideration in mind does anybody else have any considerations that haven't been brought up i didn't go to the city let me just do it any city concerns all right we're backless [Music] clear that those two changes will be put in there that he'll do the amending mortgage and you're going to do the disclaimer is that correct yes ma'am okay thank you that's my understanding okay so yes vote the table is temporarily for one session mr riley because there's enough time on that right to make the revision that one should be easy i thought it would be i just want to check okay councilmember aki hi councilmember banker councilmember gunn hi councilmember notaro aye council members flow i'm vice mayor gattis i am mayor manzo all right so the motion is tabled for one meeting to make those two changes and we will bring this back okay item 13 is request the city council ratification of purchase of additional asphalt for a paving project approval of a budget amendment the city manager brought this there was new curving on the project it required additional asphalt to ensure positive drainage and we got hit with 30 some odd thousand as i recall of extra uh charge so uh first motion is what makes the motion again second day again i'll give you the city manager mr reese yes mayor council this is a request to ratify the purchase i authorized the purchase to go forward in accordance with the city code section 2-351 feeling that stopping the project in the middle of the process would not be beneficial to the city and it would cause us to incur additional uh mobilization costs to the city i do have mark here from ajax paving if you have any questions concerning how what happened with the painting and he can explain it the leveling thing that we a brief explanation just for the citizens benefit you know it's not often that we do have overages and most of times these things are always in under budget but this one is a it's a bigger one so we just want to take a look at it so okay my name's mark miller i'm with ajax paving and mark you got to speak right to that mike and you can actually bring that up a little because you're about six foot three and i'm not gonna catch you there all right my name is mark miller with ajax baby go right ahead if you were just a brief explanation to council on you know someone layman's terms about why this happened you know what's happened what was that work over here well ajax got a po from the city to mill one inch of asphalt and replace one inch of asphalt they hired a second contractor to come in and put new curb in and because the existing curb was so flat they had to raise it halfway between the inlets and to encourage positive flow so when they did that we we had to meet that new elevation and we had to take the crown out to the middle of the road which incurred additional asphalt very well explained anybody have any questions thank you okay how much equipment did you have on the job oh goodness paver three rollers um about 70 pieces so to remove that and wait for us to make a decision we had transportation units yeah we've had multiplication awesome yes sir any other council questions stay after one second i'm just gonna i'm gonna come back to council but does any citizens have any questions while we have them here thanks for coming to the meeting today i appreciate that i think from what i saw it was a really nice job so excellent really good job the residents were pretty happy thank you okay back to council any comments seriously you called me explain this to me after the fact i as i told you i did not have an issue with this given what we just heard um you know and i gotta tell you most of the times you bring us projects that are always for the most part under budget okay once in a while they do go over this one's explainable i have zero problems but this is a good decision to move forward with it you know we could have mobilized the council for this but i have a pretty good feeling this will be approved tonight and if it's not it doesn't matter you're going to pay a bill anyway so it's going to have to get proof any other council comments citizen comments back to council last word where you smoke benny oh no so this is a request to the city council to ratify the purchase of additional asphalt for the paying project and approval of a budget amendment made by the city manager price was thirty two thousand three hundred eighty four dollars uh yes vote or and i vote is going to pass this i'll do this by voice vote and right yeah all in favor aye aye aye anyone opposed it's seven to zero it passes all right i'm 14 consideration of an encroachment easement buy-in between the city of bellar beach florida municipal corporation of the state of florida and michael and patricia first motion so good guys second leslie ontario dave gaddis to the city manager okay mr reeves yes mayor council uh in the 70s the city took took possession of the submerged lands and uh in those years people filled their lots before there were sea walls and basically the property if you look in the survey section exhibit a the green area at one time is considered submerged lands in the city and this this has happened to almost every property from 1st street all the way to 9th street but it gets smaller and smaller the property just to the north of this a couple years ago had the same issue when the title company came back and said well hey that's not part of your property so the city at the time developed an encroachment agreement allowing them to utilize the property and that's really what this is uh we're not giving them the land we're just allowing them to use it because it is their backyard and what this was as i said was created uh by is because at the time it was probably water and people came along in the early years of the city and just kept putting dirt in the dirt and they got a little more land and so this is a way to i'm missing something here they filled the land our land not not this property i understand that this happened 20 you said 20 years ago they filled fire owners filled the land our land took it over adversely built a swimming pool a dock pavers and now we want to give it to them free of charge to use in perpetuity we just heard earlier about perpetual eastmans and well some people may wish there was in perpetual license which means we're giving away folks forever we never can come back and take it yet it's our land and i'm wondering is there an easement by prescription at this point i'm talking legal stuff tournament cities that's what i'm talking about here what are we doing here because i lco's getting anything out of this i don't know these people i i it's not i have no access to grind with them one way or the other i went to visit the property today it looks like a beautiful backyard but i mean how many of these are there in this city and how much property is rightfully ours and why are we giving it away so that's three questions if you start first street and you look at the the submerged land in the property freezer you'll see the line is skinnier and skinnier and skinnier as it goes north here up to about 9th street and it runs back into the sea wall and this situation happened with the property as i said to the north and 2 2 plus maybe three years ago i think council member doterra was on i don't know uh no okay so it must have just happened just before that and there was a title issue so this is the exact same document that we utilized then other than fred gave some updates to it attorney has to say i'm just not in favor of giving away any ownership interest in any land that's rightfully the city now that doesn't mean we have to go after these folks and tell them to rip down the pool that would probably not be right um let's put it that way but we're getting a lot of bias here you know 9 30 session here so i don't know if this is ready for prime time but um i'm going to call on you on this one because please advise us legally what we're doing and what we're permanently you know given the city you know giving away the city let me throw one more thing in there our city charters those alienation of lands has to go to the voters that's the charter so whether this qualifies under the alienation clause i'm not sure it talks more about giveaways and sales of parklands and stuff but it is alienation of land i think so i'll throw it all to you and here you go this is why you make the big bucks or the little bucks or not enough bucks i would emphasize [Music] there was a prior situation where this is how the issue was addressed as he stated the purpose of doing this is to help these people resolve a uh title issue the encroachment is there it you know there's no to me there's no question but there's an encroachment on to some large land which is owned by the the cities within the city's jurisdiction you know i not trying to get into a debate but it was certain suburbs land and now it's not submerged land because it was infilled so if you returned it back to sir george land i don't know what a great value you get out of it i don't know when this occurred for all i know my guess would be this took place 30 to 40 years ago and you're basically trying to clear a title issue that's probably been in existence my guess 30 to 40 years so is that the city giving away the land i would say no it's not giving away the one that's not not giving away the land is allowing the uh an easement onto the land for the purpose of uh accommodating these folks and clearing the title issue that's the way i would look at it and it's something you you look the city council did there was a prior encroachment easement i agree with lynn it's to my understanding this is probably a recurring problem and my guess would also be that there was a time period where the title companies when houses were bought and sold probably didn't pick up on this but this is you know i i've dealt with a number of situations lately where uh due to the advances in technology they are able to pick up everything and this is probably one of them so i'm i don't know that i i haven't looked into it from the standpoint of would this be a violation of the charter with alienation of property i my gut feeling is it would not be because you're not alienating the property you are granting an easement which is an interest in the property and from a legal standpoint it's arguable whether that's the alienation or not they have permanent and exclusive easement in over under through and across the property and we're excluded i mean there's a wall there it's not like i could access everyone else i'll slightly disagree with that in section 3c uh it says they'll be responsible for the maintenance and make all necessary prayers etc section 3d said that it shall be supported to any drainage utility or communication easement required by the grantor which is the city to be issues in order to serve the public interest so it also states that the city has a dominant interest they have the subservient interests so from a legal standpoint if the city at some point needed a drainage easement that conflicted with this then this easement would have to yield to the city's need for a drainage easement so i i don't think it's a absolute thousand percent uh giveaway i think it's an accommodation to them and with caveats which includes uh what what is referenced in uh subsection 3d related to drainage utility or communications well you said that you know it was a gut field with regards to the charter i i'm not willing personally to make a vote that could potentially impact the charter because if we violate the charter's grounds for removal so i don't see any emerging need for this tonight um and my feeling would be for you to get more of the gut feel i would like you to tell me that it doesn't interfere with the charter i i really don't like this whole thing but i feel a lot more comfortable if i know it's not interfering with our charter because if it does then we can't believe that if it clearly does then the answer would be no but i don't want to put you on the spot to decide tonight and what i'm saying is do whatever research would be you know i'm i'm not going to tell you to research it but this council says when you research it um then we can get conclusive because we're all liable for our vote if we give this away and it's a violation of the charter and i'm not going to vote for it if i'm not positive i'll call the vote you may i would like to ask the questions to the city manager do it violate the charter at the time they did it before do you know of any charter issue that this would violate no we we did a lot of research because i didn't know how it happened and what what happened in the 70s is the state because of this filling problem gave the documents that i saw and this was two or three years ago in recollection documents that i saw basically stated that this the reason they gave it to us was because people were filling the mitigation or the submerged lands and you know back in the 50s 60s i'm sure there were no sea walls and basically what happened in this example i bought this lot actually the park next to us that's filled also even more so than this one so we saw the signal today that somebody at some point in time when they built their house they had a little lamb to it they went down the street admiral moore land went down the street had a little more land and as if if you go on the property appraiser's website you'll see the angle of the mitigation or the submerged land that the state gave us and and that was the reasoning for it was so the city could control this problem within people failing to add more to their property but it caught up with uh it caught up with mrs her husband is it three years ago four years ago okay same situation and at that time they didn't find any charges either correct no this was the it's an encroachment easily for them to utilize the property we're not giving anything away it's our property i'm not going to rely on paul moreno's expertise from three years ago i'm on fred riley he's our city attorney now so that's where i'm coming from [Music] it could if the title companies catch it then it could be a recurring issue all the way down i mean these are the implications are you know the due diligence kind of thing somebody buys a property well the first thing you do is you order a survey of you know if your sea wall is 20 feet over to the north and 34 feet over to the south what did you scratch your hand and say no you know you better square this away before i sign off or wrench your chair i guess i don't understand how this stuff happens so it's the due diligence kind of thing you know also it's our problem i understand where you try to go for this and try to make it easy for our residents i do have concerns along the same lines as any future interpretation of hey i've had this encroachment he's in now for 35 years why don't you just give me the property to convey the property to me i [Music] for the property that's what's considered similar plans and that's what it was when all this came out anyone else on council i guess i'm confused so now this piece if we print this this piece of land that gets tallied into their property value and they can benefit oh no okay so it's pretty much they're allowed to just go there if you look at it yeah it's not their property value or anything if you look at the diagram the space the little patio actually we might get some of their swimming pool no it's not theirs it may not be theirs but i can't get to it would have trespassing because there's a wall that goes straight to the water the only way you're going to get on that property is to climb through well they have a dock out there you can bounce up at the dock that's not theirs and you can jump on the property it's not theirs and try and tell them that it's ours before the police get there and pretty well for trespassing okay um i don't like this and i'm with clinton god i'm going to agree with him and he's agreeing with me which is amazing in itself but um we we're giving this away the next guy's going to come and you've got approach releasements on our paths you've got to encroach reasons in the park that park june showed me a park this morning where there was all uh foliage and and gardens that are grown over and according to mars being in the past that's approaching i mean there's no limit to this we're going to give away our city and it is a giveaway because we can't get there anymore it's not our water i can't kayak to this anymore because it's filled in so it is their property for all intents and purposes it's walled off it's their dock it's not like that's a public dock i'm going to knock up there we've got no dock at 7th street right let's go use this one okay that'll work right so i mean if this is the information we're given tonight we want to make a vote on it that's fine i'll call the question if we want to do a little bit more homework and get some better research somebody could make a motion to table this thing but um i'm prepared to open this up for the remaining council commons city comments back to council and paul lowe you're also telling me this guy has no perceived increase in his property value because of this the tax appraiser doesn't take that that's not his property it's our property well yeah we're saying that it's not his problem but when somebody walks out of the back door and sees that extra 600 square feet where the seat wall is in the new dock and the swimming pool is filled up but the city's allowed them whenever i don't know when it happened the city's allowed whoever owned that house at the time to put a seawall in put a dock in they've permitted all that all of that's been allowed by the city over the years [Music] when did they move into this house raise some concerns uh when they did the research on this before they sold the house i mean entitlement in in the case yes the title company did raise in within this case in this case it was known because you know their neighbors and what happened and you know so we were just trying to correct it i don't know if we're correcting it but i'm going to come to city commonwealth commons and you may have a chance to speak in a second okay i'm coming to city commons in a second um council any other comments before i move to the city i have one more so how many of these have we issued in the past just one just one and probably when was that do you know four years okay so if we don't give them the same opportunity we gave those other people four years ago then we're looking up another [Music] if we don't do this for this couple and we did it in the past for another resident what kind of life building are we opening ourselves up to them for a long time all we've heard of there's liability constitutional stuff and everything so if we don't give these people the same rights that the other people were given well i i would encourage you to when you make a decision whether it's this evening or another time to act consistently because it's bad practice and you'll have a legal issue inevitably if you are acting in an inconsistent manner because it's a an easement you don't have to write these okay you can as a council decide you're not going to do this and that is a possibility it since my understanding of the situation is that there are other properties along the way and it may have a narrower or wider um parcel then to me the most prudent thing to do given the comments that have been made this evening is to not go forward it's to table it and we will look at whether you are violating the charter again my gut feeling is you're not but i i recognize it's a legal issue and because you're going to you may be asked to replicate this in the future the good practice now would be to make sure you're on solid ground before you pass this one and any other one in the future so that's what i would recommend to them i mean i agree with you fred completely i just want to put a more personal note to this um i don't think it's their fault that they're in the situation and i don't want them to be punished because that could happen to any of us so i mean it's i from the city standpoint we've got definitely i but just keep in mind that these are people these are residents that they didn't ask for this they didn't fill it in you know shovel by shovel to take advantage if anything they're the victims here so we have to keep that in mind too so just want to point that out i'd like to make one more comment lynn alluded to this i i didn't look into it i have no no idea what actually happened i'd look in i said earlier and i'll say it again my guess is this is a problem that in all likelihood was 30 or 40 years ago in the making and whether they have the ability to go to court and seek an easement on their own would largely depend on the facts of of what happened in the past and i i have no idea what that is so again going forward the the better course of action is tableless and let's make sure we get it right this next time yeah i have a question um i'm assuming that the person who received benefit from us four years ago is the next door neighbor of this house is that correct uh going north does it form a point and that's the end of this section of land it keeps going how many homes are we talking about it goes up to almost 9th street and gets closer to the seawall and then it fades away and i understand there's a certain precedent there but most of us are up here because we ran against the past the way this city was being run and running properly so i'm not going to duplicate an error because it was done in the past it was done with a different council that i publicly made my comments about him so mr riley has said i think quite wisely for tonight let's get some more research let's get basic information first off let's find if it's within keeping of our charter which allows us to even make a decision on it if it's not then it goes to the voters if we choose to put it out there um and that we can't change so so if somebody will somebody wish to make a motion here okay we'll all make them fix the motion second second mr reilly attorney bradley will do some further research along with it sounds like mr reese has quite a bit of information too if we get a better package to decide upon here and come back and you know maybe yeah your name so vote yes this all in favor of tabling it anyone opposed it's seven to zero the motions take a table to this point item 15 is request authorization to purchase audio equipment for the community center the explanation is consideration of a budget amendment to upgrade council chamber sound system and microphones in the amount of sixteen thousand three hundred seventy three dollars and fifty cents [Music] broadcast solutions they have a contract with hillsborough county public schools that we can go off of they came in and did an evaluation of our sound system because that's been a big thing a big issue with the console they looked at they took uh ipad and stuff outside the concert chambers to try to get clarity with for anybody that wanted to call in just going forward i think the casual's direction is to eventually have the ability to have zoom meetings for the residents and so this is the first step in that replace the microphones so they're more of a spread out microphone uh these speakers are 12 years old and they are tweaked a little bit better since they came because they did some adjustments on it that day but replacing the equipment that we're talking about uh i think will assist in improving the system so i'm asking for your approval for this you answered a lot of the questions that i had for this the only question i basically want to know is first off this system sounds pretty good tonight okay i mean i'm sitting in the conference room i couldn't hear what people were saying but i can hear the voices now in the past we couldn't hear the voices outside of the bat or you know where john hansen is sitting which is the middle of the chambers right now he couldn't hear voices sometimes so i mean i'm telling you it's it's not audible clear across the hall i think it was audible all night here so it seems like that's working good i understand the zoom thing that was the direction where we want to go but these mics right now i can hear my echo in this room right now and i know it's projecting to the back so i'm just wondering you know do these folks give us a guarantee that this thing is going to work the way we expect it to work because i don't want to spend sixteen thousand dollars and then they're like well we can make a few more tweaks and we're up to 20 and then we're 25. i mean i want to know that this is going to correct the problem if we do this well this this is uh we went over to bel air to look at their system because they're doing kind of the hybrid with the zoom and all of it and this is a company they utilized and we had them come in uh actually councilmember ben was here the day they came in and they played with things these speakers are these microphones are a little out of date maybe a lot out of date but i'd have to defer to nice american ass about that but they also mentioned to us that our speakers are 12 years old and they need replacement that day they were here and they did some tweets on the system and i know councilmember gunn was sitting in the back of the room that day he was here at city hall i think to sign checks or something and they just happened to be here and it improved dramatically to the back of the room but you still got to do this okay before let me ask you sheriff you're sitting all the way in the back did you hear what lynn before you shouted in the mic please give me a thumbs up so they're hearing it even if you talk right now so what what they're proposing to do is a version of the what i call the bar mic that we did an experiment with this is a stand-up mic they're going to replace the mics and then replace the speakers and then they'll test everything and make sure it's all working properly so this is this is just going forward the console on many many occasions has made comments about let's improve the sound system let's do this let's do that so that's where we're at when we spoke last time about how because right now citizens have to come all the way up here to the photo and it's very convenient they're not they're bare well they're kind of facing us but it'd be a lot better if the podium was in the front over here they were directly speaking to us just like you would that's the way it is in every courthouse so are we thinking about i know you and i spoke about that or is that we're thinking about we've got to do some more research about because we'd have to drill into the floor and get it because there is no conduit from the middle of the floor that we can take to that room because that's where the system is but why not use wireless mic well that's a possibility too i guess we did have the wireless here many years ago i think you probably remember them they didn't work very good but you know that's not to say it can't work the other issue is that's plugged into these screens and stuff so putting it there you're not going to have that capability with that equipment unless we bore into the floor and come up with the equipment which it's hollow under here uh i had the luxury of walk crawling under here i have i'm a big supporter of this thing because i've seen the incremental improvements we've made on this thing and i've seen bel air and what's possible what i would like to see with that though is what's the end product going to look like are we going to have videos zoom so somebody can call in and council members can see it and talk to them are we going to have a podium there where people don't have the traits across the room and line up along the wall i mean what's the end vision for what this is going to look like for sixteen thousand dollars that's all i that's all i'm asking for is i support you 100 on this and i want to join the 1990s when it comes to audio visual but i'm sure like well this is is not the be all envelope this is the start to improve our speaking you know for the audience to hear it does work with the zoom out the hall and you can actually hear the person this has nothing to do with moving the podium but we can go back and ask them and has nothing to do with you know we can do the video on the big screen back there but it really has nothing well i guess that's a question i need to have more discussion with concerning that yeah just you know i'm always at the point of requirements-based procurement i mean start with what we expect to see what we want don't have the sound guys come in and tell us exactly what we want we're the customer we tell them what we want build into our specifications well we did tell him what we were trying to do the day they were here we asked them to come in to look at the system we did tell them what the problem was the problem was the sound the microphones the the zoom zoom issue and the communication with somebody being able to talk for them constantly here that's where we went first we haven't went further but if that's what you want me to do then that's fine we'll have to come up with a package and you know it's going to be significantly important yes this is step one basically and uh this i haven't seen this system i started doing a little research but i didn't i didn't spend most of my time on this uh but it's my understanding that this will get this out of my eyes and everyone will still be able to hear us and we will they'll pick that because there are multiple microphones in in one single unit whereas this is just one as i said this is the start i mean the the you know you want the podium we'll talk to them about that maybe maybe there's a you know for not much change you just tell them to change that microphone to a wireless and if you can get near either one of those you can have whatever you want it just takes some wireless [Music] moving the podium that may not cost us anything but but i'll i'll talk to them about that you know that's not a problem but you know if you're wanting to see who's calling in on that video up there that that we haven't wanted is still 2015. that's better than 2020 and that screen is too far away from council members who don't even have maybe that luxury i i think this council my personal opinion again that's exactly it so but we're agreeing now and that's a good thing i think we need to spec this out i don't like the idea oh this is the first installment i don't know where this is going because i would never buy anything from my house that way um i want to know you know we need to come together and say here's our taj mahal project and we want wireless mics and we want to you know all this and the other thing and then we can see what that cost and then we can cut it down to what we really need um and step that because i don't want to spend the citizens money twice i wanted this system to be good for the next 12 15 years we've had this system this one needs to be good for the next 15 years and i agree we got to get into the 90s before we get into 20 you know 2000's but um but i don't want to do it incrementally let's just go there come on little bar bands have wireless microphones they're not that expensive they're in the music catalogs i mean we can review this stuff and get it right where you have a wireless mic and people don't even have to come up here and cause all this trouble you know so you know trouble hopping over wires and stuff well it's sad that we've talked about this over and over and over again and we've gotten this bargain we're not ready to take this step again as far as really the podium when you move that in the middle then you're going to have the gentleman running the camera where he's going to be hitting their backside and maybe we could just move it over to her a little bit where they're still angling this way we don't need a courtroom type setting so to speak we just need to have that be a little bit further into the room but otherwise you're going to run into an issue with him and then you're going to run into another issue with having more cords right over there in his camera we need to figure out maybe a permanent placement for that but my concern is if we have discussed this and discussed this and we have sent you out to do all of this research over and over again and then we're not ready to make a decision i'm just confused why we keep doing this over and over again basically i believe that severe labor and programming do you see the cost of that i'm pretty confident with a charge like that we're going to be able to do audios and you know we're not going to have a big screen up there that we can look at but i believe that we'll be able to interact with people now i could be wrong but you said you you said we went out out the hall but over into the other office and did the zoom and you could hear it okay so you could hear the person that was out there on their ipad right okay and it was nice and clear it was like getting into the mic right now having a conversation back and forth and that's i believe that's what we were looking for and what we asked for uh yes the video would be nice but at the end of the day it's going to be whatever is on the moderator screen i believe that's how it works so probably for a minimal cost not through this company obviously we can go to video in the next step just just a suggestion well does this plan include anything with these tvs because before they were used for presentation so the audience can see what we were seeing when we had our computer here you're talking about the tvs above but i think at some point in time we've got to replace them i mean at one time i thought about taking these two and turning them around so they face the console but well golden we've got the audience back a little bit so that doesn't have any effect and that's why i'm so adamant about having the end product and vision because yeah i have no problem with the auto portion of this but if we try to integrate it with video down the road we're going to find out that the audio stuff doesn't shake hands with the video stuff we've got to start replacing amplifiers or running new bluetooth right on all four this baby sniffs start with the audio but let's just spec it out far enough down the road so that the intention is to have video and zoom in and see the council members see who's calling in and that sort of thing let's just make sure that our contractor understands that whatever we do in the future has got to be fully integrated you buy a bunch of equipment and what council member slope said this is the first time we're stacking out the system we've complained about this video in audio and the citizens have complained about it for quite some time okay it's no one's fault system is getting old i'm amazed you got 15 years out of the system that's tremendous okay but it's time to upgrade and i'm with glen gunn we're gonna upgrade this i have no problem but i want to do it once and i want to do it right and i'm not confident that what we have right here is is gonna work with us he's right we're going to 1990 well that's great but we're going to 2021 here with zoom so i don't want to hear down the road we really can't hear what they're saying on the computer screen that's a different microphone set up wait a minute tell me what let's you know what we're looking well maybe we don't know what we're looking for but let's check out what we really want and make sure everything meshes because the last thing we need is another closet of equipment that you know doesn't work for us did i know maybe we could ask for like a two part system like here's the audio package first and then here's the video package and guess what they do they are compatible but hey let's do this first and then we'll budget for this one at this point i just table it and i'll go back to them yeah that asks for that like you're interested in video down the line but they have to talk but i want you to make it clear that if you want all the bells and whistles and i'm sure vice mayor danis will tell you this it's not going to be cheap so this is another microphones and speakers that's right and then i guess programming that system over there right programming and installing it all but with capability for future upgrades that aren't going to conflict with the ones revival that's fine i'll go back and ask you but when i bring you the culture shock it's not a culture i mean if we can't afford it then that's fine but at least we're seeing what that and maybe it's like any other project that you do you you have great visions and people want to build a house out of marble and then it ultimately gets built out of concrete because marble's just too expensive but let's see what it costs you know scope skype creep and price creep you know we understand it or maybe you just phase it maybe phase one this year this budget cycle is the audio portion next year we phased the video right the game plan is the two are going to talk to one another don't don't start with a blank sheet of paper to design the video and find out it doesn't match up with the audio well this what we did here was what the council kept uh giving us direction about that's what we did here we asked for a rock that's right i think what we're missing here is that there's no there's no outcome statement there's not there's we see that there's a bunch of equipment and installation okay what do we get with all that what's it gonna do for us and maybe if you could get on board to explain it in writing i'd look i want to sign up on this now but if it's not right whenever they bring it in here and they were mad because we spent nearly 20 grand and it still doesn't satisfy our needs that's a that's a tough pill to swallow you know that's what i'm saying to do i'll entertain emotion and i'll ask seven to come to the b that would be good motion motion second and third um no discussion on that so the uh yes vote will take all this for a future investigation by the city manager all in favor aye aye anyone opposed seven to zero emotions table it takes care of the regular business we now move into unfinished businesses or any unfinished business so this is probably a good spot to do it so okay um yes we can so anyway i brought up an issue last month about who he's missing from first street beller shores to well there's one around 17th street in belgium currently and looking into this i brought up there was a permit issued in 2002 a joint permit we did the maintenance we did this installation we did the uh reinstallation they were missing um looking further into this in 2020 we got a permit to remove unnecessary buoys and actually remove delaware's shores from that permit that all said you can go back in the archives and i brought this up because it's a safety issue okay someone's going to get hurt fatal whatever go back in the archives and i want to make this as quick as possible because of the time in 2012 bel air shores noted there were boobies missing i won't use the commissioner's name but he says they need to be replaced their safety their safety need they are effective in keeping votes out he also said saves one life of preventive bad injury it's worth having buoys out okay and some of the commissions will argue about the cost uh fast forward a few years later i'll leave the commission's name out again we don't want to replace the buildings it costs us about ten thousand dollars every year uh bel air shores is only a mile long voters know from the neighboring towns buoys where the limits are okay which is i don't know why we put boxing okay anyway then another commissioner said he agreed with that commissioner after being assured the town would have no liability resulting from the lack of abilities so going in i probably spent a couple hours a week talking to florida wildlife and some conservation going back and forth back and forth they said this is a matter of dollar short should reinstall i brought up navigational orders below below means time orders the state's responsibility he says it is and it isn't municipalities are given the right to establish ordinances which fell our shores has the same almost a mirror ordinance as we have 100 yards you stay out of the boat that all said he also said uh who ticketed any fines from 2002 to 2020 any violations and i said i guess we did since we were the property holder or since we held the permit so um would have been the sheriff well sheriff what ticket book would have been written would have been dollar shores or within valor beach i don't know i you know i don't honestly know what uh well actually it probably was written in our ticket books at the time of those who were going to the sheriff's office for england and um then they looked a little bit further into the dollar shows with the shade stuff and they didn't have an ordinance pass to collect fines at this present time so he said well most probably you guys collected the fines for that 18-year stand that all said he says being such a small town this should be the responsibility if dollar shores doesn't want to do it the county which is like pulling teeth okay all right so i wrote today and i got a lot of you know nowhere so far which i'm not going to give up but it's apparent that we have about 300 homes from 1st street 16th street where the buoys are missing so we get more of a benefit than dollar shores does that they're probably 18 or 20 homes [Music] now we're spoken about spending 16 000 responses how much would it cost because iranis by um fwc to put four buoys one like at third street one in sixth street one maybe ninth street one at 12 street since there's already one there at 16th street that we would pick up the cost as good neighbors now to see if our neighboring town was really acceptable they would say sure if you're going to pay for it you'll do it or no he wants you to get hit okay we'll see who's a good neighbor here okay so how much would it cost to really put four buoys in because he said it would be acceptable to put on the map for additional votes i don't know often top of my head but i can find that out they're saying it's around 500 well the cost of the buoy plus the cost of installations yeah it's maybe a little more than that yeah i think we spent last fiscal year i want to say 18 or 19 000 to replace [Music] and we'd have to go back and ask for the permit he said with permanent there's no cost to apply for no no no no that's not the issue the only issue the person i talked to up there was that they weren't issuing once they're taken out they weren't issuing any permits so we need to well they're not issuing permits under idle speed and the statute was changed in 2020 to 327.46 the blue would have to say no vote voting restriction which is even better so yeah i know that he told me they changed but i mean ever since the fwc got combined back in 1998 and they did away with the florida marine patrol you only have the sheriff when you call on a complaint with the sheriff the sheriff will not do anything because they're saying where's the news all right frank first i want to thank you for how much hard work you've put into this and you're being modest and i'm not gonna say who you spoke to but i've spoken to those individuals about other topics they're like blue spring banker it was frank banker you're all over the place with this in terms of your work okay and it's incredible people have no idea the amount of effort you're putting in and you've got my complete admiration for what you're doing here you have talked to a lot of people and i know it well i'm going to probably keep pushing this won't he push it i have other avenues i'm going to prove the way to get this for us to act to get a resolution is we could do a resolution as a council which you can bring okay um and write it up with what you just said uh seeing what we have to do this council will either pass it or not we can at that point that resolution can instruct the city manager to approach belarushore with the proposal and see what they will say and then like you said they at that point in time in terms of rounding up prices i know having done the budget the last two years and lynn's in the process of doing it right now there's been movie replacements in our budget so we know what costs and we have a pretty good idea what cost to do ours whatever [Music] i'm totally in favor of safety so i'm not gonna say i don't know he has nothing to do so he can have it for you at the consensus is yes right you're going forward with that too yes okay so frank thank you yeah let's move it forward it's summer season any other unfinished business red riley legal city attorney turley report i'm this evening going to give an attorney report which consists of two comments and then an observation the first comment is that lynn and i have worked over the course of the last month six weeks on the uh recommendations made by the code review committee which uh related to changes and amendments to the ordinance lynn and i worked on two specific ordinances for this this current meeting the methodology we used was let's do this a bite at a time rather than one you know gigantic extravaganza type ordinance that had multiple code amendments in it i think this is a much better way it's a much more target specific uh amendments and that's what we will continue to do so i wanted to just tell you the methodology my expectation is next meeting in july we'll have you know likelihood two more and then we'll continue working through the program so that that's the first comment second comment is i had prepared a topic called future amendments to ordinances and i was going to walk through that with you this evening and my guess it would take about 10 minutes i would respectfully request that in the late hour i postpone that to a future meeting and if that's okay that's what i'll do which will lead me to the observation there's a number of things that this evening the council has decided to continue the table tilt for another day and i will just make the observation in in many respects that is a very appropriate way to do things and i'll tell you what you already know the city council you know due to the sunshine law um working with well working with lynn and working with patti we have tried to prepare the things for the city council meeting that we understand are the priorities and that the council needs to address due to the sunshine law you all can't discuss them outside of the confines of this meeting and there's a number of things and i'll just pick the one that was recent memory in this this meeting related to the alienation of property those are things i you know just so everybody's clear i'm not sorry that those come up because those are relevant things you're planning ahead for the future you want to be consistent with your policy and the the reality and i this is the point i want to make to the council i could have spent five hours writing that and i could have spent five hours five more hours researching all everything in florida law and i at the end of the day could have given you a bill for 10 hours worth of effort i didn't do that what i have tried to do in working with lynn and patty i try very much try to do this is be efficient with my time efficient with the focus of what i'm doing and occasionally there are going to be times when y'all discuss things and an issue comes up and then we should table it for another day one of the um i don't know if it's a benefit or curse that i have to work with is most city councils don't have two lawyers on it okay it's a curse most councils don't have two lawyers and you know stayed in holiday and it's personal and i stayed in the holiday in expressways well i will say with the spirit of um goodwill i have the blessing to have two of you on this council although at times you all want to make me pull my air out you got a lot of care i'm not yet that's not getting sick so i'm just making the observation it's not uncommon that things need to be delayed for another day and i'll leave you with this comment what you're trying to do and you demonstrate this again over and over again tonight is despite um at times what may be unconventional ways of trying to get there you're trying to make the decisions that are in the best interest of the citizens who elected you so that's my comment at times um this is a messy process but it's necessary to do the things the way you do them in order to get the best outcome you can and that i hope that's one of the citizens came up to me and talked to me in the break and he told me i had sage legal advice and a calm demeanor and i told him i very much appreciated the comment and i i hope i live up to that in doing the role that i have so um that's that's my attorney report for this evening and certainly will stand in for any questions that you may have i you know i'm oftentimes find myself in a position of you know finding things and stuff in here and i don't want you know there's not a lot of people left in the audience but people will watch this take i i want people to be clear about this okay i'm not doing this to say ooh fred i found something you didn't okay you could have three attorneys look at something and get five different viewpoints on it because that's just what attorneys do but i'm looking at it from one angle fred might be looking at it from another he's trying to draft it to make it a cohesive document i will say this and i'll i'll debate anybody on this council or anybody in this city fred riley is an excellent attorney excellent i would vote for you again if you come up again this year will look at your contract and i'll be voting for you again you're fair you're smart and you look at and you work with people and i think you have a very excellent demeanor in terms of when we get these these hot button issues on how you can defuse things sometimes so um i think you're perfect for the city that's my opinion and i don't know if other people have different opinions but when people hear me saying something that we found this or we found that that's not a knock thread we want the best law out there because in the end when we as a council pass it i take ownership of that law and the last thing i want to find is three years from today somebody beats it to the ground in a courtroom i don't want to find that i want to make sure we put out the best thing you can put out if it takes a little longer so be it it takes a long long a lot longer time to fight a lawsuit so you're doing a great job as far as i'm concerned i do have one comment but i want to open and i have to bring this up as a matter of public concern in this city i brought this up to the city manager's attention last month i did not hear back from him i didn't hear back from you but i didn't ask him to speak to you so i do need to bring this up okay earlier tonight i had to invoke the recusal process which is section 286.012 there's also as you know voting conflict statute of the florida statutes which is 112.3143 voting conflicts i did that out of an abundance of caution and advice from council from the ethics but we have a situation on this council it's been ongoing for a month and a half which may or may not be a similar situation and i'm not hearing similar recusals so i'm going to lay out the facts to the city and then you can do what you wish and you can give me whatever advice you wish okay the situation has come up that our city manager has sold his house and he sold his house on june 7th and that's not a problem in itself he sold it for 640 000 it was a beautiful house it sold very very quickly um i was told by a citizen that the house was for sale prior that was back in may i believe and um i believe i did question i said to you i spoke with you briefly on that and he said speak to the city manager about his intentions he told me his intentions that although he's not going to be in bellar beach he was going to be still with us that was all i was concerned about that he was going to still be our city manager um but when we went around the block to look at the listing sign we just focused the broker's record on the house on the for sale sign and that raised the potential conflict issue with me so i spoke to the reeves about it and he said that he had um utilized about two bids for bidding it out that's up to him how many bids he had um but the situation is as follows the real estate as i don't know these are the facts the fact is there was a sign in front of the house that was for sale we spoke with the listing broker that was a listed item um that was a documented listing we had a copy of that listing and um the situation comes in and that typically the listing broker receives a commission i don't know if that was the arrangement or not i don't have the contract but that would pull into question since julie's work stories open works for this council closes and pulls up to question several ethics issues and that would be basically an ongoing conflict um she does and we do the reviews we do the evaluations we just approve the budget uh change or ordinance change that gave the city to turn a city manager forms um latitude so the question comes in is do we have conflict of interest under 112.3143 even if we don't do you have the situation that i was in tonight that there was no conflict of interest but there's a perception of conflict of interest 286.012 and i'll tell you this a citizen has called the state ethics board informed them of the factual situation and the response from the state ethics board was this is a matter of serious concern for them so no formal charges as far as i know have been done i've certainly not filed any formal charges but it is important for me as the mayor of this city before we start going into the budget season and having a lot of votes and then potentially being invalid to bring this up to you inform you of the situation and see what's the best course of action and disappointment before you answer me i've made the comment since obviously you know discussing me yes i was a listing agent i was not a broker my brokerage i worked for them so what you're saying is like man couldn't walk into dave gaddis's company and buy a part from them because he was so [Music] you're basically saying that my profession i can't sell a private residential property because it interferes with something that you think is an ethics violation which is not i checked with my broker before i listed it and it was not an ethics violation because it is a private property it's not a city property i can list any residential home i want to list you're trying to mess with my profession now and that is not right and i'm telling you what if we want to go down that road group and you are incorrect on several facts it did not sell for 640 and since you wanted to publicly state that it sold for 665 and what my sellers do or their intent to do when they sell home is their private business i don't discuss that with anyone but i work for brokerage i do not have to stand back and say i can't take a listing when that's my profession everybody in this council knew exactly what my profession was prior to me running and prior to getting on here so you're saying that we can't do any kind of business with any other person because of our city council then you're interfering with one profession i [Music] if you keep this up we're going to be here at 11 o'clock because i'm going to adjourn the meeting and get with the city okay we'll return for five minutes i want to see the city manager attorney in the conference room to discuss miss trump's actions we'll decide you certainly do okay and the point of order is she's out the door you cannot say what my reason were intentless i never said anybody committed an ethics violation i said these are the ethics things that are implicated is there a situation here this is a matter of city business and her broker it doesn't matter what her broker says it matters what florida ethics success that's what's that question not her broker now with that mr riley okay my comment is i would suggest to the city council that i look into this situation and and i will dutifully get back to the city council with what what i uh my review what whatever it yields that's the only fair way to do that the you would really briefly mentioned that to me a long time ago i don't even know when it was probably two months ago or almost a month ago or whatever and my suggestion at that time as you stated was to contact lynn and discuss it directly with him which now i understand you did um you of course can't contact rita because of the sunshine law so you you know in an ideal world outside of state government you would have been able to go to each person but you can't do that so you did the part that you could do and this is another instance where as messy as it is it has to be brought up in a public setting and to be fair to everybody concerned the only reasonable thing for me to do is to [Music] look into it further and not do that with a pronouncement after we've been in a meeting for four hours and 43 minutes and give you uh some assessment of the merits of the case i i really would prefer not to do that and i think it's absolutely fair to everybody concerned i'm not asking for you to do that here in terms of people doing their profession you can perform your profession with anyone you want you're performing for your employees that's where the issue comes in if that's not understood then let's turn it over i'm going to request that this matter i want to hear what you have to say but i would really like to see a written letter from the state ethics in terms of how they view this thing because if they are taking such a strict view that a mere hint of a a benefit on a motion to say we're not member of a lawsuit needs to require a recusal then i want to see what their opinion is on this well i'll make another comment in my role there are times when i know about a situation ahead of time and i'm asked for legal advice prior to somebody acting in this situation is the opposite way it would appear to me from what has been said some action has already been taken there are times that the lawyer has a the ability in working with people wanting to understand what actually happened and secondly to propose a remedial measure and i don't know whether that's available for some this situation or not but i am saying again the only reasonable thing for me to do is to not comment further and give both old people involved an opportunity to explain what the situation is and i will again dutifully respond to you in the city council in a written format that's fair and fair everyone involved i would like to make one final comment um when i give review lynn that review is the same as the year before just so the entire city council knows there was no changes except for his goals i did not have a listing at that time he didn't call me for an interview until way after that so it did not have any impact on anybody's brains or anything that i did so i mean you're trying to make something out of nothing because you're just furious right and let me tell you what i'm thinking okay i'm thinking you don't know your ethics rules because it has nothing to do with it has to do with the appearance of the impropriety the appearance of your humanity and mistakes mr riley i'll be waiting for your report i have no other comments any comments from the city for the city attorney now we move on to the city manager mr reeves yeah mayor console uh i've given you a bell or short bellar beach comparison report under my tab with the sheriff's office over the last four months because i wanted to kind of update you on this service we keep talking about what the sheriff's doing for us and what they're doing next door and there were last month's meeting i thought there were some misrepresentations of several items and i want to just give you this over the period of january through april the city of valor beach had 242 calls for service the city of miller shore had 12. the i know there's i've received several emails and there was a statement made about breaking the beach in dollar shore uh and i get the impression based on what's being been said is that we shouldn't be doing anything for anyone well we shouldn't give city hallway to our condo associations internal training fire districts uh bel air is usually venice county we spend over 500 a month across the street maintaining a pond that is not the city of miller beaches and the county gives us nothing for that so you know i this is just some thoughts that need to be thought about uh the gulf boulevard money there was a comment made that they didn't give us anything better sure gave us 795 dollars of that alaska full of penny there's another 1 million 105 000 potential and uh i think i'm going to have to go to dollar share and see if they're going to give us that because that's with the boulevard beautification our portion of that is 2 million 946 000 and they have a 1 1.1 million contribution and i think uh unless the council has a problem with that i need to have that discussion with them because this is part of our overall underground project and that's all the money can be used for the way the interlocal agreement reads it says that the funds can be given to our beach i found nothing in the previous agreement other than the same language and i have found no documents that say we did anything other than what we did we took the money and did things down to omar for the beautification so i just want to you know let instead of you know some of the misrepresentations but let's be clear you know bell shore gave us 800 000 for about boulevard so of their money and i i do want to clear up there's been no lawsuit to my knowledge uh no claim against the city for any of the beach lots to my knowledge there's never been a claim i think that was uh spoken tonight and that i thought there again it's just misrepresented you know there was a claim for for uh morgan morgan not not bel air shore so we didn't have any claim there so uh something that's come up uh the governor hasn't signed the bill yet but if this mandate happens it could cost us anywhere from thirty to fifty thousand dollars there's a stormwater needs assessment mandate and i've been following it but so far he hasn't signed it uh the budget was sent at your desk tonight so you can start reviewing that the assessments for the bellevue estates island uh currently the people that are paying cents 1611.70 their assessment's going to be reduced to 313 and the 12 1267 group is going to be reduced to 1103 in next year's taxable assessment and then there's four homes that were paying 418 because they paid part of that firm theirs is going to 383. the audit committee our audit proposals we've got two propulsions one from our current auditor and one from another auditor the audit committee is waiting tomorrow night to go through those uh who's the other one was the other order uh was the schnitzel on the and their bid their base bid was 25 000. our auditors basically was 17 500. so but the audit committee is meeting tomorrow night to look at those uh the storm water the flood map changes uh there's a girl in the county lisa foster's been going around giving presentations i put a copy of the prayer presentation in your binder there's just really i know vice mayor heard it in the big c but just a couple things that i want to highlight on page seven in that day 12 of the county firm map was received a decrease in the beaches elevations received a decrease as an example a lot of the homes that were in the bfd 10 foot in this end of town went to eight foot and then eight percent of the counting which is mostly up in the upper tampa bay the oldsmar area they had bse increase the county is did a vulnerability study this study was started in 2012 by fema the county uh did a vulnerability study that started in uh 2017-18 time frame and their vulnerability and that's something that we're going to have to discuss over the next coming months because the maps are taking effect august 24th what the count is proposing is to add three board to if the bfe dropped to eight and it was ten then add two more for a free board to leave it at the same uh but that's that's something that uh the city council and we can discuss further if you go to page 17 they basically are saying do nothing except the maps as they are we of course received our copies of the new maps and hold the line the county's position or the lisa foster's position is we should go what the vulnerability study is and it's kind of mixed and i really don't based on what i know from the meetings i've been to i think the county-wide most of the staff deals that they'll get pushed back if they try to raise up too much so as i mentioned uh currently and i just use this in the town because the bfd dropped two feet if you go to belleville bellevue state's island area the bfe dropped a toy you were 10 now you're nine i've got the map available if anybody wants to come and see it it doesn't go into effect so if you go to page 26 to do nothing [Music] adopt the hold the line is adopted as the counties among the vulnerabilities study and make the firm via being current free board higher to relate to current conditions or integrate new data for the 100 year to 500 years possibly which means the rewards too and just to clarify what the freeborn means is i'm adding a foot to the elevation there are some cities that have three foot of reports so if your bfe is 10 you have to start your first floor with 13. so that you know it's just higher up the risk rating for that's coming out is called risk 2.20 they're starting to do some training on that so we can kind of find out a little more information because how they're going to rate your flood insurance is going to be based on this new risk factor so it's a little different than previously when they really looked at what the bmvs were so just just some information for you vice mayor if you've got any other comments that you've heard you know it was interesting that fema would go one way and pinellas county would go another it's basically you had conflicting information it went down in one direction with fema and it went up in pinellas county and what pennells is trying to do is they're trying to reach a general consensus uh amongst all municipalities that uh that we select one or the other of these three choices basically and the presentation was swift it was a lot of information and very little explanation to go along with it to back it up so i spoke with several mayors today about this and what their towns and cities were had agreed upon and some went with the extreme high some decided to do nothing and uh i so far i haven't heard anyone say well we'll take the new fema standard um that being said they only gave us two weeks and this is the first we've had because of the sunshine this is the first one that we've been able to discuss at all the problem is every town that i've spoken to they don't have enough information to make a good educated decision so it's still that they're asking for more and i i'm certain they're going to have to come back and do another presentation maybe it's something we should look into exactly they are because the part part of the problem is the fema did this vulnerabilities that counted in the vulnerability study years later from the time that being started so and the new insurance risk rating system is going to change how they rate as opposed to what they do now and we haven't got clarification on that as an example and i'm gonna use my former house it was a 10 now it's an eight okay so is that going to make my 4 600 flood insurance go to down they're they're telling us you know the female people are telling us probably not it might drop a little bit but not much uh so that clarity has got to come out because probably the biggest issue with the residents is what's it going to cost me right and and what i'm seeing is if you if you side with the study that was done the modified fema standard uh basically then you're agreeing that oh okay everything new must be higher therefore everybody is lower they're gonna get deemed to do that and that's that's not what we want no and uh i think it was uh uh safety uh pete beach i believe i can't remember which which town it was but they said yes we adopted them both and we're writing it in our code right now well there are some cities but but as i said there's a lot of cities that feel the staff i'm talking the staff feels that they're going to get pushed back from their residence because because of this situation and uh you know if it's gonna cost some more money or you know start raising standards it's not gonna affect any house that's built down it's you know i went when fema was proposing these maps four years ago three and a half years ago i went to that hearing i went to their presentation i sat with the engineers millions of dollars years of study and we're going to have local officials who know nothing oh yeah let's put two more for the free board and just invalidate their entire study this is unbelievable that local people would just basically you serve the government agency and say let me know more than that yet don't and i can't believe it i can't let yeah let's bring this up here but um i'd love to have one of the fema people come in and tell me how much research was done versus what one of these other city mayors have done or one of these other city councils have done um or the county for that matter okay to me the whole idea that it was dropping and the ve zones were changing because that's also a part of this is great okay it certainly changes the build the buildability of certain lots and then what you have to do to put an actual resonance there and it cuts your costs if you if you become a go from a ve to an a so and then for local people just come and just say dismiss it oh we know better you don't know better i completely think this is absurd at this point our ordinance is currently have auto adoption in the map which takes effect august 24th and that doesn't mean that we can't change something later but our our ordinances have already been cleared by the state fd fdem excuse me and fema has verified that and sent back that yes our ordinances are good to auto adopt and accept the maps but we can we can adjust so just because we auto adopted doesn't mean that we can't change something later if we want to currently our building is set with affordability code it's whatever the bfe is plus your input what what they're proposing as i said is well maybe the city needs to adopt an ordinance that says free board or i mean bfe plus two foot or whatever it is so this is a what i call an ongoing process and i'm not sure that based on what i've heard from other city staffs i'm not sure that they're going to get a consensus on this so that that's that for now and we'll have some more discussions last thing i have hang on frankly of course is you know what i'm saying because that  probably sailed two years ago now yeah yeah no that's not going to happen i'm interested to see and we haven't got any information i'm really interested to see what this risk 2.0 and how that works with the insurance to say be able to say and when they do start the training uh i'll definitely cue in on it to find out because because i want to find out okay if this house was at this level of the elevation what's happening here are you changing the parameters for how flood insurance is bigger so we need to clarify that and they haven't really done that and that's probably part of the problem we've got this county's vulnerability study which says oh you got a bill to you know i think uh they said that these zones you got to go for 15 feet or something so and that's the coast and you know we've got some issues with uh even condos in our city and their flood insurance i think it was like 250 000 for 32 units you know and uh mr baker talked to me about it last week you know they're in a repetitive loss area because they had several claims at some time but the last thing sign replacements here's what the insurance guy told me i'm going to give you 4 000 and that's all i'm going to give you well i'm like that's the depreciated cost of the old sign and i said wait a minute don't i have some replacement value well yeah i do but that claim's been out there for a while and it's time to move on so we went back to the company the modified signs double-sided not v-shaped the price dropped into like the 39 thousands but i did tell the insurance agent hey give me a little time here to have this discussion with the council so i'm going to ask at the work session that we have a discussion on that sign for the question so we've resolved this because he's ready to give me four thousand dollars and i'm saying wait a minute before you told me you're gonna give me ten or twelve thousand dollars [Music] something to ponder as i said you've got the the budgets you've got the backup and the work session is on the 21st 21st and uh that that will do pretty much what i did last year in the zoom meeting i'll go through and highlight everything but this gives you some time to look at you've got the details in the second part of the budget uh the ad form you've also got that in there our property values went up six 6.03 i believe it was for this year uh so all of that's in there there as i said there are a couple things in there you're going to see like in the stormwater this i put 30 000 in there for this house bill if it doesn't pass it doesn't pass uh the sheriff's number that's another discussion we're going to have to have and get us once and for all because if we're going to say we want our our own debit it's going to cost us about sixty thousand dollars more than other costs with the increase for next year because they're they're getting a 3.6 and i put that in your packet also so that's all i have unless you have something for me questions for city management city council residents okay thank you next you come to the city court okay no nothing nothing questions for city clerk citizens city council comments we start this month with robin no major comments i just um i want to thank fred because we've thrown a lot at you this meeting and you have a lot of homework to do so thank you for everything you do i greatly appreciate it i agree completely with uh mayor manzo that you are the man for this job and you are perfect for it despite all of our best efforts to deter you but thank you for everything you do thank [Music] [Music] reported that they they kind of took on our state council he needed to prioritize what code enforcement needs to be looking at i sat down with jimmy as i sat down with laura about women and approached some of the numbers we went back a year the 2020 through april 2021 and we focus primarily on the calling complaints because the assumptions mean that if a person is willing to make a call in that they would have concerned about it and that's a [Music] survey says landscaping yes you do need police and the next three categories which comprises eight percent of all the call-ins the next slope the next one was trash but it was only 16 parking 15 construction 13 percent followed by that the number one contender is definitely a landscaping last issue i've been thinking about the traffic congestion issue here and i want to just make a short pitch and you know you can save your bronze in the eye rolling here for a little bit but i'm going to pitch something that i've never heard a discussion about and that's about a roundabout just like up in the clearwater beach there and if you're willing to take some time and do a little research there's there's some information out there on the web if you even put it into uh youtube there's a two minute and four minute presentations the uh the national highway transportation people they're they're really pushing it a lot of states are converting a lot of the four-way stop intersections to roundabouts because here's what they're finding they're finding let me just hit some of the cookbook stuff the footprint typically fits within the normal right-of-way away intersection there and they are more efficient regardless of what your initial impression is or roundabout you know the traffic moves slower yeah the traffic moves slower but it's continuously moving people are entering and because of the slow speed even if you have an accident and because of the angle which the cars are moving instead of deflecting when you have less fatalities and less injuries they are typically get 20 to 50 percent more flow through around about their forward stop intersection [Music] they're greener you can do things in the center of these things aesthetically and they're much greener and also when you talk about that when there's no weighting you don't have cars ironing at stop-light burning gas so they're much more fuel efficient when you're talking about the environment we talked about the safety of these things a lot of people roll their eyes about oh yeah roundabout or whatever but what they find is after they install these things despite all the pushback and controversy about it initially after people started using the darn things the acceptance level goes through the roof so it may be something we want to discuss or pitch at the county and say hey you know it makes sense clearwater beach is using it and you know i've never sat there for any length of traffic is always moving and you don't see long lines waiting at that traffic somewhere that we should pitch to the county and consider that's all i have to tell you listen to tara [Music] on 13th street um and he has stressed that many people on 13th street as well as 12th street would prefer not to have that eyelid removed when we're discussing all these different traffic issues and everything it really helps them get out from their street with that island there so they're just wanting me to bring that up during the city council meeting and ask that you not consider that so i just wanted to throw that out otherwise i don't have anything else at this time thank you memorial they honored the deputy magley's family was there that was the officer that was first officer that was killed in 100 years it was an extremely moving ceremony and jim and i were privileged to be there met a lot of a lot of the politicians but more importantly we paid our respects to the brave men and women that gave their lives in our defense here for this uh this county it's a very sad ceremony but um it's a very moving ceremony if you ever have a chance to go to i highly recommend it and secondly i had the privilege of addressing the mayor's council of pinellas county as an executive board member on the emergency management services committee and the purpose was to discuss the cad system which is the computer-assisted dispatch system i'm not going to go through it it's a half an hour thing but we've got about seven or eight different systems in pinellas county right now that have been installed over the years and they don't perfectly sync well together there's a lot of patches that are put together to make them work and right now most of them are at the end of their useful life so what we're doing is trying to get one system that police fire ambulance everyone would be able to utilize that was a recommendation of the executive board mayor's account and i had i asked if i could make a presentation for the mayor's council we're trying to get support from uh from uh council member councilman gus villarrakis there may be some money in 2022 we're looking at about an eight to ten million dollar project here and there might be about two million dollars available so i made a presentation i'm pleased to report that 24 mayors signed on every single mayor of the county side and we gave the congressman a letter signed by 24 of us asking for that money which had a lot more effect than having four of us on the five of us on the executive board asking for it so i'll keep you advised as to how that's going i'm hoping that that system will move forward something we've been talking about for a couple of years now um that's all i have on uh tonight and with that i'm going to ask for a motion to adjourn in a second and all in favor"
