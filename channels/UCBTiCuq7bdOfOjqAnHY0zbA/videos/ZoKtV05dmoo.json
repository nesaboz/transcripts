    "transcript": "it's now 5 pm the august 1st 20 22nd special council meeting will come to order please rise and join me in the pledge of the united allegiance of america and to the recovery which stands for nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice teddy would you please call her councilmember frank banker here councilmember leslie otero here councilmember lloyd roberts here council member mike sable here vice mayor glenn gunn mayor dave gaddis here interim city manager kyle riefler city attorney randy mora and councilmember jody shirley thank you patty we have one item on the agenda which is to discuss contract negotiation parameters with city manager candidate ken c griffith in the last meeting vice mayor gunn volunteered to work on a list of initial expectations and methods of tracking progress i'm going to hand it right over to vicente thank you trying to mail this out but uh ran into some difficulties there might talk about that later on i hope that everybody would have been able to go to back to their evaluations of their prior city manager because obviously we can't do it now but it would be nice for everybody to go back and look at the goals and objectives they set forth for the next evaluation period for lynn reeves some of the uh as background uh i think we're all pretty much in agreement that we're likely to exceed the projected budget for a new city manager therefore i think it's incumbent upon us and a good justification to look at obtaining some sort of satisfactory return on our future investments so with this goal in mind i propose that the council considers some of the below expectations of objectives and i just uh this is just a random beat that i pulled off kind of uh in the vein of how the federal government runs within the first hundred days of employment the new biller beach city manager shall report back to the city council regarding a plan of action for the following areas and i don't mean when i say a plan of action i don't mean a discreet detail a plan of how he's going to do it but give us just a rough overview of what he's looking at thinking about going through his head and a cursory review of what he's seen in some recommendations number one at the top of the list is establish and implement a structured grant policy or process this process should proactively seek alternative or supplemental funding for any future or existing belair beach initiative project or acquisition although primarily focused on capital assets and infrastructure projects this process shall not be limited in scope the goal shall be to maximize any available non-city funding wherever it's possible as a minimum this belair beach grant policy shall number one designate a grant process owner i want to know who owns the process and the policy of seeking out grants for the city of military beach number two outline a method for evaluating and tracking grant applications for integration with the capital improvement plan and the budget processes this needs to be a proactive program not just a matter of waiting for something to fall into our laps it's time to get out there and actively look for and seek out any and all grants that might apply to projects that we need number two develop an integrated city of baylor beach dashboard or scorecard it should consist of a handful of intuitive and easily comprehensible metrics that communicate the status and health of biller beach to the council and our residents areas of interest would be the strategic plan goals such as the budget the capital improvement plan and code enforcement number three review and update the city of miller beach personnel policy to ensure that personnel staffing organization job descriptions responsibilities evaluations and accountability all accurately align with the existing conditions number four review the capital improvement plan and provide recommendations regarding improvements to better prioritize accelerate or reduce costs number five continue to embrace technology wherever feasible the goal is to streamline and improve communication with the council and our residents timely floral proactive and transparent communication with the council cannot be overemphasized last continue progress for improving gulf boulevard aesthetics and resiliency this includes undergrounding of utilities improved lighting and measures to reduce traffic congestion thank you very much vice mayor rudy shirley what would you uh what would you add to this and uh do you have some basic ideas that you think would qualify the new city manager i think glenn had i wish i'd had this prior to now um it would have been very nice um but what did i hold you there right there one second i don't want to get into sunshine rules and all of that in this meeting so let's just pretend like this is your first opportunity to see this and then in the next meeting at the end i will or during the uh city attorney comments i will ask randy to address this no i mean it wouldn't definitely be nice to have had some something to look out but um but either way i think glenn did he highlighted many of the areas 100 days is is a generous amount of time to give him time to pull this together i think that possibly could be shortened if we got a high-powered executive that we think we've hired then this that time i think could be shortened so we can see what is or maybe shorten the timelines on some specific points so we can see what we're dealing with and know right at the beginning whether or not we've made the right choice but if we're following this you strategic plan and um focusing on many of those goals that are listed in there we know that the employment evaluations and job descriptions are kind of a key point some of them don't really align with what our staff's doing i can see the reason for each one of these objectives and i think it's a great lesson to start with thank you um one of the uh one of the things that i noticed about this particular set of objectives 100 days of employment you generally know within that first three months who you've got we've all dealt with people that sold sold as a certain type of work ethic and then they didn't deliver and then they had to be addressed so um one thing that i would definitely like to see following this outline is we sit down with the city manager and develop some realistic goals that are attainable we know that they can be done but definitely something to show off the talent that we've been sold my table okay um basically from my experience what i see here i like absolutely uh the hundred days is really not a factor to me first of all they serve it our pleasure i mean at day one we don't like it he can be gone but monthly every month we receive a formal report from the city manager it doesn't take much for one of us to ask hey how you doing on the dashboard how you doing on this second most of us are in contact with city hall at least you know two three five times a week and frequently over here it's not a major mystery to us nothing should be ever a surprise because we're talking to them they're not going on for 100 days in a small cabinet somewhere you know we will know what they're doing it's constant feedback so the idea of you know is 100 days too short don't get fixated on it look we got monthly formal reports and we're in contact daily so what we have here is a good structure yes i would like some of the city manager's feedback because you know this is basically a contract and we want to make sure that we have properly positioned them for success you know just like we do with each other or with any new hire or even with our bosses we try to set up our bosses for success by agreeing on a good set of ground rules and expectations to be conquered over the next three months four months a year you know go back to that strategic document not only is it a hundred days but talk to them about look how are we going to integrate this into the strategic plan where do we want to see you in three months six months a year three years that's it thank you thank you very much councilmember tara yeah the one that sticks out to me most is the um the grant policy in progress and as i i'm assuming you all get the quality cities magazine and in here i noticed that the florida cities has the florida league of cities as a grants assistance program that they have over 9 000 track grants that you can do it which i i did not know about but i think that could be a big help to our entire city staff so especially whenever the candidate sells himself uh with with that talent that's that's one of the things that attracted me to it was that he believes he can get us some grants that we have missed so uh yes um first of all i think glenn did a great job in my opinion the background section really isn't necessary at all i would expect all of these objectives to be um pursued by whatever the salary is of a new city manager that doesn't really matter in my opinion all of these things we should be conveying to the new city manager again whatever the salary is so in my opinion i would remove that because it's kind of implying the only reason we want them to do these particular objectives is because we feel like we're paying outside the boundaries i don't think we should be conveying that message these are just things that we think are important and we want the city manager to pursue i'm going to uh throw this out that would probably get you to it but uh for at least the last two terms that i'm for sure the the council has been emphatic about trying to get grants and trying to push the city manager to get grants and we've always been told there's none out there so um it's it's not like we didn't try it just uh we didn't there were no there was no fruit uh that came from us so uh councilmember baker thank you mr mayor um i'm really totally confused on this whole process that we've gone into um back in march i made a proposal let me give the city manager the job see how it works out one council member just said tonight if this guy doesn't work out we can release he is an outro employee with very little you know demand on litigation and everything else the other thing is we did numerous workshops and i never i reviewed some of these workshops i never saw us exceed the 110 000 mark was connected that said what kind of disservice did we do to the 28 or 27 other candidates that applied um and did i just remember banker i'm gonna have to call a point of order because this has already been decided and we're now into the negotiations phase that's the purpose of this meeting so please try to stay on topic and let's not let's not go backwards well i i am on topic i believe that i'm i'm uh i don't believe your point of order is valid right now the city attorney can pledge that because i'm still on the topic of hiring and we're in the negotiation phase and as one council person said at the last meeting are we just negotiating i don't want to plagiarize it but because it's the last man standing um this this is just confusing uh we're bringing this guy on because of the grants he believes he can get us uh what pandora box do we open when you take a public grant uh we like this nice little secluded city that we have so what kind of pandora box do we open if we take a grant and i have to let a lot of public access i believe that this uh this whole thing should be tabled it should be reworked and it should go back to uh an employment search for a city council manager that we're willing to pay 140 000 plus for and publicize that figure i think we would get a lot better thank you very much for those comments all right uh so uh yes vice mayor i just wanted to add for lloyd's benefit that the background is just an introductory for actually our because our our sake that's all just making sure everybody's on the same page why we're doing this the objectives are really annoying all right um so what we've got here is we sort of have a template that uh vice mayor gundy has set up for us the goal tonight is to give the city attorney some direction on what the council would like to do what parameters he needs to have to go into negotiations with um with ken prison so we have already discussed salary let's bring that up again i did not want to bring it up the other night and so now that council member banker has brought it up let's just continue on with that council member banker let's hear your comments on on the salary range beyond what you just said i believe that we should stick to our blueprint format that we agree all agreed on i believe i'm not going to mention no names some council members say we will not exceed 110. let's offer him the 110 000 if he produces some type of grants that's not going to impact our city uh includes our seclusion and way of life we accustomed to uh we can always up his salary another 20 to 40 thousand dollars he produces what he says he can reduce which i don't believe can thank you very much i think i think before we actually go straight into salary we need to define what that is what is the salary is it is it combined is it several things is it just the gross pay and nothing more what what is the salary package so i'll go to leslie mataro now last week we were talking with mr president i see i think someone was saying you know we can pay you more because we aren't going to have to hire outside engineering firms we're not hiring an engineer we're hiring a city manager and i think it's better for the city if we have some sort of a need an engineering consulting work to go to an outside engineering firm there are lots of reasons for that we're not hiring an engineer we're hiring a city manager so i think the 110 000 is a more appropriate place thank you very much boyd roberts yeah in response to frank's response i know we had conversations regarding for example posting the salary range and i remember vice mayor glenn talking about and we had some conversations about this that we don't really want to do that which i thought was made sense because we want to leave the opportunity based on the skill sets and talent of a potential city manager that we may want to go over and above what we could possibly print and that might cause a challenge so i know we had conversations about that where we weren't going to hold any magical number like 110 or 115 000 we were simply going to base the salary offer based on the skill sets and background and talents that the new city manager may bring to the table so i thought that was an important point at that time and that's what we kind of decided to go with which is why we're not going to put in the job advertisement what the minimum and maximum ones so that's what i recall you're correct the minutes were approving june 30th we had a motion that was made by councilmember zabo that we would put a salary cap second invented by banker and a salary cap of 123 000 that failed and vote with the council no one agreed to put a cap on it so we agreed to move forward because we didn't want to hand high ourselves with the salary cap thank you for uh reminding us would anyone else like to comment on that okay um i gotta really draw your finger back here first of all 140k i don't want to insult some people out there frankly it's kind of low i mean hell myself i'm over 60k over that thing you need to take a look at all the average salaries top six people that number was 133 666 dollars that is the average of all top six people that we reviewed so you're already starting in that area next i've identified 20 000 savings from stopping the accounting software next some of the council pushed through kind of at the last minute a stipend for the acting city manager 24 000 a year and that was done really without even looking you know hard at the budget so that's there frankly you start adding all that together you got the money and the same rules true for any position in this country look if you're worth it you can go elsewhere you're gonna have to pay for this yeah it sounds kind of callous coming from a city you know council member but i'm a citizen as well i want the best for this city and that meant going through the due diligence for over you know two three months listening to the citizens listening to the candidates reviewing their qualifications and that's where we're at you can get a solid performer yeah it's going to be 140. i would vote to approve that or you can throw it to the wins and take your chances frankly your chances are not good when you talk about headhunters i went through most of the hiring you know practices throughout florida when i was reviewing this and you start seeing the same candidates over and over again there's a limited amount of them but you have a large number of people that believe that they're qualified so you'll start seeing them show up all through the state applying for the city manager position hell down the street it's 135k so getting the head hunter it's not going to get you anything that we haven't seen so again i found the savings it's there and i vote to approve 140k for this thank you thank you vice mayor gunn my thoughts are kind of along the same lines i i think we looked at salaries and we we sliced and diced in three different ways and came up with what we thought was a target and that's what it was it was just a target just to give us a parameter and a starting place what we're looking for is a particular set of skills because i think we have some requirements and some goals and objectives we're trying to get to and i think you're going to have to pay for that and i think we're taking a realistic appraisal of how it works and i'm not about to settle just because the original target was in a certain parameter i think we're looking for a skill set to take this city bella beach to the next level okay thank you very much because i'm not clear on the 140 cut it back to what you said mayor does that include any benefits now is he looking for us to cover 100 of medical you know what i don't know what that what the expectations are and i'm not sure if anyone else does so has has our attorney had any conversation with them starting the negotiations where are we out we've not had substantive negotiations as i was waiting awaiting direction from my client this evening on substantive terms so that i wasn't suggesting that something is oh that's an obvious yeah for sure that's that's it that that's why i brought up i want to see hardened documentation w-2 or something pay stub broken down so we're apples to apples on this that we all understand we've got a level playing field so we did all agree on that we wanted to see his i can i can ask if he's willing to share an employment agreement or w-2 or other document the caveat that any document he provides would be a public record once provided to this to the city and so he may be circumspecting what he's willing to provide in that regard i've not had that conversation with the candidate okay on there you're going to see social security numbers and things like that if it becomes a positive record can you redact any you can redact a social security number to a certain point but there's other other content that he may not wish to have in the public sphere that wouldn't be a public record depending on and i can't speak to what that is because i don't have the document in front of me but people's sensibilities of what should be in the public sphere versus what is what's provided to a public entity or not always wanted all right thank you and as far as benefits go mr riedler can i ask you exactly what type of health insurance benefits etc that you you currently get and are you [Music] just using the standard standard package that the city provides you with or are you using something else i'm currently taking the uh opt-out that lynn reeves was taking as well where i get my insurance and my wife's work it's uh if you do opt-in it's fully covered blue cross blue shield paid for the employee okay and there's a fee outside of that for any family members if you also look through the budget by the way uh his total compensation package the former city manager was 144 485 that's after the 4.6 increase over uh last year's well what he's not going to do is ask what we paid for insurance he's going to ask what type of coverage he's going to receive yes sir mr golinger you have this discussion you should have in front of you as a resource the manager leaves contract and on page three of nine um going into page four of nine is what benefits he was entitled to under his agreement should that inform your discussion there's some things and that's it that's exactly what i was looking at so um he actually had a very nice compensation package it looks like 100 of everything long-term health dental a very attractive package and uh there would be a substantial cost to this but we were paying it before and although lynn reeves was a great manager there were some things that were missing that i believe that if you did a parallel comparison gave the new city manager the exact same compensation package with the exception of the salary increase our hopes are is that it would pay for itself yes oh kyle quick question so when you stated that you you and lynn opted out did you get anything in lieu of that if you make that choice yeah what was that um two hundred dollars a year how much seven thousand two hundred dollars okay okay and that was given to you via like your salary or just a separate how is that paid first every payer okay three hundred dollars well unless you have three big beards on so the first two pay periods and three hundred dollars buddies may are good do i understand this the way you're looking at the old contract is it it's kind of a template it's something to make sure we check all the blocks but i don't believe will bound to the numbers or the percentages i i mean for instance healthcare that sort of thing i'm not a company or a corporation or business doesn't pop into my mind that cub was 100 of health care for employees i mean i'm kind of amazed based at that number and we're paying for it in our business and it's not cheap and i'm just saying that typically an employee has some sort of cold pay or something it's prorated and i'm just not aware of it so it's that's something especially for a a public employee who at this point i mean there's a give and take in some of these stuff yeah i feel like that there is some uh some burden on the uh on the side of the employee uh but it still seems that the employer pays the majority oh right that's our question um you really got to look at the whole package we're just kind of going over the numbers here let me give you some interesting things first of all everybody's been talking about what is this salary first of all it started at uh we'll stipulate 106 000 a year that's salary wages now retirements he had two interesting retirement accounts first one is called the 457 we're putting 5000 so he's getting that into his retirement account but he had another retirement account 10 000 a year in advanced retirement contributions so right now we're talking 160 red 121 in terms of cash plus you add in the car allowance 3 600. so we're almost you know going up to 130 here already and that's direct i mean i'm telling you if you're navigating the package for this man look start at 140k max to include partial you know out of that start subtracting uh car allowance you know 36 if you want and you play it either way it's a tax advantage for him possibly lift 140 cash or 137 plus three kid as far as retirement we you know when you're paying 15 000 a year in somebody's retirement that's an awful lot of money until about your home um that could be moved around and obviously i would ask because we can't say anything about spousal employment but some spousal employments come with health benefits i know you know mine does so i don't pay my health insurance it's taking care of my spouse um these are some of the things like i said we're not comparing 1-4 with 106. oh heck no these numbers are a lot closer than what you think you know don't you know i heard people oh yeah what for you or 106 no it's not it's much closer to 130 140 right now as it stands looking at that compensation for the former city manager thank you very much i need to go to frank baker yeah just just for a point of information um uh council member cheryl said about the june dean about my going with my sable on the 123 that was because we wanted to keep it below that level that's why it failed if you listen to the audio um but that was also the media believe they used the term bellerin beach is the mayberry uh and we could get a guy coming in here like mr reed she was probably on at least two pensions before he took this job but she didn't need a lot of money but i believe mr griffin salary not counting benefits is 140 000 plus he also stated and he sees at least 15 000 bonuses if his coverage is with uh blue cross aetna it's probably his family is covered under it's probably another 20 to 25 000 additional so now you're talking at least 165 um plus the car allowance pension now we're talking probably we're close to 180 000 um and they're true figures and just to say i negotiated a lot of contracts public by a state where the employer picked up the medical coverage for the employee and his family and that's the way it should be in america thank you can i just add one thing just a quick very quick statement looking at reeves um compensation package we basically were paying him 27 over his base salary so just to kind of keep the round number cover slice and dice that's what we're paying so um that's why i brought forth the question what does that 140 include what are we proposing to improve so well what he says was 140 and it's uh it's not negotiable and as far as anything above and beyond that i really don't know that's where we need to decide what's a reasonable expectations on on benefits and and then we put a cap on it and send randy on his way to uh to make the call so i would propose that we give him 140 and the only benefit we offer him is medical coverage nothing else to the extent i've had any discussions with the candidate the only other thing that was raised was the customary contribution for registration with iccm the which is an annual registration costs i'd say it's i don't know the precise cost but i believe it's between one and two thousand dollars that was the only thing that we talked about at all and there wasn't an insistence just a sort of statement on what what would we expect to see in a contract in terms of terms he's like oh and then you know that tends to be there as well and i recognized i affirmed him that i'm custom i am accustomed to seeing that a manager contracts as far as iccma i would expect that to be just standard cost of operating again that's uh we we all need continuing education of some sort and it's paid for by the city so i would have no problem with that at all mayor yes in the proposed budget for next year we have twenty three hundred dollars for memberships and publications and professional development a thousand in the mayor's or the city manager's budget excuse me so that is in the budget seriously awareness above and beyond the exclusive of the salary okay you know whenever you said medical were you just holding it at medical or was it dental was it was a regular health plan i would propose medical benefits period all medical benefits and are we 100 are we doing more or less i mean not more but less or are giving in the same thing that lynn has whatever our standard medical plan is that we offer all of our employees he would have an opportunity to enroll in that for himself in that instance it is customary in contracts to have that the managers shall receive benefits as provided for all employees in the personnel manual if there's a term that you're looking to do that way that would be that's typically that stuff okay great mr baker is your hand raised or is it just yes yeah just to clarify i believe this is on the table uh we're just giving him the 140 medical no pension no 401k no car allowance is that correct i believe that that was the starting uh that was the opening bid uh yes sir yeah i just want to clarify a couple of quick things i know when i asked him about his uh bonus that's the only thing i remember for certain that he said uh i don't would not use my bonus to be calculated at all i also remember somebody asking about 140 000 about that being an acceptable or would you be willing i think mr banker said would you be willing to take something less and his his response was um that's non-negotiable i think he said something i would prefer not to that was his response so what i would like to see randy do and i have 100 confidence in his negotiating ability i think if he starts discussing and talking with mr griffith i would simply ask him right off the bat what are you looking for and i wouldn't give him anything yet and if you can get him to say well i'm solid with 140 000. who knows he may say something you know my wife uh with her particular um position that she has she's got fabulous insurance i'm not concerned about that at all you just never know so i wouldn't offer up anything at this point and again i have complete confidence in randy he knows what we've talked about so that this probably could be and should be a little bit of a back and forth you know randy comes back to us and says i talked to him the first time and this is where we are what do you guys think that type of thing i wouldn't give up anything i would you know hopefully he'll say well i'm good with 140 000 and i would prefer to have or maybe that's it he's good vice mayor i'm on board with that i i think that's the start he's the one with the skills and services that he wants to sell and what's the price i think that's the starting point there and that's where the negotiations start i agree with that it's just that we need to establish some sort of a tab right and what i would say for you folks i don't need this is the exact number for this this is the exact number for that i am looking for guidance not not unlike if we were about to go into a mediation i said you know what give me a range you're willing to settle in or work with or tell me at this number randy walk away from the table and so i'm not talking about walking away from the tables at this point but what i am seeing i'd like to avoid the necessity to come to you every single time we change a comma or hey actually now he wants to add in a phone budget and then we've got to have a whole special meeting about a phone you know i can go through and tell you things that are customary to see and if i see if any of this strikes you let me know it is customary to see icc images which you've addressed whether there's any one provision if any for technology or or or subsidization of technical technological costs travel costs radius gas gas or travel contributions on a monthly basis you'll you also see the well we've already talked about membership i'm sorry salary benefits also termination which i think is an important thing to discuss um termination and separation not not to you know put a damper on the happiness of someone joining but we also need to know because they work in our pleasure what are their expectations what are yours that's one thing that's come up in a lot of communities that i've seen as a deal not a deal breaker but a real deal changer i will tell you that it's customary because of the industry that there'd be some kind of severance if it is not for cause and four causes very very narrowly defined as you've been convicted of a crime or done something with great world turpitude that we can establish or have good faith basis to believe happened not for cause isn't you came to this meeting you said something i didn't like and not terminated for cause that's not how forecast tends to work in the sphere but generally okay if they retire if they resign if things end amicably what happens and does it matter as to how far out that happens um you know if it's in the first year versus the third year does that change anything for you and so that's the kind of stuff i'm i'm not looking for you to give me every penny a nipple i just want to know if there's hey in looking at this agreement i can tell you for example as i read it and i've skimmed it so forgive me if i'm misreading it your previous manager's contract provided for nearly a year's compensation on separation i don't think that's one legally tenable but two i that's obviously not something we're going to replicate and so how many weeks if they're separated you know or not how many weeks are you open to that up to a certain point i just need general parameters i want to make sure i'd like to avoid coming back to you repeatedly if i have a round to work with and i can say to him hey this is this is where that conversation was tracking we can fly that up the flagpole great but i do want to avoid five and six workshops under this and there's nothing wrong with you contacting us individually just to get our opinion without sharing other people's money correct i can engage and i can engage yes right and um moving a comma is kind of extreme so let's try not to do that and then the last comment that i have uh on this particular where you're going with this is i don't want someone that's going to come in and if it doesn't work out immediately they get a big severance package we need to make sure that that is not the case and i can structure something like that and i've done that in other communities where we said if it's within the first year it's this and you know year two to three it's that so that there's not there's it's you're not incentivized to do that and then and with a note towards my comments the last meeting on their iccma ethical obligations which militate towards a two-year commitment at minimum when you're in a place unless you are terminated by the council it's okay all right i'm happy with that other comments can i say i think it's not unreasonable to have a phone for it to pay for a cell phone for him i mean i think that that's probably pretty standard with all mercy staff i think we all expect him to be available i would gladly give mine but you know we want his availability and you know without providing i just think that's kind of hard to and maybe i'm out of bounds i'm just kind of floating a couple of ideas oh that's uh that's perfectly acceptable in fact he he was the one that said whenever i asked him about getting phone calls at night he said he slept with a cell phone one of the stipulations of rainy is that i would i would want a firm commitment that this city would not be unmanned if kyle is out of town someone is manning the city in the in the event of an emergency and if it winds up being the new city manager and he has to drive across the howard franklin that's part of his responsibility and i believe that it should be in in his contract vice mayor uh two things one when it comes to the objectives list i would like to hear from kyle the interim city manager because he's currently living in the belly of the beast and i'd like to know if there's anything we've missed here or based on his experience as a backup for the city manager if he wants to add anything and then obviously to see citizens and i'd like to hear from a citizen's advisor wrap that up in 15 minutes then uh let's go for it kyle yeah i would say um you didn't really miss anything maybe dive right into the job description and have requirements or just to make sure that they're keeping up with all aspects of the job um and not dialing too much into this outside stuff that i mean make sure they're taking care of what they need to take care of the job itself um and then and then you got all this outside stuff that um that you're holding to just to make sure that the general day-to-day operations are some way to measure that thank you we have anyone on the citizens advisory committee that would like to speak no citizens back to the council yes sir um yeah going back to it i'd like to obviously let's go with the 140k max but do the approach um that councilman robert said exactly you know just leave it open and then see where it receives from there and we're behind recommend it thank you very much councilman roberts great job any other comments i'm just saying keep that termination separation agreement you know as minimal as possible like if you say that standard of the industry is fine but let's kind of tie it back to a probationary period but if it's within x amount of days there's not there's no you know so i you know comparing it to what i'm seeing on women's agreement you understand all that uh council member baker i see your hand with it is it under the city charter discussing uh city manager's position that he is an outro employee can be terminated but he has the right to review by council yes so how much more minimal can it be than that i would say just as as the council to the legal counsel to the council yes that is the most minimal and and there are situations where parties have left their legal expectations to the minimal text of their charter it creates a lot of questions when things don't go precisely as planned and then people say well it was always my understanding that and every nobody's understanding seems to align so the benefit of any contract is establishing shared expectations through that process and while we don't need to deal with every eventuality setting forth what the what those parameters are is in my advice the most prudent way to proceed especially having seen and worked through a two-year period in one community we went through four and five managers and having contracts that were reviewed and improved with each version of how that went sideways was most helpful thank you very much at this point are we all in agreement that this is the direction we want to go to let city attorney take control and see what kind of a deal he could work out for us we do with that we need a motion for that motion i think i have the general senses direction of the body um understanding not every person may agree to every single term unanimously i think i have sufficient direction to engage in discussions with the candidate and i do have their phone number again i spoke earlier today and depending on when we adjourn tonight i may call them this evening or at least tomorrow thank you very much um we have about 10 minutes till the next meeting i'm sure everyone would like a short break so we do need a motion to adjourn motion to adjourn second all right all in favor all right thank you"
