    "transcript": "here we go hello everyone at 6 pm and the june 6 regular council meeting will now come to order please rise and join me in the pledge of united states allegiance america is will you please call the rope council member frank banker president council member leslie otero councilmember lloyd roberts here council member jody shirley here councilmember mike sable vice mayor glenn gunn president mayor dave gallis city manager lynn reeves and city attorney randy mora president [Music] thank you patty our first order of business is the approval of the agenda um i have two items that i would like to change and then i'm going to ask the council if there's anything they would like to change uh the first is the date on item four it should be 2021 not 2019. and then the second item is item 12 and 13 i think that they should be swapped uh the reason why is uh even though it's it's probably something that we can pass through pretty quickly it's still something that uh someone may want to discuss so uh i would like 13 to become 12 and 12 to become 13 and then the new 13 falls into the regular agenda i'll move to approve that those changes all in favor aye aye all right the agenda is now amended do i have a motion to approve the amended agenda move frank baker second says lee notaro all in favor aye aye the united agenda is approved all right let's move right on to item two which is citizen conference um this system would like to address the council about a topic not already on the agenda please raise your hand and wait to be called we ask that you limit your comments no more than three minutes if anyone would like to speak uh yes ma'am you in the far right corner second row good evening mayor council members katie cole with the law firm of hillward henderson 600 cleveland street suite 800 clearwater florida um i'm here tonight representing the las caracolis condominium association and you had a number of other people raise your hands tonight because there are several residents and owners of other condominiums that are on along the beach and we wanted to speak to you tonight about the proposed ordinance that's been sent to fwc with respect to the swim buoys in the vessel exclusion zone and first off we understand that this has been going on for about a year and unfortunately some of the meeting notices went to the general addresses of the condominiums not just specific units or the management companies and so there's been a bit of a game of catch-up for some of these owners to get an understanding of what's happening and why and so we wanted to come tonight knowing that it's not on the agenda but that you all have sent a proposed ordinance to fish and wildlife that is necessary to come into compliance with what the prior permit was but the extent of that ordinance in the opinion of many of these residents goes too far the addition of buoys over the number of buoys that are out there tonight or today is a concern it's also a concern that if the choice is to have a vessel exclusion zone and swim only area versus what's there today which is simply notice that there might be swimmers in the area and no wake zone candidly the owners along the beaches would prefer to have no buoys there is not an issue today with boat traffic and swimmers and conflicts between the two there's not an issue with a large number of boats anchoring in this area and attempting to swim up to shore and create the situation and the addition of these buoys and the change of the status quo is not something that these residents would like to see so i know that we have several here if you all want to raise your hand um some others from some of uh jim robbins with las caracolis is also here and wants to say a few words but we wanted to come tonight we appreciate i know mr reeves has been in contact with some of the residents here i've been in contact the past week with mr mora we understand this is a work in progress with the fwc and certainly wanted to make our uh our opinion known to you all and then work together with the city on what the right solution is so we appreciate that okay um i'm going to pause it for one second i don't have a problem with anyone that wants to speak on this topic with everyone that's here to speak on this particular topic please raise your hand okay so what i would like to do is let's go ahead and take care of these first and uh and let's do it orderly each person take your three minutes come up say your name give your address and then whenever you're finished we'll just take the next one and we'll go right down the line okay and that way it will expedite the meeting and you'll be heard we certainly appreciate that thank you mayor thank you and i'm jim robbins 2523 prospect road tampa florida 33629 but also a property owner at 2450 gulf boulevard at las caracolas first i want to say thank you for giving us a little time tonight we have been playing catch up on this and we certainly appreciate the city staff the city attorney getting some to speed with the information so we now know what's going on just a brief comment my family and i've been over here for over 25 years now i'm a boater distant swimmer paddle boarder and as katie said if the choice is between i certainly appreciate the buoys that are there but if the choices needed to remove those because they're no longer compliant we'd be in favor of that but no designated swim zones or boat zones or additional buoys out there not seen any problem i think people are very respectful when they're operating uh motor vessels in that area for a host of reasons but very respectful of the swimmers and others in the water so others are going to echo that but uh our condominium uh 32 units there and other condominiums we've been in touch with i think are the similar view and you may hear that uh here behind me so thank you very much for your time this evening thank you mr robbins barbara ryles 4601 west san miguel street tampa florida we are owners of a unit at solely zombra 2250 gulf boulevard unit g1 i have been in contact with all 16 owners at solely sombra as well as owners at aldea and sanresa across the board everyone is against designating a boat zone and a swim zone we feel that it's not necessary there really are very few votes that come that close come up close to the shore and it is not necessary and it will be unsightly and we hope that you will will respect our opposition and that you will help us with this thank you thank you my name is john gibbons i'm a registered voter at 2300 north coat boulevard almond air condominium this has come to my attention and my family's attention and the rest of the owner's attention and it is our position that is unneeded we have my family has been owner of and resident or owners of this unit since january of 1973 we are also voters we are very respected of it and to my knowledge there is never been an incident of any conflict with between voters and swimmers i run all the way from uh by boat from a mock key down to any float uh update club uh in no place else do i ever see this uh that there's designated swim zones on those beaches there used to be something at clearwater beach and if it's there i'm not aware of it but that's a different situation than we are that's much more of a public beach that we do have some public accesses that we've been granted in there again we've never experienced any problem we would like to work with the city council and make sure that everybody's informed on this but if it came down to it we've heard prefer being compliance with fwc with no buoys versus having designated swim zone and additional votes thank you thank you good afternoon my name is karen mills my address is 3006 west dupled avenue in tampa florida but i am also representing my husband who could not be here tonight we are owners at 2450 golf boulevard which is los caricolas and i'm going to read something that my husband read into the minutes there is no confidence it's substantial evidence that has been presented as to the need for swim zones if the existing buoys are required to be removed by the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission then prior to the city ordinance there should be rescinded and not revised to create swimsuits the ordinance is unnecessary and represents an attempt by the city to tell people where they can and can't swim in the gulf the proposed ordinance has the potential of many unintended consequences such as creating a boating zone whereby boats can gather wrapped up raft up or even anchor along the beach if this proposed uh states that these excluded areas shall be free from restriction so if the ordinance was adopted how would these areas be controlled or governed and then finally the language of the proposed ordinance is written incorrectly as the swim zones are shown on the map are descripted as areas excluded from swim zones but the bottom line is in our five years of owning a place out here we've seen very little boat traffic and i just don't understand for long distance swimmers open water swimmers how they would be swimming along and then have to stop and get out and go to the next area where the swim zone started that just doesn't make sense to me so i very much appreciate you hearing our concerns about this and hope that you will consider them when this ordinance does come up for review thank you thank you very much mrs anyone else on this topic okay thank you very much and we'll move on to other comments that anyone else would like to speak yes ma'am please come up and state your name and your address hello my name is nancy poufman and my address is 106 13th street bellar beach i'm a relatively unique resident i want to welcome you all i received the magazine telling me all about the new council and the mayor and also and i was glad to read that that some of you in here so that you were interested in what the residents felt and had to say so being a relatively new resident here it's been about a year now and when i was buying the property the realtor was telling me all about that i was right across the street from the beach and how wonderful it was and all the things and my daughter is a new resident here in bellar beach as well down almost 22nd street and so i said okay great sounds great and we came we got settled and i finally went across the street to go see the beach and i was greeted by this massive sign that told me all the things that i couldn't do and i was quite surprised to say the least and so anyway it's taken us a while to get settled and with the new council when i started talking to different residents and they were introducing themselves to me i heard so many stories in my head where it's going to explode i heard that you know amongst the council was not well and lives were not good i heard that there was negotiations going on about rescinding the shade code that had went through because that was probably the one that threw me the most that you couldn't have any shade at all and um then i heard that the prior mayor initiated a lawsuit and i've heard so many things that i'm so perplexed now that i don't know where the city is on that issue but i am very sad because i moved here 10 of us moved here the whole tribe came all of us and you know i have a granddaughter who has a great grandson now i have my daughter who resides here in bel air now who is having a grandson and when we plan to go to the beach we plan to go to the beach to enjoy not just walk the shoreline not just go in the water and then leave and so i guess i'm here today to try to find out where this issue stands and was it correctly passed this code by the bel air shores um council council and what are we doing in beller beach about this issue thank you very much how will i know will someone give me i'm not sure how this works generally during public comments we do not respond okay i will say that this is an ongoing court case that we're not involved in and there are i i maybe consider the progress that's happening but this is something that we really need to discuss at a different time okay well i would appreciate that and i would appreciate you taking into consideration that there are families that would love to go to the beach and spend three or four hours as a family at the beach and be able to be protected i can't take these children to the beach and have them exposed for that long a period of time without shade it's just not appropriate and not healthy so i thank you for hearing me today thank you anyone else mayor i make a notion that um you bring up the discussion you had at the bel air shows of the latest work session um about the umbrellas so this resident doesn't have to stay it was a pretty productive meeting he had i i would prefer to reserve those comments until the end of the week not in the beginning all right we're on the item three which is the law enforcement report from uh good evening council the biggest highlights of the city's crunch statistics of the month of april is going to be there were a total of 15 arrests however none of them included any of the residents of the city as you know with the beach the causeway and people coming from clearwater beach when our deputies are out doing traffic enforcement we tend to catch people coming from all different directions and the stops just happen to happen in your city so they get tagged as being within the city um of the 15 arrests six of them were all traffic related whether it be duis driving on a suspended license things of that nature um there were a couple of drug possession arrests which again came from traffic stops there was a domestic battery which was from someone who was staying at a lodging facility here on vacation who was not a resident of the city deputies doing traffic enforcement issued a total of 171 warnings or citations within the city there are also 36 parking warnings before citations issued at the beach accesses and those are pretty much the highlights outside of the normal house checks neighborhood checks traffic control getting out and monitoring the beach accesses and just being highly visible for the residents and people passing through the city of bellar beach you have a question statement first of all master chief can you hear me okay back there good um our beach i've been on a beach obviously out there swimming looking around but it's considerably eroding we have no beach renourishment in sight right now and we've seen incidents with deputies patrolling in an suv on on the beach i mean maybe 30 foot of sand um i mean asking this council member can you use the atv that you have stored in the house back here instead of using the suv on the beach i mean we're just trying to conserve our sand as possible that that is definitely an option that we have um the deputies that you see on the beach those suvs are actually four wheel drive that's why they're able to go out there because a normal uh one of our normal tahoes would not be able to make it through that soft sugar sand to get to the hard pack sand but the polaris side by side that we have in the garage back there it is much smaller and i can get with captain miner and give him your suggestion and your concern about the beach erosion and being able to use that vehicle versus right because kind of you just kind of pointed it out you said you got a four wheel drive suv plowing the sand so that's that's what we're trying to get to we got to say what sandy we have because they're not making more um second of all was it's not a mystery that the gulf to causeway two-lane turn has had a lot of community confidence um [Music] can you point to it we had an increase in vehicle accidents and citations specifically about the two-lane turn since it's been put in place i know that seemed it's been questions that we've had asked numerous times and people who are familiar with this area they navigate well now that it's been there for quite some time and unfortunately enough if someone is in the outer lane and they're going to make a turn toward indian rocks that people who are in the left lane are nice enough to allow them to merge in without there being any kind of issue so as far as any real uptick in any kind of crashes or any violations that are any kind of red flags we have not seen that much of an increase great thank you yes sir any other council members yeah um yeah i just saw on the first page here that there was a uh a sex offense and three assault well the sex offense could you elaborate on that that kind of come on correct in in the way that our system tracks our report our reporting system tracks things is that if someone makes an allegation the allegation that they make unless we can say that it did not occur that's how the report gets filed that prediction that particular incident that you're referring to is a incident that occurred where someone ended up at a local facility as far as a lodging facility that had been in clearwater in tampa i believe out partying they woke up at the lodging facility and they felt as though something occurred during the course of the evening but they weren't sure where it occurred so we documented what they could remember and because they could not recall exactly where it took place it happens to be that since they were staying at that facility again like when we do traffic stops if somebody's coming through clearwater and they happen to you know come down the gulf boulevard and we stop them here because we stopped in here or the call originates from the city limits it gets tagged here okay so it may not be something that actually occurred here but because it's where it originated that's where our reporting system places it okay thank you yes sir mr baker how often do you guys uh schedule beach controls as councilmember was talking about uh there is we tried to do one at least once per shift in the evenings we usually try to do them during sunset that way we can get addressed any of the ordinance issues that you know on top on topics plus uh check the parking lots make sure people have their proper permits and whatnot but it's usually in the mornings about sun sunrise you know when we get most of your foot traffic you have people that are out exercising walking the beaches and usually sunset are the two times that we try to now deputies could come out more frequently depending upon what the parking lots look like if the parking lots look full then obviously there's a lot of people out on the beach they would give it another another pass to make sure everything is is good and that there's no violations or you know sometimes people just like to come up and talk to us and ask us questions yeah i was pertaining more or less the beach patrol itself like you guys are great i mean on everything but uh i see a lot in the parking lots but seemed like this past year i haven't seen you much of the beaches i i can definitely check the numbers and see what statistically been done but i know that there is a standing order for at least one during the day and one during the evening is that is that the contracted order yes yes that is that is the order that from my understanding captain liner has spoken with the council in the past and that has been established and it is within the city responsibilities for the deputies that are out here okay um just curious whenever you pull into one of those parking lots and you see someone that doesn't have a permit or a sticker what what's the what's the normal routine for you well education is a wonderful thing there are some people who want to push the envelope because they know that these parking lots are so close to the beach so there are a handful of people who we've come into contact you know education the first time the second time then you get a parking violation um but since it is private property outside of issuing violations there's not much more we can do than that you know once the parking violation is issued then it's you know whether or not they pay it or you know how how it goes forward from there but it's education first and then you know we write the the violation and dig in the pockets i think that more than likely this council will be having that conversation on increasing patrolling and uh and then trying to figure out we've already started conversations about what to do about the parking lot the accesses and how to handle that i appreciate your time thank you very much for the report absolutely and in regards to the beach patrol i will get with captain miner in regards to these side by side versus the topic thank you yes any other questions thank you yes john has a 22nd street our question is for the corporal um when he gets the statistics it's blended where it's um warnings and citations we don't often hear how many warnings how many citations and the last point that was made was parking and i was listening and he said first thing is education okay um i'm not a well in my mind the education is quite clear and simple when you go to the entrance to these beach access parking areas the education is clear and simple permit required it's not open for arbitration it's not open for discussion or compromise clear and simple and we've heard stories in the past about deputies going up and down the beach looking for people that have parked illegally so my thing is and as you just mentioned mr mayor we need to be looking at this we don't need to educate anymore the education is right there at the entrance to the parking no tiki no washing fine and simple thank you thank you any other comments jules chandler 3207 hibiscus drive west beach regarding the any violations or accidents that we had or didn't have on that left turn signal i as well as most everyone here that's on the north side of the bridge would be turning left sometimes you're in the right left turn line sometimes you're in the left left turn and people are not always kind with letting you in people are always trying to not always most of the time it it just seems like it's it to me it seems like it's not working and the residents that i'm speaking with are saying that it's not working um it was i think it was initiated to um ease up traffic but now the way it is now you cannot turn left on a yellow flashing light whereas before you'd stop and if there was no oncoming traffic you could turn left you cannot do that anymore so traffic is backed up the same amount that it was backed up before but unfortunately if the sheriff's well if the sheriff's car is there you know people are going be paying attention to the traffic kind enough to let somebody come in not necessarily honking or giving the finger for somebody that they think is cutting them off um that being said so it's it's not really apples to apples i think i just think that it's something that we should look at again i don't i don't believe that it's working that's it thank you thank you any other comments all right now we move to the coke enforcement report uh david flapka is not here tonight and city manager rights will be presented yes mayor council uh you've got to copy the code enforcement report we have 52 incidents that happen where we want most of them are checking permits we had 11 items that weren't there was no violation even though we had a call to check something or they thought it was a parking violation or what have you we did start a process with trying to encourage the rental registration at a couple of the condos where it was lacking we did start a program there where the deputies uh going to check to see and i will say it became fruitful because we had about 12 people that took their rental registration fee that was for renting so that was a fruitful situation we had 11 permit checks three parking issues and four landscaping other violations are just things that we modeled up on but for the most part it was a relatively quiet month thank you very much council any questions i do have one mr reece um as i drive around in bellar beach i noticed that there are a few addresses that have trees shrubs hedges that are beyond a clear violation they're literally hanging out over the streets they are blocking neighbors views trying to exit their driveways and they don't seem to be i don't think we're enforcing that properly or maybe i'm missing something and maybe we need to look at the code again but definitely something that i'd like to have a deeper conversation with and uh and find out what what can we do about this is it just a directive at this point yeah it's a code enforcement officer uh we've had a few i will tell you in the last last week in fact we've sent a couple letters out about those situations typically they're reoccurring the same person is doing it again you tell them to cut it and then they cut it and then two months later it's back in the same situation so they're the artist does say you can't go out feeling the curved line and things of that nature so uh i'll relate it to the co-op okay thank you very much any other questions all right let's move on to item four which is consideration of accepting the annual comprehensive financial report for the fiscal year oh before we before we do this peggy what happened to uh vice man of god he's there he is there there he is i'm sorry you were not a member of the brave bunch for for a few seconds all right great uh so anyway back time for consideration of accepting the annual comprehensive financial report for the fiscal year ending september 30th 2021 first off do i have a motion question made by jody shirley and second by the way okay do we have a representative from salt marsh cleveland and guns cpa right there let's see that's here good evening my name is chuck landers with salt marsh cleveland and gund had i'm fortunate opportunity to serve as the audit shareholder for the city of bel air beach we greatly appreciate the opportunity to serve as your auditors in the past you've seen janine bettinger and richard christine they have since retired i do believe they still may be doing some consulting work around but they're no longer with salt marsh and i again i have the privilege of serving as the auto shareholder uh i believe you have the draft financial segment in your packet yes i um happy to go through it not in a lot of detail but the most important thing is that it is an unmodified opinion so that that's the cleanest opinion that an auditor can give so we're saying that that is what the city has there's about a dozen pages that i would point out some information on but we don't have to go into a lot of detail other than that so i'm kind of at your mercy how much detail would you like to go into well if you have a reader's digest summary you'd like to give us that would be a great start all right reader's digest we're going to just talk about a few numbers then something that i wouldn't say are worth discussing on page 17 this is the statement of net position at the bottom of page 17 there's a section called that position i'll point out that the net investment in capital assets is 10.5 almost 10.6 million and then the unrestricted deposition is 5.3 million for total net position that the city has of 15.894 million almost 15.9 billion that that is an indication that the assets of the city far exceed the liabilities of the city by approximately 15.9 million so that's an important number that i would point out i would then turn to page 23. this is the fund balance budget and actual for the general fund you'll see that in the middle of the page is the final budget for the general fund about halfway down total revenues were budgeted at 2 million 377 000 actual came in at 2 million 708 000 for a favorable variance of 331 000. i would then jump to the bottom almost at the bottom of that page for the net change in fund balance the third column over actual increase of 192 200 which is a favorable variance of almost 185 000 over budget tremendous i would turn the page then to page 24 and the only item i'll point out here is that in 2021 the city created the storm water fund and you'll see that this is the statement of net position that includes the stormwater fund and the marina fund and then a combination for those two funds combined i would only just point out that page because the stormwater fund was new in 2021 i would then draw your attention to page 44. this is note 5 the change in capital assets and this is a reconciliation that takes you from the capital assets at the beginning of the year the additions the dispositions and the transfers to the end of the year in your municipality that is an important amount of information to understand what is what the city has what's being added what's being disposed of so it just points you to a point you point that out to you we'll continue with further good news on page 85. municipal audits have to be done in accordance with governmental auditing standards this report is the independent auditor's report on internal control of financial reporting and on compliance and other matters based on an audit of financial statements performed in accordance with government auditing standards there are two important two most important sentences in this two-page report the first one is the next last sentence on the first page given these limitations during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses that's the sentence you're looking for on that page if you turn the page to page 86 in the paragraph compliance and other matters the last sentence of that paragraph the results of our tests disclose no instances of non-compliance or other matters that are required to be reported under government auditing standards that's what you want to hear in those reports absolutely then the last bit is the very last page on page 89 this is the independent officers report on compliance with section 218.4 and five of florida statutes regarding the investment of public funds during the year and our opinion is in our opinion the city of bel air beach complied with all material respects with the aforementioned requirements for the year ended september 30th 2021. so all in all you have four positive opinions through this report thank you very much council mr god i would say that the one thing i didn't see that i was used to seeing in the past reports was trains and forecasts and i don't know if that's something that you just don't kill anymore but it was interesting to read that stuff and draw your own conclusions when you look back at the different years okay transit transit forecast that would be information that is outside of the basic financial statements there is the statistical section uh which shows historically information and you can come to your own conclusions on trends from that but that i believe what you're referring to would be outside of the basic financial statements it could be included there's nothing to say that additional information cannot be there so if city council would like to have city staff include additional non-required supplemental information we can do that where was the statistical immigration and i would encourage everyone to read the management discussion and analysis as well that's kind of a plain english version of all the numbers and notes that us accountants talk about any other questions all right uh in that case uh uh comes to a vote to uh accept the annual comprehensive financial report for the fiscal year ending september 30th 2019. what we should do oh you're right it's 2019 there too okay uh we already had a motion we did um all in favor aye aye any opposed all right now we are on to item five which is the city attorney's report mr moore thank you mr mayor uh pleasure being here at my official meeting though we've had the opportunities thus far to sit in on a workshop and the meeting of the cac last month we are off to a good start i met with the with manager reeves for a few hours on friday to talk about a series of action items begun preparing and transmitting research on some of the pending issues beginning to review ordinances that have been prepared and they're in the hopper to try and advance those and make sure they've gone under my own independent review but with that i'm happy to answer any questions you have or concerns to this point council vice mayor gunn i i do have one of your evaluation planning does any of that have to do with these signal events i'm not specifically though i have that as an action item based on the research or rather the interview process that we went through i've not yet reached that issue as there were some that were more time sensitive namely the fwc buoys issues and and others that have been percolating i also you were all sent a memorandum uh that i prepared concerning text messages public records and digital media's public records uh that was not i don't know i sent it without a lot of context i was not prepared as a result of anything specifically in this community i've been doing that research on behalf of a handful of communities based on litigation i've been involved in and thought i thought it best that all of our elected officials be aware of that and that's been said both it's been said here and in the other communities that i serve and back to your question about the sign code as you know tonight we're talking about the interim manager as that interim manager establishes the priorities and needs will certainly address where they feel that fits in based on the existing needs and need to catch up on that legal issue okay thank you very much anyone else all right moving on to item six which is the city manager's report take it away mr reeves mayor console the report is in the uh in your agenda packet uh from some of our discussions over the last couple of meetings the drainage project evaluation will start we started looking at doing some camry both boulevard at the grounding we're still waiting on duke energy to come forward with their bid and final estimate inside 7th street boat ramp renovation along with the 16th we've given a notice of award and the contract has been executed and the company is in the process of giving me some timelines for when materials could be delivered uh city seawall project that's on hold for funding at some point the city council needs to determine if they want to replace the playground in baseline park small kids playground and tonight we're working on we're doing second reading in 94 which has been a long time coming i did get information today that's not on this report the sheriff's increase is going to be 5.18 you were given uh your budget at your seat tonight the updated budget with the current property evaluation and we have a budget work session on the 20th of june and we still are waiting on waste management that's really the only other thing that's outstanding that you don't have because they are going to ask first an additional increase all right thank you very much mr reeves now welcome to the city clerks report ms gentry you have a tour um the main thing is the city manager search process so i'm doing spreadsheets for all of the scoring for each applicant and then when that's complete the committee will meet again and review those so that they can get it to council and then for the future projects these are just things that are in the archive room that need to be [Music] on an ongoing basis they need to be done so scheduling things for destruction and reorganizing we have a big condominium cabinet that's full of the plants and the [Music] blueprints so straighten that up and that's it any questions um yes john kasich one through 22nd street um question really is for the city manager i've been following this the gulf war underground do we have any explanation as to why duke energy is dragging its anchor and do they not have a drop dead date to give us a binding cost well they they gave us a binding cost and then when we asked for them to update the cost it went up 30 so we went back to them and have asked them to relook at it and i've had some discussion with them about there's some credits that we got on the w state's island underground so i've asked them about that and i have been in contact with them but they're redeveloping their possibility i recall that conversation from last month's report so just worried about things going through the roof you know we went through this last week with the front the bedroom on the stormwater thank you oh just uh for future just to let everyone know it's generally not a back-and-forth conversation with the city manager the city attorney or the city clerk that's why i did not call on anyone and i went ahead and another council member called on you but generally i'm not doing that so that's not the way that this council runs and we'll reserve our comments for the beginning of the meeting or during agenda items and this is not part of the regular agenda so i apologize if there's any confusion but i just want to make that clear all right let's move on to number eight mayor yes sir thank you sir mr gunn i'm still talking about the state clerk report i guess i had a question we're talking about the city manager hiring process we were pretty intelligent in this downtown timeline and some of the uh the processes and some durations and stuff and i'm just looking at are we taking down that timeline like we kind of outlined or sticking to the timeline that we kind of forecast or has that changed and also what what are we looking at for the conclusion for the city management hybrid process whether we for cnn being complete yes i think we're doing very well on the timeline um and then as far as completed i really don't can you help me with that lynn as far as when then when will the completion be i mean we have dates set but yeah i i don't unfortunately i don't have the calendar in front of me but there there was a calendar that was sent out to all the council members the next meeting was going to be like this eighth right and uh i know she's working on the sports sheets to get the uh we got everything in uh and she's working on putting scoring sheets together to put a spreadsheet to give to the citizens advisory council to have a meeting to confirm who their live candidates are and then after they have their confirmation and that'll be dealing with the student now let me uh let me clarify you are not uh you're not scoring the candidates around you're just you're compiling the score sheets and handing the data packets that's correct yes all right i just want to also make sure we went through that schedule twice uh we had the changes from the city manager i submitted those back but i still haven't seen those back from you that we have an approved timeline i thought we sent those back out which one the updated one i've never seen an updated timeline and that did have the ending it had the complete i think it's august day one uh original discussion was it could convince you one way or the other right that was our general guideline yes sir uh vice mayor yeah and and to that point i guess what i would just like to see is that outline with checkered parts and gates completed or whatever so we can kind of monitor how we're doing anything i'm gaining or losing track i mean i just i guess i'm looking for a little more definitive progress you know a time frame for completion you know i guess if you can show me that we're sticking down all the different processes and it kind of makes sense wherever we're ahead of the process behind and we're not going to complete it on time [Music] that's all right yes we are doing that and so right now what i'm doing is doing the final one to get all the numbers in then we can set the date for the next meeting which was the 7th or 8th that was on the timeline that was sent out i mean i can send it out again if if the vice mayor doesn't have it but we did send it out revised and then like lynn said it's kind of in flux because as each part comes due then that determines the date for the next one but i feel like we're sticking pretty close to the original timeline i think they're very close uh we might be slipping a day or two on the scoring because i think we were a little aggressive with it well we were out two days right yeah and patty was and because of the polar issue we were relying a little bit but she's working on them uh she can probably tell you how far she is along the 28 applicants and then she's gonna do a uh one sheet that basically says this is what every person is for okay i i think what vice mayor done i'm sorry about it could you just maybe update us all in an email stayed sure that's what i was going to say i think by smeargun is indicating that we're kind of in a update black hole and we really don't know what's going on any other questions all right let's move on to ordinance number 2201 this is the second video mr morrow would you please read the file for this audience happily mr mayor i'm pulling up just getting that agent materials ordinance number 22-01 an ordinance of the city council the city of belarum beach florida

the emotion frank banker do i have a second exactly what was the nature of the motion sorry that it was just i need a motion and then it was a motion this is uh consideration of ordinance 22-01 this is the second reading no i understand that i guess my finer point is the more appropriate parliamentary or just say a move to approve or move to pass oh it's another motion that i understand and it's just saying motion doesn't indicate what that motion is mr vancouver would you like to play a second reading is that yes thank you mayor sorry for the introduction so myself i'm sorry and you made the second wisdom and jody shirley mr banker do you have the floor thank you mr mayor this uh was thoroughly discussed over a couple of work sessions and again at the last council meeting i believe the first reading was passed unanimously i bring it back to you for children's comments now thank you to other council members well all right let's take it to the citizens we have community citizens all right back to the council mr baker do you have the last word right before we do patty has this ordinance been noticed in publication yes sir thank you all right hey uh let's do a road call council member banker yay i'm sorry yes thank you councilmember otero yes member roberts yes council member shirley aye council member stable yes vice mayor gunn aye mayor gattis yes so it passes unanimously 7-0 thank you to everyone who worked on this and you know what to do all right we are on to the consent agenda and uh we changed a couple of things but i think we've got this right we're going to be discussing or not discussing but passing items 9 10 11 and what used to be 13 that is now 12. so this is for approval of the may 2nd 2022 city council meeting minutes approval of may 5th 2022 special city council meeting minutes approval of may 16 2022 special city council meeting minutes and a proclamation designating june 15 2022 as world elder abuse awareness day do i have a motion move to approve latest leak material do i have a second second is that a friend yes mr baker all in favor aye aye aye any opposed all right the consent agenda passes and we move on to item number 13. all right this is um this is to authorize the city manager to execute assignment of engineering services agreement and associates acquired by sdpi incorporated the staff recommends continuation of the agreement before we do that do i have a motion question by leslie do i have a second second mine's able all right uh leslie you have four um i don't really have any comments just mayor console this is a dueling associates has been purchased uh by sepi engineering and we did the same thing and i that for when davidson christine was purchased by salt marsh so uh i did send this to the city attorney uh previously and he said as long as the current agreement is which is we have a current contract that we can assign this so they're just asking for pretty much the same thing we did with saltwater execution any other comments from the council uh i have one mr moore just curious have you been able to look this over at all i i looked it over and as much as part of the attended materials that have been circulated in advance of the meeting as a general operation in legal parliament say the acquisition of an entity by another entity and assigning its rights is fairly customary i spoke with the manager on friday concerning the agenda generally if there were any legal concerns one was not raised relative to this particular opinion thank you very much uh let's go to the citizens any citizen comments back to the council all right let's take a vote all in favor all right bye any opposed all right mr ruiz uh you can proceed now we are on to item 14. this is consideration of appointment with member to the planning and zoning board his name is our heart mcintyre and this is to fill the vacancy of one person only five member poor there are currently only four board members and this board does not have alternates to begin with do i have a motion will be shirley you don't have a second second boyd roberts all right uh it is my understanding that mr mcintyre was unable to attend tonight but uh just in case is he here nope all right well in that case uh make sure that you have the floor i don't have much to say i just we haven't heard anything from the planet how long has it been mr reeves it's probably it's probably been about over six months i uh i got to know mr mcintyre recently and i think it'll be a great addition to the board and i bet he will encourage the other members to maybe do something other than that let's go to the citizens in comments all right let's go back to the council any comments okay uh seeing that there is only one candidate mayor yes vice mayor oh vice mayor i'm sorry about that i'm still getting used to this little box up there now i guess my question goes to the protocol of how we're going to legitimize this process i guess and i was informed by the city clerk that there was some question about how we want to do this and because there was only one person the question arose whether there was going to be a vote for this or whether that person was just going to be liking the moving to the position so i guess i've given it some thought and my my question is because people and boards and communities serve at the pleasure council it it in my mind is necessary even if there's only one person that person has to be appointed by the council because i think there are some future there may be some future possibility where one person is available to fill a vacancy but that person may not be the person with the qualifications or the temperament to fill that role so in order to avoid any future problems i think it's necessary of course to establish a precedent to this thing and say hey even if it's only one person we need to legitimize the process and say yes that's the person we wanted to talk about paintless so that that's where i just in my opinion and as a chair that's your conversation thank you let me uh let me share my thoughts on that i did put some thought into it today and i think that we'll have this covered with the method of voting that we're about to do which was i was going to call on patty for a roll call vote and that's where you have the option to say yes or no and we all know that it takes at least four people to uh to pass a vote so uh i think the system works i wasn't going to ask for it all in favor it was more of a the the typical vote uh did you see something out of the ordinary or is it just because you're remote no i guess not just because i just want to make sure that the the president was there [Music] will go differently than the first vote the first vote is an easy one the second one is not so easy so uh but we'll go from there any other comments from the council if i may have to just address this procedurally uh council member guns instincts are correct and your anticipated process is correct an applicant's submission for consideration absent any other contender doesn't entitle them to the seat this body is well within its right to to allow a vacancy to remain i'm not suggesting you should hear but if it was your prerogative to say we'd rather have the vacancy than whomever has submitted um you need not necessarily establish precedent by your decision tonight but just doing so is perfectly appropriate the board members are appointed by this body and this body is not bound in its discretion in that regard thank you for that and to them and when we that mr mr mcintyre is uh appointed what is our process to allowing him to let him know that he's been appointed we just call him and tell him so or is there a document that we say we've appointed you to this position but you're serving the pleasure of the council and you know it's kind of an agreement that they understand that they could be removed at some point because clearly that's been an issue i send them an email i don't put that statement in it that you said i mean we could put anything in there that you know you deem proper but they they receive an email saying they were appointed and i would add to that your code is the contract that's really binding here if there's a contract to be had i don't want to characterize it that way but it's the binding governing document separately while i'm new to this position in many of my other communities as we get members on elected and appointed bodies as well i try to make an effort to set a time to meet with them to sensitize them to the ways their life has changed by becoming a public or semi-public official in the ways of the sunshine law and public records law because a lot of your volunteers are accustomed to serving involuntary bodies in your community at large whether that's rotary or the chamber and they're used to doing things that are just per se not permissible we wouldn't want a new member to start creating problems inadvertently just by their deal by saying well i want to meet with the chair to talk about this new application next month and things like that so i i will it's my intention subject to um staff's permission and use your resources in that regard to reach out to them and at least if not have a full-on meeting with them at least provide them with materials for their review and consideration as they acclimate to the position maybe in your email you can reference the section of the code i do i send them the scent of the link to the sunshine government and the sunshine and the ethics yeah i mean the city code about serving on that right i'm not sure if i do that or not but yeah i can it's probably not a bad idea to uh maybe hand that literature off to everyone that serves on one of our boards or committees so that they all understand and have all been given the same information okay uh so uh patty let's do a roll call oh another one you hadn't mentioned earlier that you knew mr mcintyre yes so if you don't mind if you wanted to give me this application very thoroughly if you can add to that any information that you may have or another council member or another person um assistant that would i think might help us a little bit well let's start with citizens uh is there anyone out there that would speak on this empire's path nope okay anyone on council did i miss uh while he was in here tonight uh he did not say penny he's out of town okay okay yeah that's fine okay uh you know what i've spoken with him whenever i was running for office and uh got to know him a little bit on both and seemed like a nice guy very knowledgeable very professional and i think that he would be a great asset as far as his qualifications i really didn't see anything in particular to our city but i did see the executive leadership i see he has a very extensive 40 years in fact in his professional life and um just seemed like a sharp guy and somebody that i went hollywood um i was impressed by the last section why would you like to be considered as a candidate for service on the planning and zoning board it was a trip to the piece of tranquility isolation from commercial infringement to protect and preserve the attractive qualities of bellar beach and i think that's what we need our planning and zoning work to do absolutely any other comments all right council member banker approve yes council member notaro yes councilmember roberts yes yes yes thank you councilmember shirley yes council members able yes vice mayor gunn aye mayor goddess yes so that's seven to nothing and we welcome mr mcintyre to the to the planning that's on board and uh we look forward to getting to know one another right now we are on to number 15 which is consideration of appointment of park and rec recreation board member and an alternate board member we have two candidates calling them out in the order that their application was received the first with is a carolyn cornley and the second one is patty roberts all right this is to fill the vacancy of one person on a five-member board and one of the two vacancies for alternates there are currently only four board members and this board does not i'm sorry copy something off there all right so uh before we get started what we're going to do is we're going to knock out both at the same time okay and i'll explain that but uh we can go ahead whenever i say consideration i named them both and so who made the first motion that was jody shirley would you like to clarify please yeah i i moved to consider both ladies that have applied for the position as a regular member an alternate member who will be voting on it once we hear thank you uh any other clarification okay great so um uh miss uh you are here so if you'd like to speak please come up good evening mayor and city council i'm caroline cornelli i live at 2204 um bayshore drive between 22nd and 23rd i've been serving on the board of adjustments for the last five years i've lived in the area now for six years and i really enjoyed getting to know some of the community members through my board activities and just being supportive of this great community i feel so honored to live here um the reason for me wanting to move into the parks and recreation board is i thought that was a much better fit for my skill set my background i've been in finance for over 20 years and i have great planning skills so i'd like to lend my planning skills to the board and help manage the financial aspects so i really hope to be able to contribute in that capacity thank you first of all let me apologize for this that's okay uh second do we have any questions what are your thoughts for increasing community participation i think one of what stood out to me is for one of the last events that i live in the community i'm pretty active here i'm always running and i didn't even know about the event for the sinatra plant and so i think we have to do um you know look at how we're advertising our events and to get the word out there were some signs and we're really how we our community outreach and how we get in touch with our community members so that we have greater participation and really understand what are the type of events that our community members would enjoy so by just looking at whether we have good attendance on you know what are people giving us having communities having suggestion boxes of what they would like to see in the community or me i'm just getting the word and finding out from our community members what what activities they would enjoy would help to increase the participation thank you you're currently on the board of adjustment correct i resigned from that board leslie any other questions let's go to the public record any questions all right back to the council okay i have one uh miss uh corneli if you are not selected as a board member are you willing to serve as an altar yes thank you what is the differentiation does the alternate still participate in all the meetings i believe any alternate uh has the option of participating but they would not be considered a voting member if it's uh if the board or committee was forwarded is that correct yes thank you miss cornelli all right question if the board if they have a meeting and only four members show the alternative constant replace then they are voting right then there are still been voting at that point correct yes okay uh next up is miss roberts would you like to come up and speak while she's on her way you know i do know her a little bit um she's been babysitting our grandchildren seven three and one all day today i did notice when i was tracking her she did stop off at a little club place so it was for medicinal purposes only so she's not speaking correctly i don't want to talk on the mic though because i have a cold it's not cold though i've tested twice okay so can you hear me without the mic yes we can okay so now that he's introduced me i can't let god hear you thank you okay so i'm happy roberts i do have a connection with one of the board members i don't know if that makes a difference it should it will not to me i do want to serve on this because i'm an active person physically active i do not have the financial skills of this lovely lady that i met last week at the meeting but i am a very active person and i love recreation and outdoor activities so that's what my skill sets will be i'll plant flowers and dig holes and he can tell you i'm the laborer at our house he's the brains so that's why i signed up for this committee because i really want to be involved i don't want him to be the only one involved in the family so um that's why i'm here thank you do we have any questions from the council yeah um if uh put on the uh what would you like to see or what would your uh plans be well some of the things that i've already discussed with tammy and just people is i like christmas decorations and so i would like to beautify the place in that type of activity the medians i would like to see more plants either flowers or other variegated plants in the medians and then on 22 22nd street um anything to beautify areas and like i said i'm a good your hands dirty kind of person so i would be willing to volunteer to do any of those activities i love the beach cleanups i didn't go this week because i was sick in bed so thank you any other council questions no mr gun no anyone in the public would like to uh ask a question okay um so [Music] back to the council last chance all right so uh thank you very much oh wait i did have one question for you i need to ask you the same thing if you are not selected as a board member are you willing to serve as an author okay thank you miss roberts okay so uh patty has prepared balance um we're gonna do this a little different because uh vice mayor dunn is not here so we currently have balance with with two columns and there's two names line one has uh miss cornelli and line two has miss roberts first column is regular member second is alternate member whenever we take the vote you're going to put a y in whichever candidate or neither okay you would like to vote for for the regular member and then you will do the same for the alternate member remember you are not required to check yes on either box but it does require a minimum of four votes for each candidate for for them to be elected onto this floor so in vice mayor gunn's case what you will have to do is just hold up your ouch does that work for you okay great right all right so uh does everyone have a ballot and so let's go ahead and vote um uh um you have to open [Laughter] are you ready for mine well um we'll start with you sure okay so i can't see it okay looks like the one for miss cornelli on the regular regular member and um ms roberts for the alternate member okay there now it's up thank you councilmember banker miss cornelli for the alternate wait wait you're going to say who the votes before this could give you big trouble so councilmember banker miss cornelli for the alternate miss roberts for the regular council member notaro miss cornelli for the regular ms roberts for the alternate council member roberts miss cornelli for the alternate miss roberts for the regular mayor goddess ms cornelli for the regular miss roberts for the alternate council member shirley ms cornelli for the regular miss roberts for the alternate and council members abel miss cornelli for the regular miss roberts for the alternate okay we have uh five to two on the regular uh for uh cornelli and we have five to two uh for robert on the alternate so uh cornelli is the regular uh account [Music] member and roberts is the alternate congratulations to both and thank you so much for volunteering [Applause] all right we're on to item number 16 which is consideration of appointment of an interim city manager during the city manager's search process first off do i have a motion and please clarify it's a move and doesn't work i move to consider the appointment um down here the interim city manager do i have a second section all right lloyd roberts you have before yes the city manager has provided us with a recommendation which i think is wonderful the only question i had um lynn had to do with what does it actually begin what does it go into effect if we approve it tonight when this does his additional pay kick in i'm planning on hitting the road on wednesday but and so i would think it would take effect then and then uh i am planning to come back for the budget workshop to work that out with you which i told you before so but his increase would still stay in place once it starts yeah and i'll just be as needed from that point okay through the body workshop and any changes you make at that we'll make sure they're all updated that'll be [Music] as needed i will be on vacation that that's i'm taking what do you call a terminal vacation i would like to make a recommendation for one minor change and i spoke to mr reeves a little bit earlier tonight about this so currently listed as two thousand dollars per month i would like to alter that slightly to save one thousand dollars per pay period which is every two weeks just to make it more rounded rather than have to multiply the two thousand dollars by 12 and then divide it by 26 you know to come up with some number you just gave more eggs i did i'd like to i'd like to amend that emotion and make it as first june first instead of uh i guess you want to do in my state well this is i mean we could do it effective today and that would be the start of the paper but i was like i said i'm leaving one point so today is the start of a pay period yes i think that would make sense okay as a function of procedure sorry i'm making more attention i just want to make clear what you folks are doing pursuant to your charter section 3.01 the city council on a majority vote appoints the manager of the town of the city once you appoint mr uh whomever you appoint whoever your point and they become the city manager the interim city manager they are the person invested with all the authority of that office and so while mr reeves has kindly offered donated however it's working out to be available return to facilitate meetings and things that he see projects through upon his return that office doesn't change unless this body somehow changes it whoever assumes that office will have that office until you hire your next manager or otherwise remove that person from office and so just to be clear since there's this element of mr research he doesn't ride back into the sunset and become sheriff again you have your you have your manager and that's a mixed individual and that's so that there's predictability and operation of your government thank you very much before before you go you took uh your position it was mr reeves is going to be an advisory council more than city bachelor was relinquished to the job so he's coming back to help us right as an advisor [Music] and you and you folks and just again now getting back to procedurally where we were in the meeting um roberts had made a motion uh member banker uh had suggested that a proposed amendment demotion was not yet seconded um and so procedurally parliamentary procedure i don't know if you wish to clean that up before you or if you were amenable to that motion express then propose a minute expressing that what i would like to do is i would like to hold off i know everyone wants to make motions but what i would like to prefer to do is hold off until we hear from mr reichler and but let's uh let i'd like to hear from him would you like to come up and address the council and introduce yourself kyle riefler the assistant city manager for the city of feller beach i'm looking forward to having this opportunity if you guys see fit i'm excited to work for this wonderful city uh i've been working with mr reeves past two months getting familiar with everything i was not already familiar with and um during the time as an interim city manager i am confident that i can prove to you that i'm capable of uh for your consideration for the full-time position any questions i think we're blessed to have him i mean you've been doing you've been doing the assistant for a year now right approximately approximately yes and he's hand-joined he's in the building he's out there he's a great guy leslie mr roberts i agree vice mayor john with my background there is such a thing as just acting i mean he has some character all the authority in the absence of the city manager but it kind of clears up this concern of the senior attorney but i'm old for him i think uh appropriately angled the lower the city manager of this absence okay i knew that you had motion and you had a motion so you went first and you wanted to change change it to one thousand dollars that's exactly all right and then we have to go with that one first so do i have a second on that motion second that was my sable yes all right uh okay before we take a vote on this we have to take it to the citizens so would any citizens like to comment on this uh can we do this just by a voice vote all in favor aye aye any opposed okay so you just got a raise and you're not even hired [Laughter] okay so uh there was a second motion and that was brought about by frank just started at this pay period which is today i believe he said last week yesterday and i don't think that we actually have a start date on this no is that correct so we can uh do we have to put the start date on there or do we go ahead and go through this procedure uh generally speaking when entering into an employment agreement with the manager it's customary to have an effective date so you know again who had the authority at any given time and so you may wish you could and you can um you can set that for today it's a little complicated but you can do that just by the fact okay would you please make a motion and and list the date that you would like it my motion is the effective date of his pay increase would be great now since the council voted unanimously to approve him as our interim city manager is well we've already discussed we are amending the amended motion so the first the first motion was to amend the current um current consideration for a point so what we're doing is we're adding some stipulations to that so now it's uh right now the motion is approved to do one thousand dollars per pay period and now you're wanting to amend it as as soon as the council votes there's effectiveness today all right so let's see if i've got this right uh my advice would be that it'd be take effect immediately on the conclusion of this meeting that that's that's even better thank you way way better because it's starting to get a little dicey uh and do we have a second on your motion second day okay that's from leslie now we have consideration of appointing an interim city manager during the city manager search process with an effective pay rate of one thousand dollars per pay period beginning of or effective immediately following this vote can we change you have to watch that it's an increase it's not uh total it's an increase in one thousand percent period correct we're going to have to have some help writing this out so the most emotion on the floor mayor is is as you've stated to increase the compensation by a thousand dollars per pay period taking effect on the conclusion of this meeting this is what i believe you have if i'm capturing properly your communication that's what i'm understanding the motion on the floor being it's already been a thousand papers and setting this specific time is mr baker's motion on the floor that's been seconded behind that right okay do we have a second on that question any comments this this is actually consideration of appointing an interim city manager during the city of manchester process is who is correct we're not at that stage right stretching the agreement vice mayor gunn do you have any comments i guess i'm not clear why you're considering this the city manager gave the recommendation on the pay raise when he leaves that's the effective date of kyle stepping up that anti-acting city manager so i guess i'm not quite sure why we're born here the guy poor guy hasn't even been in the office yet you're already giving them uh considerations i i guess i'm not i'm not quite sure like that's my own problem yeah my guy was you got to be clear that which the word he used acting this is not an acting this is an interim right which means he's out of the chair and the new city manager is kyle for the interim so the good so the question is is is it going to be interim city manager effective this evening when we take this vote yes that's that's the motion on the floor well the motion to proceed to an individual the motion on the floor is for it to operate in that function to the extent i'm pausing and a little i'm trying to reconcile because i'm learning a little bit on the fly and where you are my your added concern here is um mr reeves is still an employee with vacation leave that he intends to take and his employment title is city manager um if you unseat him from that position effective tonight um as the interim with an interim and no no clear successor he is and are you you're not your aim is not to it's my understanding that it is not your aim to terminate mr reeves tenure uh before he exhausts his leave and whatever else and so that's the and that was part of why i previewed you know you're you're putting somebody new in the seat i'm not presently aware of those that exist i'm not aware of an agreement an independent agreement with mr reeves that would start today that would happen as an employee a contracted employee i don't know if is again i don't know if he has an employment contract um my apologies i didn't i wasn't clear where this was going and what the anticipated procedure was but the challenges and mr governs gonzalez if he's acting manager he has that authority however you have that and you have somebody in the seat for example if in another one of our another community i serve it is established by resolution that if the manager is incapacitated for any period of time so and so is the person with all the authority but the moment they're back on the scene capable they still hold they never cease to hold that title and so the tension that we're trying to reconcile here is you have a manager who will still be on your payroll taking their entitled vacation leave as they generally downshift and off and off board but you do need somebody who will serve that function day-to-day while they're on that leave and that is customarily referred to as an acting manager um and acting is not it's not emphasis on acting like they're pretending and they don't know what they're doing it's they have the authority on sight they are act they're actively serving in that role and so that's i think the vice mayor was picking up on what i was afraid was going to happen is it feels like this is incomplete all the pieces are not there and is that does that sound correct to you is that is that kind of what you're picking up on is that the pieces can be there i i don't know that we've reached that point yet um and ultimately that's under the charter you are the body with the authority to appoint a manager and dictate how that position is filled or who is serving in it at any given time so you have the capacity to put those in however these issues should be reconciled so that you don't have confusion as to um you know where mr reef sits in his tenure relative to whomever you have serving in that rule while he's traveling beginning wednesday and thereafter and the the timeliness is not actually given us the opportunity to hash these things out this is a time sensitive issue yes ma'am [Music] i don't think that was the right ending i didn't give you what i did i gave you your 60 days notice and i told the council that i would help in any way shape or form and uh that i wanted to take some vacation so if you tap your vacation onto your reservation date what is your resignation it's probably sometime in july and in july yeah somewhere and there i'll say third week of july which is what we were asking for and that's probably where there's some gray area because now we have we would have a standing interim and a standing city manager at the same time right now and you you can't do that no your charter contemplates one person holding that office and only one person and so that it is customary in municipal operation generally that in some communities it's mandated that there would be a resolution on file who states who would be the manager in the absence of a manager but i'm not aware of the policy here in that regard but what i would say is what at the very least in your business this evening i would suggest that you determine for any amount of time that manager reeves is absent from the jurisdiction or otherwise incapable of fulfilling and discharging his duties who will be the person to serve that role whether that be for his three weeks of leave or if god forbid somebody gets it by a bus tomorrow you know what happens next and so in this case you can have an acting manager that would probably be your best course of action at this stage to have an acting manager while still allowing mr reeve to fulfill whatever benefit you're you would either at that stage have your intro or if it i know that you were also expressing some concern about timelines of improvement but if somebody's recruited before the end of july that's something else then you won't need an interim but if you don't conclude that phase then you would need an intern to get you from the end of july to whenever in august or september that you finally reach a final candidate so that that individual for example let's because the discussion is centered around mr brooklyn i don't mean to talk about you as though you're not um he could be acting through to use the parlance videos so far the end of july become interim at the end of july and then you hire somebody thereafter to be your manager without qualification and there would be no conflict with our charter if we had an acting city manager no you would actually i mean you should always know who the person's it's sort of a more succession play it is customary to have a who is who has all the authority of the office by decree of the council in mr reed's absence because if god forbid putting aside his anticipated retirement if mr reeves were to fall into a coma tomorrow you would want to know well who is who is going to i i know it's it's terrible but but it's it's it's important to know who and i i'm speaking from a place of experience in another jurisdiction that i represent in this in this county they went from a manager retiring to an interim manager that interim manager in turn resigned and then it was this and we had to keep saying that 11 59 on tuesday they cease to be the manager and the next manager will be constantly establishing and we went through about five in a year um you know in terms of succession and shifts and and then even once we reached that final one it was okay and if anything happens to you who makes the call or if you're stuck in mexico on vacation and without communication who makes that who has the authority to say you're terminated because you've done something terrible in this town or yes sign that contract it's just succession planning much as we have the president vice president you know speaker etc in our federal government mr mayor and i know this has gone far afield of where you intended to be my apologies but i want to make sure you're you're executing precisely what you've intended wouldn't it be more crude if we go back to the original plan and just change mr ray's title to advisor lead the memorandum except for the word changing for a thousand dollars period or the other way to clean up the muddiness of this thing is whenever lynn release isn't in pocket to fulfill his city manager duties the assistant city manager becomes the acting city manager so i mean if you want to all it would take would be a resolution doesn't need his assistant as the acting city manager in the absence of lyndon ray's or a city manager sonic even at the point where lynn reeve's resignation becomes effective you still have an acting city manager and at the end of the hiring process you designated with the city managers and up until you designated who the city manager is kyle is the team city manager all the authority of lynn reeves in his absence that's very important i am uh i'm i'm reaching out to the city attorney to guide us through this and i think that's the best best route absolutely i appreciate that mr banker your point is well taken uh but however that's complicated by the fact that your sitting manager mr reeves has an employment agreement tonight and as i sit here now to reconcile that with a proposed course of action removing him from office and what would he be entitled to on the spot and it gets very very convoluted and i'm not trying to remove wrongs i'm trying to do a title change no i i understand that but his his employment agreement contemplates him serving with a specific type and so that's that's the challenge i understand you're not trying to terminate him but it's what what recourse did he have etcetera and my job is to consider those those eventualities i would say your best bet is as a council you can informally vote to designate mr whomever to rightfully flirt sorry which one is it great reefer mr reid flirt um mr riefler as the acting city manager in the absence of mr reeves and that would be the simplest way to in line with what council member governor suggested it's it's just you by your vote you could establish who would be the acting manager it would be mr riefler and if you wish to set terms for that we can we can also take an agreement and retroactively apply it approved at a subsequent hearing as to what the compensation would be for added service in that role etc we can look at that but as far as most narrowly what you're trying to achieve tonight is ensuring that when mr reeds leaves on wednesday for what he's described as his terminal leave you know who's in charge and this body has the ability to do that by [Music] okay so would you be kind enough to give us give us the correct motion that incorporates everything that we're trying to accomplish tonight so that someone here can actually make that motion and we can move forward because we're going to be here all night i also think it's a good idea to name the candidate in this in this motion in particular and at this stage of the proceedings i agree with you mayor that's that's appropriate uh remember shelley for surely it sounded like there was something yeah i was gonna say i don't mind taking a stab at it you know just if you wanted to get this movie i work at your pleasure so you tell me how you want to receive well i mean it seems pretty simple i mean i just uh would like to make a motion to appoint um kyle riefler as the acting city manager and the absence of mr lynn reeves and also well i was discussing pay those i was going to say and then also um in consideration for the added dues uh a pay increase of a thousand dollars per pay period is an ocean that was my question second uh you didn't you didn't mention the effective thing well it would she did mention that right it's functionally in his absence upon his absolutely the own and the only question i would have and you sort of talked about it earlier so when mr reeves comes back into town we can't be bouncing back and forth on this that doesn't make any sense so he comes back into town we're saying okay now mr reese is in charge that's going to be very confusing he said in his absence and once he comes back into town he's not absent anymore right so who's the city manager in that instance it would be that it would be manageable to manage your readings that's a problem it's no different than what we've been doing it's not this is i understand why it's a problem in terms of wanting it to to the cleanest of the cleanest most desirable approaches somebody ends on this day somebody ends on that day your complication here is really a complication as a result of an embarrassment of riches you have a manager who's who's retiring and willing to make themselves available on an ongoing basis while they've reached their retirement date rather than say full stop don't call me lose my number after this day and so that we're trying to navigate that while balancing the needs excuse me of your form of government and so i agree with you that the complication there to me is not so much in who's in charge because it's very clear whenever he's whenever the man's in the building the man's a manager uh but the complication there is in as much as you start adding compensation to it and his compensation is based on when he's serving in that role and you know he's playing people with the role that kind of compact does complicate how do we establish what his compensation is so my strong recommendation to you at this stage would be to establish who is going to be in the role beginning which date and it can be acting i the motion that you made is very close to what i would have said um and it would have been to to establish that mr riefler be appointed as the acting city manager in the absence of mr reeves until such time as mr reeves vacates the office or you otherwise hire somebody else that's basically what you're trying to achieve compensation otherwise i think that there's still time with all due respect to mr riefler i don't i don't know what plans you've made in your life around this potential compensation but the that element i don't know when this body is next to convene it sounds like we'll be convening sooner than later based on your manager recruitment processes anyhow and that can be addressed in a matter of a few weeks when you meet and backdated to hey he's been assuming this if we can find a way to clean that up and reconcile it with the informed knowledge of mr reeve's contract the acting manager agreement the responsibilities and duties so my [Music] concise statement is take the motion mr shirley had made go with that right up until there was a compensation element resolve compensation benefits and otherwise at a later date if need be but really for continuity of government which is my core concern for you as a community would be to handle that tonight and that only and deal with how people will be compensated and then that may give you time to also reevaluate what your current um configuration is i'm not the chair so i'm not going to call you is there a way to word it so that um the effective date that we choose for kyle he becomes the um not the interim city manager but the acting and and he is in that role from that point forward so is there a way to work it in such a way that mr reeves from that point forward will i'm sorry we'll never be considered the city manager for a couple reasons because i know from a council standpoint we would like the opportunity i know to and i know he's going to excel to evaluate kyle in this role full-time so while we're going through this process it's one of the candidates obviously there short answer yes is there a way to do that yes it's basically the first half of our discussion right up until what's this complication the challenge the complication here is you have an employee who by all accounts you wish to to steward towards retirement and allow them the benefit of all of their accrued benefits and otherwise and that takes time and what you don't have in this moment is time and so my challenge for you is how are you going to reconcile the interests of this is not a situation where you're terminating a manager because you're done with them you're through with them and we need to you're reconcilable differences usually in those scenarios it's very clean after this meeting you mean right in the middle of me you leave hey you you come up and you sit here that's not what you're trying to do you're you know and that's and i'm not i don't know what to suggest you are but if you make it such that mr riefler is the manager effective tomorrow at 1201 am then to the extent mr reeves has an employment contract that entitles him to compensation benefits leave approval etc how do you reconcile that with the fact that he doesn't actually have an office in your city again right and so i'm trying to balance those interests by saying the best way to do this is you're functioning the placeholder making him acting and if that gives us time to reevaluate maybe we enter into a separate agreement with mr reeves to reconcile that that will make this cleaner down the road and my my duty is as much as i respect and have enjoyed working with mr reeves my duty is to use the body if this body feels to realize like you know what i didn't quite appreciate that this worked that way we can talk about a different voluntary separation agreement or anything else but in the here and now and again i'm not suggesting mr reeves easily i'm trying to balance all your interest and present you the multiverse of auctions before you the the here and now option that is most viable is the emotion on the floor that does not have a second which is that mr riefler served as the acting city manager for the city of bellar beach upon the absence of mr reeves from the jurisdiction or basically that's the ocean basically in his absence mr riesler serves and when he returns then mr reeves is vested with that authority until such time as the other was departs again or the city council takes some action that is not consistent with him retaining the time is it is it smart to list mr reeves exclusively or is it in absence of city manager and that way we actually do have a backup city manager in the event that someone else is hired for that position big picture i would ordinarily say yes but given your current landscape not really it's my understanding that mr riefler may well be one of the candidates for that office yeah and so it in the in the event he were to ascend to that and there's no presumption that he would you've not really achieved anything and so i would say that your better bet is to just address the here and now and not try we can put a pin and i trust me after the conversation we've had i'm not going to forget this you know getting getting a procedure in place for that going forward once we get to a permanent manager it may well be a resolution that we do right after we approve the contract for that individual um and deciding who those people or persons would be in what order um but in the here and now i think your your motion member shirley's motion on the floor is the most appropriate motion for you to consider absent any reference to compensation all right surely would you please uh repeat your motions yes my motion is to appoint kyle free florida as the acting city manager in the absence of mr lane raves remember the charter science okay i like that council comments well mr roberts brings out a good point about is he in the chair or not in the chair and i think the two of them weren't smart i mean mr reese actually brought kyle here i don't think there's going to be any conflict but i like what mr roberts said about we want to evaluate this ban so how are you really evaluating if there's he comes back for a day two days he doesn't have well i don't think that it hasn't been an issue to this point i know lin's um agreed to help us through budgeting i think that's a good opportunity for kyle to learn from lynn what the budgeting process is so i think that i think you guys are reading too deep into this kyle has the authority unless lynn is in the building and you know but i don't see lynn coming in and going kyle sit down and shut up i'm taking over i just don't see that i i agree with you guys maturely uh and specifically what you just stated that we're going to evaluate him that's unfair to all the other candidates we can't be doing that well the only of the only question and uh i have to agree with mr banker that it will he plainly says in absence so he's no longer the acting city manager in absence of city manager reeves so he walks in the door you're no longer the acting city manager that's my problem yes vice mayor i i was just going to say because i don't i think we're murderboarding this thing and this acting really clears it up a lot and i don't see lynn coming in and trying to reassert and stuff and nothing prevents lynn from coming in and saying kyle is still acting i'm delegating all of my city manager of 42 kyle to make decisions on the spot right now because i'm i'm fully employed taking care of the budget or something else he can do that just about any time it's delegate his responsibilities to kyle's i i think we're we're concerned about too much here and i think this is the most robust solution we're going to come up with and i'm all i'm fully in support of the council member okay though i've not found the specific language on delegation that is standard practice if you wish to clean it up yet further the motion could be in the absence or declared unavailability of manager libraries and in that way if mr reeve's presence alone is the implication you could say i'm here but i'm considerably unavailable um that's the only other thing i can offer to you as a and i'm not trying to be pedantic about this i'm trying to respond to your feedback and quell your concerns so your other option could be to be in the absence or declared unavailability of the manager then that would address the hey yeah i'm in the building but like i'm not here to answer questions i'm not here to do stuff i came to pick up a pen i left i'm not trying to make official decisions um that would be the closest i think we could get to reconciling each party's concerns tonight with the understanding that i do think this matter may likely need to be revisited in the near term what did you call it declared availability unavailable declared unavailability and then that way that gives explicitly it's in the absence or declared on availability if you're out of motion in a second so um they would have to express a desire to amend their motions but um if you go that route that leaves no doubt that ling has the authority to the ability to see that and his your presence while his new presence be triggered he can also then functionally decline would you like to retract your um your second while she corrects her motion yes that's fine or i'll move to the bit i don't know okay with the emotion and my motion is to appoint kyle reefer at griefler as an acting city manager in the absence or declared unavailability of mr lynn reeves do i have a second yes why would we not want to go ahead and put the compensation in there now that we've kind of addressed that compensation was in there the reason that i offered that i'd suggested that it complicates matters is to the extent mr reeves can at his election and presence assume the office are you then not compensate today where we i don't have an employment agreement i don't have all these other documents that i want and i don't know how your payroll works are you going to then program mr riefler's compensation by minus 24 hours of that one week and minus 36 hours i don't think so but you you could do it but then they're not really being compensated for the services right you could do it it's your prerogative it's just i can see just as easily as you say as far as i'm concerning should have it for as long as he's available to serve that office and you could certainly do that um i was trying to not eat the elephant one bite at a time right let's determine who's going to be in there and what their and then if you wish to resolve that you can but my complication was then if one person says well i'm not comfortable using those funds during that time to compensate god he's not really holding the title and so i'm trying to balance based on the feedback and comments i'm hearing trying to reconcile that and say the first bite is who's going to occupy the office and when let's figure out who and when and we can retroactively resolve for what for what compensation um if we so desire if you wish to i would say my advice to you would be do that first and if you wish to talk about compensation we can have that conversation next but at least decide who's going to be assuming the office the moment mr reeves starts driving away from the jurisdiction any other comments before i go to the citizens no citizens yes sir john hanson 322nd street i lost track of the number of times she beat this poor host to death i really have emotion as it's made right now makes sense the one thing that is totally complicated your decision process you don't have an actual date that the current city manager is retiring he's giving you a 60-day notice he's given you an agreement which you have agreed to make available for assistance down the road with the budget and so forth now there are two of us physically in this room and one remotely with military experience and i'm going to give you an example terminal leave prior to discharge or retirement you have so many days on the books you know when your last day is my question to you is and to us the citizens when is his last day if you had that information it would have made your decision process much simpler much quicker and a whole lot less complicated thank you very much anyone else yes florida um i certainly appreciate all the time you've taken tonight to discuss this and make sure it all gets ironed out so it's correct um another idea might be for then to go ahead and leave on the aid and you guys give him a severance package to pay him for all of his vacation time that he has come in that way kyle could go ahead and take over as the interim and that would resolve all of that but it's an idea to go ahead and give him the severance package that's only really dad thank you thank you any other citizens so back to the council is that less common workable uh that he i'm sure you're staying on health benefits with the city utility and the other comment from the citizen about we should have a hard date that you're leaving well i can do that with the calendar to give you like i don't said earlier it's like july 22nd or something so if we gave you a severance package and we've already approved your travel expenses coming back and everything like that would that not clean everything up here the short answer is yes a severance package is being described i would call it a severance agreement would clean that up and that's sort of what i've very vaguely been referencing throughout this is you may wish to revisit you you as a council may wish to revisit if this arrangement this sort of semi-formal arrangement works best for you however if you decided and mr reeves was amenable to it we could talk terms and see if an agreement can be vetted out that that memorializes a specific end date compensation how his leave and benefits would be handled that's not something that you're going to met out at this day is this evening at least on my advice i would not advise you to do so until such time as again your legal counsel has the benefit of seeing what is he entitled to in his current employment agreement what does your insurance provider provide about coverage for somebody depending on what what his status is and those sorts of those those factors all go into a [Music] efficient and effective severance agreement so that we don't leave anything undone and unresolved because if we try to do it on the fly invariably there will be something we miss that will one subject you do heightened criticism for this process and also to not fully memorialize what what you would have done with the ability to prepare and so there may be there may be value in reconvening this month or or early in the next month to address that but in the here and now tonight i think your motion on the floor is adequate and you and you folks can mull over whether or not that needs to be addressed at a later date okay all right uh yes can we call for a vote what do we need to do a discussion with the horse is dead well i have to allow you to discuss it as long as you need and if everyone's ready we can take the vote vice mayor gun are you good with that i'm good i'm just going to say this is a devotional floor is a very cool box it's very robust covers all the cloudiness and bakeries when they reach is absent or declares his absence think that kyle riefler is acting significant very clean and uh we deal with the uh bonuses and pain issues later i agree with council members shirley and the advice of city intern okay all right if everybody's uh satisfied with this motion we will move forward and uh take a vote patty this is for appointing kyle riehler as acting city manager in absence of city manager reeves or declared unavailability council member roberts yes council member shirley aye councilmember sable yes councilmember banker yes councilmember notaro yes vice mayor gunn i mayor goddess yes so the pass is 7-0 and we now have an acting city manager [Applause] all right next do we need to address the compensation uh and uh if so would someone like to make a motion promotion to address the compensation manager to address his compensation to increase it one thousand dollars per pay period effective immediately do i have a second second boys i believe since council voted to give him the responsibilities of this great city and acting city manager he serves compensation for it and his story roberts i would like to further define a thousand dollars per pay period there's 10 days in the pay period correct 14. but we don't get paid if we divide it up in 10 working days that equates to 100 per day very simple number if we made it 100 per day and on particular times mr reeves returned there would be a simple mathematical equation so let's say in any particular week you're back one day now it's 400 for that week something like that but it could if somebody's concerned about that fact that mr reeves comes back into town and he's now the city manager it's a very simple round number unless we're confident that we're never going to have that scenario where you're going to be now the city manager again you're always going to relinquish that option as long as we're good on that then we just leave it a thousand dollars a day period and it's no problem can i propose something um i think this is going to take a little more thought that we can we can do sitting at this diet i think we need to review enter into an agreement contract with kyle we uh this on again off again pay i don't think is something that can be done we agreed to as long as he's acting city manager this is his compensation period it doesn't matter whether lynn's in town or not in town that shouldn't matter so there's and that's a good reason why we need to kind of put some thought into this and maybe have the attorney present us a employment contract plus we need to look at lynn's employment at the same time so i would i would propose that we have a meeting we talk about setting up another meeting right now all right let's take a look this is a motion to table the motion to uh increase uh acting city managers pay uh one thousand dollars per pay period until further discussion uh patty could you please call council member notaro aye councilmember banker no council member zabel councilmember shirley i'm councilmember roberts yes pardon yes yes vice mayor gunn hi mayor goddess yes so the motion of the table passage we will address this soon uh i anticipate a work session and some sort of an emergency meeting to approve this compensation okay we've got that out of the way item 17 this is to authorize the city manager to execute an extension of the code enforcement special master memorandum of understanding extend the mou for an additional two years at 175 dollars per hour do i have a motion shirley do i have a second second surely you on the floor any other discussion uh let's go to the citizens oh this question back to the council briefly how many hours have we paid for uh she's she's on a bi uh cohering basis uh actually i think we did a check for her today it was like 150 per copier so it's sporadic as an example if we have a uh let's see what was the most recent quarter co-appearing it was a short term and i think it costs the 450 yeah because i was concerned about the 25 or an hour increase but it's not 40 hours a week it's oh no no no no i mean i can send you an email with what she was compensated last year thank you it's kind of hitting this this is the first increase we've had ever ever and we've started this company for 10 years now the original time she started was our co-administrators yeah all right any other comments from the council mr dunn is blacked out right now so uh all in favor any opposed all right 7-0 mr reeves you're authorized to execute the extension all right now we go to unfinished business does anyone have any unfinished business well okay um the only thing that i have right mr gunn did you have any kid i didn't look up sorry the only thing that i have right now is the total wage zones we discuss towards zones and and i spoke to randy about that and he did send us some information the total weight zone issue really lies with feller shore because that's the area we're talking about and uh randy can kind of give some more input on that but we did have a discussion you could indulge me a moment marriage just want to call it by email so i can recall precisely what it stated in the broadest sense as we talk about toway zones the issue comes from whose property um my understanding of the beach accesses that were of concern the beach access is the property is owned by eller shore at least in the areas that were a particular concern whether the city or town has the ability to depends on the actual owner of record of the contemplated parking areas additionally there may be they'll need to be appropriate signage place vehicle owners will notice that they are in a towing zone how to reach the company that will tow their vehicle given that both communities rely on ps pcso my advice was also to inquire with bcso if they have any sop standard operating procedures or legal considerations associated with towing from public property we may likely be directing that but your your code enforcement is handled by pcso and if pcso says oh we don't like doing that but we're not willing to do that that creates an ad and i'm not suggesting they will but there are times where municipalities want the sheriff's office to do something and they say we're not comfortable proceeding in that fashion so no and so we need to make sure that that i doubt that would be the case but that we should have that dialogue as well um and finally the communities need to consider their respective purchasing guidelines concerning the procurement of a contractor to handle towing if it is decided that they want to go in that direction so if if it is in fact battle source property that's the only place we're towing from dollar store has to close about that if they have procurement guidelines that require them for a contract of x amount to go out to bid or do invitation events or something like that just doing that and keeping with those procedures as well i think it would be more of a mutual understanding i understand what you're saying it's their property so they would have to do the contract with towing company and make sure that law enforcement agreed with the procedure we certainly we have our own we have our own lots also and going back to the conversation with belair shore that the last conversation that i had with him was we were trying to to come to some type of terms that would benefit both communities so that we could work together and make life easier for us and make life easier for them they agree that they want to be neighborly with us but they also understand that there are some abuses that are going on on their property so one of the things that i opened up and discussed with them was what can we do to help you and their two biggest complaints weren't really obviously because there's no umbrellas right now the two biggest complaints that they had was people abusing their property trespassing and [Music] just pretty much neglecting their their teach the the belair shore beach so the conversation that i had with him was well what can we do and i think mutually we agree that we should increase the up and down the beach uh i did mention that uh we had an erosion problem and that the uh putting the big cruisers on the beach was probably not the best idea uh if they do couple that with turtle nesting season so that was one one avenue that we went down and the other one was um parking parking access and who actually goes there well uh if the sheriff's department is patrolling once a shift and they have to not go by during sunset or after sunset or maybe just before they're probably missing the peak opportunity to get the most traffic also we hear the education i also heard that at the bellar shore meeting that i think both communities as a whole i think that that we agree that if people are just ducking in there they don't have a sticker they don't have permission they have nothing to do with anybody in either one of our municipalities they're trespassing and so i think that they're on board with contracting with a towing company and trust me a toting company has opportunity to make money so they would swoop in there every time they saw a car and they would tow them away and now that would be the end of that um these are these are all things that we're starting to discuss so at this time i haven't really haven't had a huge discussion with the council about it's more of a fact-finding mission to see what could be done and uh and you've got the answer for me and so in the next work session that's what we'll be addressing is how do we how do we do this if we want to move forward i can assure you that bel air shore will go along with this what whatever it is that we need and it's their understanding all they hate is some signs that say it's totally zoned and somebody shows up that doesn't belong there tell a company i'll jump all over and take take their car away they'll only do it one time and so that's that's where we're at right now as far as um as far as the the topic that you brought up with the umbrellas uh unfortunately right now we're still in a stalemate and it has to do with um with a lawsuit and two very strong real entities and it's that i don't think that there's really anything that our community community can do except we're continuing to extend that alcoholic branch and see if we can break them down and i think that we're making progress i see manager reach do you have any comments on that yeah i i think the conversation the mayor and i had was a good conversation i will tell you that i did contact the sheriff's office and ask them to do more directive patrols on the beach so hopefully they're doing that if they're not then we'll check into them little further but i i think it's a positive step a couple other things we talked about was that trying to gains some research on that actually we started uh one company i think was in prayer or something like that that we're talking to so uh the towing was product around you to see if it was and i assumed it was going to have to be a bell or short situation so i i think it may be time to have another conversation i think that they would go along with the electronic gates the problem is is now you have to legally provide every resident in lrb with something to get them in the gate and now it becomes cost prohibitive because let's just say that you know every remote is 75 per household and you want two or three of them because you have two or three cars and you want one to walk around with so you can get in the small gate all of a sudden the cost goes way up for the town of valley shore it's not that much because they don't have that many residents but for the city of bel air beach it's a huge expense and so that's why i've kind of shied away from the the access gates because it just it doesn't seem practical but that would certainly solve most of our problems mr mayor yes just just today and talking to a couple of people about our shows i haven't talked to many but they're concerned about the uber drop offs um just today two electric bikes came on at 6th street another one had and i'm a dog lover not only i had a dog walking the whole length of the beach okay um doing its duty okay um and i understand that they that's what upsets them you know and i can't think if they go all the way down to the clearwater boat that club or whatever they haven't gained access there but it's a punch key which can't be that expensive um well the problem with that is is that whenever you have a population the size of belair peach that's a lot of shared access you're absolutely right but it i think it would drop i think it would minimize some of it it's not gonna it's it's cheaper it's what i'm saying and not that for the gates or you know whatever the kirk deep deeds are currently what i'm saying is if you're going to build that relationship um i think the parking has been really and i think it's the the electronic bikes um uber job walls and even we're a little bit you know we've got the parking out here where you can park here and then we'll go yeah i think it's uh it just starts with baby steps something that we do we can that both municipalities can agree upon and then you grow the relationship and uh and and work together and little by little i think that we'll get over this but yes it's taking some time and uh it's it's uh very unfortunate but there were there was a uh unfortunate chain of events that occurred uh on the onset of coca and uh suddenly tampa is down here flooding our beaches and destroying things and carving furniture and swimming in people's pools and partying on their sea walls and it wasn't just there it was up here some too so it's just going to take some time to repair the damage and that's the best answer any other unfinished business nope council member or a vice president no all right so uh now we have council comments since uh since i tried the last time to leave him out this month we're going out the vote of war again and i'll call council member uh the only comment i have is uh 78 years ago today d-day i thank all those who count men and great men that attacked his beaches and put the end to world war two well a year two months three months later but uh thank you up there i'm looking up in heaven but uh god bless nicely said any other comments uh councilman ontario all right uh councilmember roberts yes the uh somebody mentioned about the left-hand turn issue that we have up here right down the street uh at our last workshop i asked the council if i could kind of take the lead on that which i'm going to do they all approved it i do have a copy of the traffic study that was done by pinellas county they actually outsourced it mr reeves gave me a copy of that it's about 12 inches thick which is wonderful but i do have some experience and knowledge in that area so i am going to pursue that i strongly believe that there are better options and my lead question to the county is going to be tell me what we can do in order to have the left turn signal returned i already know what some of their answers are going to be but that's going to be my objective to get that left turn signal yellow turn signal back where we have the option because we've all lived through that we've come up to that light and now we have a red light and there's no traffic on the other side and we're sitting there for which seems like a day i'm sure it's only 60 seconds but it's still very very frustrating so that's going to be my goal to get that fixed and it was one other thing yeah i'm all in favor of the parking tickets for the 6 12 and 19 street parking area i appreciate the officer was talking about education i think the best education is give them a ticket have them pay the fine and then they'll be much smarter the next time so very quickly this is a big issue for me this council recently approved the 12th and 13th street stormwater project i went home that night and i actually had difficulty sleeping because i know i was elected as all of us were to represent all the citizens of this county i actually visited a family who's sitting back there now when i left that meeting to vent so that i could somehow get rid of that i went home i laid in bed till one o'clock in the morning i got the remote control i turned on the television and watched top gun for the first hot gun for two additional hours the problem is the following this council dropped the ball we are sitting in a position where we could potentially waste 250 000 conservatively of our taxpayer dollars i'm sorry that's the only way to say it and the reason is let me tell you there's only like three or four different things that are happening with these outfall pipes you have a high tide and no rain historically the city has witnessed problems where the salt water back flowed through the pipe and onto the streets kudos to the city city manager and team have alleviated a lot of those problems by putting check valves on the end of those alcohol pipes beautiful we also have a scenario still where there's a high tide and a new drain event that water cannot get out of the streets because check valves are going to close and even if there won't check valves there because of the head pressures involved that water could not get out good news is the water that's going to be sitting in your streets is fresh water not salt water that's all good you're also going to have a low tide with a big rain event that's when there's no issue at all the water goes down the drains into the pipe out the outfall no problem so that's not a problem a quick timeline on may the 2nd we had a council meeting where this was brought up for the first time and we decided to table it because there were so many questions asked about it that was followed up by a workshop on may the 16th we spent a lot of time discussing the 12th and 13th street project and the decision was made at that time i just listened to the audio again today to move forward to reject the project then i had a special council meeting on sixth one which was last wednesday walked into the meeting all of a sudden it wasn't rejected people had changed their vote and it wasn't rejected so it was actually voted at that point to move forward with the contract and that project again i will say we're missing the opportunity to review this the biggest question was what is the condition of the current reinforced concrete pipe that's under the ground we have not done our job by videoing those those pipes to determine what condition they're in i just read about a city i think it was in wisconsin where they decided they had 85 year old pipe they decided to remove it when they removed it they were like wow this pipe is in excellent condition is what they determine so they kept that pipe that they took out of the ground and they're going to reuse it potentially on projects down the street the army corps of engineers has articles talking about reinforced concrete planet can be good for over a hundred years yet we're choosing to take it out it doesn't make any sense because at the end of the day as i ask the engineer on this job will that improve these other scenarios i described and the answer is no it's not going to happen we're going to see the same problems which begs the question why would we spend that additional money in order to see the same issues and i'm still unbelieving as to how the votes change from the workshop to the last special meeting and that's where we are and it we're taking taxpayers dollars and not spending it properly that's the part that makes me uncomfortable that's our job our job is to determine the best way to spend the money we have we have a finite amount of money and we need to spend it correctly thank you council member shirley just a couple of quick comments um the there were a lot of people here wanted to address the buoys i'm not sure that they're aware of the letter that was sent and they draft as as i'm told again this was during a work session so that might change but this was a letter that had to be sent to fwc so that we were now brought into compliance that we have a plan in place it doesn't mean that we have to proceed with the plan council has not voted on yet this was just a holding a card holder basically for fwc so they would not find us so that's to those that looks like everyone left that was asking those questions but uh to address that and then um secondly my second point is back to the drainage issue that mr roberts just discussed um i unfortunately was not here for that special meeting that was called but when we left the work session we all agreed that we were going to have uh cameras running to the pipe so we could get a complete picture of what we were dealing with on this drainage project and the fact that we voted on something that we didn't do our due diligence on is really disgusting to me that the council would move forward with a vote that we all agreed we would do some homework on and see what needs to be done the fact that it passed is just um shameful that our council agreed to pass that and that's all i want to say i hope in the future that we don't uh act so quickly to move forward with something we're getting hit with huge increases and we shouldn't take a closer look at it council members say well i would uh basically add to that if you're complaining about that you should be here for the vote but otherwise thank you house member banker for remembering our guilty veterans thank you that's all i am vice mayor gun two things one is this remote access from my perspective is working wonderful i can hear you guys i'm seeing so i'm pumped up on the audio vision secondly why is it that the two engineers in this collegial body is having problems sleeping with this 12th and 13th street project i am in total agreement with everything that lloyd has said and especially joey sher if you go back to the minute council member robert suggested to table the item or review to ensure that the benefit of the project is equal to the cost we we all pretty much bloated on that when we came back and then the next thing that happened my expectations were that we were going to do some due diligence you were going to jam with the pipes we were going to go back and look at the cost benefit of this project and the escalation and prices to consider the budget index with respect to a comment that was made that to avoid analysis paralysis there was no analysis between the time that we tangled that and the time that we had a special meeting there was no discussion there was no further analysis in this thing whatsoever i was as surprised as anybody when i saw nothing getting done i they sent out the old report so people could at least see what the basis of the initial report was and it was all simulation it was all based on went onto an outdated design or system but there was no objective analysis of the condition or types or the problems it said hey it's an outdated design problem it's small outflows and we don't think we can solve that problem because of the easement issues there so i have some some serious problems with that as well in absence of that nothing else where is the gimbal plan for where we go from here i'm not disputing the vote that's due process and i understand it but how he made the decision there was nothing there there was no analysis no further discussion that just happened and i'm saddened by that process if nothing else happens we need to monitor this project because as we start digging up little pies we should be we should be uh archiving the status of those pipes and conditioning these structural integrities pipes so that further down in the room we don't make the same mistake we spent time talking about uh decals four thousand talked about uh christmas decoration we're talking about a 35 increase in a project 200 thousand dollars and we when we okayed this even before we got into the budget reward process you know horse car horsepower something down tilted here we haven't even talked about the strategic plan what are the relevant issues what what are the priorities when you're paying a 200 000 increasing project and i'm talking about standing warnings that's all i've got to say on that thank you thank you vice mayor let's see i've been made aware that the tourism development council may be able to help the san kee beach nourishment project i also spoke with mayor ken welch at the mayor's council he actually served on that council and told him that we were in dire straits and we're one of the lucky ones and we still have beach but there are many communities south of here that they have little of nothing left their beaches are eroded we've lost according mr reeves we've lost half of our beach already so i made a point to pull him off to the side and get his attention on this and plan on sending him a letter along with other mayors they're holding the purse strings of about 300 million dollars this could be resolved and it would still require easements to do the nourishment project however it would not require a perpetual easement it would only take a one or two year easement that i'm certain that most of the people that are unwilling to sign these easements they would sign it on a two-year plan knowing that they would get their property back at the end of the project so working on that to see what can be done and if the county is willing to work with us if we can get the tourism development council on board i believe that they will have no problem persuading the county permission to approve this but we have to keep working and we'll see what happens uh let's see here again i'd like to thank everyone for coming out tonight i'd also like to thank kyle um the vice mayor dunn's already brought it up the new audio system is incredible uh for patty she told me that we were at least up to 2019. no i'm just kidding great job great job and uh do i have a motion to adjourn i shouldn't return frank baker do i have a second second floyd roberts all right all in favor all right any opposed goodnight everyone"
