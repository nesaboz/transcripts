    "transcript": "okay charlotte d malay here tony gatliff here here i'm sorry yeah i can hear you once i'm just trying to looking for dave see if he was back okay leslie notaro robert risper here michael sable yeah and kathleen's closure is unable to attend and hold on dave just came in hold on uh oh that's a lot of um feedback hold on i'm letting david dave so for some reason we got a google meet something or another and i was confused i went to the wrong meeting place yeah i don't know what that is but can can you hear this feedback dave uh the feedback did i did i introduced that well one second no it's not you it's leslie for some reason can't unmute and so we have her on the speakerphone but it's doing feedback okay so i see um okay so it's leslie that cannot on you right he answered hang on for a second okay okay this is the deal is she on telephone there she is okay i just i just moved the plug from point a to point b now can you hear me there we go all right so we did the roll call and we're ready to go okay okay i'm here first thing is the june 24th 2020 meeting minutes a motion to approve discussion all in favor aye all right good done okay um discussion of committee deliverables and priorities i think you all got a copy of with what patty sent out the shall i say the brief report that i gave to the city council last whenever it was at their last meeting about they had wanted some things that we thought were like first steps and things that could be done including town hall meetings the lists of residents voters um working with other cities on how they communicate we're looking at our website and looking at possible systems to um online our um our uh city council meetings and just um a lot of this stuff is things that um you know we're putting on to the city council on the systems i know that um david was looking he gave a presentation to the council last dave gaddis about um his logitech systems are you there yes i am can you like kind of fill us in on what it was and how it happened and what they said okay so um so basically at this time that hardware is not necessary um uh also i receive uh feedback from lynn that the company said that their hardware their hardware would not work now logitech yes now in the meantime my company has actually purchased one of the kits and uh we received it today we started playing with it a little bit but we only had about i'd say about 10 minutes to set it up at least i got a picture and uh that's a start i will have more information next week and uh uh basically what i will do is i will send a an email to patty uh forward on to everyone that you know basically states what you know how i felt about it and uh and then she of course is our filter can decide whether it's in violation of something they're not um but uh overall it was very easy to set up it looks like it could relatively inexpensively uh take care of our meetings the cables are long the microphones have great response uh the only thing they don't do is provide amplification for the audience and uh i honestly believe that if the speakers are out in the audience and then we're talking among our you know ourselves in our regular meeting that we can generally hear each other um but again there's some things i need to work out and uh we'll see where it goes if it's not the appropriate system then lynn is actually looking at uh alternatives on his own professional companies if that's what they do is they set up uh boardrooms for virtual meetings so lynn uh do you have any input to add to that no that that's you know i talked to that one which i mentioned to you uh and basically what the logitech person told me was that it was more for a small conference room not for a size of the size of city uh console chambers so that's what they shared with me but uh and even the video company that did come out said that it probably wasn't the thing that would work because it doesn't have a big expansion to it i guess how he put it but we'll get more information yeah and here's what i found out about that is that the device supports up to seven microphones there's about i'm going to say about 10 feet between each microphone and if it's placed between every two or three people they share so what happens is the the uh the camera will swing around to that mic that's getting the action and if it's uh basically if people are within the range of speaking it's sort of intelligent but so let's say i'm speaking and then i've got a couple of council members on each side of me what would happen is it would rather than just showing me or trying to find me it would find the three people that it's picked up on and show them all in the view even though only one person is speaking again i'm doing some experimentation i have the system that i purchased i bought two additional mics so we have four mics and i was able to fill a very large boardroom with them so let's see how the camera responds to the sound and everything once we've got it fully loaded and do some experimentation with it with it i without a doubt think that at least sound wise it'll pick up everybody it's just as it's smart enough to know where that sound came from so we'll see thank you um unfortunately i didn't get this stuff information early enough to get you guys out but if you'll go to the indian rocks beach website they put theirs on youtube and victor our video guy is involved with that and he can help us with that i wish i could have gotten to him earlier to get him here tonight but go on the indian rocks beach website and see what you think of their yes i see dave what he victor did tell me is that they have no interaction with the public right now so he's able to film and and broadcast live but he's not able to allow the public to phone in or sky or you know use their their cameras and uh get into the system no citizen comments right that's what what he told me also that's that's that's not what they're i guess whatever indian rocks is doing that's how they decided to operate it at this point and he said we he would need two people to do it if he tried to expand it yep and so the system that we're using right now we actually tested we're using zoom now and uh the difference between regular zoom and what we are using today is uh uh webinars and it's not being used to its fullest extent but basically um there's a public address that you give out that anyone can log into and then you can uh either with a your keypad on your phone or with your computer you can raise your hand but everyone is muted by default with that particular login the other members uh this committee the council whatever you know one of the boards etc they are given individual logins and um basically uh patty or or victor whoever it was that was managing the uh the meeting would populate a certain uh list and then say send and everyone in this group would receive a different email that's customized just for you so then uh patty or victor would put the general public login on the website so and this is what we're using right now it's just again it's not being used uh to its fullest extent uh basically the uh the uh where we're muting and unmuting and having trouble with that everyone on this committee has uh unfettered access to be able to speak however the public is by default muted at all times and what they have to do is they have to raise their hand and then you can text or uh you know do a uh instant message uh to the host and that's where you get the name and address and everything and you can even lock it down even further to where it requires them to register so once they're registered now you automatically know who it is and um it worked out not too bad we didn't we used everyone as general public in the last meeting but we had some people that called in that had comments and it worked out uh would you agree lynn yes yeah yeah it worked it was fine i think the last council meeting the last works work session that's right and and we've got to do some more you know this is our second meeting with it so we're learning as we go along and uh you know dave told us about this secondary thing and we need to do some more research and i think he's going to come by and when he has time and we'll sit down with patty and figure out what we can do to work the system in the best way you know hopefully when all this corona stuff goes away we won't have to worry about that we can have real meetings that that's that's that's the end game i hope yeah okay okay uh leslie i have a question um i wasn't able to go to the uh council meeting on the 6th but just this afternoon i was i was able to see some of the video from that and i saw your report and i understand that that meeting was dominated by other concerns storm water and beach umbrellas and all kinds of things but i could not tell uh if the council other than thanking you for your report gave you any kind of guidance or feedback on what what you presented and any uh updated guidance on what they'd like from us and if they didn't at that meeting i understand that's probably the case have you received anything or dave as our as our council member was there any other feedback from council members on what we did last time and and how we drive on um they they did not give a whole lot of feedback before the last meeting they had wanted you know a certain number of quick i'd say quick fixes and that's not the right word but you know things that we can do right now and that's what i was presenting to them and they said okay and got very little feedback i think dave do you agree with that yes i would agree i think that there were hotter topics but but also um i think that that basically i uh just because i'm on the council and uh and i went by and spoke with lynn and went ahead and said okay we have no choice we have to go virtual let's try this and because the county and the current status of what's going on in the world uh it'll be a while before we actually have to uh to deal with hardware and uh that type of environment in person uh that we we just cooled it on the hardware and said let's focus on on a better way of telecommunicating with the public and so that's whenever i presented this and uh um uh kyle and lynn agreed they they thought it was a good idea and uh this is the product of it uh so uh as as far as anything else we also discussed town hall meetings a little bit i recall touching on um but again uh there were several topics that were hot topics that uh people wanted to discuss and resolve and uh um i think that uh before we do a town hall meeting we need to perfect this and then once we've got this knocked out that the council will have no no problem whatsoever having a town hall meeting online it's my opinion that right now given all this stuff about you know we can't have meetings in person and stuff that the one thing that the city council could do and that we should recommend to them right now is to assemble the mailing list you know from the tax rolls from the you know the send it to resident ex street um how do you want to be contacted and so if that's something that i think we could get the city could get going right now while we're in all this uncertainty then i'm sorry linda do you say that you actually have that mailing list yeah we we get we get that from the property appraiser i'm i mean getting it is is the current one you know the one that's active today is is very simple to to get it's not anything that's a hard thing and basically it's all the property owners uh and i guess we could get the voter list and compare it you know to say okay johnny may own a property here but he's not a voter so it could be a renter in that house but uh getting those lists is is really inconsequential pretty simple yeah right i mean i think that's something for whatever there was something on this meeting at this last meeting about um one of the assessments and i got a postcard that saying to resident at 2300 bel air beach b1 you know so i think we could we could start combining and coming out with those lists i think that's something that we should recommend that during this stuff when there's not a whole a whole lot of other stuff we can do that that's something that we could start going and send something out to people saying okay do you want to do emails it's public record do you want a letter you know your address is public record do you want a phone you know how do you want to be see who wants to get information and how they want to get it and i think that that can be obtained relatively easy for the people that have posted or or given out that information in one way or another um whenever i whenever i ran basically i didn't get my email list from one particular place i contacted the board of elections i contact or i reached out to the city i looked up property records things like that and it's just a matter of sitting down and scrubbing that list and then seeing you know kicking out the junk and uh and then once you've got a starting list it's okay to ask if they want to receive them you just can't start blasting them though without their permission and uh and keep in mind you always have to leave a way for them to get out of that list if they want to exactly yeah and i think um when we talked a couple weeks ago i said this i i think that's absolutely right and people have a right to opt out of those things but then that that's our big limitation on relying on on email to communicate with the residents of the city is that you're going to get a very small number who are going to opt into that because of all those those concerns that dave just mentioned and so going forward i still think we need to find a way for the city to proactively push information out to people and not rely on just the ones who are opting in to receive an email and and i think there are a few different ways to get at them well there's obviously put it on the website but then you know some people check out the website some people don't but we you know you can't force people to do that now the u.s mail is is the most reliable as to getting to every every household in the city um i they actually mailing is it's pretty simple when you mail to the residents of every household then we only need to identify who doesn't live here who who is an owner and lives elsewhere doesn't matter who they rent to we really don't need to know who they're renting to we're just going to send to the resident and and at that point it is going to be there there will come a point that we talked about the before where some people doesn't matter how much we push it they won't be interested i don't care um you know that's at that point in time it's you know what we can do is what we can do we have the facebook site that we can push on the mail we can push on if they choose to adopt email we can push through that yeah charlie ask a quick question to dave um that list that you sent out with the uh calling and text services did anything stand out to you from that are you speaking to me yes okay so uh i did a little research on that and i think that we're looking at uh it's it's not real expensive we're looking at about 100 a month for 500 uh recipients between basically you can split it up i don't know i'm not sure about the groups but basically if it works the way that i think it does you can have up to 500 recipients and you pick who gets text and who gets a voicemail or or a phone call a robocall basically for the robocalls uh somebody like lynn or patty or kyle or somebody within the city would actually they would log into the site record their message they would verify the list that they're picking and then hit send and all of a sudden the phones would start ringing and there's your message for the people that prefer text you would have a separate group and you would log in and the same deal you would uh you would you know send the message and it would come as a text to the people that preferred that and those services i believe are unlimited it's just the number of people that are on your list yeah it's probably this is your final call i've gotten many final calls for whatever they're doing have you not renewed your your um automobile warranty i put it in your name dude yeah and this is our final call what do you get tomorrow or the next day but okay well i need to know where the mute button is in case my dog starts to bark at someone walking down the street show us pictures of the dog so as far as robo calls are concerned back to robo calls i mean that's to me that's the the bane of most people's existence is to get a robocall you know most of it i i i get through maybe the half of the first word and i hang up yeah you know yeah so i mean it could be an emergency call and i would hang up because i wouldn't even wait for it to get to that point so so tony let me ask you this if the first words were this is the city of bel air beach this is and i'd hang up that's that's me though i mean i i get whatever 30 of them a day between one phone or the or the other i see where we stand yeah i mean [Laughter] i i just don't think that you're gonna have many people that will be in favor of having another robocall coming to their phone i was more curious about the texting capabilities i didn't even stand out for that because that does seem to be a favorite um avenue of information for a lot of people to just quick text on their phone they can read it you know without disturbing anything did any of them stand out as being a good text option they were basically there's about i just in a quick i spent about an hour looking at services and there were about four or five that stood out and they were all pretty much identical they're competitively priced they offer the same thing uh i i stopped one step sort of uh of going through their reviews uh because i'm always skeptical of reviews because every time i look you know read reviews i think the people that like the services actually are the service that wrote them so uh it's always uh you get on board and then you can cancel at any time and uh you know i figure uh as far as what the end user sees probably not a whole lot of difference um but you know i i'm certainly open to trying one of them because i've said all all along we need to take advantage of text and voice and email and then whenever things are really really really important especially whenever it comes down to legal issues uh snail mail where you have a hard copy that's mailed out to you well i i can tell you that pinellas county you know has alert pinellas but we can only use that for emergencies so the but the thing still is people would have to opt into that we had a similar service where i worked previously was called code red but that system you could send other things other than emergencies like uh you know you could send out information on a specific topic or something but the problem still is how do you obtain that uh phone number that email that text you know their cell phone number if they want to text they still have to opt into it and short of just putting something on the website i think you would have to mail something to the residents and say ask the question how do you want to receive communication or do you not want to receive anything i think honestly back to the website and facebook you know yeah point people in the right direction and the web the website would be the ultimate collector of that data uh if people are really interested uh they they are going to go there if they'll take the time to go to next door [Music] [Laughter] they'll certainly sign up to see what we're doing right yeah but well that's what i'm saying rather we've got to get to them to because not everybody even looks at our website not everybody looks at uh if you have a facebook thing not everybody looks at all that stuff so we've got to figure out a way to get that information so they have the opportunity to participate and if they don't want to participate then you know that's really their choice we can't shove them information that they don't want to get you know i mean they have to opt in is the question they have to opt in or do they have to opt out yeah yeah i would say they have to opt in i think u.s mail i mean correct me if i'm wrong but we can send them a postcard every day if we wanted to um i don't think i think that's i don't know if that's an opt-in or opt-out um question email text phone call without a doubt uh that's something they would have to opt in which you know brings us to the choices if we were to send out a postcard with choices you know what are your options email text us mail phone call is there another another option i agree i think we need to send something out to them you know by basic postcards saying hey here are your options and it just goes to basic resident at one two three four third street you know maybe they can check a box fill it out drop it off at the um at city hall or call send email send the email or something a response by email whatever yeah good point i'll set up a form on the website where people can just go on and fill it in here yeah i'm actually in largo and you guys are getting to get a pretty good storm in about half an hour that's why i keep muting myself it's pretty loud i'm listening to it out here and you're hearing a little thunder yeah that's i keep muting it's it's a good one we need the rain yeah thank goodness not a bad thing okay so is it everybody's sort of considerations the first thing we need to do is to say establish the mailing list figure you know figure out how people want to be contacted um by mail by email by text by whatever yes yes well the only thing i differ a little bit on it i think we need to do that but i i think the first thing we need to do is is to go down the list of what the council asked us to do and figure out what needs to be communicated and how often and then that can drive different methods of communicating that okay so we had a we had a list early on and uh basically uh i believe tony gatliff had created a list uh i think robin you created a list and someone else did uh she's not here tonight ethelene did yeah thought we did i thought between kathleen and rob's list i thought those were were pretty we're pretty good i think that was what we'd come to i think we all agreed that they were pretty thorough and so we moved on to how are we going to deliver it because uh at the end of the day there's city business going on um there's things that uh the council is voting on uh there's there's uh meetings that are happening there are [Music] things that happen within the city such as construction or major plumbing issues things like that uh where are you know where are we today with um with the umbrella issue you know anything that that affects the general public or a specific neighborhood those are those are all things that people i'm sure would want to hear about um yeah also upcoming events um i mean we we pretty much covered all this and we can just compile the list and say here's the list that we agreed upon and um you know if if it's okay with everybody maybe that's what we need to do is just take that list put them all together and let's review it right quick and uh see if everybody's on the same page or if there's anything we need to kick out or if there's anything we need to add it was i was i was gonna say pleasantly surprised but at our first meeting when several of the members of the committee came out with you know here's what we need to do when we need to do how to they're all the same we're very close so maybe we need to um you know put those together and present that at the next council meeting i'll go through the um in front of me right now that the presentations that are the emails that everybody gave and you know try to merge them and um up with this is you know this is what we think neat we need to communicate when we need to communicate and how we need to do it right and um uh rob to answer your question uh or you know to respond to your comment about we need to have this list of deliverables they're all delivered at the same time at the end of whenever we're finished we present what we've decided on this is what's best for the city yeah so even though we haven't actually compiled that list we all pretty much agree upon the list that were created and they they uh they meshed they worked out well uh so um you know if you want if you're more comfortable with us just compiling the list and saying okay that's off the list we've got that ready to go uh that's fine and it's you know what we're basically as far as when i think it's a reaction to the the what so do we have a newsletter already we do kyle is generating something every so often is that right yeah we we generate that every other month uh but that's to the email list that we have which is i'd say less than 50 percent of the things on there are residents everyone think that um every other month is enough for just general information here's what's happening in bel air beach if it's not an emergency every other month is probably good yeah i i think every other month is is great the question i mean i have is like lynn just said if you can hear me over the storm reaching howard drive it's raining here in my courtyard yeah is that um that that every other month newsletter letter is getting to a very small number of residents of the city correct and so if we want to make a newsletter that allows the city's leadership both the city manager side and the elected council to push information you can't rely on that emailed newsletter so you're gonna have to have a newsletter that we send hard copy mail you know snail mail and then again my question would be how often can the city afford to do that because it's going to cost you know i think lynn told us at least a thousand dollars every time they mail something out you know could be something a little bit more so i was thinking that a newsletter like that is probably something quarterly as opposed to every other month just because of the cost maybe a summary of the email since we're doing a a bi-monthly email we have a quarterly mail out to everyone to those people who are not on the email list the mailing list yeah well but but you don't know in a lot of cases all you know is an email you don't know if it's a resident or not a resident that's that's the only problem with the email list because a lot of people when they set up their email like you know i'll use tony as an example is does his email say t gatliff or does it say tjt or something i don't know you know so that that's the problem uh that you don't really know who those are going to and we don't have any address connected with them so maybe what we should do is rather than obviously we know what the message is we know how often we would like to uh to get to work i'm actually going to have terminal light it's so dark outside maybe we should focus our efforts at this time on how do we collect that list how do we make that list um this is a bad example but our mayor walked the streets and got what he wanted he knocked on every door and did it you know quickly and he did it i think he made about three rounds trying to visit every address in claire beach there's got to be some way that we can that we can get you know we can get this questionnaire to everyone or get these questions answered to every address in bel air beach ideas i think it's gonna take that kind of a multi-pronged approach if we try you know a mailer first i know lynn said that when they did that with the the i guess it was another project just not postcards and asked for emails for updates you got a very poor response but if you maybe you know connect the either the phone numbers or the emails with an address and if they don't respond to the initial mailer then maybe they get a door knock or you know it's something where there's a follow-up to it kind of a almost like a task force to do like you said it comes down to it walk the street this may be the last resort um kind of take a multi-stage approach to trying to get them i know last time it was suggested maybe when they pick up parking permits or you know that's one way to do it maybe when they come in for the city council well i guess that's going to be online now but um you know several different types of call outs and then at the very end potentially door knock you know you haven't responded i guess that's what the census is doing right now you know chasing down people who don't respond we may need to do that in the end it would certainly limit the number of door knocks we'd have to make you know if we go through the process first and then make a data list of okay we haven't heard from these 100 addresses um let's start knocking on doors there and how we do that who does it is you know different different matter maybe uh someone local that maybe we see got someone local maybe we do it i would have no problem uh it's always uncomfortable just blind you know blind calling on people knocking on doors uh but i i i would do it you know if we divvied it up with with the stragglers whoever was left over i would more than hap be more than happy to take my share and uh and go knock on some doors and just ask hey if we strike out we strike out but uh does anybody else have interest in that i knock on doors i'm fine with it my only concern is with the all this stuff going on now do you really want to knock on doors well thankfully i think you know they could stand you know knock on the door or a mask you know but yeah it's um some people may not answer the door they may yell through the door to go away that's that's true but if you're holding a if you're you're keeping a clipboard and a pen in your hand and you're writing down the information and you're wearing a mask and keeping your distance uh i think that that would also show uh the citizens of bel air beach that we're actually making the effort uh to try to fix the communication issue right and at that point if they still tell you to hit the road then have a nice day and that's whenever we come back okay we come back with eggs [Laughter] eggs okay well i think yeah we're all sort of agreed that our first thing is to getting getting this list the email the real mail the snail mail the whatever mail list of people together that's got to be the first priority no matter how we do it through several steps and we need it going to need a database heard from these people didn't hear from them these guys are cool tried them the second time didn't hear from them try them a third time forget them lin what what is it what is the cost for postcards do you know that off the top of your head no it's uh the postage rate's a little bit lower but you know however as an example the thing we sent out for the uh stormwater right that that cost us uh i think it was about seven or eight hundred dollars but we developed that card ourself you know so uh it wasn't developed by you know a printer or something but i think what you're where you're going is kind of what we did with bellevue estates island we send out a postcard and figure out some way to put a link on the website that they could email if they want to participate to like actually that's what we did for bei we we asked them to return uh their email if they wanted to get information and out of the 115 residents i think it was 12 we got so if we sent out some kind of postcard design something with do you want to be contacted by blah blah blah and maybe show them a link that they could go into the website or send an email to the info at bellar beach city of bellaire beach then we could compile that information and you know and some people may drop the postcard back off but what we'd need to verify who did that was they'd have to put their address in and their email or their phone number or whatever because without that we'd have no way of knowing if they sent it back anyway right which creating a form on the website's easy uh we we've actually we're in the process of uh you know asked the question to the city manager or something which we thought about some time ago no one's asked me a question recently but that's beside the point well hey it's part of the deal but you know we could do that we could ask them to send something to the info mailbox which is just a general mailbox and uh but we'd still need their address because you know and the suggestion but that would have to be next year about collecting them through the uh parking permits which this year we're right at about 800 right now so that's probably somewhere between five and 600 residents well there's going to be an initial cost to doing this that's we're not going to be able to get out of that so so if the committee wants to come up with some kind of concept for a postcard then we can get it designed all i need really is a sketch of what you want to ask and how you want to go about it would it make any sense to uh perhaps um divide and conquer have a few of us work on what needs to be delivered and the other group work on how to deliver it that make any sense leslie that's that's fine um you know i see i see no problem with that other than we are you know we've been designed designated as a committee as a unit obviously some people are more attuned to one aspect than another um i think the first thing is what do we need to communicate and then how to communicate and then what do we need to communicate you know which stuff is you know comes out in a monthly report a bi-monthly report a you know emergency report yeah i'm just thinking we might make progress and then let's say the three that are working on what needs to be delivered um present that to the rest of us and vice versa you know um i mean so we would still make decisions as a group yeah but may be able to make um faster progress in a couple of smaller groups i don't know this is my first time working with something like this so you know let me know allow that for us to meet out i'm sorry i didn't hear you i apologize i said my implication of the sunshine laws we're not allowed to meet like that outside this committee no i'm not talking about meeting necessarily outside um well you know you're right actually we don't know how else we would do it if we're not all mistaken if three people were gonna meet they would have to like publish an agenda notice it and all that stuff gotcha okay unfortunately the only way you can do that is to take the list pick your favorites and then compile the list in public yeah you can you can't you can't share your thoughts into independently yeah well i think what was done at our first meeting where several of the members put out you know a list of who what when where why or whatever anybody can do that and maybe we should do that for the next meeting come up with you know what needs to be focused on maybe what needs to be communicated sure so i don't have that list in front of me at the moment i can pull it up in my email does anyone have that list now right in front of them the original from the charlotte has it exactly i haven't why don't we just real quickly run through that list and knock it out i mean leslie [Music] dave i need to interrupt you for a minute leslie yeah um i think uh patty had told you i need to um start leaving for the airport hopefully you're going someplace good well i'm picking up my wife that's good twice is good if do i need to leave um proxy with anyone before i go in case we vote on something or no no we're good thank you okay alrighty thank you safe yeah i'm gonna leave it so i'm leaving a little early it's gonna take a little longer to get there and the plane's coming in early thank you hopefully it's an uneventful flight yeah okay i'm looking through my pile of stuff and i cannot find the ones that people put out for the original meeting where they this is a heck of a storm yeah i i have it and charlotte has it i think one of us can read it if that's what we want that would be awesome okay okay so one two three four that's enough for a quorum right we're good five yeah [Music] and i apologize i didn't write down who sent them which email so with one list where it listed by type of communication you know social media website page phone calls mail and then there was um the chart that had category types of information frequency which one would like to go you're looking at the right ones uh it was the the uh the first three emails that were sent uh the night of the first meeting very first meeting our last meeting i think it was the first meeting june 24th yeah i just found one okay so um what needs to be communicated there was a chart of safety issues types of information storm and natural disaster warnings advisory man-made disasters accidents warning advisories law and order audience batteries at frequency immediate you go into any discussion or just maybe read a little slower so i'll just go over the first category was the safety issues basically you know any sort of disasters uh and law and order pipe advisories and the second category was status of infrastructure sewage and water updates rain runoff updates advisories seawall and bridge status streets and road traffic updates advisories facilities and park updates advisories that frequency was listed as routine then there was a category of budget issues expenditure updates shortfalls surpluses revenues incoming revenues needed liabilities that frequency is labeled routine tax issues deficits surpluses changes in rates and fees labeled as routine ordinance issues enforcement changes procedures for addressing enforcement changes exemptions routine elections and ballot issues schedules and deadlines offices up for decision recommended ballot measures periodic long-term plans strategic plan infrastructure maintenance and upgrade plans labeled as periodic did you cover upcoming elections yes election ballot issues okay and what about agenda agenda items on upcoming meetings i actually don't see that on here that probably should be a category unto itself wouldn't it yeah i would think what what's you know what's the council doing next you know upcoming agenda items uh also uh are there any ad hoc committees such as ours and what are they discussing and um and then are there any um board of adjustment meetings coming up uh those things are important uh planning and zoning basically all of the boards uh just like we published the agenda on on the website uh we should have those items go out to notify people because they may not necessarily log into the website to see it and don't know what's happening uh i i honestly cannot tell you how many times that i've had people say i didn't know you were discussing this or i didn't know that that you were going to discuss this last night otherwise i would have been from there i agree yeah i think that makes a lot of sense dave and if we're looking at the um the chart that puts those issues that charlotte read in in a priority order a second priority as routine information that gets pushed out as those meetings and things are going to take place on a regular basis infrastructure on down down a priority in the chart correct and that will also quiet the uh the people that say well i didn't know or there were you know you guys didn't you guys didn't get the message out that this was happening and uh and that's that's very important to me because uh um honestly i think people aren't they don't know they have they don't know and uh our even though our website has the uh the information there they have to dig for it so if you give them a summary rather than giving them making them go to the website and dig dig dig to get the information uh it's just there only only note i did i didn't read off the priorities um the only kind of disagreement i have with that now absolutely safety issues is number one but i think the priority is kind of determine just go ahead you're telling me to go ahead or patty to go ahead no you can go ahead okay all right where were we um we were looking to put together you know what needs to be communicated and i think um like charlotte was going through this oh you know the the stuff from our original the original night and we need to sort of refine that and what we need to what needs to be communicated how when it needs to be communicated once we figure out how we communicate with each individual resident taxpayer property owner or whatever within the city i think that's those are the are two focused things right now does everybody agree with that yes yeah okay so i'll show you the name is showing dave gaddis on my screen but i'm not seeing him i i'm anyone to see me stuffing my mouth all right yeah that's right what's for dinner what time should we be there popcorn and nuts if that's what you're interested in just kidding okay well um what else can we talk about tonight is there anything else we've got enough stuff to work on okay so let me let me get back to where we were before uh land dropped off and i i don't know lightning hit the system or whatever um basically uh what i was saying was uh and uh i don't see charlotte she's not here anymore i think we lost it yeah she's trying to reconnect but she hasn't come back on he was on for a second and then there she is there you are okay now can all right now our audio is connected all right you need to mute charlo are on mute charlotte sorry i lost internet yep no worries so what we were talking about before we all dropped out was uh charlotte you are going to compile the list and then i was going to get with lynn and compile the you were going to do the what list and i was going to do the mailing list or list of addresses email addresses whatever so start with the entire address book for bel air beach all of the homes and in condos and then scrub the that list and basically anything that bel air beach currently has and put together the giant list of this is all we have right now and then uh and then present it to you guys and uh see where we need to fill holes is it um i have this chart you know that i made for that last meeting and i i sent it through batting all of you but i know that was in a pdf form can i send it in microsoft word format through patty to charlotte so you don't have to recreate everything it's it's all there is that an acceptable thing i'll just cut and paste it and do it in excel so i can change it around yeah but either way so you don't have to recreate it it's there yeah if it comes through patty that's cool okay so we can she can send it to just one person on the committee doesn't have to send it she should send it to the whole community committee all right so i'll do that i'll okay i'll uh clean this thing up and then i'll i'll send it to patty to send it to you so you you don't have to start from scratch paddy will convert it to pdf for us okay [Music] it stopped raining it started back here like i said i'm wondering i'm gonna get it again god knows we need it but anyway well you know hold on one second we could all throw rocks at each other how are we having different weather i've in largo oh okay that makes sense okay well the answer to that dave is flora it can be raining under one side of your house and not on the other exactly uh yes i call the golf course many times is it open why wouldn't it be it's pouring no it's not anyway okay well i think this has been some good discussion tonight um we'll work on stuff for our next meeting uh which would be i'm looking at my calendar here lastly yes while you're doing that um a marv beam is also in the meeting but he's muted do you want to see if he has any comments or questions yes mark well i have to meet him i don't know if he does or not but okay all right there yeah it's not on muting so oh there it is i know the uh the thing that i'm concerned about um just listening in is to differentiate or who does this let's put it that way what's important and needs to go out immediately and again uh is it hurricanes is it um you know a gulf boulevard jammed up something in that nature and that's something we have to worry about the city doesn't want to get uh cited at all for not putting the information out right away or in the wrong format um you know we're talking about mailing everything well we can't do that if it's a hurricane warning or it can't do that if it's a flooded street or a power line down um so i guess we're gonna have to be uh yeah i think that you're right um but you know the list of things that have to go out immediately thankfully it's going to be smaller than the list of all the other stuff and i think that as we capture this list and we list off to decide how clearly the immediates would not be waiting for a mailing or an email or something like that and so it would be my recommendation that you know those are things that go whether we use alert pinellas or you use something some other alert system that sends out emergency notifications and can get posted to the website maybe an auto call system is another option that auto dials to people and then it would be my recommendation of course is that it's the city manager who controls that and of course all of you elected officials you know can call him anytime and say hey i think this is something that needs to go out right we have we have an issue though what about weekends and holidays you know that's that's another thing that has to be taken into consideration what do you do if you have a something go on on a sunday morning you know who's there to collect the data and who's there to put it out i don't think that's the city's responsibility to do that i mean there's the pinellas county sheriff's office there's an activity near me thing on there um you know there's the alert pinellas the city is not responsible for telling people hey you know there's a lot of traffic on gulf boulevard i don't i don't see that as the city's responsibility we're doing things that you know affect the city that the city has control over you know we're looking to put the good information out i just don't want to mix it up with say on a sunday something goes on and it comes through next door bel air and uh all of a sudden the city is uh you know complained about because it went on next door in bel air and it didn't go through the city you know these are the kind of things that are happening with the social media stuff today that makes us look bad constantly well that'd be a case of uh you know with the traffic i agree that's not something that we should be putting out and if anybody puts stuff on if you're worried about stuff going on you know alternative sites well look is it a real city position or is it just somebody you know venting off i mean your real city positions should not be posted through uh you know an ulterior uh social online um and then again you shouldn't be worried about that i mean that's like gossip you know just leave it alone just just go on if you need to address it you post it in an official city proceeding otherwise just like any other gossip leave it alone i i agree with you but you know with all the controversy going on i'm just just brought that up just to think about it and uh whether it's important or not i don't know but if this stuff goes out you know let's say about the beach umbrellas that stuff went on and there's so much bad information and battle publicity going on and if it happens to be on a sunday morning uh you know how can we correct it well we can't we'll just have to wait i guess and you shouldn't i mean again this stuff like rumors fly at the speed of light just leave it alone on monday morning you make an official announcement if people you know got complaints look that's also part of the feedback loop too that we should be addressing people have concerns look feed it back don't go through the next door don't you know play with the rumor game come back to the official channel your life's not going to be you know corrected on a sunday night i mean that's what we're hearing absolutely right new york city i agree with you and and that's that goes back to what uh i was saying early on is that uh even though we currently don't have a facebook presence and a next door presence and things like that we do need those as official the official uh facebook page for bel air beach even though we only put what's important what the it's not a rumor mill station it's not a open debate uh location it's just a place where we we post official messages from the city of bel air beach nothing more nothing less and uh and so you know the rumor mill we cannot we can't stop that from happening that runs 24 7 and it's completely out of control however um because now we do have a presence at these locations you know i'm not saying it's been a lot of time but just basically whenever we update the website we go right to facebook and give the same message you know whatever it is upcoming meetings um you know again back to our main breaks upcoming just looking into the umbrella issue we'll keep you posted come back to the official facebook page for bel air beach david i have to i disagree with you about the facebook page we have a website that's it i don't think we need to waste our time and energy and expense and effort playing on all of these social media sites yeah i disagree with you and the reason why i do is because there are people that rely on facebook for their news yes and no okay it is another media outlet and it's something that we can control our message with we don't we again we can control comments we can we can prevent them from happening all the way around but it's another way to communicate with our city so uh they ruled briefly is because of the type of medium you're using uh websites are frankly you really got to navigate those with a large view desktop computer i don't know if anybody's going to disagree with me with that facebook is tailored for actually the phone which is frankly everybody carries now back in the old days nobody had them but now that's where you're gonna access it and i agree with dave it's gotta be on facebook because of the the forum factor that it's in your hands and you really can't easily jump up to second of all to update a web page a web browser i mean that's our web page that's a pain in the ass frankly uh and i'm talking as a software engineer somebody that's done that you know since the early beginnings of the net it's difficult versus a facebook post is is frankly it's about 10 seconds and you're updated so that's those are the reasons i'd agree with dave yeah i agree with the with that as well if you you you have to use the social media platforms that your residents are using and very very few are using the website and lots of them are using facebook and nextdoor and whatever else there is and so i think you you surrender those about it i'm just gonna say if you surrender that environment then you're automatically at a disadvantage and you're also succumbing to uh to the rumor mail because uh basically uh if you have a facebook account you identify as living in this area um and because that's one of the first questions they ask that's how you keep up with your friends that's how they know that you are in bel air beach or at least are associated with people in bel air beach because of that and because their algorithm we don't really have to try very hard the match out most people do use facebook or at least look at it i'm not a big poster on facebook but you know once a day i just log in i scan through the first 25 posts just see if there's anything i'm interested in and i'm out well if belair beach is where i live and the official page of bellaire beach which all of my friends follow uh you know they they follow that well then i'm going to see those i'm going to see those posts whether i want to see them or not they're going to show up in the fee because i live here and uh and you know unfortunately as as evil as social media is there are advantages to take to using it and uh this is a [Music] okay everybody is i think i think our internet's not doing so well tonight yeah it says network bandwidth is low but anyway okay so maybe something we discussed next week is city website or next meeting a city website versus facebook you know what the pros and cons and how we would deal with it how we would control what went on the city's facebook page um and so on i think that's something for some more for another discussion okay okay speaking of next meeting i'm looking at the calendar this is july 16th we could how do you feel about august 13th that's four one two three four weeks from now is there is thursday night good for most people that's fine for me yeah it works for me too um what is our deadline on this uh for deliverables your committee setup is 120 days and so that's you know it may may be more beneficial to meet sooner than a month away i guess that's that's kind of what i was i was uh you want to do july 30th that would be two weeks from now is thursday night better for people than wednesdays it doesn't matter to me thursday's day it works for me thursday is good that's fine july 30th okay uh let's see checking my calendar just to make sure i think nothing is going on but uh just verifying here 30th was that yes yes that's fine for me the 30th yep i'm good with that yeah and dave just a question it's my understanding that if we get a facebook or twitter or whatever it is that whatever we post to the website we can figure out a way to make it automatically transfer to those or vice versa yes and you can definitely do that um you're going to have to get with your iot guy or whoever it is that's managing the page because there are there are things that have to be set up for it to automatically replicate to facebook but yes it is 100 possible with wordpress okay okay well that may be something i need to go talk to our it guy and see the best way to do that so at least we're working on that going forward so you know it's something that once whatever we establish at least we're ahead of the game okay and i will dig up a document on how to do that uh in fact i just pulled it right up uh uh and i will send that over to you that you can pass on to your wordpress okay okay well anything else that we need to talk about tonight i think we got some stuff to go forward with for two weeks from now and lynn i will be uh contacting you just for whatever you currently have so that i can i have something to look at and start with okay as far as as far as our email list and telephone numbers things like that yeah okay it's about 7 30 um is anyone want to stay on here any longer negative have a good one stay healthy"
