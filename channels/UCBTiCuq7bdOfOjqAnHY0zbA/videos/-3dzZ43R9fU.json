    "transcript": "good evening everyone it is now 6 43 p.m on monday august 22nd 2022 and this is the city council work session and we have a few items we'll be discussing shortly but uh for now let's do the pledge of allegiance to the flag in the united states of america and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all patty would you please call council member frank banker president council member leslie otero here council member lloyd roberts here council member jody shirley here council member mike sable here vice mayor glenn gunn your mayor dave gaddis your interim city manager kyle wiefler and city attorney randy mora president thank you all right the first item on the agenda is to discuss the contract for code enforcement services with pinellas county sheriff for fiscal year 2022 um what's missing is i'm assuming that it was interim city manager wrigler yes that's right you've got the floor okay so just an overview um this came up in the uh june uh council meeting and we decided that there was a table to discuss further we've been doing code enforcement with the knotts county sheriff's office since 2020 last year we had code enforcement budgeted for 20 hours a week and a rate of 49.80 this year that that rate went up 4.01 now the rate is 51.80 per hour we've discussed in previous meetings of coming back the 20 hours a week down to 15 hours a week if you take our what we budgeted uh 20 hours a week at the new rate would be 53 872 dollars for the year if we drop it back down to 15 hours a week it's uh 40 404 there's a difference of 13 468 dollars keep in mind that in the non-departmental budget we have a part-time administrative assistant added to the budget that is a 20-hour part-time position at 18 an hour that is going to cost the city once hired 18 720 so [Music] it'll kind of offset by cutting back the hours on the code enforcement i calculated a 12 hour a week of code enforcement will take us down to an annual cost of 32 323 which would give us the difference of a current 20 hour week of 21 548 so at that point it would be completely covering this part-time admin assistant and saving the city of roughly three thousand dollars i think that's kind of our magic number to get to is a three day maybe monday wednesday friday four hour shift for pinellas county sheriff code enforcement as a hybrid model with using laura who would be our in-house staff to do some of the code for their procedures but immediately what i'm recommending is that we go to a 15-hour week and see how that goes so that would be a monday wednesday friday five hour shift all right mike do you have any questions um actually i'm fine for the 50 and rolling back to the 15 hours because right now just looking at the last few months um it's going out and obviously talking to people and always looking at where's your license where's your permit but it really you haven't seen a big sweeping increase in violation so 15 hours is fine for me i concur with the 15 the only question i would have kyle is how does that work with the sheriff's department so five hours with us what does that person do for the balance do they typically what's their shift normally is it is it whatever we want it to be or they have other time that they spend for the county or the sheriff somewhere so they just go home after five hours and that's it they're good with that yes okay and um the way our contract works and i've talked to the captain you know it's completely us up to us we want to do five hours a week we do five hours a week okay they're at our service they'll be happy to provide any code enforcement requirement that we have so it is completely undoes to determine what the hours are going to be and how we schedule those hours perfect so whoever is in that position they're not working like 40 hours a week for the sheriff and out of that 40 hours in this example they're working 15 hours for us and then 25 hours the sheriff finds other things for that person to do the sheriff finds other duties for them yeah they don't just work 15 hours a week it's like a part time they don't solely do our city they find other hours throughout the county okay all right so that works for you yes good prank maker i'm doing 15 hours as an experiment all right leslie um i'm trying to find in here where the 20 hours or the 15 hours are not specified in the contract they are that's just a um let's say ours is that's determined by this determined by his or her supervisor after consultation with city manager okay no problem with that so i'm i don't i'm not a thing of coming back hours uh when it comes to code enforcement clearly we just had a meeting where we had three major violations and i think maybe if we had someone working on anymore you know it wasn't treated as a part-time job and no one took ownership type position we maybe wouldn't have those those code issues piling up i couldn't say that we could have made done anything different i'm just an observation i know there's a lot of code issues throughout the town i see them quite often whether they're addressed or not i don't know um i certainly don't call the code enforcement officer on everything i see so i you know if it affects me directly on my call but certainly i don't call so i don't know that um favor of reducing hours i know administratively the staff in the office needs assistance i'm not against hiring an administrative assistant but i might be against reducing the hours for the co-postal officer giving you you know the budget to do both thank you what i haven't heard here is everybody's jumping on okay let's go for 20 to 15 hours what i haven't heard is what falls off the plate what's not going to get done or what still going to get done and get emphasized okay so we haven't really gone over what those duties are but okay we're going to cross off five hours worth of duties well what are those things that are going to fall off the plate and what stays on this admin assistant was kind of like slipped in it was during the budget briefings and there was really no discussion or description of what those duties were and what that person does and what the the costs are going to be i'd like to see a little more requirements based decision making here if we go from 20 hours to 15 hours how do you know what it's gotten down how will you know if it's gotten better just the bottom line is cheaper but i mean how do you know that you're still getting those things done that are important to the residents with code enforcement to the staff and we're going to see a reduction in the problem we're having code enforcement so answer me those questions about the duties and responsibilities that are going to change and how we're going to know and monitor it if it's getting better or if it's getting worse let's give me those details and i will help make a decision i'm just not in favor to say yeah we wanted 20 hours to 15 okay uh let me see if i remember how this went this contract is not determining the number of hours this is just engaging with the pinellas county sheriffs of norman uh so although it's important to discuss who's going to do what we need to get this thing signed and get it back to them or terminate we terminate services for code enforcement and bring it all back in-house there's no i don't see any middle of the road on this it's either we engage or we don't engage if we decide to use internal personnel as a supplement to code enforcement services provided by the sheriff's department so be it but i don't think it's relevant to this contract i i agree through the contract and frankly i would recommend that we approve it with the exception being page 46 that we change a city manager name to the acting city manager kyle what this contract does give us the opportunity is it provides a max a ceiling cab of not to exceed 54 000 and it's up to the city manager as designated by the city council how many hours and what to study so i would recommend that we approve this contract thank you boyd roberts agreed frank i agree on that on mr dunn's question aren't most violations or a question of violations given to the city manager yourself and then dispatch to the code enforcement person so what i'm saying is so you have a pretty good idea if we can reduce the hours that's that's the way lynn always told me how about i have a good understanding of the workflow a lot of the a lot of the complaints do come through with me and then i give them to the code enforcement officer but most students that come directly through him i'm aware of because he tosses checks in on a daily basis so i know he's working on sorry leslie like someone said this agreement doesn't say anything about the number of hours whether it's 15 hours or 20 years his numbers are determined by the supervisor and the city managers i think that gives us the leeway that we need to have effective on code enforcement judy i would agree with that just i know and we've talked about this before is where we you know what's the plan moving forward because we are to a session moving forward to set some uh standards you know how several times i think i've shared with patton some things that had been supplied to me years ago that i'm not sure if we put that together for sure but it seemed like a pretty good basis of here's the flow of how it works and here's whose responsibilities but then we can maybe start with something like that and start putting forward expectations and how are we doing like you know can we go back to the residents and say we're making a dent in the code enforcement issues um you know i don't know i don't know if we are or not i mean i guess it just depends on what resident you talk to and how they're affected by code violations i personally don't think we do a great job following up on stuff glenn all right i i will admit that um that there are many people throughout the community that are unhappy with the services provided by the sheriff's department but for the most part it's people that were either caught with their pants down or were um getting a lightning approach um there's someone here in the audience who actually has spoken to me about it i think that there may be some uh conversations that need to be have had about how to address the residents whenever there's a problem and what you can and can't do i firmly believe that deputy clef gets to do it he's going by the book and he's doing everything right unfortunately we're not i don't think we're used to writing and so it's it's a little bit of an abrasive experience to the little town of bellaire beach so maybe that's something that we can work on in the future just to make this a little less abrasive than what it has been for certain people that's why i added item number four about what can you do what what can't you do and how do we address this and educate the residents so they don't have this terrible experience whenever they decide to take all their windows and at like nothing's going on other than that i agree we need to definitely do a better job of monitoring our progress however i kind of feel that on all of these construction projects that are that are illegal unlicensed unpermitted they're going to gradually go down but if we ever terminated services with deputy klafka they would go right back up because now no one's watching so i i've been watching the i've been watching the citations and the investigations and the most part most of them were warranted again i think that there's a certain way that you handle people in bel air beach whenever you want to approach them that's probably something that we could do a little better job but i say we move forward and get this contract signed i didn't move on okay agree any other discussion on this topic how are we moving forward with code enforcement can we because we're on a work session we have i mean i don't mean to be and i kind of disagree with you i don't think the about the residents but that's just my opinion but i mean you know can we put this on a timeline though you know what are what are our expectations and let's let's not kick it down the road a bit because i think everything we've talked about this like since all of us started with seats that we need to have some measurable um plan are we doing better or are we not you know and so and let's you know let's talk about that who can head that up kyle and you know all the data is out there we've all received reports every month all we have to do is compile the data and show trends it should really shouldn't be that hard but i still firmly believe that with with deputy clapton we're going to see the a lot of the calls going down and then the ones that are not hot hotbed items he seems to be attracted to the construction projects and doing things without permits and then the rest of it i think is directed based would you agree with that i would agree okay and so if we're steering the directive then how do you know if you're actually doing better or not the directive would have to be the same at all times to even be able to monitor a trend i think you would have to i don't know this week we go for hedges next week you go for grass you know i'm just not really sure what the best way to monitor this other than look back on our history and once we have that maybe we can sit down and try to say these things are very important to us and these are the ones that we really want to focus on and give that information back to deputy clapton and you kyle you uh had it in your plans that you were going to use your staff to do some of the code enforcement uh and i don't know if it was it wouldn't be like what the empty classes do it would be more soft targets is that right that's correct i think more just general monitoring going up and down the streets looking at the lots picking out the obvious when it comes to landscape grass um and you know parking issues that that kind of thing i think a piece of time can be set aside for the staff in-house to cover that um that v cloud does focus on construction he seems to catch a lot of things that aren't going for people who aren't licensed who aren't permitted so i think that is vital and he has the presence of kind of coming up on a lot of property and getting answers without people can run around too much it's the bottom of it so he definitely is making an impact on license people being licensed and proper permitting so i think there needs to be a balance again i've got to kind of find out all the areas that we need to focus on what's most important and then i got to divide up how we're going to allocate people's time to that in an even week and come up with more of a plan on a weekly basis like the directive and then find a way to measure it approaches so is it fair to say that's something you'll work on and you can come back to us for a plan that's what i'm looking for i don't i don't think we're gonna solve the problem right now vice versa to joby's point here code reinforcement is a process from an organizational standpoint code enforcement is a process that runs through every priority in the strategic thing it's a process code enforcement it runs through safety and health of our residents it runs through the best taxpayer return for our tax dollar it runs through community and aesthetics and communications it runs everything so it's an important process for this city and i'm not sure or to jody's point it needs its due regard here it needs its owner somebody needs to own that somebody needs to take it by the horns and say okay this is this is the code enforcement process the policy this is how we're going to stamp it this is how we're funded this is what the responsibilities are this is how we're going to measure it and tell us whether we're getting better if it works it's it's too important to just say okay we've got codes we've got a guy who goes out and writes citations we've got somebody driving around it's more important that it needs structure and we don't have that structure and we really need to set the direction for this thing it's that important it's really that important every city knows that code enforcement is an important process for a city and we need to get a little more structure than just saying hey we got codes we've got a guy with a bed and i agree with you we've been talking about this for five or six years now and really the method of doing it has not changed um people complain it's landscape calls and then suddenly it becomes a directive wants to run these calls for a while but there's not been a systematic approach where it sort of is on autopilot which i think would probably be an important matter because we do see these laws that are completely trashed why are they being ignored i can tell you why because their neighbor is not complaining it's it's the it's the squeaky wheel situation it's generally how we've handled code enforcement kyle please speak up if i'm incorrect completely correct it's definitely a reactive process i think to add to that matter if i may with the recent changes in the statute in the last two years we've gone from a system where complaints can be made anonymously to a system or they cannot which in some communities we've seen i wouldn't necessarily call it a full-on chilling effect but a hesitancy as a good neighbor to not be the person hey i know you were traveling and i didn't want to call but honestly man can you handle it and yes that gets back to people having a discourse but um for the for the passerby who drives down the street every now and again seeing that and saying nobody's doing it um well it is often complaint based and those if you have a discomfort about making the complaint and it doesn't get handled i would say the other part of that is i know you and i spoke about this and myself and the manager and your manager have spoken about this as well but also your due process process for code enforcement you and i can see something that we know to be or believe to be a violation but that person is going to get a hearing that hearing might be three weeks out and at that hearing they're going to determine whether or not they work in violation and then give additional time to come into compliance and so somebody keeps driving by week after week and saying i told the city about if they didn't do anything well we've said hearing and we'll have another hearing after that maybe if they don't comply um and then the last thing i think that's an important consideration for our policymakers when you talk about code enforcement is understanding that as it is a priority towards your strategic plans and initiatives it's also not a profit venture um it and many times can be done at a loss depending on how it's done um because you're not you're not you're not making money on it you're doing it to get compliance and in some cases in most cases you should be at a loss you go out there and you say hey turn down the music all right turn on the music there's nobody getting a violation for that you might be upset about it because it woke you up um but you got compliance and the same is true of landscaping and other issues so those are some of the challenges you see with as the as the for lack of a better term in the casual passerby in the community it may seem like nothing's being done when hey it's accruing a fine on a daily basis that's we don't have the right to enter into private property and just make it look like the hoa we desire we have the ability to impose that fine maybe foreclose on it if we're at that stage but there are limits even to the city's ability to to reach the aesthetic goals or just general signals thank you clean good the cost benefits to the city are a subtle thing people move to bellaire beach because they like the way the neighborhoods look they look they like the feel of the community and the foundation and baseline for that are a system of codes and code enforcement right when when when you can't get along with your neighbor or whatever the common denominator is course that's the basis for how we expect to conduct our relations with our residents and our neighbors so when we enforce these codes i mean that's kind of the expectation of people who live here because they moved here because they like the way the place looks the way it feels and that's the subtle thing that drives up property so yeah there's it's not a revenue stream or any meaning but in a subtle way that's what increases the property values of biller beach and guess what happens today and the more yes so it's a very solid thing but it's it is a there's life safety issues on my street i pay to have pest control and ski repellent spray every couple of weeks the guy next to me has a green pool that when i finally called code enforces he said i don't care if he knows i called i'm tired of paying to kill his mosquitoes he's growing in his pool and by the way there's appliances and things like that um they drain the pool well that grain in the pool works until it rains and the water comes right back so i don't know what kind of follow-up's done on something like that but i can just tell you i see drafts running i've in three occasions over the last week seeing the rats running across the road i'm walking the dog at night and all of that stems from that house not being maintained i mean it's all goes hand in hand my point is they're really looking at life safety issues and so there's a whole lot of stuff that goes into this and i don't know how you overcome that example i just gave but you could until a few years ago we used to have a code enforcement officer on staff we didn't use the sheriff's department we had our own code enforcement officer and then there were some personnel issues that went out so we got rid of that person and that's when we got in contract with the sheriff do we want to go back to having someone on the staff that is a full-time code enforcement officer something to think about right i'm all in favor of keeping the uh sheriff as a co-enforcement officer i think uh satisfy councilman shirley uh concerns about where we lose him with the five hours maybe kyle you can delegate the easy stuff like you said to our in-house people and have him do more patrolling than you know answering simple complaints on one i don't think he answers that anymore completes now it doesn't doesn't already house through them i've probably done about saturday last month okay so you know i try to grab him all right but i just think you should be on the street patrolling more than so is anybody other than leslie actually live through here you know working on the council that saw both the in-house versus austin so what would what were the just the gut feelings uh back back then when it was within the city staff did you guys feel like it was better than than it is with the sheriff not any particulars but just gut feeling did it seem like you know i don't know what the criteria you would use to evaluate that question i think one of the things that happened with sheriff comes is they look more serious than yeah they're better they've got a uniform and they can um with the results again we haven't identified the criteria how to evaluate that i think this is glenn's point i think danny said it best the previous step forwards when i go out he was a very great guy he was a very mild manner and everything like that when he went out to investigate if he thought he was being lied to me to say i'm going to stop this interview and now make it an official interview with a police officer of you would you try to catch a line it could be a two-year felony church so then all of a sudden you can say his stories will change it seems like the flow of the information though went better or could go better with the internal staff because possibly one person was working it all the way through whereas my understanding is now the sheriff of this deputy who does a great job identifies the issue comes back turns in a document to somebody else that somebody else takes it and fills out some more information and by the time the report is generated more than a couple of people have touched it i think that lends itself to some challenges where one person was in concert the whole way through the process there's less likelihood of something falling through the cracks just my opinion real quick when i was with ibm we used to do a thing called an application transfer study with our customers it would take six weeks so you can take a topic like code enforcement and work with that company for that entire period to develop all the things like vice mayor gunn was talking about so at the end of the day and you took everything from scratch nothing was assumed the way we used to do it they didn't care how they used to do it and you actually came out with a whole new process and program taking this as an example with code enforcement so that everybody that available to develop new processes and programs but it's not something that's done in an hour meeting i can tell you that you know it takes you know for this one topic if you're trying to do it in an entire weekend an eight hour saturday an eight hour sunday it would be tough but at the end of the day with everybody's effort you came out of there with a document saying this is how we're doing it and this is why we're doing it so just a thought i'm retired exactly it's an important issue but i just want to bring us back on topic i'd like to make a motion to approve the uh interim city manager to execute the contract for code enforcement services with pinellas county sheriff fiscal year 22-23 i don't think we can do that and this is just general consensus direction and we're out of organization imperial consent consent agenda item at a later meeting or otherwise but okay i appreciate i'd like to move on because uh looking at uh last uh agenda we had from monday august 15th we still have the beautification program gulf boulevards working on the vh rules for any men doing themselves in general business so we still got quite a lot on the schedule judy shirley uh is our conversation with that i'd like to nominate the intern sydney manager to get this process going are you interested in making all this projects sure give up your stuff all the time uh whenever you do have something put together please spread it out and uh and we'll respond individually all right okay thank you very much all right next up the gulf boulevard beautification project underground and funding report this also is interim city manager we've learned okay for this we got a slideshow presentation um you should all have this package from here along with just a couple things i set it out on thursday evenings so okay i should have it right now where people don't can see it as well okay first we're going to start off with a map a little explanation of where we're at where we're going um currently we are 95 [Music] it's down to a handful of guy wires that are in the process to get them removed moving forward we're looking to start on the south side of the city which is phase one that comes in with the cost of utility consultants and deep energy about two million dollars phase two so that's from that's from the first street to crosswalk boulevard phase two will be north of cosby boulder um same thing it's gonna be chile consultants doing the uh conduit and followed by duke energy and we also have some of spectrum of the dew on the north part of the city that is from 12th street mark so combined if we were to consolidate phase one and phase two we're looking at about 5.3 million total um in the grand scheme of thing if we press it out it saves us about 20 to 25 k with uh utility consultants uh that which would be a mobilization fee um savings so um we compared that to the incoming money from penny for canals [Music] if you look at the little table there on the slide on the uh it shows that we're currently budget available to start fiscal year 23. we're about 2.2 million available if you look at the phase number that that gives us enough star phases on both the utility consultants and the duke energy portions and with a little left over of 200k for fiscal year 24 we have penny money available about 930 000 and saying is true for fiscal year 25. if you look at the big picture it puts us that for the total project in the hole for about 1.2 million dollars so we at this point need to find alternate funding sources unless independent five program they come up with more money for the underground project that has not been determined so in looking at this slide we've kind of said you know some options we have a million dollar hurricane fund that we maintain and one option would be to downsize the restricted uh hurricane fund to uh 400 000 uh giving us freedom six hundred thousand dollars at the same time looking into opening a line of credit um to compensate for that and then we also want to remember that we have the american rescue funds which is about 800 2 000. so that in turn give us about 1.4 million that could be used to compensate our uh our losses uh or where we need to get the funding from this timeline uh right now we're uh you know we're at the end of the fiscal year 22 work session discuss discussing our options here first piece of advice you want to get phase one started so intention is to have this on the september regular leading agenda to move forward to get phase one started to give contracts to the utility consultant and duke energy we have the money available right now it's something that we should get going there's a lot of cities up and down called boulevard that are doing underground as well and um this is the intention of the previous manager as well just to start phase one on the important timeline uh dating would be in beginning november now because if we're considering doing uh consolidating both phase one and phase two it's important to know that duke energy both phase one and phase two the binding cost estimates expire on december 8th 2022 so given enough time we need to make a decision on phase two in the november meeting and also something to look at if you look at the timeline of phase one you have utility consultants come in their timelines like four to five months for that for that phase uh after they complete that duplicates come in they inspect their work and then they start their abortion dude energy for phase one is looking at about 10 months so these are conservative times we could be shorter but still if we plan the new phase one starting this kind of budget year and then when the conservative thought of not starting phase two until we got more funding which would be the start of fiscal year 24. you see phase two it stretches this out same deal four to five months each other consultants for two coming in for the larger portion of phase two in about 12 months the idea of consolidation utility consultants brings them down to doing both faith one phase two to about five to seven months and then do come in afterwards um almost overlapping because utility consultants are done with phase one's south of possible or at that point we're you do their inspections and start the work while the drilling and salt starts phase two and then utility consultants finish this condo into phase two duke energy is now up and down about boulevard wrapping up their portions the idea of giving more time to duke energy to get not get started on work earlier is in hopes that they get multi-crews out here timeline projections are based on having more time available it might get overlapped that's why we got represented in the orange here awful savings in time that uh with the goal of trying to keep it a two-year project gets this all complete another good reason that we have decision making for phase two consolidation in november is that it gives us the time to take it back to assistant's advisory board get some advice um and also uh meeting the city banker is a some time to do a san diego check check our project on the next stage we did some calculations yes i'm sorry i did it and i'm sorry so late for this question but if you go back to the second page i guess which let's say zero phase one phase two some of the numbers i just was having trouble that's the one so if we look at y24 and we say that the projected cost is 3 million 400 000 and change and then the pennies grant 930 000 obviously that's revenue coming in and then we had an extra 261 thousand dollars left over that we brought over from 23. i'm having difficulty coming up with that 1 million and 277 874 being the delta so we have we have a cost of three million four hundred thousand and then we have revenues of nine hundred and thirty thousand and two hundred sixty one thousand coming into there right the delta is uh much bigger than that 930 000. that's the other column there take it into the contacts here yeah it's 9 30 twice so you're you're about 9 30 20. yeah your delta the way the table is laid out if you take all the orange portion um so you're taking both both years of the 9th 9 30 plus the extra subtracting from the uh 3 400 so that's where you're getting that number and if you bring it all the way over where you have the 1 million 2 52 that's that's taken into account the 25 000. right but even that one doesn't so if you look at the but you're not showing the 930 twice really in that particular column it's two scenarios right yeah so the taking away from here was just that the overall project we're we're looking at a need to find funding at 1.2 million so we have a deficit of 1.2 million for both projects correct okay but the 930 000 we're getting in 23 and 24 right but we don't show it at 23. it's once you get the pennies money for 25 that's going to basically go backwards to pay for the project you're doing a discount and it's important to know that um this money is just becoming available we still haven't budgeted it up front [Music] okay please continue so on this page uh did a calculation of where we're at with our unassigned reserves at the start of fiscal year 23 which is going to be used in october we're looking at about 2.5 2.6 rounded million dollars in reserve unsigned funds our charter requires us to have 20 of our operating expenditures that's a 563 000 now calculating based on a model that was a very conservative model what we did is we kept our ad alarm income the same we increased our expenditures throughout each year at 8.5 percent so that'd be basically keeping the same inflation rate ongoing for the next two years um and then if we come into doing that way it leaves us with the beginning of this year 2024 uh 2.2 million dollars in unrestricted and then beginning of 2025 1.5 now also it's important to know that this does not include the american rescue funding so if you took that american rescue injection it brings us back up to roughly about 2.3 um let's talk about the poles and cells and the aesthetics of gulf war are as you know you know the poles that are still left on the east side uh you have the high tension power lines that are at the top of the poles they're probably the most significant thing left over if you're driving on the road we have street lights that are on most of the poles now doing this project and undergrounding of the wires we have a total of 82 poles left from the golf ball now 67 of those actually have lights on so there's only 15 poles that will be removed during this project so aesthetically you're going to get rid of those top power lines they're going to cut them and cap them and it's going to leave us with 67 of the street lights on the east side still some issues and uh issues or non-issues general considerations i think um like the previous slide is the safety resiliency versus the aesthetics what we're trying to accomplish with this project and at what point uh you know if we're seeing a significant increase in the looks of dropping up and down boulevard as you go through bella beach currently there is no street lighting plan there needs to be one developed um so phase one just some of some over your numbers you got 25 total poles you know 20 of those have lights on them so each one about themselves by the city um phase two kind of the same thing 57 pulse total 47 have streetlights on that as far as some numbers is replacing the wood poles the concrete pole estimated at about three thousand dollars per pole at 67 poles you're looking at about 200k that would be installed but you'd still have a lease on those pools another option would be solar solar is going to be more expensive again this is something we need to look at down the road for the streetlight environment contingency estimates uh duke energy they cover everything as far as putting the earth back it does not take into account um fixing landscaping irrigation of that sort just think about nothing in nature there's a 200k surplus after if we did phase one we get in budget year 2023 that could be used for other other things possibly switching on some concrete poles plus the test bed for silver lighting and then again if consolidating to look at the hurricane disaster reserve level and reprogramming american rescue funds ongoing we want to uh validate against fiscal years 2024-25 track our our capital spending um calculate our burn rate this is an ongoing process make sure that we're we're seeing the same numbers that we previously calculated and actually we're on track um based on this we may want to look into accelerating other capital projects the one thing to consider and we've talked about in previous meetings is we may be moving down the road with some of our stormwater product and not reducing the scope of those products maybe not going the full bmp that the engineer originally designed so there could be some savings there again i have this review by the prospective city manager and a ticket to assistance advisor for sanity check and uh possible ideas on the line of credit we did factors for council to consider is the strategic priorities for this project the cost if it's a reasonable cost of forgiving the best value for for our money funding again where we're going to get the additional funding needed for this project the duration uh how this project will impact things such as the traffic how long it will last luckily in bellar beach vehicle sorry we have a very large right away compared to some of the other cities along boulevard that have a lot of commercial property but not much space so we are fortunate we're but we did a previous underground on the west side of gulf war there really wasn't a major and then the return on investment is always important conclusion uh key factors that binding cost for both phase one phase two for two is uh expires on december eight so that is the this kind of our decision date that we need to plan for um if the costs uh at this point are foreseen to escalate and don't seem like they're gonna be coming down or anything they're gonna go up slightly or more depending on the situation in the future um money is already programmed for and locked in the money will become available in the next three years one major thing to consider is that either if we do phase one now and do phase two later it's still going to require supplemental funding so regardless of the way or not we're still going to need to fill that 1.2 million dollar deficit that we have but we still have a 25k if we decide to do one and two at the same time that's the safety is still on that series yes cable company is not very detachable as we've seen on south of gulf boulevard on the east side which they've already done almost done with a 12th street they uh they took a lot longer than i thought they were going to so one one thing to know is that you need the planet for a little bit more time and then you know depending on how if we move forward with phase one and go into phase two if there is a time where you need to fit the cable company in so that they [Music] um the funds sydney reserves are they've been sitting there for for some time now and as we've seen with the cost of everything going up they're depreciating as they sit there they're not being posted and just all along we have infrastructure that isn't being repaired or approved consolidate both phase one and phase two it it sets a priority for the entire project moving forward with something that would plan on completing either way the uh it aligns with the strategic plan and it aligns with the safety for the residents the best value for investment and the aesthetics so the recommendation is to consolidate phase one and phase two um approving phase one on september in the september reading and then at the very latest situation phase two in november i've uh it's not something we need to rush out we still have time for phase two but i've confirmed with the utility consultants that they will have no problem if we start them in september october time period do an addendum to the agreement adding to the video and then keep them moving forward um we need to revise the hurricane fund and seek a supplemental line of credit uh there's there's a lot of a lot of money that just sits there in the hurricane fund um where we could accomplish the very same thing with line of credit and keeping 400 thousand dollars cash on hand the american wrestling funds we can utilize that that's 802 000 dollars that again is a gift for the federal government and this is a project that is a good investment for for our community it's something that we've already committed ourselves to so it's a good use of funds for the american rescue money the streamlight master plan needs to be done and so there needs to be more planning in that process of finding out what we want what are options what our end goal is for the street lighting plan and then [Music] as always and i think we have a great start here with the capital projects in calculating kind of what our reserves are going to do in the next three years we need to continue to to look at our numbers look at our capital projects our spending and and track what our research and then i'm going to take you to the in the years that they're funded and then some projections of the streets that coincide and how they're funded in the current year giving us total numbers over here on the left the bottom left so that that takes into account um kind of a big picture of capital spending on your stockholder products or your big chunk and then followed up by the streets which hit on a given year that you moving the stonewater projects throughout the city those numbers are brought down here to show your major capital spending for those years anyone have any questions counseling okay well i'll start with obviously we're on the deadline to approve this project otherwise it will be re-quoted and most likely it will be higher did i hear you right there on the next council meeting you're gonna ask for us to approve at least phase one okay and i didn't quite understand what you were saying about the holes you're gonna cut the tops off and leave the lights off so the idea is to to think about what's gonna make the biggest difference um so i'm showing that when duke energy comes through the underground all their wires they're going to pop those poles in they're going to cap them and uh kind of giving a visual image of what you're going to be left with just moving forward on you know we're building resiliency by underground the wires and then uh we're improving the the aesthetics of the community and we're accomplishing a lot i guess the overall picture is that those crossfires that we already took care of for the worst part next horse part is going to be those those high tension wires and removing those and then where do we stand from there so yes and whatever you uh speak of ultimate funding borrowing money a lot of credit what what what would be your source bank thank you yes yeah i already have other youtube requirements okay all right jody shirley um just trying to get my head around everything right now because you threw the future sewing water projects in here and if i'm looking at this right we still have after this year 3.5 million seems like that that number never goes down it just keeps getting bigger it's that smaller and we keep working away at that every i'm just doing some round numbers in my head but it looks like after physical year 2122 we've got about remaining three and halfway correct and uh starting the total of the stormwater projects i'm just trying to get my hands around everything but we do have there is going to be a point um with the progression of the star water projects where we may get to some of them that were recommendations of the master plan and and think this isn't something we need to do right now you know how much of a benefit are we going to get from this project as we talked about earlier you know some of the engineering ideas you know further in advance so with those prior committee it just seems like when you started this um first of all you need to approach your economies of scale that 25 000 consolidation is critical i would and i'm looking at this financially i'm looking at yet doing both phases at once um reason 125k for consolidation number two the reserves we're way over our minimum reserves are required to have you know i do agree that we can remove some of that why you addressed it succinctly you said safety if you look at it like a body that's a terminal order that is our main source of power for the entire city if it's cut there or there you've lost everything you know regardless of what other streets have done for underground those are the feeders and by taking those underground we've removed any potential costs that may be incurred due to a hurricane number one costs number two down power lines we had one down on our street and it was an extreme fire hazard because it's bouncing around so the safety of the people by taking away the high voltage or the high tension lines safety obviously and ensuring the city has a good contiguous power supply so i like what you've done there i agree with lowering the expenditure and using some of that excess money like i said we're at least a million over in areas as well as using uh now that the storm water i defer to the councilman shirley you know the storm honor program as far as the potential savings they may be gleaned from there so i can't touch that and it literally was i don't know what i'm talking about the rest of it i agree with it yeah no i'm in huge support of this i can't touch on this but um but you know this i was on the advisor committee when this was posed to us in my these are exact exactly what my analysis was was let's try to move some of this along take some of those reserve funds use them to move forward with these capital improvement projects that we just keep um talking about and not getting done the other thing just as a side note is that patty forwarded us some information from forward finalists their last meeting they have a billion dollars annually over the next five years and grant money to give to people for municipalities for safety improvements so that might be a source for street lighting too so just kind of thinking down the road you know i don't know if we have anyone that participates in a forward palace meetings but we maybe should get someone on that i think also there's going to be a slew of grants very soon so that's what five million dollars to various lines is an awful lot of money and safety works both ways line and site is one thing when you bury something there's another um how many do you know how many junction boxes will be on allen golf boulevard because you can only run flying so far they have to have another junction box i'll tell you one thing i've never seen a car hit a high power line up top but they do hit jumps and boxes they can be awful dangerous when they do um but i think this money where we live we've been better served in putting in storm orders i think we're too far along now to back off on this but i know going down golf ball board i i see everybody with their head up like this look at the lines i hopefully they're looking this way i just think this is useless money this this project would not have been possible to have been for peace for finalists yeah penn for canals has factors and capital improvements is one of the factors and could have used that capital improvements for a storm um so um and specifically underground city can't use their money for anything besides underground so they can keep going but there's there's i believe there's a number of factors with that penalty canals i mean i know we're getting it for beautification for instance but we would have looked at it for other avenues i think we could have used it with the same amount yeah i mean it's got to be counting use they're going to be used on the county roadway so that's the county and jargon it would have been the county has to come and pump all these sewers out all the time here overflight leslie i'm in favor of using some of the reserve money to fund some of these projects and if there's grant money out there that's that's great i think go ahead glenn i think the best opportunity we have for a grand money is full of hard-made utilities penny's money from what you've stated definitely supports goals it's going to look pretty nice because when you top the poles and get rid of the upper high tension lines what you're left with is heightened poles that pretty much blends in with the mature vegetation so you're not really going to see them and if you keep those poles to the east side of the sidewalks you don't want to see it it keeps the boulevard pretty wide you go to solar lighting or something else where you have to move lights to the curbside then you create a safety hazard for accidents and also it's going to kind of aesthetically visually narrow the boulevard i think the strength of kyle's work with this was for the first time council is getting a pretty good peek behind the budget curtain for reserves and what the projected spend is for the capital projects in at least the next couple of years and you've got a lot of money sitting on the sidelines that's not working for us right now i think kyle's giving some good alternatives for maybe tapping into that money and if you decide to pay yourself back expeditiously or whatever it's up to the council to kind of decide what's the sleep factor if we use some of that hurricane money and we want to make something restricted funding well what's that level what's going to allow us the fact that he's looked ahead and forecast his projects and he's made some assumptions and stuff to kind of give us some conservative numbers here it gives us an opportunity to look down the road and see if we do want to accelerate some of the stormwater projects or street lighting or whatever it's the first time that i think uh kind of staff has ever looked that far ahead i think he's done some great work here definitely okay so i think the question is is do we want to see phase one only or phase one and phase two on the uh uh for both in our next council meeting that's the that's where i believe we're building so phase one only phase one and two okay as far as the borrowed side of things goes that's something we'll have to vote for later correct that's correct and i'd like to take it to the assistant's advisory committee not to get i think he did an excellent job my arguments wasn't against you it's just the project i think this was great [Music] of great job if we had this conversation as joey mentioned um eight months ago at this point this is going to be what it would take and plenty of um it's one thing we don't see much uh big years and so how much cash is really sitting in the bank account so everyone should sleep well there's plenty of uh short-term cash but it would be an easy uh line of credit the leverage that this the city has is nominal relative to its revenue so any lender that is schooled in lending will easily provide that uh there will be privacy academy i think you can lose some deposits to that lender as a result but as long as you don't bond money it doesn't cost you anything the way that reserve works is historically is you know there's a lot of expenses when a hurricane comes and then we get reimbursement fees afterwards so we'll spend the money then we'll get it back uh at the end of the day so i think uh i uh support what you guys are doing bringing this to the agenda sooner versus later we'll take a deeper dive with kyle council as well thank you very much well since we've had one citizen speak with anyone i would slide to on this topic no all right uh kyle sounds like you've got your marching orders and uh we look forward to seeing this great presentation thank you thank you man all right next up uh discussion of smoking on the beach i bring this up because it seems to be a trend that's beginning to happen on many of the beaches here in florida it wasn't too long ago that cshb 105 became law and city attorney would you like to explain exactly what this law does for us happen mr mayor um the mayor's corrected stating it wasn't too long ago this became what we were talking about is a change in the legislation um that took effect july 1st up until july first of this year when individual municipalities did not have the ability to prevent smoking in public parks and beaches you may have seen signs in places or gone to beach where they said that they did but they couldn't really enforce it what you saw in a lot of communities were thank you for not smoking more of an approach of as a courtesy please abide but nobody was getting issued a citation if they were they were often challenged and then those ordinances so what the law did is it changed what historically in florida was known as the clean indoor air act to just the clean air act and i'll read the language as it stands now what it's safe what it states is counties and municipalities may further restrict smoking within the boundaries of any public beaches and public parks that they own except that they may not further restrict the smoking of unfiltered cigars a municipality may further restrict smoking within the boundaries of public beaches and public parks that are within its jurisdiction but are owned by the county unless such restriction conflicts with the county ordinance except that they may not further restrict the smoking of unfiltered cigars yes that is how it reads yes there is a particular carve out the idea being from uh from a home rule standpoint this is a bit of a win and that we got back or understanding that we have a universal powers that are taken away from we got back as a substantial amount of power but yes if you were just trying to say full stop no form of smoking you can't do that unfiltered cigars are accepted what i think the mayor's touching on is more recently there's been a discourse within the big c another beach community zone now that we are allowed to talk about doing this what do we as an individual community here or elsewhere wish to do and that's what this workshop is is do you wish to see an ordinance regulating this activity or not and that's you know a discussion for you folks to have it's not something that you know again this being a work session we're not going to come out of here and suddenly it's prohibited any ordinance would go on first and second reading with all appropriate public input but before any work is expended one of the things we talked about in my interviewing process was i worked for the body collected and this is truly a legislative matter you have there's no there's no competent substantial evidence standard or anything you have the ability to make this policy if you so desire and you can make a policy that's less than that you can say we're okay with we know we can't touch unfiltered cigars we know while we're at it we don't care about pipes either you have the ability to define your universe if you so desire and again i'm just telling you what your abilities are i'm not lobbying for any one result i don't try to persuade advice right and uh and my purpose for bringing this up is because it does keep coming up in the big c meetings and also i think just not everyone here has participated in beach cleanups i would say the number one item that i pick up are cigarette butts the plastic caps whatever it is they don't go away after remain permanently attached somehow to the bottle rather than taking them off but anyway i just wanted to throw this out to the council and see what the consensus was what the general direction was how you felt about it i can tell you from the discourse on this and at least one other community pcso to the extent they enforce your codes that they will enforce what you whatever you put on the books that has generally been the sheriff's stance on this i'm not aware of the county taking any kind of incongruent action with your ability to at least at this point to regulate i would advise from a practical standpoint um especially in a community where you have so many condominiums with people overlooking the beach from a practical standpoint you're not likely to see people getting citations by the dozen on this issue um you know the time it takes to get to somebody once you've learned and then we get there and find out oh that's an unfiltered cigar we can't um more likely than not this will be you can't do that here put it out or you know the person who stuns before they're you know encountered or something of the sort again i'm telling you pcso will enforce but from a practical standpoint resource allocation the simple fact that you see somebody smoking doesn't necessarily mean that that person is going to have a court date immediately and that ultimately an administrative decision for you folks as to what resources do we want to allocate to this and you know what do what education period do we want to do or before we start inciting people we want people to get to know what our rules are if we change it's practically unenforceable and you look at this everybody thinks a cigar is this giant stone and when you get down to it now you're looking in about 10 foot down the beach at somebody and the big difference is what you're seeing on the beach is the filter not the cigarette but just the filter and that's why they talk about the no filter i mean you can see a cigar or a cigarette especially they're covering that filter with their hand which most people do now you know if you want that cop to kind of go in and force it then the guy opens up his hand says that's an unfiltered you know this whole thing disappears when i finish nothing's left so me i'm kind of waiting to see what the other cities do because really this is almost 100 percent unenforceable very difficult all right lloyd yeah i think the good news is just generally unless people are smoking these days um that's good i think we would be i think it may work better if we somehow put some signage out there where we were asking people on the beach to please whatever burgers we would come up with the message would be hey don't don't leave your cigarette butts on the beach if you could help us out by doing that i think that may be effective i know in the evenings when i'm walking the beach there are oftentimes things being smoked that don't fit into any of the categories we filter we've referenced so you know it's going to happen but but i think if somehow we can get people to not leave the remnants of whatever they're smoking on the beach on the sand and i know we've kind of approached the topic a bit comically but i do think it warrants noting just because paradigms have shifted on the issue in this discourse sometimes it does come up about marijuana smoke and marijuana presence and because of the medical marijuana laws in the state people have a legal ability with the card to to smoke that product and whereas in an old paradigm the simple presence of the smoke was evidence of something we need to enforce against from a law enforcement standpoint that's not always the case and so that also has changed whereas people you know you may get community feedback saying i'm not so concerned about cigarettes but what are you guys going to do about the weed on the beach um you know again that paradigm has shifted as well from a regular joystick and there's uh i thought that laws were in place that prevent people from smoking marijuana i'm not going to opine specifically on how that functions and where you know public may be especially as we start talking about beaches where it's i'm at the edge of my buddy's backyard i'm not quite on the beach um but suffice to say there are places where you can in the simple presence of that smoke you know whether it be from your car in a public location or otherwise is i don't know why i had this satire thing in my head with this big that bureaucrat popping on us apart making walls state saying you can't do this but i can do this i i don't know how about some of the stuff that's this on this practice pass through the house and the governor signs off i just had i know it was 115 walls that renewed i think in july maybe mr morgan or uh 15 new walls came out one was two residents grabbed me within last month about the 25 foot sound coming out of a car or a vehicle or chain if the radio if i can hear a radio 25 feet from the vehicle it's against the wall now that's another wall that just came out in july and they're they're complaining about these motorcycles going up and down about boulevard here from the causeway to harrison hey i clean the beach i think i've missed one beach cleanup since i've been here and i created cigarette butt cigarette butt cigarette butts at all so you can kill them let's do it let's get the bottles cast next because they get into the fish i don't necessarily believe this has anything to do with clean air but i do think it probably is a good way to to at least curb some of the uh something littering it's just terrible i think an ordinance prohibiting smoking on the beaches says more trouble than it's worth a sign that says clean up your stuff when you get off the beach you know put maybe put more garbage cans at the beach accesses yeah i think i think the goal is more instead of enforcement it's probably more just awareness awareness yeah i'm i'm just not in favor of passing any any anything in relation to this i agree when i go out and clean up the beach the only thing i pick up for parts typically maybe a poke guy here there or something but um and it's disgusting i don't know smokers where they think the cigarette butts are going but the flip side is we started with no smoking indoors so now we're saying no smoking outdoors i just i have a real problem with i don't think there should be a seat belt wall i just don't want anyone telling me what i can and can't do it's a personal preference and i don't smoke no one in my family's most doesn't affect me either way but there are people in the world and i just don't think it's right thank you glenn i'm in concurrent with everybody i think the inverter needs to address rather than writing ordinances that's fine so the purpose of this discussion was for me to take our answers back to the big city and because i i think as uh all of um sand key we're trying to sort of line up our policies and i've already had one mayor say i don't think so i would love to see the cigarette butts going away and i like the idea possibly well there's a couple of things number one we don't actually provide any place to put the cigarette butts so where else are they going to put them don't want them in the trash because it's going to cause a fire but do we have any of those we have some some some buddy bugs at the beach accesses and morgan park all of them yes okay spot home maybe i just stare at them you know what you're right okay so they're just not using them yeah a lot of times they'll stick over the trash can and it'll melt the side of the trashcan well that's something to look into i will take this back i i can do either way on this one are you getting it you should just one mayor's faulty so far well i read in the paper today that saint pete beach is seriously considerate but they're not ready to move on it just yet so this is this is the beginning of a conversation even though this seems like something a very minor topic to be discussing i would consider this at least something positive in the direct the right direction of home rule the state actually allowing us to do something and not controlling us so it doesn't necessarily mean that we need to jump on it but hey it's a start it means somebody's actually listening giving us the opportunity to regulate ourselves any other conversation about that ready to move on all right uh next is uh discuss rules of unlicensed handyman and handyman and do it yourself let's put this one on also because of numerous complaints about code enforcement and just the way things are being handled i think many people don't realize that that they can't hire a handyman to paint their house i didn't know that did anyone know that that you can't just hire an unlicensed person to paint your house this guy's painting my house so the reason why i bring this up is because i think that maybe we should we should provide some something a small maybe a three-page unfold or something that we can distribute to the residents that say here's some views and don'ts because there's been quite a few people that are in trouble had stop work um notices uh all sorts of things going on where they're hiring a handyman or they got a buddy or their next door neighbors helping them and they're getting shut down and maybe maybe it's just an educational issue more than just hiding especially if they're doing the work and they're not taping up all their windows and hiding out inside those are the ones that i would worry about but mr mayor you're making some good points that i'm not clear because if i'm helping my neighbor out in the sprinkler system or something like that or a and uh you can't get a money to help you with it you have to own the project yourself and even then it may require permit where it's not requiring a license and you may be able to you can one of the one of the nuances here is you may be able to do that but you have to have a permit to do it um you know i i at one point in my home for example in a former home in mind we wanted to put up two walls and i called a contractor and said hey what's it cost to put up two walls and he quoted me a number and i said okay well just so you know i'm a city attorney for a living so we're going to need to do this on the up and up are there any permits or anything else like oh well if you're going to go that route it's going to be a whole nother um and then i did get a properly licensed contractor and the price tripled and then they had to hardwire electrics because the city reviewed it and said you know building code says this and so i understand why people you know on occasion will not do that but what i would say to you to you folks too if you do want to to look into educational materials this is a high priority or has been over the past few years for pcso they may already have materials um crypt that we can quit from and use and just say hey here's already the pcso fire on this because i mean when i say it's been a priority for them to the point that they set up sting houses hey we've got a vacant property um for you know and just solicit hey we're looking for somebody to come to the roof and everybody who shows up was an unlicensed contractor saying oh do you root for you know a couple hundred bucks yeah you know because it is a criminal violation and then you pursue that that's really the bigger permitted stage i mean [Music] of the largest foreign in the world is home depot and lowe's and they're based on the predicate of do it yourself i do myself i'm allowed to do it myself i can redo my house if i want all i got to do is if it falls under the permit i'm allowed to pull that curve as the florida homeowner and it's my primary residence i'm good right windows and swap them out and never have somebody look at it but i can't have it permitted i can pull the permit i can have whoever worked for me so long as that work passes the inspector so you're absolutely good with doing it i can hire you tomorrow if i pull the permit you do the work and it passes inspection but i'd have to be licensed certainly not necessarily not necessarily but unnecessarily and i think that's where it's really one i think that this in this discussion is generally informative on it seems like there's a lot of nuance in this understanding potentially um and so there may be value in getting resources on what is that getting to the you know the point they discussed yeah it's just you know i've had neighbors come up like i can't get that electricity and they've got a bad breaker out there i've pulled breakers out of replace breakers and i've done wiring yeah of the code important things we were talking about before because public awareness is a big part of this thing and we had talked in a previous work session about putting out online or commenting stuff like this and just being the perfect addendum like oh by the way while we're on the subject you know there are some issues and concerns about this again public works and education might be perfect i do know that roofing and plumbing and electrical uh some things are perfect unless you're changing the whole structure if i'm changing a load if i'm well the whole point is is because uh i don't want to see everybody getting in trouble all the time for all this work and it's it's really a bad problem anyway because first off nobody wants to do a little job nobody so then you are a handyman to do a little job and you pay him what it's really worth or you go through the proper process and it does cost three or four times because no one wants to do a little job and if you do find somebody to do the work you might as well wait six months before they can get to you i wanna i'd like to put an awning out yeah [Music] has always been with licensed insured contractors when we redid our house we had to take that guy to court because they were basically claiming work progress that they never did because we were up in maryland we finally came down here and found out they were doing nothing so we had to hire another contractor obviously we watch also license but just because they're licensed and insured doesn't mean they're ready at all and that's always been a problem florida just getting that person that's not only licensed insured but actually it does the work and they come out and do it yeah and on time you know you know the whole yeah yeah check the courthouse and then uh i know that mike kelly he is working with a county to [Music] to basically up the defines and watching people more closely and maybe he has some insight on this also i'll reach out to him and see if maybe he'd like to come speak to us for a few minutes just so that put us in the right direction i just feel like we're we need to help our community because there's just so much going on right now and i don't you see it you know what's going on there's a there's a lot of what what's the volume of projects where you're seeing illegal activity and uh claphams having to step in and shut people down and things like that it's happening and how much would you say of it is ignorance versus just trying to get away with something uh randy you said you've got the kind of the sheriff's office has something i'm saying they may i don't i don't know but given what a priority it is i imagine that they have some kind of educational material our administrative resources i'm happy to reach out to their their counselor okay so someone mentioned stealing information from another agency that's just called okay i'll call them and see if they have something that i can get my hands off is just anything we can get our hands on to take a look at for examples and uh i don't think there's licensed contractors no no no i would say to you i've seen so many guys i have no problem with that at all my point is is that it's a struggle between because it is hard to get to the small town it is tough and you know but the flip side is do you want someone on a 35-foot ladder that doesn't have insurance on the property i mean kind of protecting the homeowners right so there's some some pros and cons to it it's tough both sides i get it but you know and that is the disadvantage to not living in the area for a long time you know if i need something done like that i don't you know what it is all right okay well we'll uh revisit this a little bit later now we're on the general business a couple of things came in the first one was this uh library letter anyone see this or is it distributed anywhere else so i'll just read it dear mary gaddis nellis public library cooperative incorporated is made up of 14 member libraries geographically located throughout pinellas county collectively they provide access to over 2 million items including books dvds music ebooks audiobooks and a wide array of online resources in addition to materials for recreational and educational use our libraries provide a variety of programs for adults teens and children together our member libraries enrich the quality of life for all our users in accordance with the interlocal agreement i am providing you with notification of the per capita amount required for your participation as a member of the cooperative each of your members has submitted audit audited reports documenting the cost of running their local library based on these reports we calculated the cost at 35. 35.79 per capita your membership fee for fiscal year 23 should you wish to join the cooperative it's based on your population multiplied by the per capita cost biller beach population 1632 times 35.79 is 58 409 and 28 cents now haven't we been participating but if we said only a few per capita reimburse people that requested the [Music] why would they even send i know that we do this every year but i don't recall it being presented this way no they want to charge the city so that all of our citizens may use no we'll never use well right so what we do is those that wish you that we reimburse and that's a much lower number they get to pay 50 bucks for a library card and we give them 50 bucks you have to join you know your membership fee should you wish to join the cooperator are we are the would you pursue this will you find maybe not yeah the 330 versus 400 rate for the filming of the city council yes yes that was given to us today yeah i put that out all right so i asked victor to give us a price to do the administration of the uh zoom meetings and i thought a fair price would be because he's not using any of his editing equipment or his cameras he's using all our equipment which we'll have he showed up would be the two-thirds of what his current contract price was so that's the that's the amount that you're seeing at the 330 and that included an email so he wrote that he wrote up that contract based on the price i told him to and then he made a request in an email to me that i distributed to you just for consideration i plan on having randy's still reviewing the contract but once we uh make sure it's where it needs to be by having that approved in the september meeting so we were paying him 400 per meeting and he was going home and editing and then yeah 495 495 and now we're down to how much three thirty for the two hours and then there's a additional hourly rate 400. sorry 195. would that satisfy the requirement what requirements i'm sorry i'm not understanding the question of the requirements of a city council to have minutes i'm not familiar with the precise term my understanding was the discussion was principally around fiscal allocation looking at the agreement now and when kyle says it's illegal i'm not pretending that this is an extensive thing i received it last week and planned the private attendance this week but the you're looking at the fee section 4 is that weird no i'm just kidding what he's proposing to provide us our requirements of city council we don't need a edited video there is no legal requirement that any public meeting most public meetings be recorded via audio or video for that matter communities do it for the reasons of one it makes it easier to produce in minutes two added transparency and engagement with the public and three additional records to document the decision-making process but there's nothing under the sunshine law that requires ordinary meetings there's some exceptions ordinary meetings being recorded via audio or video so the editing does not require that no it may give you a better final product if that's something you're interested in but it's not there's no statutory requirement that any video produced by municipality be edited to you know in platform x or quite frankly it's like by editing the implies that you're trying to hide something and with today's technology somebody said well meeting's too long well they all have fast forward i can take that thing and go right to the end if i want to do whatever i want or help i i would i would quibble with the uh the characterization that editing implies destruction but i understand that i don't mean you're that conspiratorial notion in our in our society generally um when you say something's edited that means you're hiding something i get what you mean i think it's standard in audio visual production and that's a term that just means we're eliminating the white noise and dead spaces kyle were we receiving a flat rate prior to this you know we're always getting a two-hour base rate with the uh additional hours calculated out here what was the additional hour rate it was the same rate it he's going to be keeping an eye on the monitor to make sure if anyone's raising their hand yes i think that's going to be your greatest benefit is just having someone there who's okay so we're talking about hiring a part-time clerical worker why can't we have that part-time worker come in and head to the meetings and do that for twenty dollars an hour i was going to throw out a suggestion about looking into an intern program i'd actually looked at some stuff for the same pg your college and this internship program and all you got to do is go out and say hey looking for some kid who's in uh you know information resources or audio visual stuff and i need them for x number of hours a week and typically compensated a little bit opposite of those benefits or anything like that but these guys are jumping for real-world experience and hands-on stuff all it takes would be a letter to call to a safety junior college you say i like that idea if you look right now kyle is running the meeting he's running the the video conference and uh he's gotten up three times i think what's the difference from doing now or our city council well what happens is during a regular council session people will want to speak well you've had that type i think kyle you were saying because yeah well they don't do it on their own someone has to moderate it so someone has to sit there and actually be ready to to click and patty is busy with uh minutes and kyle is in the city manager role as an intern yes spc will definitely dr cronkite would be more than welcome to set something up interns are great but for me you need someone you know who's going to show up and that's the problem you run into with interns they don't always show up what they're supposed to do so i do feel like we have to have a paperwork you know contribute position typically yeah i i think the point number shirley is making is somebody who's in a contract with you has obligations to give kind of reaches and understanding and that's a person that's a policy decision you folks but i think that's the product of our people whatever you can say okay you know we agreed over time for it to cover the meeting a lot of times what happens is people come in and intern programs and people like them so much they turn around and hire them some sort of part-time job so you know it can be a self-serving kind of thing too it allows us to look at people and say hey we really like you and maybe like a part-time job our meetings generally run about three to four hours worst case scenario around four hours these days not as bad as it used to be you doubled it yeah yeah so um look at the amount of money here in the past i understood it because it does take forever you have to take that raw video and you have to turn it into something that you can put back online but what we want to give them is what they're seeing live and i think that that's way simpler than 500 worth of it's not an attorney in jesus happy birthday so patty what you put on our website currently that's an audio version of our council meetings that's what you you do that right right i take the audio kyle does something to it and then i put it on the website i don't know what pal let's do it but it's an audio only it starts as an audio and i did a video by putting the city seal behind it youtube you can help me upload videos okay yeah let me give you some back history um several years ago we said we weren't doing enough we wanted our residents to be able to see us out and so if it was audio only we would not be doing any more than we've been doing for the past few years whenever we have these small meetings correct that's what that's what we can do is just uploading audio but these meetings with zoom because we're recording it there's nothing to do it's just a matter of uploading it after you can save it into the computer so really we just need somebody that can run soon and kyle can train them if they don't have that it's not that hard and i also wonder is it possible that we already have staff that would be interested in making a little extra cash during our meetings because we do have a few people here victor has been with us for as he says over seven years and has done a wonderful job and i would be in favor of keeping him from re-upping his contract i don't have a problem with keeping him i have a problem with this raid okay it seems very pricey and i'm aware of the family that yeah uh we don't need this um we just transfer over to somebody that works for us i mean the city manager does work for us we got his direction so i locate the direction and this provides somebody to do this and we are willing to you know provide financially for that volunteer that comes forward to do this they already have insurance they're covered we know who they are you monitor their work quality as well as we do and we're saving that's a lot of money yeah it's about right here at the 3 30 rate was at 165 an hour yeah god forbid you've run over i don't want to truncate our the people's business by saying we really can't go much further because we're paying this person you know x amount every hour we work i bet if we offer a victory or contract two hours plus one an hour but it's a salary now type of position where he last six hours he has to stay six hours two hours flat rate would be yeah that's for sure i know he wants to he wants to keep working with us but um this is if we have one of those bad meetings um it's just a very expensive right now [Music] this is easy [Music] you just need the following somebody that works for you that can push the button and bring to our attention anybody that does the phone that's it i don't need to pay for an editor or anything else i mean this is frankly kind of minimum wage that would be perfect instead of coming in at nine in the morning we'll see at six times [Music] unfortunately enough hours that they can hire someone sometimes you can't hire someone to give you enough hours like a contract yeah kyle would you like to survey your staff and see if anybody's interested in helping us out it needs to be somebody that can operate that you can train with anybody right uh if it was our staff and they'd already insured under our policy the uh what rate do we think it had been definitely set up to come in the off hours [Music] i have a hard time paying after that i just can't do it anybody else feel the same way okay uh any other general business yes frank um i wanted to put this on the agenda it was called grantham there's a there's north oak times um i have one at 123 h that's impacted proudly when it falls over which had a guy come out who was in an artist it seems hollow now but if it falls it could take four houses out for 250 i think kyle he's he's been out to look at it um i like this i like to have council come up with an artist to come out i don't know what the county would do it um but we get one day of winter storm it looks like it's going to go over it's about at least 75 feet high the resident the homeowner tore the house down probably five six years ago lives in las vegas doesn't give a hoot about the property anymore won't sell the property but this pine tree just keeps growing and enrollment are we legally allowed no it's on his private property we i won't say we're absolutely not allowed to there are very limited circumstances in which we could i i'm not sure that i've heard those circumstances articulated yet but i would say that it is a high bar to going even a tree that we may consider potentially dangerous or undesirable and its aesthetics remains part of someone's private property and so there's our ability to engage in self-help may be limited i'm not saying it's an absolute no of course my job is to help you focus on the resources i want to tell you it's we're starting from robotical presumption the presumption is no we may be able to i i'll need to learn more but i don't want to what if it looks like it could be a catastrophe dangerous situation uh subjective terms that's what i would say where is it located on the property like is it on the edge of the property in the middle of the property where it could take a house out at 9th street two houses think about transmission power we can't just jump on that either as it works i know but um the resident was here to refresh everyone's memory uh the last little storm we had do a lot of things i understand what you're saying mayor about the legal party yeah like if there's been more to look into that we could do something on there i'm going to tell you that my inclination is likely that the answer will be if there are concerned neighbors they may have private remedies but that doesn't necessarily render them local jurisdictions responsibility for them connecting with some more more power david has right attention and then here's the other thing maybe the neighbor the neighbors could get together and turn the trade if no one's at the property and no one's maintaining it that would be if i was concerned about going on my house i would turn the tree in can we do that with that can you probably not leave her i was i was i would deal with the other that's a woman i was thinking that route yeah i mean that's but here's the difference like i do it with trees i've got one hanging over my office well if it's hanging in your yard you can try it out but i'm talking about this one that's tilting yeah so you top it off you just trim it down and top it off the neighbors approach this guy at all yes and offered to take it down um i don't i don't want to give you third hand information but he wasn't very uh to be a judge okay uh vice mayor gunner do you have is there any action coming out of this can i bring up another topic you know for the longest time parking i just happened to be in the parking lot on 19th street and was sitting there and a couple cars came in without miller beach stickers and it's one of those times like we're here with a sheriff well sheriff just took the whole day and he sat there for a while and then finally he walked up and started sighting cars and ended up on the beach looking for people hey you know move the car and then while he's talking somebody there they're all lining up with their citations and to take up this valuable time and my question is is we've talked about towing services and where has that gone i mean this predates the umbrella stuff we thought of it as a possibility to subvert the people just coming in doing dumping runs whatever and i'm sure there is not a bellar beach resident who if he walked through that park and saw a car there without a sticker wouldn't drop a dime on one of those people and i'm just wondering why haven't we pursued this it's because we can't do it we can't do it we legally cannot do it it's not hard and now in our lives we can right it's not our property to to from but the if you're talking about the accesses that are shared we are in fact fellow shores but considered part of our general shared community at large and that's their property to regulate and enforce on so you're correct that even in my brief tenure we've had discussions but our discussions are we are prepared to facilitate and enable if they move in that policy direction but we can't unilaterally as a commission say we're going to hire a tow company to put up the proper signage so have we approached that with builder shore or is it worth a letter from miller beach to another shore said hey or i could just pick up the phone and call somebody and say hey what do you think what's your will help facilitate it my understanding is that this is part of a broader dialogue on what's happening in the accesses and they are aware of that inclination i know i know i in very broad terms spoke with their city attorney to say hey is there any availability to this i know a successful meeting i was at but that's part of a broader discussion of what's happening at the rece at those accesses and how the two communities are going to find the gray area of the venn diagram where they're both happy about a whole bunch of issues so understanding decision issue isn't happening in a vacuum i i don't know that we have an ability to meaningfully advance it beyond what their policy priorities are many people i can tell you that they don't have a problem with vehicles being towed but it's never actually i've been to several of their meetings and i've never actually seen them have a serious conversation about it but there's nothing stopping me from bringing it up at one of their meetings yesterday morning 10 o'clock i'm coming up down boulevard i go in the sixth street there's a nice gentleman yearning all over the wall okay and everyone go and looks at me it's 10 o'clock in the morning that's what happens in their backyards yeah and they do have a legitimate complaint okay about some of the abuse i mean and then who what how what comes ten minutes later i knew to pick the guy up yeah so and they you know i mentioned that on in one of the meetings that i attended and i think there's been a lot of mention of it i think it's maybe you made a phone call but i think an official letter from the city saying we are willing to facilitate this and feel different so that they'll talk about it in their council meeting rather than just being able to talk about this yeah i think the residents want that yeah okay any other business right now yes sir i got two things um i don't know if anyone saw this we got a notification from the fellas county sheriff's like event coordinator uh notify asked it on october 2nd clearwater is doing a half marathon and it's going to close gulf boulevard north causeway from seven minutes 7 30 am digital yeah so police completely they usually do lane yeah all right and then the other thing is that on 1041 that was made full so that's settled that code enforcement that but [Music] [Music] time frame but i'll call the contractor to get an update on what's going on they've been taking care of the grass at least now yeah and when they build the the two that are being built the you know just some safety stuff that we might need to have before midnight all right uh you made a motion to return do i have a second second all right all in favor"
