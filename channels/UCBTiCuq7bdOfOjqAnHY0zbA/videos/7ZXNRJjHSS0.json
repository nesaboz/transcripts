    "transcript": "good evening everyone welcome to the monday october 4th 2021 public meeting of the city of bel air beach please rise and join me for the pledge of allegiance adam clark please call councilmember robynocki council member frank banker brother councilmember glenn gunn council member leslie otero here councilmember rita sword here vice mayor dave davis here mayor joseph manzo yeah city manager lynn reeves and city attorney fred bradley here okay thank you first item of business is to approve the agenda before we do that we've got two or four items on the consent agenda i want to move actually i have questions on two of them but i think we have to move them so we can discuss them so eight nine and ten i'd like to move just question on eight and nine ten a little bit more i couldn't read the attachment so i'm going to have the city manager explain it so nothing heavy i just want to move them to regular agenda anybody have anything else i'll entertain motion and to approve the agenda moving those items notion yes okay any discussion citizens counsel all in favor aye all right anyone opposed has a 7-0 assistant's comments ladies and gentlemen we're going to invite you to come up here take three minutes speak to the council on any topic that's not on the agenda if it's on the agenda you'll have a separate time to discuss that agenda item when it comes around so don't come up and speak about something we already have because you'll have more time later on on that um please just give us your name your uh your address information uh and you know we all have a meeting afterwards we all agree that we're gonna try and keep these things as civil as we possibly can we're going to do our best and we ask you to help us with that so does anyone like to address the council okay so i'm debbie law and i live on causeway hillary i have a few suggestions and a few comments uh first regarding the parking lots and most particularly the crane and heavy equipment at the 12th street access i would like to suggest that we have mr riley write a letter to bellaire's show informing them that due to their issuing parking permits for construction vehicles and other commercial vehicles in violation of their open ordinance that we can no longer indemnify and hold harmless spellers sure from claims of injury or property damage on any vehicle in the lot without a balers beach parking sticker as well as non-residents pedestrians accessing the lots i got our insurance covers damage caused by construction vehicles away that we're allowing heavy construction equipment to use these slots second lin mentioned that you all are looking into a new telephone system i'd suggest that we look for a system with a feature that will allow you to push out text messages to property owners regarding emergency information since we have a significant number of snowbirds as well as renters these property owners would not see any emergency information posted on our sign we have a home in colorado and rental properties there as well i received texts from the city for real properties regarding fire snow storms covered vaccinations freeways closures etc and it's just a really good way i think to keep our citizens informed i'm also very concerned about personal issues of board members that are influencing their opinions and votes as elected officials you all are held to a higher standard and must represent and consider the needs of all of the citizens those of you who live on the water and don't use the beach cannot minimize or push aside the needs of those citizens who do use the beach so while dilapidated boats and boat docks may be important to some of you it's no more important than umbrellas reporting markers to those of us who enjoy the beach i'm very concerned in particular about the ethical issues of ms swopes she felt completely unnecessary to inform the council that she was listing our city manager's home for sale and would make a significant commission from celica she did not recuse herself from voting on pay raise and other things regarding our city manager yet she felt it necessary to recuse herself from voting on the signed ordinance because she's a realtor that didn't make any sense to me i believe that she is unwilling to represent the citizens of bella beach fairly and issues regarding the other shore because she's hoping that perhaps she would get a referral uh perhaps or mrs calucci on a listing a home here i believe that uh let's see um [Music] i believe that also our city manager has issues with that same elephant in the room so to speak we've seen the parking issue escalate as well as the issue with the beach accesses umbrellas and now we're seeing it with the booties rick shock and i first met with lynn regarding the parking lot issues when lynn became city manager years ago and nothing was ever addressed or done that's why rick and i not joseph manzo first contacted bellar store threatening the lawsuit i'm not sure if we could take a yield afterward i don't have the thing normally you yield it in front i don't you're okay all right thank you i think if you're gonna yield i think it has to be done up front just so you know okay i think so i i could be rolling on that if you want me to look it up we'll stop it but okay okay anyone else to address the council so you know other hands i'll close citizen comments next we have a presentation by the pinellas county sheriff's office sergeant you're going to be doing the presentation i am sir okay please i could also take the opportunity to introduce my corporal sure bring him up and let everyone need to absolutely duration of the shift and they'll be filling in my absence all right so the statistics that i am presenting this evening are going to be from august of 2021 the activity we had one assault that was domestic related and then we also had two thefts there were a total of 12 people arrested a lot of those came from traffic initiated traffic stops dui and other related offenses there were 931 events in the city for the month of august and leaving that were house checks and traffic enforcement and then there were three crashes one at 2000 belf boulevard causeway health boulevard and causeway and cedar drive and a total of 208 citations and warnings were issued within the city limits and it looks like from the breakdown that i have here 32 look like they were traffic citations and 169 warnings and i can't quite see the breakdown on the parking citation enforcement however i do know the deputy on my shift is continually in northern park and the other accesses and that is all i have thank you sheriff i do know i mean i don't know why but and maybe it's domestic related but you know if you look at us first last year we're pretty much the same in terms of crime and all this is very very low most people have you know cities have this kind of crime in a day we talk about it for months on end but um you know we only have 12 major events you know year to date up till august but i do know that like seven of them this year are assaults and last year we only had one is it domestic related or is it just something in the water what's going on i'm going to say that it is majority domestic related however when i do do some research on some of the significant activity that occurs in the city i will note that some of the activity occurs elsewhere and it ends up in the city or it will occur somewhere else come through the city and end up in the iraq's beach and somehow it ends up entitled in bellaire beach when it should be entitled maybe a different city so sometimes the numbers don't reflect that they necessarily occurred heard somewhere else or ended up in bellaire beach as opposed to very naturally occurring any observation as to whether this is transients you know with the short-term rentals that we have on the beach the motels things like that versus our regular residents some of them are transient in that nature visitors coming from other states uh one of the noted reports on there is a grand theft that was a bicycle that was taken from morgan park where it happened a transient that came through the city saw a bicycle took it for himself however it was captured right down the road so a lot of it is transient so obviously our residents as well there was a burglary to a conveyance in which the vehicle board was unlocked however that was the only one which means that the citizens are doing their part by locking their doors unfortunately sometimes one gets by or a lot of color enough in the state so somebody showed me a video of kids i don't know if just here or one of the neighboring towns and you just see them they go around three or four one stents in this sits in the road keeping an eye out the other two two on one side two on the other doors at you know whatever one o'clock two o'clock in the morning so you just heard it from the sheriff locked your doors we've said it a thousand times you don't want to be one of these statistics any counsel comments questions all right and frank i was wondering um the three beach access spots that are conveyed to us needed to us since we no longer you guys are no longer ticketed through the ballard beach ticket book is there any way we can get a statistic since they are our lots every month how many citations are being issued through the ballard's shore yeah of course yeah you can reach out to the can we get that included in i think that came up a month ago a few months ago my understanding is that would be through captain miner or reaching out to the city for something or i'll start reaching out to the they don't publish it like you hear it as part of their agenda but bellar sure does get that information every every time citizens anything for the sheriff yes is it possible to know how many citations are written i'm going to repeat that because you didn't come up and the question is is it possible to know how many citations were written on the cosplay i could request a breakdown for specific locations again with when you have over 100 citations being issued both citations and warnings it might take a little bit more to break it down to the specific location so i can request and see if that can be broken down into that criteria would you like that does that mean can we is it possible to get a month of that or without too much extra work i mean you don't want to have massive stuff as it is it's back he's on vacation they usually give us the you know the breakout here but you know whether the stops occurred but that doesn't necessarily mean whether it was a citation right so usually right usually you like to do one or two in front of my house my whole house lights up when you're doing it out there it's nice at two o'clock in the morning but you guys are doing great so and actually i'll say something about that there was one i mean the whole house is lighting up you know with the blue lights and i was observing it from the window i was kidding captain liner so this is like watching cops but i don't have to watch it on tv the professionalism was incredible i mean there were two young people there was some issues and you had them out of the car but you could just see it went very smoothly i don't think they even got a ticket they just got a warning or something but you work through the whole thing and everybody was you know kept their cool and everything it was a you know it was late at night so it was a good job thank you okay all right anything else thank you sheriff thank you item four is board reports we have board of adjustment parks and rec board and planning and zoning board anyone from board of adjustment no report mr mayor no report that's michael kelly no report from the board of adjustment parks and rec board yes hi everyone hello um just a quick word report from this last quarter you know i'm hearing okay okay perfect so um in the last quarter we had two blood drives i want to thank everyone that participated um one blog said that seven donations were made saving 21 lives in august and then we had 11 blood donations september 24th saving 33 lives so i'd like to thank everybody that came and if you haven't done so or if you don't know a lot about it you can either sign up online or you can just show up and kind of wait in line so it just depends on your time frame but thank you to everyone that has participated and the next blood drive is friday november 19th from 10 to 3 in the parking lot so um my second item is the beach cleanups have been going very well this past saturday was our fifth month meeting on 19th street this past quarter we've had anywhere from 11 to 25 people show up on the beach so it's really great it's a nice hour you're in and out and we collect a lot of garbage so it's good so it's a it's a nice way to get to meet people and i appreciate everybody that's coming out to help number three so this last sunday we had our jazz in the park event so again i think everyone was really happy with the outcome i know we were and i'd like to thank my entire board for all the hard work everybody pitched in and tiny talent was extremely appreciated um we had about 120 people in attendance and we sold about 700 in bellar beach merchandise and everyone was really excited about it and a lot of people were like we didn't know we had this which kind of makes sense because you know if you work during the day you really can't get up to see it so it was nice that everybody had a chance to see what we had to offer um and we sold out a couple of the categories so that was nice okay number four um an indoor yoga class was added by request it's all fitness level so if you've never done yoga day in your life this would be a great class if you don't like sand if you don't like the heat um she accommodates all levels and it's monday and wednesday at 11 30 here in this room so i've taken the class a couple times it's really nice and um it's also good because the beach yoga if you know because of the red tide or if it rains it gives you an opportunity if you can't go to the beach and do it um up and coming events halloween pets and powell's costume contest and parade is coming up this saturday october 30th from 10 to 12. it was requested on the postcard invites that if you please call and sign up you literally just have to give your favorite first name in your address we've already had a couple i think we have three kids and a dog or two that have signed up already and we really just want to know to make sure that we have enough refreshments if you decide last minute to you know throw a costume on your dog and show up that's great you don't feel like you have to sign up to participate we have really nice um prizes for the winners and it'll be a quick in and out with the treat bags for all the kids and all the dogs and so hopefully we have a big brother and we have a good turnout like at the jazz fest we also have another sunsets by brush that will be wednesday november 3rd from 4 to 7. we had one in may and we had a very good turnout we had about 22 people show up there's a video of it on the motherboard's website that patty added if you're not familiar with it but it's it's it's really beautiful way to spend the evening on the beach painting and you don't have to be a good painter you know it's just fun and it's the instructor is wonderful and then last but not least um we have our holiday social and christmas tree lighting on monday december 6 at 5 00 so it'll be right before we the city council meeting it'll be a quick one-hour thing but we will have christmas carolers and refreshments and we'll like our christmas tree for the season so that's all i have for this quarter another questions or comments uh yeah i went to the uh the event last week and i thought it was it was put together nicely it wasn't over the top and it seemed like everyone was having a good time so and i think everyone i know that went there bought something from you guys so good job on that in fact i will not assure it over to the grocery store and somebody immediately came up and said where did you get that oh good so that's that was really cool yeah good great job thank you okay thank you i wasn't able i had a prior commitment that day but i what i've heard it went well and it sounds like it did so thank you to you and your crew great job um and looking forward to the next events some of these things you're mentioning um like sunset by brush i'm not gonna paint anything i can't even paint a wall but it's okay i didn't even know about that though so like please you know let us know and i mean if you want us you know when we come to the end over here we usually say when the next council meets if you have an event like you know you're here today but you only come and typically have to make a quarterly presentation if you've got something that you want us to just let everybody know about you know like a reminder that you know the pets we'll do that we have the work session but in december we could make an announcement in november you know to that effect so feel free to utilize that the only question i have for you is this beach cleanup you know people doing cleanups and stuff like that are we getting legal release from these people for the for their participations no this is the first that's ever been mentioned to me so now it should be mentioned city term should we not be doing a legal release if people are going to do it you do a legal release when you have a road race you do we get a legal release for the bounce house what about it you certainly could do a release if some people are going to be doing something where somebody could slip and fall somebody could get hit by a car or that sort of thing so i i would say i've not talked to lynn about it i'm sure there's been other instant there are situations where the city's used a general uh participation type release if not i know there i've done it for my other city and it's something that you could easily incorporate into your events and it could be a one-time thing for a person they don't have to do it each time but just to cover us in case somebody's picking up something and they you know have a nail go through their arm or something like that i mean they're volunteering here and it's not it is a city event so we do have liability at this point you know um it kind of gets a little funky if we have somebody outside of the city helping out you know because then we're in the lot somebody came and talked about liability earlier in those lots where we right now have the legal obligation what's happening in those lots parking and anything that goes on actually okay um well as far as the advertising of the events they've built all been on the city website for months so if you go under park and rec and you click it you'll you'll see it there's a sign up sheet there's a scroll my name and number is in like three different places so all of these things have been on there and then as we get closer patti we'll put them on the front page kind of flashing but when they're a couple months out we only have them and they've been there for probably the last six months so if they are there we do utilize what we have and what's great about i know like however and wherever you sit on the sign that's going in the front the sign will save like like there were 1500 in our budget that we had to spend doing the mailers and the signs which we no longer have to do because we can post these things hopefully on the sign out front as opposed to spending money and because not everybody goes to our website and looks under pardon wreck so yeah it's a good way to see it and like we did put a big sign up but you know obviously people don't always go like this but if it's a flashing sign closer to the street they might you know be more apt to see it so that's good and then as far as the liability from i have no problem with that and as long as um and you know it's pretty much the same 25 people and sometimes they come and sometimes they don't if they sign the form once so it really it's just you're worried about what's happening in the parking lot because if they're done everything i mean it's parking lot you know you step one foot on the sand in bellaire shore on private property let's just insulate ourselves the city manager will give you a standard release it's nothing we're not creating reinventing the wheel here it's something simple you've probably signed hundreds of them for any event that you did i bet if you go to that yoga class there's a release there oh there is yeah that's fine so that's okay that's all we need i i just it came to mind and i just thankfully everything's really went well so yeah it has okay perfect right no problem uh so any comments from the citizens thank you okay [Music] all right public

tie here i'm gonna go with dave gaddis i think i heard him first and playing gun the second do you david i'd like to uh make a motion to table this for the next work session second by frank banker there's a discussion on that um it is not debatable okay so um a majority ruling on this will the majority ruling will take all this um come to the council well let's call the role as we will patty on

public hearing minutes the s vote will approve this all in favor all right anyone opposed pass this seven to zero item nine this is approval of the september 20th 2021 work session minutes i get asked to move this and i did have some questions but first let's get a motion so move dennis second second second robin hockey dave um so my comment was this um the reason why let me write to the item here reason why i put item four on the agenda initially was to resolve some of the questions that we had which we did on that meeting but i don't think it was really reflected in these minutes and i'll give you some of the areas that i didn't really think got a lot of coverage here that probably should have one of them was the ability of the code officer to talk freely with any member of council or the citizens and we heard from captain miner saying that of course he could and that should be possible that should be the way he conducts himself um we also the focus was to make sure that the code officer and the city manager was aware that our focus is on compliance not crackdown on code can i go back to what mike liner said he's never met a mayor or a council that said let's crack down and make tickets money off our citizens so that didn't get reflected in here i thought it should have again these are my personal opinions but i think this stuff should be in there i believe the word sensible code enforcement is what we were using and that's where we what we've been doing and i want to make sure it's been stressed that's what we're supposed to be at the code office are supposed to be at our meetings we're going right now temporarily to a 20-hour code enforcement work week we used to have eight but we used that twelve then we had eight now we're up to twenty and we wanna see how that's working out and there's no mention of it in here and also that he's gonna come starting with november we didn't say do it this month but um he was supposed to come and make the presentation right after during the sheriff's presentation the sheriff will do the crime in the city and then have a code officer have the opportunity to speak with us so that really was something that we asked to start happening in november uh and finally i didn't see reflected and hear anything about the ride-alongs even though right now they're suspended due to covet as soon as the opportunity comes up again the city council members have been invited to you know participate not participating enforcement but to see what the code enforcement you know a day in the life of if you will sit in the truck and see what he's going through how he's spending his time you know what do you see when you're going around town that type of thing and haven't seen that reflected in here so my my request is that we revised the minutes to add some of that stuff because to me that was the most important stuff that's why i called it i think what we got in here was just you know a lot of stuff that we probably already knew um but we could affirm where we're supposed to be going on it so that was my takeaways from this and i just and even if it's not in there i think it should at least be highlighted that those were the concerns and that's what i was erasing you know counseling citizens [Music] back to council so i'm going to ask that here we voluntarily do it or we can entertain emotion or we can have incomplete minutes i'm going to have a problem if we have incomplete minutes but um you know i think we should i think we should either table this one or move it to our you know revise it i don't think we can pass it the way it is that's my feeling are you asking for a motion i'll entertain a motion or i'll make it myself if we have to do it i'm just trying to avoid the pass go ahead i'll make a motion to enter oh all right okay i'm sorry motion to under what approval pending you know then just have another listen to that maybe and see if what i was recalling is you know if you think those are highlights okay um i don't um put every statement that everyone makes you know we're trying to pair the minutes down to as close to action minutes as we can but i'll do whatever council wants to do but um can you tell me specifically are you does counsel saying they want exactly what you said previously because i can go back and listen to that i just need to know what to enter to do it i'm just saying to me that was the sailing issues that's why i brought it i thought those were the key things that were takeaways and i i really would like it reflected in the minutes um to me that's what was the most important because there's just missing stuff on these minutes i'm not saying it was intentional but i don't think it was toss away stuff i think it was important um that was all the reason why i brought it if you look back to what my concerns were that were enumerated on when i brought it and i would like those concerns you know we did address every one of them and i think council was in pretty much agreement i don't think we were disagreeing at all that night right i'm just asking is that what the motion was to do exactly it was just a table and having to take another look at it but i mean i kind of just gave you what i was looking for maybe other people have some other record recollections or something they wanted to put in or maybe i just thought something was important they didn't think it was i understand the motion so that i can do what the motion was and the motion was to do all the points that you mentioned no it's just a table until you can go back and see if that just listen to it listen to it and add that if you you know and bring it back to us again with is valid let's do let's do a uh let's do a voice uh i'm not gonna do a voiceover that's called roll on this one there's motion to table only okay then you and i can go over i'll talk with you how's that okay okay at least what i was looking for if people don't like it they could strike it out the next time okay so motion to table this is tabling it only okay uh now it's already seconded if pat is going to call the uh the roll for 10 motion a table [Music] councilmember banker yes councilmember gunn named councilmember otero councilmember slope nay vice mayor gallus hey [Music] the items so you can listen to this one but we can go through it again if you want and then they can edit it if necessary sorry okay that's out of nine item 10 authorize the city manager to advertise for a liter drive drainage repair this is authorization advertised for repair to reduce street flooding um got a motion first so movement second second light leslie dave refer to the city manager on this yeah mayor council uh we've got a drainage issue on elita drive uh it's about 200 feet of pipe that we need to put in to bring it to a storm brain inland and so what i'm asking is authorization to advertise for that repair to be done and it will put on the tail we'll go along the new curve we'll put in a pipe on the outside of the curb that will take the water from the area that's in question down to the storm water inlet underground so the water issue on that street in that area is gone was this the reason why i moved this into discussion i i don't know maybe my eyes were going at 63 but i can't see this okay this is like in microfiche if anybody remembers that's what they said so that's why i needed you to explain it so that's it it's a couple hundred feet of pipe that we're gonna put along the curb to run it into an inlet so there'll be an inlet at like the address but there'll be an inlet then go down the street to the stormwater box and then go back into that because there's an issue just in this actually it's really more in front of two properties on the let's see it be on the north side of the street so this is the way to fix it we had the engineer look at it we did a survey did the elevations so we could get the hardware flowing a lot of the water that goes there is from irrigation lines you know irrigation you know people are irrigating space there all the time so it's puddling up it's cooling up and when it rains it stays and gets into the middle of the stream we want to fix that council because it's just two homes it's two homes that it's public in front of but we need to get it to the stormwater the only thing i have i like to add is there's a house on fifth street the resident reached out to me i think some other council like i i call my abby kurtz i think it needs to be shaped down and get rid of your order um i think if we're doing this something like this you're progressing yeah the one on fifth street history yes history i don't know about i'll give you one right in front of my house ever since you um they replaced the valley curves a couple years ago i could play billiards it's a level in front of my house the water actually cools up and it evaporates and that's fun in the middle of florida summers when it's really gross i mean it's just smelly and dirty and it's and it's there's no pitch there was but there isn't any more so guys when they installed it like didn't pitch it so it's probably the same sounds like the same thing frank is talking about um and it's definitely i mean it's not like it's flooding into the street but it's probably breeding mosquitoes so and that's exactly what is it it just lays right in front of that property because the curb's actually a little bit low well your curbs were probably replaced five or six years ago at least not under warranty but it wasn't noticeable at first you know but it definitely happens so anyway okay um so uh citizen comments yes sir [Music] after the most recent paving on a bad rainstorm you can't [Music] as i recall right so now we're hearing fifth street donato no no no i'm talking about this oh you're seeing these okay comments we're talking about um drainage this retention pond across this street which is known by the county hasn't been dug out for about four or five years and they just said they said that all they needed was a call from the city manager and they would come out and do it for free because they own it and i noticed water pulling on the street [Music] 13th street all the time in waters pulling it's going to start affecting the pavement and so forth which is an expense in the city and if the county is willing to clean out the retention plan and it is theirs i say go for it it doesn't cost us anything thank you thank you citizens that council it gets you less work on they're all done i recommend that we vote for this so what we have is item 10 to authorize the city manager to advertise for elita drive drainage repair i'll do a voice vote on this all in favor all right you have anyone to post seven to zero and you've got a few more there to look into mysteries but that's not part of the resolution okay all right regular agenda now this is consideration of ordinance 21-09 in orders of the city council of the city of bellar beach florida providing for an amendment to section 30-141 of the city code of ordinances pertaining to the gulf of mexico safety zone providing for incorporation of recitals providing for approval of an amendment to section 30-141 of the city code ordinances providing for a copy kept on file providing for several ability providing for the repeal of all ordinances in conflict here with and providing for an effective date the description is to create a designated safety zone within the corporate boundaries of the city and i'll just add the city of bella beach you have a motion slope next to the motion second second second yeah i'll go ahead and defer to the city manager city manager yes this is a discussion we've been having and to amend our ordinance so it comes into compliance with the florida statutes and we've sent this to the state for them to review it we had to make a couple changes to it we edited that and this is what they approved going forward and we'll have to once the second reading is done we'll have to restart our buoys but we won't have to move [Music] and i have one question for you because i missed the first i've really read this i never engaged in this activity so it's just one of those things i never had to pay attention to but we talked about no vessels of any type in the swim area and now we're talking bellar beach folks because frank bancard has done a lot of work with bella shore and trying to work that this is just our city limit so we're only talking our beach now so what about somebody wants to launch you know when i see these people launching a paddle board or a you know inflatable kayak or something like that it doesn't really define what vessels mean i mean we don't want motor boats clearly we don't want jet skis we don't want sailboats and big stuff like that but what about a smaller thing is there a cut out carved out for that or we don't want it at all well i don't think technically paddle boards would fall under a vessel there is really no carve out because what the push was is to make sure that we make it a swim area so that we can come in there with non-motorized or non-motorized like a sailboat or something like that the reason why i asked because it does talk about no vessels of any type but it also says operation of watercraft and i certainly would argue that any of those you know lesser harmful things are working i don't want to be hitting the head with a cell board either okay those things hurt too and maybe we just don't want them or maybe we want to have a designated area where you can launch them but i hate to be so restricted because you know i do know a lot of people like to use them and you know are we going to just say no to that i and that's a council's decision but fred do you look like you want to say something or you want to jump the ordinance was written to be consistent with the florida statute and then there's administrative code provisions and there are several different categories and the most restrictive one was the vessel and that's you're you're meeting all the requirements to do that and that's to make that area a an area for swimming and really nothing else so i'm looking now to see if i can find uh administrative credit provision that that maybe has the definition of water crowd but that'll take me leslie wanted to speak to him [Music] [Music] and also the old version had the no wave zone that says a watercraft intending to anchor at a location within the defined safety zone may proceed at idle speed and this eliminates that apparently if i was uh whenever i was participating with a beach clean-up i looked down baylor beach i looked at our shoreline i didn't really see a problem with it we had booze everywhere and it was clearly marked i understand the need for this but i'm also wondering if we're not over restricting ourselves so that's that's fine and put it on i'm not sure an understanding of the restriction well if if we're not being very clear about what a vessel is and what type of vehicles can be used on the beach i i might be one of those people that wants to pick up my family um so do i want them swimming all the way out to the building probably not so i understand so you're in agreement with um yeah i mean i look i don't want to make a criminal out of i don't know somebody you know i don't see too many people there's anything called wind surfing i don't see too much of that anymore but you can go really fast with that and they probably shouldn't be doing it but somebody kayaking or like you know like yeah this is talking about if you're coming straight in you know at a basically a no-wake speed and you're picking somebody up i mean you're not boating in the area you are but you're not i just don't want to i don't want to be like some cities that ban everything and then you can't do anything and you can't have fun in the water obviously no one's advocating that motor boats or jet skis should be running up and down at full throttle or anything close to it but i you know i i don't want you know leslie goes out in her raft and somebody comes along and says you've got a watercraft that's not what this is intended for you know well i think that just to clarify something the issue right now they can come in there i will speak okay but the issue is that keeps being brought up is well the idle speed guy might speed up and we can't control that you know so if if the console wants to do something else that's fine i'm just trying to concentrate banker brought up the issue with the buoys uh we've got to get ourself in compliance and uh with the statute that changed some 10 years ago and whenever we want to make it if you make it a what is it item speed or something like that then you still got the same problem with the boats so you know really it's you're not going to win either way okay i'm looking at the administrative code provision that includes definitions and there are several definitions of different classes of prohibition so let me read just a couple of them one is no power driven vessels another one is no internal combustion motors or no motor zone there's also a vessel exclusion zone and that includes no motorized vessels or manually propelled vessels so there's all sorts of different classifications and the most restrictive is the no no vessel which establishes a swim area and that that's to achieve the objective that council member banker was most concerned about which is anything being in that area so if you want to receive from that slightly you can you can use the other one of the other classifications if that's what you want to do but that's a decision that council would need to make and ultimately the choice that you make for the the ordinance would have to be correspondent with the manner in which the buoy is labeled frank you are probably you know the most expert of everyone on this council just due to the amount of efforts and research you put in um you know again we all know motorized you know heavy motorized things that's what we don't want we don't want to be killed but if you get hit in the head with a kayak you're not going to get killed it you might not want to get hit in the head with a kayak either so i guess i'm asking you you've done a lot of research what have you seen out there is there you know do other cities just ban it entirely i know across the street bans it entirely but what do we you know what have you seen in other places well first of all to clear clarify this i brought up the removal of the buoys from bursary bellaire shores to 17 mothers on 17th street because of the savings i have a problem with this whole ordinance because last month it was brought up that other towns are being looked at now that have been corrected so i went to the fwc i asked them that's part of wildlife conservative commission asked for a public record of any towns being addressed since sydney june 1st or whatever to change their words like they're forcing us they sent me three links which were corrupt okay but again being retired i think i was able to crack some of these links but i asked again to have a senator pbs since the pdf is supposed to be a government software item the review nothing but qriket so here's the big problem of equal protection on the wall why are we being picked on all right look i would love to see all the motorized watercraft staying out i got a picture i was in my office today 6th street beach okay that's that's my name she's a doctor she can contest this boat was 10 feet fishing motorized and pulling all the way up through bel air beach two fishermen they weren't paying attention one of their residents came up and said excuse my friends what the hell is this going all right you need pictures is it already done so no one was really in the water today in my area up there where there was but again why are we being picked on and other communities are not of course this statue has changed over 10 years ago i only won the safety zone put back that protects the people that live from first street and bel air beach to 27th street that go on that beach all right fwc ignorance of their own permit approval that they don't want to admit to and i've asked to speak at their commissioners meeting this week has now turned the page and says okay we're going to stick it to you this way by making a change your movies and nobody else's so that's what i have a big problem with and i think we should be looking in maybe a legal action against them for allowing permits have to be inspected every three years it was changed in 2010 so at least three years or at least three inspections went by and they approved an illegal permit so is um is it a hazard out there yeah it's a big hazard from first aid 17th street um a letter went out indicating last month we put the billy at 6th street through 12th street that will cure a lot of the problems i believe but it won't make it an entire safe area for our residents but this is just i mean and you know what we're doing is incredible for the safety of this community because we have every right to be on the 6th street 12th street and 18th street beaches even though it's a different city we have rights to be there and we are unprotected right now but this is about from 18th really from 18th street north so i guess the question comes to councils how restrictive do you want to be okay we have total restriction i don't you know so i'm not leveraging anything the other shore completely bans everything if you take a paddle board out if one of their commissioners admitted to doing you're breaking their law okay if you take a kayak out of you're breaking their law i've seen people go out there with paddle boards you know it happens okay um we don't permit it apparently either now the question is do we want to or do we not want to i don't want anybody coming back and the neighbor wants motorboats no i don't okay dave gaddis is responsible i think he would come in at the right speed some of these other guys that have the music that you can hear from four blocks away and are you know drinking it up i don't know if they'd be quite as responsible so i'm almost tempted to say sorry you know unfortunately dave winds up getting restricted because he could be responsible and the other people won't be responsible but you know you're gonna survive a hit with a kayak probably you're not gonna survive that with a motorboat or you're not going to survive a jet ski and i swim in those waters and ordinances are created for the unresponsible i mean a resident sent me an email sonny regarding an accident just happened last november kids were out on the boat but it was on the intercoastal no weight zone he floored it i guess knocked seven people out of the boat and one kid 16 year old supporter or 16 year old girl dog um not responsible for that underage drinking i mean if we can't but we can't you know get away from all these types of accidents but i think we should stiffen up our policies i i mean look if that's the wall that's involved too here yes you know you may need to make a reference to other areas because the fwc may have no jurisdiction these kind of issues i mean they they give progress for certain areas but so far as enforcement of operation watercraft and vehicles that may fall within the purview of the marine patrol and somebody else and i think you may need to look for references in the florida statutes or other areas to define watercraft investments and i think you're going to find that association with the florida registration numbers and that sort of things to be concerned about some of these these motorized boats may be right here and also i don't know if anybody stood on the beach and washed a uh a kiteboard or a wind surfer and there's other things you need to be looking at because there are people who are operating those things a hell of a lot more recklessly than people who operate in large boats so there's some unexpected consequences to some of this stuff but i think you also you need to look at the big picture and kind of expand your search because there's different rice bowls and people have different responsibilities in the government agencies any other council comments citizens i'd like to hear from you anybody have any comments on this issue yes yes please come up yeah that's why it's on the money too i think there's some other things that we might need to consider so that we're not coming back to this issue in a year um first i do tell it work and then do paddleboard on the 12 strings i just do um but i i think that uh paddle boards and kayaks probably are not you have a little more control over those i also have a kite but i put kite in here years ago because it's it's not safe there's better places so um the other i think the issues that i see because i run that beach every day um that we need to be um concerned about and and glenn was right um absolutely windsurfers and kiteboarders are dangerous i don't know if y'all are familiar with foiling i have probably half a dozen times stock spoilers in bel air beach who are out there on a crowded saturday and said there are no motorized vehicles a lot of you guys gotta you can't be out there on those and there's tons of kids out there playing and swimming and these guys don't know what the heck they're doing they're learning how to do it and it's it's dangerous so i think that we you know might have to address boiling uh specifically or at least motorized that would follow a motorized vehicle and define foiling for everybody who doesn't know what it is so it's um it's a it's a wing surfer it's a pipe board um it's anything they have hydrofoils on them so they they go above the water and they can go very fast it just makes it uh it shortens the learning curve and it's a little easier to operate and you can go a lot faster but i don't think personally that they belong in an area where there's people swimming i know that i'm not going to hurt someone with my caliber but like he said about dave gaddis you know we're probably a little more conscientious than maybe some other people out there but those foilings dangerous so i think we need to at least look at that roger discussion it seems there um don't and so if we're trying to make it a safe community for everybody it just seems prudent that we would have buoys up so that motorcraft can't come in and accidentally get named because that just sets the safety zone but if you want to have access for somebody other cities do where they just have like a 20-foot wide area i don't really see that many comments 47th street i always had clever beach just recently and they actually had poles set in the water with those safety signs on so what is the difference between that and a buoy and maybe that could be a possibility and just have a permanent structure out there and then we're just replacing a sign and uh that we weren't going back and forth with the buoy issue it's something we're thinking of thank you thank you great shot 115 13th street i've lost track of exactly where we're going in this conversation but us coast guard um and there are florida state laws which direct how close power craft and power boats can come to the shore so i spent a lot of time on the water i do charters and i'm also a trainer we can put up all the signs we want and that isn't going to improve anyone's voting behavior so uh like uh vice mayor gaddis i think it would be nice to be able to idle in um since i owned a powerboat and pick up some friends family or whatever and use the water but you know people are going to do what people are going to do and we can put all the signs all the ways up there and we're still going to go flying through there so i'm not an advocate of laws and witnesses that can't be enforced um unless we have someone standing out there you know we're going to write down the fl number and then you can drive a deal the fwc marine control coast guard you're going to get no action out of undermanned understaffed and overworked and popular aid so the goal here is to try to protect swimmers i think there's also some responsibility on the swimmers part to be aware of what's going on so you know we're trying to cover ourselves from a legal standpoint we've got to do what we've got to do but understand our statutes there and put everything up and people are still going to drive the boats the way they drive the boats so i hope we can come to a reasonable agreement so that responsible voters can use remote something as simple as idle speed inside the moons like if you drive around clearwater beach in that area they have all kinds of very specific buoys there special purpose blues will show you what you can and can't do [Music] that's the council i tried to drive that home about the personal responsibility and the false sense of security and my analogy is the bike lanes on the bridge there that little thin painted line that says bike lane is not going to protect you all you got to do is look at the curbs here and look at the skate marks and go up on the curb there as you drive across the bridge and that drives all the point it's a false sense of security responsibility goes a long ways thanks glenn by the way i took you up on that offer i'll never run away on that bridge i mean there's marks all over the place you take your life into your hands but that aside where i was coming from with this thing and kind of got a little bit into other some discussions but right now the way i read this you really you know we heard some people they they have paddleboard um well you might want to take a rash out i have a kayak i've taken to the beach once okay but um you can't do that the way i read this okay so it's okay if that's what we wanted says council all watercraft all vessels are going to be prohibited and i'll argue that all of this stuff i'm not going to i don't think a little kid's raft is going to be a big issue but any other watercraft if you're sitting on it you're standing on it it's water crafted so if we want to say no to all of that which is probably what it says already but if we're going to continue with that that's fine we just need to know that's what we're voting for if we're if we want to have carved outs and like the captain is talking about you know there are places where there's designated stuff i've been to resorts where they have jet skis going off from the resort but it comes through in a certain area it doesn't come through anyway so and you're not going horizontal to the coastline you're coming straight in you're in fact if you do anything else they'll throw you out of the resort so it's you know it's just a question of what we want i don't want to over complicate it but i don't want to see somebody innocently taking a paddle board out and then they get nailed i understand enforcement is basically non-existent but it's still if you put it on the books it's a law and you know then you're subject to everything that goes with it okay i think that there are some valuable efforts made here that are needed just to bring us into compliance with our buoys but i think also it's a little gray and possibly a little overreaching i i think that this needs work let me read to you several things so that you everybody here understands what's being discussed in section 30-141 a which is the code provision we're dealing with it says designated there is created a designated safety zone within the corporate boundaries of the city extending 100 yards from the shoreline into the gulf of mexico and running parallel to the city's shoreline along the gulf of mexico the designated safety zone shall be a public bathing beach and all vessels of any type are prohibited from entering the marked area within the designated safety zone the the language that is in that provision and there's more later on but that that's the language that's consistent with the statute and the administrative code so let me go again to the administrative code and i'm going to read to you two of the categories that i had mentioned a few minutes ago first category is no power driven vessels that that is defined by all vessels equipped with any mechanical means a propulsion must turn off the mechanical means of propulsion and if possible to do so tilde raised the mechanical means of propulsion out of the water the use of any motor including an electric motor is prohibited the next one is no internal internal combustion motors or no motor zone which is all vessels equipped with internal combustion motors eg gasoline or diesel motors for propulsion must turn off the internal combustion motor and if possible to do so tilde raised the internal combustion motor out of the water the use of electric motors is not prohibited and in the underneath the provision for vessel exclusion zone they define manually propelled vessels only which is all vessels other than those propelled by oars paddles or boat or poles are prohibited from entering the marked area vessels equipped with sales or a mechanical means of propulsion may enter the marked area only if the sales or mechanical means of propulsion is not in use and if possible to do so the mechanical means of propulsion is tilted or raised out of the water so there are several different categories that you could select to to achieve whatever you want to achieve and your buoy will have to have a corresponding designation with it and if if you want to change it you certainly are able to do that the the thing that i will tell you then and i did several drafts of this uh document and sent it to the the agency ahead of time they gave us feedback two different times and what we were trying to do is present something that they had already approved so that if the council approved it then we knew you know hopefully that they would approve it the final time if y'all want to change it my suggestion would be to consider one of those other categories and instead of passing anything tonight give us direction on how you want to change it then lynn and i would revise it and send it back to them to to go through this again the one of the times that we sent it in or with the no vessel designation um they sent it back and said you know no vessels mean basically no vessels nothing so that is the most exclusive or exclusionary category and um the the practical comments that have been made i'm not going to discount at all those are practical comments and they're probably valid what you're trying to do is make whatever buoy designation you select consistent so that you comply with state law and you achieve what frank has been trying to achieve all along which is the highest degree of safety for the people in the community i mean and we can't fix this tonight because this is an ordinance change so it's been it's advertised it's put out so we would have to take this back to a work session if now when you were reading those different possibilities the third one i was listening to and i'm like yeah that's that's very good that's very reasonable it allows you to get that paddle board in the raft and it doesn't you know if you're if you've got a canoe with auroras you're good um but that's a lot to fit on my buoy you know so as opposed to no vessels so you know i don't want this to get over complicated because we don't like that right um but then you know we don't have to go we have to decide as a council whether how restricted we want to be i just think i'll take the vote on it tonight i think we've debated this quite a bit i mean again we can keep going around but if we're thinking about changing it we might want to either if we turn it down we'll go back to work session for more work i think we need to pass something but i don't know that i'm probably not going to vote for this the way it is because i think it is too over restrictive i i want to see i don't and i don't know dog in the fight but i saw a guy with an inflatable um paddleboard the other day and he was falling off it and he was having a fun time trying to stand up i'm like that looks like fun and i don't see that you should not be allowed to do that if you have common sense go away from people and go out and launch it on baylor beach we've got a lot of space there you know i go fishing sometimes i don't fish in the middle of the eastman or property i walk down three or four houses so i don't throw hooks into people's head i've been hooked with people that are less intelligent okay because they'll throw the stuff out um they don't care but you know again it goes back to responsibility to me it looks like it should go to a work session but we'll do what the council wants to do but we're coming around further again right i'd like to table this until other towns are subjected to the same procedures it can be tabled until somebody brings it back up that's we can't i mean anybody on the council can bring it back up in another another work session in motion so you can table it for tonight if you can get the votes but if that's what the motion you want to make an emotion we have a motion to table do we have a second um there's no debate on it uh patty let's let's take this one by voice if we will this is a motion to table if we do we'll table this to the next work section council member gunn remember doterra i'm council member slogan hi council member baker that concludes our regular agenda 12 do we have any unfinished business city attorney this may be controversial but i'll suggest that anyway on the inspiration of council member banker i recommended the council consider a policy for staff to wear relaxed clothing to city council meetings looks like he's pretty casual you can do that it's okay as long as you're comfortable that concludes my report thank you you know i do want to pick up on something that one of the citizens said um and i'm going to walk this line maybe because it's a little controversial i'm going to walk it as mayor of the town and not as a litigant in a wall seat so she brought up an issue we all know about this 60-ton crane that was in the parking lot 100 time how much you know when when i got the uh enhanced digital photo of it guess what they were taking up two two you hear the sheriff two handicap spots two they're not even supposed to be taking up one and i can't believe that nobody saw that so here's my situation as the mayor as a council member my responsibilities for the safety of the city and the adherence to our contracts and if you read the interlocal agreement which i probably have memorized at this point the interlocal agreement makes us at bellar beach indemnify belarushore for all liability that occurs on the 6th street 12th street and 18th street eastmans um there is no way a even if they have the right which is the topic of the lawsuit that we'll deal with in court but even if they have the right with that liability kick out like that to bel air beach there's no way any crane should ever be there there's no way nfl films should be there unless we're making our our uh people cleaning up the beach sign release there should have been a release and probably an insurance policy that named us as name beneficiary we could be talking serious death with a crime okay not to mention the fact that they broke one of the real rules you're not ever supposed to break i mean what if a person who had disability claims and comes to that beach there's a crane in their spot not cool so that's it aside but the the liability issue is a city issue we have it in our local agreement which we have agreed to pick up basically indemnify belair short if they're going to park cars there which they intend to do let me tell you they will park cars until next july when we get a decision in this lawsuit um they're going to keep parking their cars there so the question is we have an indemnification if somebody parks their maserati there or they block park their van from their mechanical company and it gets dented handling reads the bill and say lynn peters why are we doing that why so that's all i'm going to say it's a city liability issue i'm not going to vote on it if you bring something up anyway but you do have a liability i think you have a liability issue so i just want to toss it to you for thoughts comments research table it yeah i just want to bring it out a citizen broadcast you want me to tell anyone that if you've cared to it's just uh it was a die it was brought up and i thought it was a at the last meeting one of this topic was discussed and if the city council wants to give uh direction to me and i would suggest it a direction to myself from the city manager we would address the issue and we would write an appropriate letter asking for the other city to comply with the agreement and comply with their code provision if you all want to correct me to do that then that's fine i didn't ask for that i just want to be really clear because that's just what i'm supposed to do but i'm asking giving you a response to the yeah i remember i said i was going to walk a fine line so i'm going to keep walking that fine line i was asking strictly about city indemnification i'm worried about that we have an indemnification policy our expectation was that it was going to be better beach residents only the other city i can tell you i'm not letting any cat out of the bag the other city does not believe that they believe that irrespective of any ordinance they may have that they can let anyone use that lot that they feel like and they have i've got a whole bunch of litigation documents that prove they did it we've all witnessed it question is now that we've graduated to cranes and semis i was there for nfl films i got pictures of the trucks these we're not talking about little you know pickup trucks anymore not that i want to be hit by a pickup but these were big trucks and that surely was a big crane so um you know that's what we're dealing with the question is our indemnification for the city right now the way i read that liability it is solely our responsibility and is that something that's sitting well with us given the way things are going from a liability standpoint i don't know whether we'd tackle that thing somebody who said you know stop the interlocal agreement i don't think that's a good idea but we have a situation here where they're enjoying it and they're holding parties and they're holding fundraisers and they're holding you they have the way i mean you know so well i've read the indemnification provision a number of times i don't remember it off the top of my head in a verbatim way that i can give you what i would say is very specific legal advice on it other than um i i don't think the indemnification obligation is normally when you indemnify somebody it it relates to your action okay and if another city is doing something then i i really don't see it as broadly as you probably do but again having said that i think it is totally within reason to address a letter to the other city that has to deal with the lots and ask that they comply with the agreement and they comply with their own code provision those two things are completely reasonable in my opinion council yeah i was questioning the from the city manager later this is a good opportunity you know i think sight verse and restriction for the safe operation of wide-body aircraft are much bigger much heavier than those cranes and i know nothing about the operation of heavy equipment and cranes so my question is really you know we're talking about indemnification and responsibilities and who's in deep pocket my question is is when it comes to the operation and certification or licensing and permeating of these equipment what's there i mean when somebody shows up at our doorstep and says you know we need to bring in a crane to do something and we issue a permit do you ask for bonding and insurance and what is what is out there you know when somebody comes knocking on our door i imagine osha's involved in that stuff the state licensing boards are involved in that stuff and i imagine there's all kinds of other federal agencies that regulate and monitor the operation safe operation heavy equipment like that like they do the faa and that kind of thing but my question is is what is that or when things go very bad and they start looking at throwing lawsuits around what is the order i mean nothing protects us they're going to come after everybody but my question is what's who's who's at the head of that uh pyramid say when it comes to responsibility and fiscal uh liability well the owner of the crane has some responsibility and the operator and that may be two different people and whoever the contractor is i mean there's a number of potential defendants if something goes wrong if it's the city-owned lot then or it's in trust then there's potential liability there there's those things that happen forbid at a 100 pound or 120 ton train collat or uh crane collapsed there there's going to be plenty of defendants to go around and it i don't think it ignores to whoever allowed it to be done i mean my understanding the ukraine being there is one day the claim cranes suddenly there and i'm i'm not aware of the situation entirely other than it was brought up a city council meeting before so if they had a permit and the permit was issued from the other city the question would be was the the permit issue consistent with their code provision and with the trust document and i guess that's my point is this is a key learning point for us and we we don't even know what questions we probably should have had we don't know what we don't know and that's why i'm saying this is a key learning point where we need to go back and say what are those questions we should have been asking when somebody came in for a permit saying hey we need to bring in a piece of equipment well obviously we're learning some things here for the next program and are we archiving these lessons learned so i guess we need to go to the experts and the state regulators and that sort of thing and say hey what bonding is out there what should these people have when they come knocking on their doors and they need to move some equipment within our city glenn they didn't come knocking on our door that's the problem see if they came then you can fall to the city manager he typically i'm not sure he gets releases from everybody that he might you know allowed to go in there but um you know i think it's pretty clear and i i did not bring my inner local agreement but um i think you have it would you mind that you have a can i see that but i just asked my point my point is i mean we're making claims to controlling and having a jurisdiction over those parking access areas so when all the dust settles what should we be looking for when when we say we really are the owners or operators of those access areas right i mean we're not we're not going to i'm not i'm personally you guys can talk about who has the right to think i can't personally talk about that my position is legally extremely clear um but here's what i'm talking about and frank will come to you next okay i just want to read this this is thank you debbie on make sure i get this back to you okay so it's paragraph four of the interval and here's what it says patty this is not going in word for word i'm just going to read it into the record here for everybody it says to the extent permitted by law the city the city's us okay they're the town there this is the city the city will indemnify save and hold harmless the town is cut off but i think it says from all costs lie about damage loss liability and expense penalty and refined whatsoever that may arise from or claimed against the town by any person or persons for any injury to person or property or damage of whatever kind and character consequent to or arising from any use maintenance repairs alterations improvement whatsoever of or two lots 21 43 and 66 by the city and its residents and their i don't know this is age by agency uh and employees and an invitees except if same arises from the sole negligence of the officers agents or employees of the town that's what it says that's paragraph four so we kind of have a whole harmonica so if somebody's over there you know little child is riding a bicycle to the beach or walking there you know like walking to the beach and you know heavy crane crushes little kid um sure you're gonna sue the crane company but it looks like it comes back to bellar beach and that was that's what i was concerned about is this paragraph is paragraph four all this use whether whether it's our position is very clear they have no right to be there their own statute says that they have no right to be there their own statute says they can't have commercial vehicles that aside they did okay they did and so the question is is they're having a good time but at our expense potentially if somebody gets hurt and when i see that parties have been done and you know we want to want to close the gates early except when there's a party you know and then they stay up till 11 12 o'clock with a party and you know you can only imagine these people are coming back to the car in somewhat altered states maybe in some cases and we're identifying all of that that's my concern it's indemnity only i'll fight the rest of the battle for the city but i'm just concerned about indemnity i can't change what's in that agreement and i can't litigate that agreement so i just i don't want to i don't expect you to have an answer i'm just saying is this something we should have as a discussion that it counsels as a work session get some input from you and you know we had somebody said write a letter do we want to write a letter do you want to go you know you want something more formal we can discuss that in an open session but just bring it up today to know if we're going to throw it on the agenda for october well two points one the only thing i know about this situation is what i've been told at city council meetings so i am not going to take issue with anything that has been discussed other than to say i today um would like to make sure before i make any grand pronouncement about anything that that i have all the facts in front of me so that's one one point that to me is only prudent second point is you you norma you know you you read the provision and i accept the provision as what you stated but normally you don't get an independent indemnification um benefit from your own conduct okay so you know i that's that's a general statement of of a legal concept to council member guns point you know you can't change what's already happened but you can make sure that situation doesn't happen again and the way to make sure it doesn't happen again is for the council to give the city manager and i direction to address the situation so that's my answer listen um i disagree that this is so as broad as you say it is it talks about arising from use maintenance blah blah blah by the city and its residents and their agents employees and invitees the crane operator is not a city a resident it's agent or it's invitee so i can't see how we would be we would be required to indemnify them for that you're not indemnifying the crane operator you're invited you're the invitee is me and you who have a sticker to go and use that but i don't even need a sticker we live here to use that so we're the invitee that you have to identify so if i get hit in the head with the crane and paragraph four comes up you know anybody's gonna come up and say i'm the invite we're not identifying them it's not our behavior we're identifying against it someone else is well i think is illegal behavior but um that's debatable and i can just agree with you okay that's fine i mean bottom line is you're on notice there's potential liability questions what do you want to do about it we want to move it to the next work session that's you know that's where the likely spot would be to discuss it and see where the council wants to go if the council doesn't want to i can't participate in the discussion to leverage that thing but i can for liability and say i don't like this contract the way it's written right now i'm not going to take our city's responsibility for what i think are trespassers on that property we're indemnifying trespassing right now i don't like it well again i'm going to say to me the solution is for the council to give us some direction and that i'll give you an example of direction you could give city manager and city attorney put together a letter that you want to propose to address this situation and present it at the next uh city council workshop that that's a good start that way you'll have something specific it's in front of you you can review all the materials that are relevant and you can at that point give further direction to me that's a very reasonable it's incremental sometimes things need to be a lot faster but that's in two weeks away and you can certainly do it that way if you want they are not for point of clarification [Music] when the citizen supplied you with that interlocal agreement do we need to make a note in the minutes who supplied it and do we need to have a copy of the promise applied to the city clerk that was actually supplied that way we're getting actually what she gave you that's my question i read it in if you wanted to be read in the city met the clerk need the copy of the interlocal it's already a public document we don't need to create multiple copies of the same document anybody wants to read it it's right here but i'm handing it back to debbie it was not a gift to me um so i'm not archiving it you have this in political agreement in the possession of the city clerk so it's paragraph four that's what was represented to me i don't have my copy but i received my copy from the city clerk two years ago one of the first things i requested the deeds and these interlocal agreement but you're welcome to read it take a copy of it if you like where you're from um all right frank yeah getting back to mr gardner's remarks like um who's responsible i'm probably the only guy in the room i had a license to run cranes okay um i work for many crane outfits each one of them has an agreement that you sign that the customer signs before they even get out of the cab or make the first pick as we would call it and that takes away all the responsibilities mostly and they're all written different because they're all different companies but they're longer than an auto rental contract that you would sign and all the responsibility is on the renter and the line that that would go on because if the lot had a fall underneath it and it collapsed which the ground there was there was no there was no compaction test on that block i'm sure before that crane showed up right which most crane operators say hey what's the compaction level here all right they're just assuming that there's no fault underneath there there's a water line going around there so i i read that interlocal agreement saying that the town is not going to be responsible for anything whether we are responsible mr jordan we might have a point as mayor you may have a point bottom line is if you keep allowing equipment on those lots they're not going to do lots anymore they will tear them up and shred them who's going to repair it we are okay there's a sign on the 6th street lot that we supply the reclamation for the beautification and do all the tree trimming i i've been on this council 203 days now i am totally still confused on why we do all these expenses and get the middle finger forward it's in the inner local agreement we agreed to do all the many months yeah yeah but then we don't get to use it the way it's supposed to be written i can tell you why because we didn't have access before that that's that's basically that was the deal that's how we got access to that page you've had access since 1950 it's the beats i've got them in my lawsuit we have permanent and we can dispel this one you know and again i can only tell you because patty has the deeds too they're public records the deeds give every biller be dressed living east of the center line of belt boulevard the right to use those three laws in perpetuity they cannot be taken away from us so there's this misinformation like oh don't make them mad they're gonna take it away try okay that part is very clear in the in the deep okay we have the right to use it for beach invading purposes and what we're arguing about right now is that very narrow definition of what beach and baby purposes are some folks think that it gives you the right to bring a towel what the captain liner tell me you can bring a towel a blank a towel a chair and a glass of water that's pathetic but that's what you can bring to the beach okay others are saying well maybe you should be allowed to bring a few other things to it so it's really what that definition is but it goes all the way back the interlocal agreement was just to work it out and i see that the man who signed it is sitting right here okay mike kelly was our mayor back then so he we had access to those beaches going back 1948 1948 mike oh hang on one second we're i i would be permission to have you speak but i don't i would love to hear you hang on one second does the council we have a unique opportunity here mike kelly signed that agreement and probably can give us some inside information as to what was going on we we're on right now we're on city attorney business but if there's no objection i'd love to hear from him i don't know what he's going to say but i'd love to hear from any objection mr object uh kelly should actually put this on a work session to where we have more time and then we can invite uh mr kelly to that because i think it's just it's not even on the agenda for this evening and we've spent quite a bit of time on it so [Music] on many other options and other topics that are less important and it's only seven four you've gone to one and you have plenty of hours i'll make this real quick okay you were correct you were great mike kelly i missed his drive mayor that signed that foreign the key was the words you just said in perpetuity we've got it forever as residents to the use of that of those accesses and that's what they are it was done in harmony it was put together there was no fighting going on but in 1950 it is our um i won't say it's our right to use it um it was they own the land we get to use that's all there is to it questions i i understand i'm going to ask you another question why why would we sign something like that there had to be there had to be some there had to be some trade-off for us to accept full response maintenance yeah we maintained it it was done in good faith and that was before the gates were even there there was walls there i mean we were walking through there we weren't even sure we were driving through there we were walking through there um it came down to the park um got into some wars going on with who's really taking care of him who's putting the treats there who's this who's that and that's why the agreement was struck but historically was was referred back to when in 1950 we were given the right to use it it was just a re reaffirmation is a good word of what it really was and why we did it but it's big i mean the whole thing has been good what was your intention or understanding at the time you you keep saying access and use but you haven't used the word ownership fellowship is there there's the land is theirs we do not own it we get to use it we have the right to use it there was no dispute whatsoever in terms of the ownership and and that that's kind of where i was going this was that yes they own it but we were we were trying to work out something maybe a nice way of saying thank you i i don't know i don't know what we were doing there was no animosity there was no dispute since the charters took place it's bare land there's three lots over there they're saying welcome folks you can use it you maintain it i i have the benefit of having 50 years of history in my view of that there was a lot of atmospheres when they built those gates we were near a lawsuit we had three lawyers law firms um including tom trask as a young man um not tom traskell offered but tom trask is a lawyer making legal opinion sd ownership and stuff like that i don't even want to get into all that tom wasn't representing belarus no he was they were talking also about building a city hall on there which is clearly prohibited but yeah i actually have uh donald trump meetings anyway we're way off topic on it but the point is is that there was some back and forth on it and this was a compromise but um and you know the maintenance i think it makes sense to me because we have a city manager we have city dpw crew we didn't have a city manager back then but we had we were in the city but we had a dpw crew we had people who could do it they don't have the ability to maintain this stuff so it just made sense that we would take on the maintenance my only question is you know things have changed over time and now you know they weren't parking cranes their way back when and they weren't parking tractor trailers so that's mine was strictly a liability thing should we be indemnifying them and that we know that it's happening then it goes to what frank's point was which is the point i'm not going to participate in but does this council want to tell fred write that legal cease and desist letter maybe as a resident hearing what you're saying wholehearted i agree you should give fred absolutely tonight and do it and put him on notice it's nothing more than protection of our of our citizens i urge council right now to do a consensus vote to do it but there was no train update strictly maintenance there was some really irritable heart people on the board at the time they were creating wars real bad wars with what was going on between the two communities relative to the types of trees that were out there it was really stupid and the whole thing had to be calmed down we did no trainer whatsoever we just said we in the city will tell our people what to do what to put over there and how to maintain it and it was pretty simple it's only three pages long you know we didn't do a dictionary of information on this right but i urge you to tell those folks we can't do that tonight but it's going to come up on a work session and i'm going to recuse myself but i'm going to talk before i recuse myself that i don't think it means about it right there's a um i'll be happy to do it since i can't consent on that one only because of my legal situation so if you want to entertain it tonight um we can do it we're in city matt we're actually out of our regular agenda here so i'm going to say do it at your next meeting but you're going to chair i'm telling you in advance i have i can i am going to say something i have that right before we do it it's a consensus so i don't have to recuse myself but you get a real complexion and you can simplify it just tell them to do that that's my recommendation well it helps apply a little bit at those three lines there's i don't know if there's three plaques i know there's at least two plaques going back to like in the 60s um staying below shores ballard beach working together to improve these easements and there's plaques right when you go into the beach right there and they're still maintaining now mr chairman he said there was problems going back to when the gates were put in i guess that was like 16 or something like that but when i moved here in 14 i've never had we never eights go way back up they put them in we didn't do it okay they said this is the way it's gonna be i understand it does a bad look and i i don't understand how that bad blood had created because i've only been here since 14 um and i've never had a problem up until this beach shade inside it was all about maintenance and when people said that we're going to do what we're not going to do over here from our partner it was absurd but that's history too they they put the gates up because they chose to if they won't walk those gates they can yes we can use it that they can turn around and say we're going to put a three foot gate there and you can't drive here anymore and and we're going a lot so keep it simple keep it calm and bellar beach you can use it in perpetuity yeah and and i'm going to disagree with everybody about who owns it or not i mean i know it's on the tax partial bel air shores there's been no taxes ever paid on it um if you look at the uh language it'll actually clarify that for the name party on the tax partial bellar beach okay even though it's on that strip of land but um the deed i guess this goes back to the what came first the chicken or the egg i mean um 1950 i think we got we got chartered bellar beach those conveyances and deeds came with us from the bellerin beach improvement uh belair shores make it charter until 55 i believe they returned over three different names well it was the town held out yeah they the ownership resides with them but what their type of ownership is is different than the type of ownership that you or i have of a house it's not unfettered stuff they can't put a city call there and the way i read it and that's not just me but a lot of lawyers that i think are quite more talented than me when it comes to real estate law have read it that they hold that as trustee not to do whatever they want with and my backup for that and i'm not telling you anything folks so don't go call your friends and bail or show that enzo gave away the secret it's right in my complaint it's in their corporate formation they hold it as trustee that's why i agree with that that's why i'm trying to remove them as trustee we'll see if i'm right or not i don't know this is a whole business thank you very much thanks for the insight very nice to have you here with that this is a long way from what i started out with but let me give you some things to think about there are four relevant documents one of them is the trust document the other one is the interlocal agreement and then both the city of bel air beach and the town of bel air shore each have ordinances that relate to the beach access lots those are the four relevant things that should be considered having said that i don't think it is highly controversial that a letter be prepared and presented at the next workshop that points out that the two to me the two things that are easily identified as the crane and the issuance of permits and those be the examples that are put in the letter that lynn and i would put together and the council you all have divergent views on all sorts of things i would feel better presenting that letter to y'all in a workshop and then you have something specific to discuss and you can tweak the letter if you want or rip it to shreds and throw it out if you want to do that but at least you have something specific and to me the thing to do is to put the other city on notice for non-controversial things like comply with your own code provision and comply with the inter local agreement that obligates you to do certain things i don't think the obligation is a one-way street and i it would be my hope that if you presented that kind of a letter the other city would take it under consideration and hopefully we would get a resolution that would benefit everybody for the next work the work session will be scheduled then tell me if i'm running into anything holiday wise or problem wise the 18th of october is the monday is that it that works for everybody uh outside for me not for frank it doesn't have to be a monday we have flexibility because tuesday frank i'm going to be going that probably that whole week that's the problem um we can move it the [Music] i'm what's wrong with the i mean we've got a quorum right [Music] so is that much time but you all need to tell me what you want to do well i think i think you heard kind of i'm going to tell you when it comes to that letter i can't say a i think he's being proactive and he's looking for a consensus and i say i agree that's that's getting started so we have glenn and leslie you're good yeah i'm not going to say word i'm good yep good there you go yep robin okay you've got consensus okay with me then and i will put the leather together and it will be ready for the meeting on the 18th okay perfect okay sorry we got into a big discussion that by the way the longer city attorney wants to have anything else okay city manager yes mayor council uh i i did send after the 27th i did send a letter to bella shore about the movies but it appears we're going to do something different maybe but that's already been sent just to give you an update on the rescue funds that did come in uh originally we had to give them our first report on the 31st of october but that was changed last week to april 22 so much better and they didn't have the report format together anyway so uh for the work session next time we're going to bring up a clean copy of the site ordinance i'm also going to bring you some concepts of the size of the boards because i heard the signs because i i think what i heard i heard three by five two by four and you know they just get bigger so i'm going to bring something to the beam so you can actually see the size so patty's going to be on vacation next week so for the work session if you want to put anything on that agenda you need that agenda to buy new consultations the items that were tabled tonight left everybody all the items that got taken tonight automatically that's what's our parallel intent right so uh if you have anything else you want to add to it please give it to petty by noon on thursday it's thursday this thursday because she's going to be on vacation next week and you'll get the agenda it'll come out friday so she's going to be on vacation uh i'm sure you already noticed the speed monitor has been put at the bridge and over on boulevard and the county is uh working on the intersection changes and stuff so that's all i had and did they put a traffic camera on the bridge we noticed a new camera up in the middle of the bridge i don't know that they did but i'll ask that there's one up there yeah high yeah up high and like our side of the bridge it's all doing it okay yeah it's there's one up there maybe they're spying on us we gotta find out what they're doing here well we've talked to them about because we even had some more discussion about the intersection because they said well the traffic numbers are lower and this that the other one we're talking about september we're not talking about in july august eastern other times so they are going forward with the intersection changes that everybody talked about with the two left triangles to see if it helps but i did notice on gulf boulevard today going that way uh a lot of breaks so you know they're looking at it and they're paying attention so that's it do you know what happened last night in that intersection where uh it was shut down the entire intersection was shut down they didn't they completely closed traffic you had to go all the way around and get home well the reason i don't know is because uh captain line was out this week so usually he's the one that says what happens do you have any questions um yes um one of the citizens brought up that uh pumping the pond over here and that reminded me of something i've seen our city employees voting that pond it's it says pinellas county's property do we have do we charge them for pinellas county for that do we have permission to be on that property to load it what if somebody gets hurt over there knowing that since it's owned by them well no we don't get any money for agreement i can tell you if pinellas county maintained it it would be an example would probably be on east bay down on the south side of the retention pond we'd should be up to here because they'd only mow it every so often but no there's no painting that was many years ago then i had one other quick question what's going on on gulf boulevard and 9th street it's been torn up for two weeks here maybe three but yeah that was that was the damage the spectrum hit frontier's line and they had to wait for some parts involved and they filled them back in so i i think their work is pretty much done there of course spectrum's still working on golf boulevard to take the lines down but that that was a very long time coming i hope they had good insurance about this that was a lot of work those guys yeah as they dug it up okay thank you city clerk you're going on vacation question for the city clerk my interactions with the staff my question is as the public records estonia how many open public records requests are we sitting on and are we running into timeliness issues with these things yes right now i'm i'm not sure the exact number but i believe it's 12 open ones right now that's open okay we've closed a lot of them as far as timeliness yes because some of them are so there's so much involved in them and we're having to have the rit consultant he actually had to research and work with an experiment how to actually get what was being requested he's finally figured that out so now we have to do the process for each one okay so what's the giveaway plan and all of this stuff and uh how do we make this go away get better with it what's what's the time frame for this can't qualify what do you mean exactly well i mean you're sitting on opening polypropylene what's the issue what's the giveaway plan for solving the issue and moving forward and clearing off your accounting because you're busy and it's impacting your other duties yeah we don't have a program uh that will actually surge like some you know if you have a larger city have a program that will search and redact and everything else we don't have that so we're having to use a program that he found and it's a little bit cumbersome and so it takes longer and we just have to go through the process that's all we can do and then we have to physically look at each one and redact from there but we have to look at each one [Music] and as long as the city attorney has said that as long as we're making a good faith effort which we are i mean we work on it continuously um then we're complying and you know we try to get about as fast as we can because that's what we want we want people to be able to get the records they're asking for can i add something to that right quick sure basically if we hosted our own server we would not be having these problems it would be much faster and it leads me to wonder at what point is it not worth using cloud-based services with these record requests because that's what it boils down to you have to query those servers somehow and is that right yes that's what that's what he's doing okay so basically if we had the server in our possession we wouldn't be going through near the trouble now there's an overhead with keeping obviously keeping the server here on the side and maintaining it but the point is is that eventually we're going to hit a part we're going to hit this period where it's no longer worth using cloud-based services if we keep going through these public records requests especially for i have no idea what they're what they are with the nature of tomorrow if it's somebody that's uh served the city for many years or even three years i get a lot of email i'm sure everyone here does so i i can imagine three years i cannot imagine say 15 years and you know that's just my two cents on that something it's not only a technology-based issue right there's reimbursement issues and there was some concerns about getting the aging opinion on reimbursements where are we with that and how we're going to solve that issue well i brought that up to the council and fred and i had a short conversation today about that and patty has given some input that i'm going to send to fred we need to discuss you know the ramifications of the cost because we keep kind of running into a wall that says okay well we have a city email for everyone that's applied but then unfortunately some emails are handled privately they have their own email account and [Music] when a public records request comes in paddy sends that to whoever it is you know it doesn't matter if it's dave the mayor or whatever they have a private email account she sends that to them and uh we've had we have instances where people have asked for payment before they provide a public record well we've got two or three different versions of no you don't get paid yes you do get paid so i think going forward so we resolve this and once and for all and then the other question is what is the value of that payment uh i'm gonna use frank as an example because he made a set of email i think that you got 78 an hour or something okay so is that when he gets paid for providing a public record or is it something less and you know robert maybe she gets paid 300 an hour as a surgeon okay well this in the mayor's case i i don't know what his legal uh fee is but it's probably two or three hundred dollars an hour does he get paid for two or three months what i asked for no i understand that but i'm just saying in general so uh to clear this up i think it's incumbent to resolve it is ask the attorney general to give us some type of opinion on because the way the sunshine thing reads it says reasonable cost so what is reasonable cost it doesn't tell you that i mean the attorney general is not going to tell you either she's going to tell you that it's reasonable and well i think the question that i'm trying to get resolved is because we've received two or three different opinions is there payment for that or is there not payment for that that's what needs to be resolved really and that's that's kind of where i've talked to fred about you can discuss this at the work session i i know this book backwards and forward i wrote you the law on it i'll be happy to go through this again for probably fourth time the rules are crystal clear and they're not clear at all okay so it says reasonable and that's what the attorney general's going to say the county charge is i think 71 an hour so just full disclosure i was asking for 75 which is the absolute lowest rate i charge anybody and that's the state of new jersey and they pay their bills not everybody who's requested records pays the bills so um so if the county you know so we're not and the attorney general's opinion too i mean let's talk about this at the meeting but it's an opinion she's not the supreme court it's a legal opinion you have four lawyers with four opinions you'll have a fifth lawyer with a fifth opinion it's nothing but persuasive so if it's not gonna stop anything and we're gonna spend a lot of money i read the letter back and forth because i did request that letter and fred put a lot of work on that right at least so he was asked to do it so um so we can talk about it the next meeting when i brought it up we certainly can talk about it but um you know we just want to clear clear it up so patty has some guidance to go forward well you put into an issue though is if someone wants to use their private server their private email whatever they everyone here is provided with an email address if you choose not to use it well now we don't know what to do we don't know how to handle it and you know it's you we're always going to have one or two people that want a duck city business on some other type of email and that's where the problems start that's where it's too difficult to to nail down how do you pay somebody because you wouldn't have to pay them at all if they were using the city's mail service carroll doesn't use the city now i don't use the city email nobody on any one of the parks boards planning board or any others or even supplied with city emails so the email my city email has been hacked three times my personal one zero i'll stick with mine that's it it's real simple okay um and i have every right to use it and so is leslie and so does glenn if he chooses anybody else and we do know what to do it says that the person's an agency and the agency's allowed to charge a reasonable fee and if a requester has a problem with that i said this to a person one time who made a big issue and wrote a big letter i said this isn't the forum the city council can't help you with this the city manager and city attorney and city clerk they're just the messengers don't shoot them your avenue the book is clear you have to go to court and by the way if the person who says i'm going to do this is wrong you're about to get legal fees so by all means if somebody thinks it's wrong there's an avenue for that it's the court here in pinellas so take it to court that's the way you do it why we're spending a fortune on something that's really somebody else's responsibility it's i don't know why we're doing it really it's very easy what you do patty's done it with me several times i'm not sure about other people who have private servers but plenty of people have used private ones in the past it's completely your choice you know so but we can talk about it let's add it to the uh work session next time we'll give her comments and we'll see where we go if everybody has consensus that they want to go forward that's fine money try to be glad i can't see your face right um any comments from the city clerk questions city council comments we start with robin no comment no comments frank banker uh just at our last war session uh vice mayor dennis and you and we've been discussing a peaceful resolution in these meetings kudos to you tonight great and so is that work session anything [Music] thank you everybody for coming and thanks for
