wish to speak to council please come up there's rules of conduct all around these uh this room here i can summarize it in one sentence just basically speak to us the way we you know you'd have us speak with you just everybody be good and the christmas spirit will have a wonderful meeting with that i'm gonna open up the floor to citizen's comments yes sir uh tom ferraro 123 elite drive i've got exercise merchandise and passes out sure i don't know if i mentioned you have three minutes of time when you're up here we're not going to count the distribution okay so it starts now all right i told lynn i said i'll try to speak as fast as i can so again tom ferrara 123 elite drive so i'm here to ask the council to review reappraise the decision in 2018 about the fence heights and hedge heights on waterfront properties for the setbacks um i live at 1.3 litre drive i'm on the water we've lived there for 26 years we've enjoyed a wonderful view when you look out in the backyard left and right we had neighbors move in couple three years ago they planted some palm trees fairly close together on the other side of our wall they were low and if you look at the first picture on the deck that's the view we've had for 23 years if you look at the second picture on the deck that was about a year ago and if you look at the third picture that was two weeks ago you can see i don't think the intention of the ordinance change was to do that to us and i don't think it benefits everybody to do it but what happened is they got to the point where they were five feet and i went to talk to them about asking them to cut them down but i read the ordinance first and found out that they've been changed so it surprised me so i'm just asking if you guys i don't know what the process is to reconsider i'm happy to shepherd it through talk longer about it i think it's fairly evident from the pictures what i don't think was intended is happening but i'd like to ask us to look back at either lowering that or going back to where it was to be able to benefit this view when you live here on the water the idea of being able to see makes all the sense to me the idea that was boxed off with i think i even read the code that it's very definitive about what you can see and i just think that's wrong so anyway um i was on council in early 2000 i know you guys have got a lot of balancing you got to do but i think this is one that needs to be re-reviewed and i asked to do that spend um we've done this the last couple times i i'd love to give this gentleman an answer in how he would proceed with this he's asked a question and i don't want him to have to wait until it's our turn in the end um that would require a motion to dispense with the rules so that we can speak directly with him somebody make that motion motion by frank banker in a second anyone sorry okay i'll i'll address this at the end if you okay i'll can't it during council comments okay thank you any other citizens yes i didn't see you where i get to the endeavor mall [Music] 115 causeway um i'm here to talk about the lights beside the lights on the new sign they're very bright at night and i know that they come on at six and they go off at 10 but during the night once it's dark at 5 30 those white lights are crazy bright and i have pictures on my phone i can with my wide plantation shutter slats open i can see the sign all the way across from the other side of my house and the city's always been a good neighbor but that's just not good neighboring so i would like to suggest that the white the white lights get dimmed down at when i looked at tampa so the gentleman who was here and i sent you all that information from the city of tampa our lights are brighter than theirs and that's just crazy i have lightning roger and i have been over here measuring the lights uh it's it's it's about double what tampa's highest is so what their policy is is 30 minutes before sunset they dig down and then 30 minutes after sunrise then they go back up again and i think that um it has a sensor or something that can do that or it can be certainly i know it can be programmed to do that so um i would appreciate it if somebody could look into that right i'm gonna address it at the end also okay any other citizens yes sir mr mullen i think a little clarity so that that's a third as bright as the white digital lights and so i think that there's probably women probably know that there's some i'm sure there's some way to tweak the amount of wattage that goes into the brightness of those lights so that they can dim down to be the same as what the city will reach science is any other citizens seeing no other hands on close citizen comments and i'll move first somebody say something there patty is there a copy that was just somebody banging okay um next we're gonna move into the pinellas sheriff's office uh do we have a share we have two people here from the sheriff's office we have our code officer danny doherty and then we have law enforcement so danny you can go first okay danny dardy good first good evening everyone i presume everyone's got a copy of the code activity um just one note on there on the second page um i forgot to enter a date uh so under 11 22 in between those two c's which are complaints would be 11 23 21 at that on that line that should be next to 401 parker yes this was a short month due to the the holidays i was also in training i took a vacation a couple vacation dates so i only worked 15 days during the month of november during the month i had 89 items of activity which included follow-up investigations as well the primary actions or violations for activity are broken down into six categories number one with uh 14 i did 14 payment checks on construction related residences five code assessments on houses for sale to make sure there's no code violations and they're one none there were some landscaping basically overgrown harassing these five which were all corrected and along with uh junk and debris four and uh site degree requirements which is dumped through the covers of the total floor as well the final final activity there were six items of six incidents of boats with jet ski with trailers on the driveways and they were all corrected through communication if you have questions about any activity i'll have to answer them danny this is the second month now that you've went with the 20 hour work week how are you finding that so far stay busy um it's pretty much the same what i like about it is it's able to give me um more time to follow up and uh close the cases a lot quicker uh basically if i can't do it that day i'm finding a lot of success when i come back to work the following day instead of me throughout the week to interact with the citizens and get things taken care of and how's everything going here at headquarters everything going well in relation as well that's good good to hear that council any other questions citizens any questions for our code officer thank you very much have a very merry christmas okay thank you annelise county sheriff sheriff if i may before you start i have something i want to say now stand up there this is good this is real good um so the other day i'm like minding my own business in my house working on an appeal i think and i see one sheriff's car combined two sheriff's cars combined three sheriff's cars combined clear water comes by five more undercovers i'm like what is going on and i found out what was going on um for those who didn't know uh we had a little action finally in bel air beach right we had a bank robber from clearwater who decided to come this way that was a big mistake um turned down second street that was even a bigger mistake tangled with the wrong guy that was even a bigger mistake because the guy started fighting him and that by then all i saw on the report was that the sheriff's dog started like taking chunks out of him so great job really great job thanks for keeping us safe safest cities in the state of florida for living um nothing new to add outside of you know that happened just just the other day but as far as the past month there's nothing out of the ordinary or anything that involves any citizens within the city again most people are passing through using a bridge to go to clear water or to go back to largo or so that's usually where we catch most of the stuff it [Music] and looking over the october report we had six incidents like three larcenies and a couple of two assaults what do you know what that was all about or most most of the way that calls come out sometimes our call takers get them as they get dispatched to us um assaults they couple those in with disagreements or again you have the one commercial property in the city which is the resort up there and that is usually the only place that we have any incidences where there's any kind of paper you know people get into a domestic argument somebody from a neighboring room calls in i i mean for the year as the sheriff was saying we have 19 incidents of our year today from october most of us like nine assaults and there's like seven more cities which are the smaller things and a couple of burglaries which usually are car things so i mean yeah it's real safe thank god we never see anything in the first couple categories such as murder sex offenses and robberies so it's yeah it's really good you guys are doing great citizens are doing great keeping a good watch out for things so and that's a key component if you see something that doesn't look right by all means don't hesitate to call us that's what we're here for and you know if we have you as our eyes where we can't be on your your street or your avenue and we're doing our neighborhood controls if you call in it only takes a hot second for some of our cars from any rocks to come up or somebody to come across the beach you know so we we can get here quickly in a barrier so we definitely appreciate all the citizens giving us their their feedback and giving us tips and you know concerns about people you see driving through your neighborhood or something just a little right because that helps us do our job even better and provide you with the best quality law enforcement council we have any other comments or questions for the sheriff citizens yes sheriff i'm just going to have you just step right by that doorway kelly hear to speak and then you can answer his question hi i'm mike kelly 27 40 hibiscus drive west quick question maybe it'll be a monthly question since you guys have the uh hopeful right now has a double tournament delight if you have any fender vendors as of right now it's actually been a new point people are actually paying attention a lot better i think it threw people off um that being the major intersection the way it is it's kind of difficult to let people know that it's changed like in residential areas they had like a stop cycle before we stopped put up but i think that most people now have gotten used to it or at least they're paying attention to the lane workers but there haven't been any crashes that have increased or it's people haven't called it a problem we're hearing i'm hearing there's hesitancy on emerging and there's people that kind of getting into that after they've made the turn and they're getting there and they don't know what to do so let's keep our fingers crossed we may have to re-look at this after you know as we get a busier season here i think there was some confusion because there's an extra green light out there too i think we're going back there one thing i've noticed though is i have yet to see traffic backed up past the island you know everything's in front of that either now just like everything else you know courtesy goes a long way with your public drivers we have sergeant smith with us now the our last sergeant got transferred so this is sergeant smith who will now be out here working with the we've got our most exciting month that we've ever had like in the last 30 years welcome sergeant um [Music] have a presentation certificate get

best city leader possible so yeah if you would okay on behalf of uh all right we moved to the public gearing portion of the meeting this is item number five this is consideration of wharton's 21-02 an ordinance of the city council of the city of belarus beach florida providing for the amendment chapter 86 signs of the city code of ordinances providing for incorporation of recitals providing for the amendment of chapter 86 signs and city code of ordinances providing for a copy to be kept on file providing for severability providing for the repeal of all ordinances and conflict herewith and providing for an effective date this is the second reading we're going to have a motion please thank you motion by glam gun second that was a tie although let me it gave of seconds clinton my feeling and i expressed it before was that and i think there's some other opinions in here but i think we just uh i think the pendulum swung a little too far the other way it's comments about the green [Music] well i'm gonna do something i rarely do which is to change my opinion on that change in my opinion um i said to try and move this thing forward we put a lot of effort in fred ryder they put a tremendous amount of effort this is not for his lack of effort in any way shape or form um i had a conversation with fred the other day every time i look at this thing and it is 30 pages long i see something else and i know i'm not sure if everybody's reading every word of this thing it's hard sometimes when you get to the end but i called up fred i said fred i think we banned the american flag and we did okay and we bare and we banned your little security signs that drove around yesterday in the city there's like protected by adt we banned those two um glenn sometimes speaks of the law of unintended consequences and i think we may have hit it here i think this one needs a little bit more work um i'll make an offer to this council if they want it okay because i you know i am an attorney and i read through this stuff as an attorney does i'll be happy to sit with fred riley and try and clean this up but i have to join you i don't think this one is quite ready yet for us so i think i have to say we have to defer this at this point that's where i'm at council leslie um things that were in the previous sign ordinance that aren't in here that i think should be in here are the number of signs you can put on a property and the time you can put them on um you know so so much in front of an election date it says bail issues and qualified candidates may display temporary political signs we haven't even had qualifications for the next election and their signs up already you also don't have assignments right now so there's no sign organization in july of 2020 but i think i think it needs a little more work it does you know and i mean again i took a ride around our city yesterday and i mean people have welcome signs that's a nice thing to have on your house we'll be able to have that um you know you're not gonna be able to have go bucks you're not gonna be able to have that sign i don't think that's what we wanted um i think we do want to limit the signs as leslie said we want to have a certain limit i mean i think you aren't full of other than campaign time a yard full of science is kind of an eyesore but there's a happy medium over here and there's just a few things we missed i don't think this is that bad and it doesn't bother me that it's 30 pages long i just think there's a few more refinements that are necessary here i don't think this needs a lot of work to be ready for um for prime time but i think there's also gonna have to be a break-in period too because you know i don't want to see danny doherty charged with going out and ripping up welcome signs we're going to have a room full of people that are going to be very upset and rightfully so if uh i noticed that um that there's no there's no timeline as soon as you qualify you uh can have a sign out there that's around 90 days i don't know if everyone wants science for 90 days but i did see a problem with that i'm probably looking for clarification on the repeal i don't recall repealing an ordinance because it's still on the books i what i recall is choosing not to enforce the ordinance right so we have an ordinance we're just choosing not to adhere to it that's that's what i'm seeing um as far as this goes i agree it is overkill um i was prepared to vote for it anyway because we were pushed uh the 45 days someone called me about that earlier this evening i was on the fence and uh i'm going to have to vote against it just so we're clear i think i said repeal let me change my word there so our motion back on july 6th of 2020 actually motioned by dave gaddis said to temporarily suspend political sign enforcement for further consideration the reason why it was done um and instead reached the explanation here city manager reeves advised that this agenda item was generated by citizen complaints we had two citizens come in one complained about the city both complained about the city manager um asking to remove signs in one case removing the signs one gentleman was an attorney he was very nice but very firm in telling us what our liability could be and he said i want this to be a learning experience but i want you guys to fix this and we and he worked with fred reilly and we did this passed unanimously though i'm looking at this right now being data shirley swope aki gun and manzo all voted yes to do this so we're suspended on the sign ordinance okay i have and we need to clarify this whole thing politically because i've said it a million times when we're done and i don't want to debate too much tonight but you should have a right okay there's i'm not even going to mention the candidates but there's people who are favoring certain candidates for 2024. we've seen these banners in people's houses or signs in people's houses and if you want to urge your candidate to run for 2024 so be it you want to urge somebody to run for governor they may not be qualified in the sense that the commissioner has stamped it i mean there's a person we're supporting for congress right now and she hasn't qualified yet because qualifying has it opened but i'd love to put a sign saying i support so-and-so i don't think that's too much to ask i don't think it's too much to ask to say if you have a favorite you know thing if you want to just say you know whatever certain lives matter or what have you you have the right to put that sign as i drove around yesterday i think i saw one house that had two signs they had a um support the blue and some about a lawsuit that was i saw one house with two sides that's all i saw i mean this isn't a city there's not a lot of people that have a million signs so i i think we don't have to solve a problem that we don't have but i don't want to say to people you can't put a welcome sign out or let's go brandon sign if that's prerogative i mean you can put it out there if you want to it may not be what we want patty um on the line once he speaks she's recognized yeah can we make that a little louder so they can hear in the audience yeah i just wanted to make sure that i express my concern about other people with a legal background working with our city attorney on this we need only one attorney because that's what our city pays for and i'm concerned when you start to get too many people in there with different legal opinions and we need to go outside for different opinions and i'm all for that but i i don't agree with that part um i too have been around the city and there are a number of homes with a couple of signs in there uh more than just the one that you mentioned with back to blue and uh whatever other sign you stated but there are a lot of poems right now with multiple signs i too am getting calls and complains about these signs being up so early since nobody's actually fighting for them to run yet and so there are a lot of concerns from our citizens at the present time definitely a lot [Music] we're operating kind of in a vacuum right now i can go with the deform of this thing but i would i would throw out that i think we need to reinstate the old organs until we resolve this thing because it's it's ironic to me that well we don't have a 45-day limit anymore we're not quite there with the qualified candidates and we're operating in the classroom so i would given the circumstances we're getting close to the election i would like to go on record and say i'd like to reinvoke all aspects of the old sign organs until this gets resolved and we've kind of moved past the concerns we had from the old ordnance and we have some sensitivities to that and kind of know how to navigate those inconsistencies to bring back the old sign ordinance will require a resolution which we can't do on the fly tonight so we can do that um there's a matter of um of what you do with existing stuff don't go down this road you want to bring back the old one that's fine um we can bring the old sign ordinance back in but the old sign ordinance was exactly what i believe citizen al fanduel said he wanted fixed so i don't i wasn't privy to that discussion but a deal is a deal and if the deal was made that we were going to fix it and now he's bringing back and start enforcing it then we're not really living up to our market i wasn't privy to it city attorney was to address rita smoke's comment i offered my services free of charge to the city because i want to see this thing get done right if those services aren't wanted or appreciated no problem i have plenty of work so i offered it because i think sitting down with fred riley he and i could bang this thing out fairly quickly and bring you something that you will be able to vote for um i've been the one who's made the most comments on this thing because i'm looking at it from my legal perspective but we have another attorney on this council we can't both meet with him whoever wants to meet is fine with me i offered it's up to the council if you want to take it or not i will be hurt if you don't so i just wanted to offer it to my city cancel any other comments before i open it to the citizens yeah i think just for clarification purposes when we suspended the existing ordinance was that our resolution this was resolution 2020-11 resolution to city council city of bella beach florida related to section 86-65 political science code of ordinances fighting for findings providing for temporary suspension of the enforcement of section 86-65 coding ordinances providing for applicability and conflicts providing for an effective day providing for a sunset day providing for qualification temporary suspense signs that was it that's what we had and that was july 6th and it has been suspended ever since code enforcement has not happened i know i've seen you know signs that would probably violate the old ordnance that were in place and they weren't it wasn't being enforced and rightfully so we were at seven to zero so that's where we were at with this so so there were no conditions or constraints these are the minutes these are the minutes that patty had so i just pricked it out this page i don't have the uh you know we had what was behind it i didn't work that out but that's where we're at i would be in favor of cable menace or whatever the correct floor is and working on it i don't have a problem with any of you guys whoever wants to volunteer work with fred i mean i've never had a problem glenn when you've worked one-on-one with lynn or fred it doesn't matter your background if you're willing to take the time i wish i had more time to volunteer and do it but i don't so i appreciate when you guys do have the time to volunteer so if you haven't have a background where you can read through the lego momo jungle faster than me without having to think about everyone then i'm fine with that so i i do think there's some flaws in this um i had mentioned the number of signs um at the city council or at the work session and i had never seen it in there but um so that's something because otherwise you know on a corner lot you could technically put two one for each street but he said that that wasn't allowed but nothing in here says that so i think there are some new polls that need to be fixed i don't think we should throw it out just because it's long if not half the laws in order this in any city would be thrown out because of length size doesn't matter to me as far as a matter of pages and uh yeah i think we should table it and work on it fred's already put so much time into this i don't think we should lose momentum [Music] we should not throw the baby out of the bath water this is a good ordinance it covers most everything the problem is with it being the size that it is every time and this is me looking through it okay and i gotta think that citizens are gonna have the same kind of confusion i looked through it the other day i'm like oh my god i don't we consider a flag a sign you can't put american flag up or you certainly can't put a flag that says don't tread on me or green bay packers that's not what we intended we also your favorite sentence i love my chihuahua i still can't put that sign outside and i want to say that i can put mine i love my chihuahua now it's not my i love my chihuahua sign that's going to get this city in trouble you know what the signs are that are going to generate problems and somebody wants to say you know a christmas type sign and stuff like that a religious sign and we say it's not process prohibited or just a general sign you know whatever so-and-so is god whatever that's allowed on a regular basis and i think that's a total abridgement of your first amendment right i think if somebody puts that in they may very well be challenging you to do something we pull it out you know welcome to federal court this doesn't need a lot to fix it really doesn't i mean we could probably fix this with a few sentences i think um but we can't fix it on the fly you can't fix it when it's up for second reading so i would agree to table it uh you can reject it and then we can revive it that's the other thing i don't agree with going back to the old ordnance that's that's a problem arguments the outcome is exactly the same as if we don't take them to call the question let's clear this one off the books if you want to revive it and start over again do it let's call the question and then my follow-up to that is depending on which way this goes did we move back to the old organs can't pull the question until i open it to the citizens but we can call it after it comes back so we can make that motion after any other citizen any other council comments on the motion to table only well i would say instead of calling the question and voting on it it would be better to table it because i think you would kick it less farther down the road than if you completely get rid of it and start over so i think if you fix the problems you'll get to a solution a lot faster than starting over we've been edited how long now i mean you can use the existing as a template to go move forward still but you it still resets the clock you still need two readings yeah exactly the same i agree with you but why not do all that with this one instead of because i'm thinking my thinking is recall the question if it fails we go back to that starting but that gives us a reason to go back to the old board news in the end it all started because the whole organisms have flaws so again why are you going back to the beginning when we already realized that gaining was the problem and we've already made headway because we understand that's one person in time for it sorry robin thinks that i said i think doing that you're going farther back and you're wasting more time and you're talking about kicking the can down the road you're just pumping it down the inconsistencies are well loaded we understand how to navigate them we've played to those sensitivities and the living proof is the existing ordinance has been suspended for over a year and we have not had a crisis yeah but then you're talking about reinstating the old ordinance that if it wasn't stated the whole time we could have had crisis because i think we need to fill the bathroom we needed something in the interim it's taken us a year just to get to this point where we're still pushing the can down the road and we're operating right back you don't have a 45 day we don't have qualified candidates at least with the old ordinance we hit we can clear up some of these inconsistencies and look the more we've done all along we kind of pick and choose the major issues hypocrisy here because two months ago you didn't mention the 45 days of the 90 or the qualified candidates all of a sudden because a candidate you may not agree with has to sign up now you see a problem because i think this whole thing is being orchestrated to get around a qualified candidate if you excuse my perception of their situation on that because i'm the only candidate with signs i followed the law some people got like it when you follow the law but i followed the existing law for 45 days is absolutely unconstitutional okay so if you want to stick to a 45 day by all means do it but the signs that are out are not coming down period that's my position take them down deal with the consequences it's an election tampering so don't go back to your whole thing because that's exactly what got us in trouble the first time anyway this is a motion to table let's let's just talk about whether we should table it or not table it and then because i think we're getting into a discussion of the ordinance itself so right now what's on here is should we table it speak in favor of tabling it we're not in favor of tabling it and we've all went a few times so i'm going to recognize dick gas okay um first off i'd like to apologize to all of you for the mistake that we made um you shouldn't have to look at signs for 105 days that's how long they're going to be out there and everyone's alone it's not vel our beach this is not what we came here for 45 days 60 days whatever 105 days that you're going to see one candidate science out there on lawns i'm going to uh i'm going to vote one way on this and no matter what the outcome is not going to fix the problem i think that i agree with mr gunn i think it was intentional um welcome to bel air beach so what they'll have you believe is that back on july 6 2020 i knew i was gonna run for mayor again now if any of you knew me okay you knew that that decision wasn't made until i saw the halloween spectacle out on the patio in the back okay i didn't make my mind up and you could ask anybody who knows me as june vancoy as debbie maul as rick shock they're all in the audience tonight come on up here and tell me if i'm lying i had no idea in july of 2020 this was no great game plan i will tell you that 45 days is unconstitutional it's arbitrary and capricious particularly when you let certain supporters put trunk banners that covered their roof and were visible from clear water and didn't say a word and didn't have the you know what's to enforce the law had another put trump 2024 banners in uh 2024 signs on his property i don't know mr trump qualified for 2024 yet i don't believe so so cut the nonsense folks this is about tabling i want a discussion right now on whether it's your table or not you can come back to the ordinance if it survives the motion to table yes we're tabling no we're not tabling speak only in favor of that please let's keep this discussion where it has to be and if it survives the most of the table then we'll come and vote on the ordinance roberts made this who hasn't spoken i want to get those opinions if anyone else wants to go is there a motion to table right now it's not debatable no it's not it is absolutely debatable motion to table is just one second postpone the discussion for a certain time you need a second and it says it's debatable that's what my chart says and i need a majority to approve it so look at it i mean this is my cheat sheet if you want to look at it we can call and look up the actual rules of order i mean if you want to stop the meeting for it i mean do we have much more discussion on motion to table citizens counsel patty take a voice vote on motion to table yes vote will table this indefinitely um until revived no vote will not take what we'll consider and we'll bring it to a vote um on the ordinance itself secondary yes oh i'm sorry yes on tabling only yeah you can speak in favor of tabling or not in favor of tabling you'll leave carol and um first i have a question you can answer at the end where in the ordinance does it say about qualifications because i've read through it and i must have missed it and i could not find anything i said about being qualified for the 45 days um but nonetheless i do agree that it has to be take they should be tabled um it is i'm personally really offended by some of the discussion tonight um the council thinks they are to tell me that i cannot have a sign more than 45 days on my lawn if it meets the other requirements just because you don't happen to have been ready or you didn't put your sign up i if i'm ready and the sign meets over qualification and it's a political sign i should be allowed to put it up now if you as a council suspended this ordinance from this year because you were pending a lawsuit a possible lawsuit because it was unconstitutional then this is your result fix it complete it and put it in going back to the old ornaments is about as ridiculous as i can i can even think i'm offended that we're wasting so much time going back and forth and the hint about conspiracy please point of order that's the point of order point of order what does that mean hang on we have a point of order i don't know where the conspiracy came from it has nothing to do with tabling this motion i don't find the point of order that there's yes let's stick to tabling it um but there's nothing wrong with saying conspiracy or addressing comment that was made but the comment right now is just one tabling so let's just talk about today okay wonderful john hansen john hanson 22nd street i'm your favorite table in this i've read through it it's still broken it needs to be fixed but i'm going to concur with the previous speaker you're not going to take my first amendment rights no way no how over my dead body i fly a flag 24 7. i have the right to put a sign in my yard even if it's above the eastman you can't tell me i can't do that you can tell me size whatever you and nobody else will take my first amendment rights away my constitutional rights that i defended for you thank you juventus numerous times i've heard this mayor offered his legal services to work with the city attorney and this council has continuously voting to try to stop them but yet they keep saying oh it's the bills the bills the bills but how many hours have we sat here on this particular issue how much legal time have we spent on fred riley when this could have been settled and figured out within three hours how much money have we paid the city attorney to work on this ordinance when you have you have the the city's mayor who's an attorney willing to sit down with the city attorney work this out and it still comes in front of the council for voting on i don't understand what the issue here is other than trying to play politics okay this is all about saving all these people tax dollars tax dollars instead of trying to be power struggles tax dollars remember that everyone tax dollars thank you thank you any other citizen comments yes tony galbo 2228 in auto drive you know we've had a tradition here of with that 40-day 45-day limit i think it would be beneficial to the city if the candidates whoever they end up being would agree that perhaps it's in the best interest of the city of its citizens to abide by that 45 day whether it's on the books or not because it's a respectful thing to do for this city as opposed to hey it's not the law it is the law and i'm going to do whatever i want to do stick with the 45 days for the citizens sake no one wants to see for signs months whatever it is thank you mr gatlin anyone else i've never spoken to you in the past but this past two questions including the wrong um in hearing you tonight you're telling me that two citizens came up and complained one of which was an attorney and you changed an argument without renewal we changed our whole organs because two people complained of the entire state and was at attorney and natural system thank you anyone else i have a gentleman in the back here how do you are you going back to rita i believe so i'm not on council at this point in citizens just trying to get your attention okay we'll come back to her go ahead sir david cardella 705 harbor drive happened to be the fire commissioner of water beach uh i would like to just say mr gavin said we have some civility here we can have the two candidates or whoever is going to be running for an election abide by the 45 day i mean i find that ironic you live in a city you can't put a boat trailer in your front yard you can't put an rv in your front yard you can't park on the street we're going to allow littering basically for three four months of every four year election cycle and that's excessive whether it's 45 days 30 days 60 days we've got to come up with something other than what we are able to do at this point it just goes against what you expect it's a city of bellerin beach to provide for its residents that's all i want to say thank you anyone else there'll be more i'm in favor of tabling this i'm a little bit disappointed because you guys are all focusing on political signs there's much more involved in our community than just political signs and y'all did this with the sign you put out front nobody stopped to think oh we put a digital sign in front of city hall now what have we done we've opened up pandora's box we're again being very short-sighted and you all are only thinking about the political signs we live here 365 days a year and we need a sign ordinance that covers all of that and the gentleman by the way [Music] because i've spoken with him uh because he was originally helping rick and myself with the umbrella suit before you filed yours mr mayor he is a constitutional law attorney and he is a resident of our city and he's a very brilliant man so he knows from whence he speaks and i think we should be listening to him and i don't think that we should um bring back the old motion because we're gonna be old statue we're going to be in legal trouble there if we do that and we'll just make more work but i want you all to quit discussing i think that the qualification period ends december is december 15th what are we nine days ten days away from that you all need to look beyond ten days for heaven's sake thank you thank you anyone else i'm gonna bring back to the council did rita want to speak go to her first she had her hand up this is on tabling now so let's confine this discussion to tabling you're in for or against tabling i want to get this question [Music] i would say that i love to listen to the citizens and they seem to all favor tabling as if there's something wrong we need to fix it so i think we should honor what the citizens are saying and say that they're we may not like the ordinance we have now there may need to be things added there may be things taken away but the problem is it's not ready right now so whatever that is we need to fix it and that's what table needs to do i'm in favor of your total emotion i'm not in favor of going back to the 40 to the old thing there's no such 45 day rule that's a construct of bel air beach wake up people wake up you're coming up here and giving away your first amendment rights that guys like john hansen fought for and some of his comrades died for you're giving that up city has one lawsuit on on trampling of federal rights and you want to have more taking signs out of the ground we got in this trouble because our city manager went out and ripped signs out of the ground political signs that's how we got there mayor i want to make one thing i did not take any more signs i it was a complaint that was made you keep saying i took somebody's signs i didn't take anybody's signs i went to the individual as the jet told the gentleman the code and explained to him that there was a complaint and there was a 45 day i have never touched anyone's sides but you continue to say that so make sure you have your facts before you say something okay here's a fact under color of title you asked him to remove a sign and under threat of the code that's a federal 1983 offense and that's what mr athen duos was going to sue us for i don't know the man i've never met him and i don't think i ever spoke with him although i do think he came to our council meeting once but i didn't speak to him directly i don't know i wouldn't know if he was here tonight but that's what got us the table is along with mr levitz who twice was told to remove his signs and when they told him to take one side out he put two in and that's courage so i'm on four table let's anybody else want a table this is before i'm going to call this what's a voice vote i want people to go on record on this one so i'm not a single i call the role i'm sorry patty anyone else before we bring it well robin has the last word of so here we have a motion to table this motion table will postpone this um item five indefinitely until it's revived and then i will ask you afterwards if you wish for me as glenn gunn does all the time to work with the city manager do you want me to work free of charge with your city attorney if the answer is no believe me i'm not hurt i got a lot to do right now patty gentry please call the role yes vote tables it council member occu yes council member banker yes councilmember gunn name councilmember otero yes councilmember slope vice mayor gavis yes mayor ransom yes so it passes the table uh passes five to two it's not an agenda item i made an offer i'd like it uh to know how people wish for me to proceed if you wish for me to proceed i will i will work with the city manager and try to clean this up before our next council session which is in january providing he has the time that's free of charge my donation to the city of bellar beach because i love you patty call the role that's my offer to um to help the city attorney fix this and fix any deficiencies another question yes are you going to shorten it i hope if you work out i'll do my best i i've heard your comments and you know i respect them and will do what we can do i think maybe some of this we might be able to put into the resolution itself and take out that's just i think we might be able to do that mr riley and not you know some of the law and stuff like that we'll see i'll do my best and i don't guarantee you i'll have it done for january 1st but i'm going to do my best okay yeah just yes no you want me to help or not it's real simple yes councilmember banker yes councilmember gunn name councilmember otero nay council member slope vice mayor gavis hey mayor manzo uh yes so it's four to three against and um fred you're on your own i tried okay so you can revise it if you wish we'll meet with this again um typically what we do if we're going to revise an ordinance we meet in a work session first and then bring it out there's no more work sessions this year so um the next work session will be in january probably mid month sometime and then we will take it um to the i guess the february meeting in the meantime if anybody wants to try and revive the old one be my guest you better be talking about what you're going to do with the existing stuff too that's just a suggestion not a request okay that concludes item five anybody need a break for one hour in good item six consideration of ordinance 21-08 ordinance of the city council of the city of bellar beach florida providing for amendment to section 2-63-d of the city code of ordinance is pertaining to addressing the city council providing for incorporation of recitals providing for approval of an amendment to section 2-63-d of the city code ordinances providing for a copy to be kept on file providing for separability providing for the repeal of all ordinances in conflict with here herewith and providing for an effective date this is the second reading this is a discussion depending this is regarding discussion of pending litigation and prospective litigation in council sessions first motion so moved by data second second by leslie and terrell it's open for discussion yes motion the table motion to table okay um second on the motion table 12 seconds okay uh discussion glenn i saw you looking at roberts did anything change from my understanding okay so we do have discussions you know of him before we have to take a call time out and research it you have a parliamentarian in the massachusetts there is debatable and would you speak into the microphone it is so the parliamentarian john hansen is saying it's debatable are we accepting it folks i can stop the meeting for five minutes and we can look through the book it's not that hard or ten minutes i mean i i don't want to have any proper discussion but i don't want to cut off a discussion so well you just had a discussion on for half an hour on a motion to table so i at the least i'd say be consistent okay if you want to be a thousand percent sure then stop the meeting and we'll look at the robert's rules and we'll clarify it that's that's the thing thing to do right i would go for act consistent with what you've done this evening let's do it that way okay that's my suggestion for the next time to the entire council so if dave get us making the motion and the navy is making a motion to table it so dave goddess you have the floor i have no comment anyone anyone else on motion to table yes yes i just looked up um robert's rules of order for dummy emotions to lay on the table i take offense at that guy it isn't debatable it is not debatable all right so let's that's it then it's not debatable we have motion to table um patty pulled a roll on that one council member gun name council member name council member spoke hi councilmember aki name councilmember baker vice mayor gavin hi mayor manzo so it fails five to two we'll have discussion back to dave gasps okay um i will stand behind my initial [Music] the initial authoring of this i think that discussing pending and perspective litigation is inappropriate in a public forum i think that it puts us in danger and i'm going to vote for this anyone else i would so the reason why this is here is because in my legal opinion the existing rule that we have is unconstitutional and why is it unconstitutional i explained this at the work session explained this last time and amazingly some people said yeah i hear you but i don't trust you you should trust me because i'm going to read you the federal law in a second um the audience the citizens are permitted to speak about pending litigation this is what's known as a limited public forum and i'll keep my constitutional law class real brief it's a limited public forum if you notice you come in here there's certain rules okay you can't hold up a sign for instance we could make those rules you could hold up a sign on the sidewalk but it can't be here you can't come in here and swear and curse and yell you can't do that right even we do that we get in trouble we get points of order all right citizens have spoken about pending litigation in a public forum they've come to that mic and spoke yet people up here are squelched i didn't we didn't make this law this council did not make this law this goes way back okay it was bad law then it's a bad law now it's unconstitutional this emanates from the fact that i wanted to make a motion regarding pending litigation i was told i can't do it but it was a violation and everything in the world was going to happen to me i'm a lawyer i could get disbarred if i start breaking ordinances and rules i wasn't going to test it i am going to test the law legally because this is not good you do not lose your rights when you come up here and i've been preaching this for three years now you do not give away your rights when you become an elected official i have just as much rights to speak on the issue as you do now there's a thing called strict scrutiny when you take away first amendment right there's scrutiny what that says is it has to be a compelling government interest narrowly tailored law to achieve that goal compelling government interest like we can't live without it you know our compelling government interest was folks this might cost us money you might say the wrong thing but our city manager went out and gave an interview to the newspaper and said the wrong thing does this deeper in my opinion and guess what he's not prohibited from doing that and we could go out and give an interview with the newspaper but we can't speak in here the public forum that we chair that's wrong it's not like wrong it's illegal patty add this again to the verbatim okay i can give you a copy of it if you'd like okay so here's what the federal law states well you go from here patty section 1983 civil action for deprivation of rights every person who under color of any statute ordinance regulation custom or usage of any state or territory of the district of columbia subjects or causes to be subjected to any citizen of the united states or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights privileges or immunities secured by the constitutional laws shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law suit inequity or other proper proceeding for redress end quote end of what goes into it statement you're violating the federal law i am your mayor these are our council members here's our vice mayor they have every right to speak about a lawsuit the compromise what i wanted was to say that the city attorney if we're going to speak should give us a warning just to remind us that kind of like the miranda warnings anything you say can will and will be held against you or can help against this city that's what we're asking for but what we've got here on this thing doesn't fix that problem it still prohibits us in fact in passing this ordinance we all broke the law not too long ago when we had a lawsuit here and we had what was known as a chain meeting because according to our current procedure we're not allowed to discuss lawsuits we all wrote law our organs i mean this is beyond ridiculous john hanzik i can salute you you come up here and you say that you fought and died your friends fought and died for this you did too and we're giving these rights away we're banning people from speaking this isn't china this isn't north korea this isn't some third world republic this is bellar beach united states of america we're going to repeal this law one way or the other i'm begging you and i don't beg anyone to do it the easy way and repeal the law tonight's motion should be we pass the first time this needs to be defeated you will not correct the problem by passing item six you will continue to have an illegal law on your books i have been victimized by this law and anyone else who comes up here who wants to speak on this council will be victimized by it i cannot and will not let that stand in my city because the next group of people that are coming up here will be subject to this same bad law number six needs to be voted no and i would like to ask why you think not passing this is better than passing it whenever you clearly see if we broke the law during a shade meeting and this ordinance will allow us to have that shade meeting but you're saying no no don't don't pass it at all um keep it the way that it is it doesn't make any sense at all um i i i'm still your question you can't be a little bit pregnant okay this thing is still unconstitutional for the reasons i just gave yes we could have a shade meeting and we still can't speak about litigation but citizens can come up here and speak about it we have the right to rebut citizens or give them additional information somebody came before ask some questions we're going to i'm going to answer your questions at the end of the night i'm sorry you have to wait this long i'm just trying to do it quicker but we have the right to rebut what you said up here anytime you have an imbalance where one group in the same venue can do stuff and another group can't do it i mean you don't have to go to law school to know that that's not right that's what's wrong with it dave it's unconstitutional and the reason why you want to do it is to save money let me quote glenn gunn who said it not once but twice we have insurance for this that's our attitude here we have insurance for it so what are you worried about if we have insurance what are you worried that i'm going to say the wrong thing or i'm going to say something you don't like now see that's suppression of free speech folks and i'll fight to the death for that because i never served i never had the privilege of serving in the armed forces but that's what the people did okay i'll be damned if i'm going to just give that a right away i'm not giving any of my amendment rights away i'm not doing that yeah i'm saying you're making it far more difficult than it has to be you have two choices um you don't like either one uh you there's no third option until this vote goes one way or the other right repeal the law that's it's real soon repeal the law you don't need this law this is a vestige of prior administrations prior city attorney no one in this room has any hands in this that i know of okay i mean leslie i don't know when this passed so i'm not sure you you have quite a history on council but i think this past i think this is even before you started with council this is an old this is an old law and it's a bad law it's just one of many but it's a bad law you get rid of it you don't try and fix it it's no good you're not going to make it constitutional by saying that was shade meaning we still have the problem i don't have a motion i want to bring it concerns you concerns readers concerns claim gun and i can't bring that motion and i've been trying to bring that motion since october and i have a letter from the city attorney threatening me that don't bring it i gotta advise you don't bring it that's what it says basically it's a public record ask for it you can get it i didn't give you a copy so how can i tell you that's okay yes it talks about discussing pending litigation in accordance with section 286 i mean 0 1 8 of florida statute which says notwithstanding the predictions of subsection 1 which talks about open meetings any border commission of any state agency or authority maybe in front of the entity's attorney to discuss pending litigation to which the entity is presently a party before a court or administrative agency providing that the following conditions are met the entity's attorney shall advise the entity at a public meeting that he or she desires advice concerning the litigation the subject matter of the meeting shall be confined to the settlement or negotiations or strategy sessions related to litigation expenditures entire sec section session cell being recorded by a court reporter so there's nothing unconstitutional about not discussing litigation in an open meeting it's perfect provided under the state foreign statutes that we could have that's not what i'm saying that's not what i'm saying leslie i totally agree what you just read that's the shay ordinance that provo okay so for everybody in the citizens everything we do we can i can't pick up the telephone and call frank banker and say frank let's talk about tuesday's meeting or monday's meeting i can't do it it's illegal okay he can't do it to me everything we do under florida law has to be done in public which is why we have these extended debates because we can't talk on the outside okay there is a time and it's very very narrow which leslie batero just read that we can go in the conference room or actually dismiss the the citizens for a temporary basis bring the court reporter and speak about something and that's a lawsuit litigation um that's pending settling um strategy that we can do okay that makes sense right because if i had to discuss this with everybody here in public like our you know opponents would know exactly what we're thinking which is not a good idea that's not what i'm talking about although that's illegal right now okay that needs to be corrected okay because we can't have that shade meeting even though the floor get this folks the florida senate and legislature gives us the right to have it and bellar beach said now we don't want to do that why do you think they gave that to you they gave that to you so you could settle litigation okay that's not the problem the problem is we're still leaving this the provision here where the citizens can come in and speak about a lawsuit and we can't say a word this is a limited public forum we all have the same rights here we all play pretty much by the same rules we have unlimited time we limit the citizens time that's actually constitutional but if a citizen comes up and wants to speak about well we have a citizen speaking about growth and and palm trees that are too high we have the right to rebut that well why can't we do it on lawsuit again the answer given the compelling state reason is oh you might say the wrong word and um get us into a lawsuit or make the lawsuit worse we got into the lawsuit because people said the wrong words okay not this lawsuit i'm not talking anyone in particular that's how he got to a lawsuit because somebody said the wrong words in the city or did something wrong so if somebody comes up here and speaks about something we have the right to speak back and yes i we were going to put a provision where the city attorney should just read the warning to us saying if you're going to speak think twice before what comes out of your mouth because you might hurt the city i don't think anybody wants to hurt the city without her to sabotage the city we're sure as he'll have that right if a citizen comes up here and speaks about it we have that right and if you don't see that then you don't understand the constitution you're violating the oath you swore when you swore into a position to uphold the constitution first amendment right freedom of speech and i will tell you there's no higher right than the freedom of political speech and the freedom of religious speech so watch it when you travel close counseling so to me i agree with uh everybody should have the right to speak just because you have the right to speak doesn't mean you should that's a personal thing but everybody should still have the right so i'm all for that part of it um to have the right to speak i'm also i think we need to fix that problem with the shade that we should have be able to have a shade if we need it even if we never use that so this i think also needs work um i never already shut down the bush and tablet so i guess in that case we'd have to vote no on it and then put it back on drawing board is that the process just to clarify for me yeah but here's my take on this okay we got an election coming up here i may or may not be sitting in this chair after march you're running out the clock on me i'm not gonna get to bring this emotion because if we table this or we don't fix this and we don't repeal this and i can't bring that motion no one can bring that motion as a citizen so i've already been stopped from bringing the motion and this is a unique situation folks because no one no citizen could ever challenge this at this point only somebody up here who's been denied their right to speak and in your case it's yours truly who's been denied the right to speak i don't like that i did not and i've said this before sign away my rights when i became mayor council member vice mayor we didn't sign away our rights i don't give up any rights i don't know what else to say this needs six does not correct the problem it is not acceptable to me still can't bring the motion but we will vote for it tonight yay or nay uh yes i would actually like to hear from our city attorney and get his legal advice on it because we're hearing a lot of other stuff but since uh he's our actual attorney for the entire city i'd like to hear from him okay i'm going to have glenn gunn that i'm going to move to city attorney glenn dunn i just wanted to say that in my 26 years as a military master chief uncle sam tried to cash my check no less than four times and i would be at the head in line or with you to protect personality rights i'm not quite sure we're at that abyss right now my statements about insurance is because that gives us the freedom to make decisions without being pressured and that's we do our best to make informed conscious intelligent decisions and not be swayed or pressured by threats of legal action or whatever and that's where i made it thank you fred riley i would like to make several comments first the the measure that's before the council this evening was changed on first reading it was changed to uh include the prohib prohibition against prospective litigation so to fully understand this you you have to understand a couple of things one the the original version of this referred to pending or respective litigation okay the state law authorizes as has been said the a shade meeting which is what is called for in section 286.0118 the effort in trying to revise this was to make the city's ordinance consistent with the state law and make it and clarify that so there was absolutely clarity that you you can meet the shade meeting i i will disagree with mayor manzo that the previous shane meeting was illegal i don't think it was illegal i think it was consistent with state law and you know i i will not backtrack from that one having said that the original version of this allowed you as a council if this was passed to discuss prospective litigation the stumbling block and the discussion this evening is about prospective litigation so i'm going to say several things related to just prospective litigation the first one is prospective litigation it is a beauty in the eye of the beholder type concept if there's a dangerous condition that somebody becomes aware of is that prospective litigation arguably it is that's different from somebody got hurt and because they stumbled on a city piece of property and they broke their arm and now they may file a lawsuit against the city the difference is once one's a dangerous condition the other is somebody got hurt in an accident because potentially due to a condition that the city you know didn't correct the the object of the original version that i presented was to give the council the ability to discuss things so that as a principle the principle thing i was focused on was how do you address as a council the potential for there to be problems that you people see and you're taking some action so that you can prevent a dangerous condition to me that's a very uh good sense type approach to doing things the the prohibition part that was in the original code provision is arguably is a unconstitutional restriction and i i would say in all likelihood it is a bit unconstitutional restriction because you are prohibiting something and the the first amendment is is very much dependent on being able to discuss ideas in the marketplace and this is one of the principal marketplaces in the constitution envisions is there to be a discussion of ideas in a public setting and the best ideal wins that's that's the foundation of constitutional or first amendment law so i i'm not uh particularly receptive to the the current version of this that that includes prohibiting prospective litigation the the original or the version that i submitted before was changed would allow prospective litigation to be discussed and there would be a a warning of sorts from the city attorney about making admissions against interest so let me go back to my two examples you have no accident and you have a dangerous condition and the council wants to discuss what action should be taken because there's a dangerous condition that that should be a freewheeling discussion because nothing's happened yet second example is somebody tripped on a the the carpet that was um actually they tripped on my cord because i didn't put the chair there okay and i was negligent in not putting the chair there anybody that's been to these meetings knows every meeting i put that chair there so but somebody tripped because i didn't i had a lapse of memory i didn't put the chair there and somebody fell and hurt them broke their arm well now the discussion is it takes a different light because you have an actual accident an actual injury and potential liability for the city so in that case the object of having a warning to the city council is so that you you don't have people making what would be interpreted as missions against interest in a public meeting and that that's the policy thing that you're trying to prevent the question was raised when this has been discussed earlier in earlier uh city council meetings and workshops how do you discuss things if you remove it from perspective if you delete prospective litigation how do you just the prohibition if you delete the prohibition how do you do this one of the ways that you do it and i've done it elsewhere numerous times is if there was a potential lawsuit or litigation and it had not ripened into pending litigation then there's a discussion by me is the city attorney one-on-one with each of the city council members that's perfectly allowable okay what is not allowable for is for me to be a conduit and have discussions with the seven city council members and share each other's opinions that's something i would not do i know the ramifications of that but as the city attorney it is perfectly ethical for me to have a one-on-one discussion with each of the council members about something that that could be forthcoming that i think you all ought to know about from a legal standpoint so that that's you know really what should happen in most circumstances and if you deleted the prohibition against pro prospective litigation then what i hope would happen is that there would be situations where the city council has the ability to discuss something but chooses to refrain from discussing it because they don't want to have a discussion where people are making taking positions and potentially stating admissions against interest that that is the thing that i hope would happen one of one of the points that i i will make about this and it applies to quite a few of the discussions that i've heard in my tenure here is that instead of looking at the code provision and focusing on how you're going to amend it there is a distinct tendency to bring in all these other things and all these other examples and all these other factors i have encouraged the city council in the past to not do that it may illustrate your position but the what happens over and over again is instead of focusing on the provision you add continually add factors that make it harder to address the problem at hand because now there's so many other things that are considered and the the recent discussion this evening about the sign ordinance is that's exactly what was done in my opinion and it doesn't make things easier to sort out it makes it far complicated more complicated so with with this discussion i i would encourage you to delete the prohibition against discussing prospective litigation and clarify the point about pending litigation and uh approve it in in that that manner so how would you do that i i would would would say you would delete the words or prospective litigation and keep the rest of it the same that's my recommendation to you mr riley you address pending litigation pending litigation i agree with you wholeheartedly on perspective just pending litigation that is eligible and there's very limited amount of pending litigation that's eligible for a shade meeting you do not address in here pending in litigation that is not eligible for shape meaning my motion that you're well aware of that you leave by leaving a prohibition on speaking on pending litigation i would like you to address whether that is in your opinion constitutional or not constitutional you're talking it's if you delete the words or prospective litigation then then you're you're clarifying that this shade meeting uh provision is applicable right but that's not my question my question is pending litigation we had this very discussion on existing pending litigation three citizens came forward took a mic one of them actually got sued because of what they said okay and that was unallowed to be rebutted because of this prohibition that we have in here my point to you isn't what i just spent half an hour explaining to everybody constitutionally is if a citizen can come up here and give their opinion on pending litigation that is not eligible for a shape meeting then the people up here should too you're saying it's okay for prospective my argument to you is it's also okay for pending i'm asking you a city attorney whether you believe it's constitutional to prohibit pending litigation from being discussed when it doesn't otherwise qualify for a shade meeting i i think you're splitting hairs i would apply the shade meeting provision of section 286.0118 so some stuff can be discussed on pending litigation and other stuff can but a citizen can discuss anything yeah you think that's constitutional i do when i differ why would you want to discuss pending litigation in a public forum to give away strategies or decisions or whatever now going to the the next question about prospective litigation i pose this question to a attorney who makes his living defending municipalities in this area against lawsuits he is the attorney of choice who's retained by the florida league of cities to defend municipalities against lawsuits i pose this issue to him his answer is short answer you don't want to go there you don't want to go there and it speaks directly to admissions against interest you don't know what's going to be said in the passion of a moment a slip of a tongue or whatever that can be used against you in follow-on litigation his point was and his observation from making a living at this is that there are only two people who could determine what an admission against interest is that's a judge and that's a jury and his opinion was that many attorneys many municipal attorneys aren't familiar with all the intricacies and concerns involved with dimension against interest so just don't go there don't don't don't take debate on that just be silent and just exercise good common sense answer your question as to why i have the right to bring any emotion i want here as long as it's a legal emotion and it was absolutely a legal motion i'll clarify my choice of words when i say illegal it's against our statute it was not against the state statute we were fully in compliance with the state statute actually our statute is probably the one that's illegal because it conflicts with what the state has already given us you can't make lesser rights than what the state has given you so i have every right to bring what i want so you and we've heard all kinds of emotions from our council members and um that's what we're supposed to do we represent the people and if we feel that there's a valid interest and there's absolutely a valid interest for this but it's not going to get hurt okay and what i'm hearing tonight is the people can speak but you elected officials can't speak on these issues because you might say the wrong thing and it might dig us deeper well that is not a compelling state interest that is not narrowly tailored to achieve the goals that makes it unconstitutional that makes it a suppression of rights and i've been victimized by this one so i got a dog in this fight and i've begged and i begged i've been begging for four months done begging fix this law repeal it you want to listen to your attorney i don't know who you spoke to if it's the attorney who's defending this city that attorney has multiple sunshine issues in madeira beach i'm not sure who you spoke to but i'm not taking hearsay argument from some attorney who's saying violate the constitution you swore the oath council member and i swore the same oath to uphold the constitution that attorney didn't swear any oath not in this manner so i'm not going with this this needs to be repealed that the i don't i can't even follow the legal logic with all due respect mr raleigh you're entitled to your legal opinion i can't follow that it's okay to talk about prospective litigation but it's not okay to talk about pending litigation only when the state allows you to do it in a in a subject law in a shade ordinance you told me that you received research all the cities around here and you couldn't find an ordinance like this i submit to you because they know better than us because they know this is unconstitutional now if you want to find out the hard way i'm sure this always could be challenged this is bad law this is suppression of your elected officials i'm not letting it go i'm not letting it go this needs to be fixed i've asked at least four times for this to be fixed now the clock's going to get run out on this council this council's term ends at the end of march whether people are re-elected or not this council will end in its present form and we get a new council coming in some people continue leslie and frank banker to continue and glenn so this needs to be addressed i'm sorry i disagree with your opinion usually you and i are pretty much in sync not this time not this time if a citizen can get up there and talk about it so can we and the best you can do is we might say the wrong thing we might say the wrong thing on everything we say all night long that's why we have immunity that's why you add legislative immunity so we can get up here and speak freely that's what it's here for you're cutting off these people's voices these people elected me some of them and i don't get to represent them to bring their ideas a promotion you can defeat this motion you think it's a bad motion it'll get road voted down i can't i don't get to bring the motion i'm not saying anything more i'm voting no for number six it's unconstitutional you vote yes it still remains unconstitutional in my opinion your opinion is different that's why there's judges that's why they're supreme courts because lawyers differ sometimes along with constitutionality i would say don't go down that road too chairman yes mr banker if i heard mr riley correct we should strike some words in this ordinance perspective litigation if we do that we're not going to be able to pass it on second well then the ordinance is out of good so let's just kill him right now that's where i think we were last time actually i thought we were going to kill it but it's nice it's like jason is coming back from the day yeah [Music] still here i still have to hear from the citizens and then we can bring it back to council so i agree with frank i'm going to follow fred riley's advice to strike those words so i'll probably vote and work on it again listen you said you want to strike the or prospective litigation can we do a motion to amend this ordinance and then vote on the amended order no because we have i don't believe so i'll refer to the city attorney we have first reading with the in and second reading with it out and that's a sizable difference as we just discussed for the last 20 minutes your motion your ordinances have to be equal and we've advertised it this way so i you know it's not like we're changing a punctuation mark or something immaterial this is i believe material but you're the city attorney you advise us it's a significant change and the the problem that that occurs here on almost every measure you you take up is it's debated six ways this sunday numerous times so the the reality is you all have very uh very different views of things and you have very spirited views of things if you want to make a change to it if it's already been changed once then the the best thing to do is direct that another change be made it be re-advertised and you have a second reading on the the new version of it that's the best thing you should do because that that gives absolute clarity on what you're doing if we change that change don't we need to make two readings of that because we are changing it substantially i think we go back to the original right glenn's saying yes i think so i think that's the i think we'd have to do two readings if you want to be a thousand percent certain of what you're doing then i would agree with you i defer to you well i'm not i think it's true i have to tell you i i do my level best over and over again to try and change the code provisions based on the discussion that you all have and there there were several of these that have come up that you all agreed you would go through the process of discussing them in a workshop so that you could iron all these things out and then you've done that and then here we are again in a second reading of an ordinance change to amend the code and you you go through a another complete round of debating it that's religiously told us i'll say the same thing i've said it over and over again this relates to the sign ordinances as well personally provided you comply with the law i don't care what you do all i want is that the refined language of what you settle on is truly what you want to do and the that that is what i suggest you do we're not going to i'm not going to as a presiding officer limited discussion on this stuff i don't care if we discuss this stuff all night long okay i really don't and the reason being is things do change people look at some things sometimes i mean earlier today i disagreed on the sign ordinance i don't want to keep rehashing that but i agree with glenn dunn i didn't agree with him last time we read it you see different things in it a little bit later and that's the legislative process that's the debate process unfortunately or fortunately florida says this is the way we have to do it we don't get a chance to try and call somebody up and try and win them over and out i fully understand that yeah and with respect to the sign ordinance and i'm only using this as an example you all have debated it over and over and over again you've done it in workshops you've done it in city council meetings and i again will say i have tried my level best to be responsive to the changes that you've made i'm not telling you you shouldn't revisit it and debate things in in a council meeting that that is your prerogative to do that i think i made it clear that so and again we're talking about sign arts we've moved past it but i said it when we were discussed today that has nothing to do with you you've done a tremendous job on trying to get all our stuff in here but this is a deliberative body and it's our job that we said we were going to do to deliberate and and things change and people see things differently and somebody suggests something differently that's the legislative process that florida wants and until the state legislature tells us differently that's the one we have to follow so um this is not a reflect none of this is a reflection on you so take take me out of it all i'm telling you is y'all need to debate things and you need the object is to get it right and to get it constitutional and and make sure what you're doing is indeed going to be upheld that's ever challenged that's the objective that i've always focused on it's frustrating i'm going to be honest with you it's frustrating to retread the same stuff over and over again but that's okay because the object is to get it right council i have a question yes is it possible to vote the first is it possible to set back the clock and do the first round of vote if if it's amended tonight no no it's not oh all right we have to go back she can kill it and then we can bring it up to the next meeting that's fine any other on council but i'm about to turn this over to citizen citizens any citizen comments on this hanzo john hanson 22nd street first off i didn't want to make it sound like i'm the only one in here that served i i defer and appreciate the service of all my brothers and sisters in the service but on this item six and everything else you're discussing and mr roddy just said it nailed it constitutionally correct that's josh sworn over to and yet i'm i'm sitting here listening to the debate and i was here for the first vote and it dawned on me tonight listening to everybody talking this item six was politically motivated to suppress an individual that's my take okay that's not white that's my take okay i'm entitled to my opinion you're entitled to yours and we can agree to disagree sometimes but the point is i don't know how else to say it i've said it before y'all took an oath to serve the best interests of the citizens of this city and you really gotta ask yourself at the end of the day if an issue is politically motivated to suppress someone or benefit someone is that in the best interests of the city and if i made comments about well that's why we have insurance i made this comment at the last meeting if somebody sues us well in excess of what our liability is who's on the hook we are is that a good return on investment i don't think so please do what's constitutionally right and in the best interests of us we the people thank you thank you mr hansek any other citizens i have to counsel for final comments before we call the vote this issue was initially raised by the mayor as i recall you brought this forward motion to repeal correct and what we had before us now is just iterative evolution of that intelligent discussion and i think regardless of the opinion whether we're for or against it every person sitting up here on this dais makes a decision in what he thinks is in the best interest of the city and citizens i'm saying whether it's one person or the opposite view that person makes a decision based on what he thinks is the best interest of the citizens and just because it doesn't go with just one group's decision or concept of what's right or what's wrong doesn't make it right or wrong that's why we have a body up here to make decisions thank you folks there's an old adage you could lead a horse in the water but you can't make the horse drink i'm leading the horse to water of course don't want to drink i'm trying i'll quote a line from my favorite one of my favorite movies pulp fiction i'm trying to go i'm trying okay i'm really trying here okay i'm really trying that's all i'm saying i'll let you up to that um i don't think that repeal is on the uh agenda for tonight that is not the case so what we have is we have old or new and based upon what i'm hearing from mr riley which is slightly different than what i heard from mr riley several times before he's i believe that he has changed his mind on perspective litigation i'm fine with that um unfortunately we're in a position right now to where there's nothing we can do about it you either have to go with the overly restricted or you go with a slightly lesser restrictive ordinance but because the new ordinance is tied to this sitting council i would recommend all council members vote no on this and we go back to the old ordinance and then we deal with it that's all i have to say okay yeah dave had brought this motion today if anybody else has anything else to add them but i will come back today for a final comment go ahead my thought would be that we defeat this one bring it back removing the ore perspective litigation phrase there and deal with it that way at our next meeting thanks any other council commons you've been against this for what i don't know how many work sessions council meetings since the summertime since the summer i don't know how much cost of weight these wounds but now we've got council agreeing with you that's just bad i i will say it again i don't agree with the mayor what i will say is i would rather revert back to what we have and then try to fix it but the fix may not necessarily be what the mayor wants i'm just saying [Music] we'll take another stab at it it is not what i want i want it repealed period we don't need it superfluous we don't need to say what the rights are that florida gives us but dave uh gas is correct there is no motion for appeal tonight but that's where that was what i proposed that gets rid of all issues or alternatively and the citizens don't have the right to comment on it i could equally live with that so that's two options for you repeal it or stop the citizens from speaking about it anything else i'll stick by everything i said constitutionally repeated um we can defeat number six tonight but the ordinance that stays on our books in my opinion remains unconstitutional you just heard from your city attorney that at least part of it is unconstitutional and in conflict with state law so garbage on the books are you ready to vote before us is consideration according to 2108 an ordinance of the city council of the city of delaware beach florida providing for an amendment to section 2-63-d of the city code of ordinances pertaining to addressing city council providing for incorporation of recitals providing for approval of amendment of nmm into section 2-63-d of the city code ordinances providing for a copy to be kept on file providing for separability providing for the repeal of all ordinances in conflict herewith and providing for an effective date this is the second reading if this passes it will become our new law tonight miss gentry clerk gentry would you please call [Music] yes council member note yes council member spoke yes council member aki no councilmember baker no vice mayor gattis no no this is defeated three uh four to three item six does not pass we stick with our existing organs thank you council that was a discussion very good discussion on this i don't everybody need a break we're now at eight o'clock we don't have much left here because we're going to consent agenda after this all right i'll continue then not hearing any and i'm not requesting a break consideration i'm seven

the repeal of all ordinances in conflict here with and providing for an effective date somebody bring a motion please so about a gas motion second second second by leslie detero open for discussion dave dad is first i refer to the city manager city manager yes mayor and council uh changes in this ordinance were to add the restriction on electric bicycles on the beach we updated a section on page four store leave abandoned derelict boats watercraft navigable waters and we updated a section in section four on page six if any dot or pile this was all discussed at the previous meeting and then we updated the dates for the slips of the boat ramp 180 days right occupy shall revert to the city the boat slip let's see if owner operator of such watercraft takes work for crews of up to 90 days that's a lab and then uh also 180 days for repair so that those were the highlights and the changes and we went through this at a work session and we had first reading of the last concept other changes have been made we've not updated since the last council meeting right so this is since then when you said update i just was saying we didn't update it oh noises that's i want to clarify i'm just kind of highlighting the highlights thank you city manager council i have i have a question on page six section h at section four item h right oh i'm sorry section four items okay it says any person who may walk there on such structure shall be either removed it talks about uh that being unsafe what does it mean by any person i mean this is private property i'm assuming h maintenance page six okay so answer the question again what does it mean by any person these these docs wars pile structures or private property i'm assuming so how do you get out there and welcome just any person well it says creating an unrest unreasonable bodily intrigue any person who may walk on there that's perspective i'm not sure what i what you're asking well the perspective is it's unsafe correct yes okay so when it says any person who may walk there this is private property are you are we going to just force our way going to that the city manager or the code enforcement officer or whoever and say well i'm going to walk your deck and make sure it's the boards are all firm that's not what i'm saying and you can't do that what it's saying is that the doc has potential to hurt any person it's not saying if this is not giving someone permission to go on private property it's saying if a person happens to step on this dock it could it could hurt them correct but system violation to any person who may walk there on any person who may walk there once correct you have to walk on that dock to say oh that that is that legislation it says not not even close if any dark dwarf pile or structure falls into a state of disrepair and becomes a dangerous structure creating an unreasonable risk so that that would it should be a pretty obvious and why are we why do we have the words who may walk there on because somebody's going to walk their arm well that's what i'm saying but this is private property again i don't think that is relevant to this provision you're creating a standard the standard is is there a dangerous condition for someone that may conceivably walk across there in the in the future well that's the better i guess that's the better question he determines that if i go out there on a boat and i see you adopted i don't think it's safe okay but it may be safe um who determines if if there's a site anybody cited for this then that would the person that would determine it would be the special magistry and i understand that i mean how do you get to the special magistrate i would say president a has an unsafe dock okay it doesn't look like it's safe to walk on well i'll give you two polar examples let me just finish it has a lot of wear on the wood there's cracks in the wood but it could still be stable so how do you determine that it's unsafe without actually going on it would be what the code officer observes and let me give you the two polar examples one is that there was a storm and the there's a a walkway that typically would have boards the whole way down the walk and and this the structure's been damaged to the point that a number of the boards are missing so it's fine and you may then you can't walk on it okay but this says who may walk well let me give you my other example okay the there there are several boards let me let me change my example there are several boards that are cracked okay so they're not missing but they're cracked and they're cracked to the point that somebody observing him could could deduct that the crack boards would lead to somebody falling through if they walked there on so that's one example at the other end of the spectrum there was a storm the thing wasn't damaged at all except a little bit of the paint was chipped off that that's a situation where there's no uh state of disrepair well that is disrepair that it needs to be painted but it doesn't create a dangerous structure that creates an unreasonable risk those are two different ends of the spectrum i fully recognize that there's everything in between and what hopefully you would have if you implemented this provision is you would have a code officer that would bring a case if he had a legitimate bona fide concern that the thing was damaged to the point that it created a an unreasonable risk that's the case he would bring and then these special magistrates the one that would determine based on the evidence presented whether there was an uh this code provision was violated all right i just just any doc i mean it sounds to me frank like sort of like the statement unfit for human consumption it's kind of like that it's it's if any person happens to get on that dog there's a good possibility it's going to fall through okay but why are you getting if if it was my dog why are you getting on my diet that's my question there you go there you go you don't have to get on your dock sound in my view so stable this is not talking this is not this is not everything this is not giving people permission to walk on your dock what it's saying is the whole purpose of this is to keep your dog from falling apart into the water and damaging boats and other people's property a good a good reference point is if you can't walk on that thing without it breaking through something needs to be done about it and that's what this is saying it's not saying everybody's got permission to get on your dog you're you're not reading it the way that it was written it's i'm reading it the way it is i'm not sure what you're reading i honestly don't know hang on hang on i'm going to move this to leslie back and forth and we're not supposed to have crosstalk and this is why so i think you have to read it in conjunction with the first sentence of section h all permits for docs shall be issued on the condition that such construction will be maintained in a self in a safe condition at all times this is just what you have to do if it's not in a safe condition you got to fix it remove it or repair it it's not it's not like you know you have to worry about a trespasser walking on it it's it's a follow-on to that first says your permits issued on the condition that you maintain it in a safe condition they have to be read together i don't have problems with the first verbiage if you just read the existing orange the problem i have is the additional language that we're voting on it says it has to be either repaired or replaced if it's not in a safe condition right okay what i'm saying by saying body injury to any person who may walk there well that any person includes the owner of the dock as well sure any human absolutely now the owner comes out there and says oh whoa i need to replace the stock that's that's great but if i'm driving by in a boat i'm thinking that doc needs to be replaced okay well you know dave and i can attest to this for neighboring ducks that they're quite obvious when four of the boards are in the water that no person or dog can walk on them i think it's in reference to those we're not going to go by and be that nail is four millimeters too high i bet that dock is unsafe it's the ones that are falling in the water the ones that are bowed so it looks like this it's those and i understand what you're saying but i think we're getting a little too nitpicky it's just a general saying that if any person child human or not walked on this when it's bowed like this they're gonna get hurt it's both like that that's fine but i've had a resident contact me that had code enforcement come out and question their dog okay they're an elderly couple and they don't use it for voting or anything like that i don't want our residents being scrutinized because other people don't think the doc looks acceptable to what i'm saying that was perfectly fine okay they'll look at it and say it's fine but they were turned in to have their dog questioned and you know well people turn people in because of their grass and everything else so it's just another appendage of them you know i can turn somebody in because they need to paint their house it's the same thing what language that we're going to pass is there any person any person that walks on it would be able to hold their weight and be structurally sound not that any person is welcome to walk on it i see what you're saying i see where you see you're seeing that but i think it's written as as far as safety of a person walk on it that's a chihuahua versus you know i'm just like crosstalk i blended to speak so let's go to glenn and then we can entertain it again i was just going to say it sounds like there's pretty much a consensus for the marine as it is there's there's some concern on this side but i haven't heard a recommendation on how to change it so my proposal is that because we have a consensus on this thing i'll protocol i don't think we're going to change anybody's mind here maybe just go to the same scenario i mean we want to debate here's frank i want to we just had a code case okay and i think that's where maybe councilmember bakker's misunderstanding it's not saying that the deputy could go onto the dock what it's saying is if anybody walked on the dock if it's a guest to the house and that dock could cause moderately injury to them that's what that really means we just had a code case with a doc last month actually uh the dot was in ill repair and we took it to the magistrate the magistrate determined that the dock was in no repair and that neither needed to be repaired or removed and she determined that they had x amount of days to do that so it's it's not saying that you as a citizen are going to walk up to somebody's dock it's saying it would be like a cat if a cat walked on it and got hurt it's just bottom of the injury it's it's it's not i think that's where we're kind of lost a little bit yeah then you kind of said a lot of what i was going to say and i'll just add a little bit to it then we'll go back and see if that's if it explains it for you know for frank frank i remember the debate last time and i looked right at lynn reeves and i said if code ever goes on a dock okay first off the search is invalid okay and the summons and everything else isn't going to stand the whole point here is what generated this was people seeing docs that were in real states of disrepair you know in the supreme court they tried to define pornography and the judge said i know it when i see it okay you'll know this when you see it okay because this is a dock that's in disrepair we talked about this last time you can't go and say oh you know you're missing a nail on board number five and it's no it's in disrepair well first off they don't have to let the code officer back there okay the code officer has to take a boat and look at it from the boat if your neighbor turns you in well your neighbor turned you in okay but still code has to look at it from the road unless you invite him in if code comes on your property he can't okay you can look from the street you can look from the water you can't do anything more and i tell you i said or the neighbors yard or the neighbor's yard if the neighbor lets you in yes if the neighbor lets you in um so that was that now if it's the way i read this frank is the bodily injury to any person who may walk it's just that any person is this safe you know if my stairs are rotted out and we go wow like nobody should ever walk on that thing it's not me it's not you it's not it's like anybody who might use it i think that's the way i read this and i didn't really have a problem with this language if a code officer ever goes there i believe i lit i looked at you and i said if a code officer ever goes there as long as i'm here i want to see him the next meeting because we're going to have a problem as a council you know you can't do that so frank will go back to you well i just think the words so what's your proposal to strike the word after injury to through their fred reilly on that proposal two things i mean yeah second reading and and does it change it substantially not it wouldn't die it wouldn't read differently without it but i don't you have to tell us if you you know it's going to kill it then let us know and then he calls that he could call it as a motion to amend but i don't want to go through a motion to amend if it's going to kill it then i'll respond the same way i did before if you're making a change in second reading then the safest thing so that there's absolutely no issue is to continue it and have it deleted and have another reading that's the safest thing you can do frank you want to make a motion or you won't just go to a vote on this two to their own section four each so before you load on that i i would encourage you to leave it the way it is my my reading of the the legal standard that's created is is i i think there is tremendous clarity in the way it's written now and it doesn't create a private uh authorization authorization for somebody to walk onto your dock it contemplates that somebody somebody would be walking on the dock the standard is set up so it says if any docker structure falls into a state of repair that's condition a and condition b becomes a dangerous structure and describes how it would be a dangerous structure so i i think it's fine the way it is i would encourage you not to amend it and to simply adopt it frank it's your call i'm making that motion motion is made by frank banker to amend striking the words um after uh said striking the words to any person who may walk there on correct frank correct okay we have a second for that motion last fall second motion to amend is defeated or does for going to the second back to the motion the uh the question before us is there any more council debate before i go to the city citizens does anyone like to speak on this back to the council last word will go to dave gaddis but anybody else want to speak before him okay last word other questions if you say call the question then it's actually a motion so i think you just want you have no comment right no job thank you all right so item seven is consideration of ordinance 21-10 an ordinance at the city council of the city

november 1st meetings and you always do a very good job i think with the with the minutes but those were exceptional and i really think that if anyone looks at like how many should be they were perfect i mean they had the detail but they didn't have too much they were just perfect so really excellent job on that thank you if anyone ever wants to see it how they should be done i think that's your example to me at least that was i read that and i was like perfect i mean it was there wasn't a comment out of place it was perfect great job regular agenda item 13 authorization for the city manager to execute a purchase order for the elite addressing project the explanation is to execute a purchase order include contract and ink for the storm drain improvement project first notion manager suit manager yes mayor council this is uh to uh correct an area on elita drive that we have some drainage issues where it's puddling after we did all the work and what we're going to be doing uh we spoke about this i uh gave you a diagram in here we're going to be putting in new piping behind the curve at this one area i'm going to get the drainage to the drainage outball box down the street and this will eliminate the water that's been totaling there we have funding in the 2021 uh stormwater fund to take care of this and we've got three quotes one for twenty four thousand eight hundred forty three dollars and sixty five cents one for forty two thousand and one for seventy five thousand four hundred sixty one dollars and eighteen cents and uh they're part of the tactic if you have any other questions i'll be that happy to answer you're recommending uh contracting people yes and you've worked with have you worked with them before yes yeah actually he did actually he did the entrance science course several years ago he's done other things i i've had even when i was in oldsmar he did projects so he's been around and he worked with us to to try to keep the costs down versus another i'm going to put a plug for my street because they fixed the valley curves of mine and we have the same problem okay maybe not to the extent that they have on atleta but um it puddles it rots it gets disgusting in the summertime um right in front of my place and i'm not sure if it's in other places but i'm not sure this is happening in the city but i mean it's so level and it wasn't level before but it was level now and um it's there and it's just you know it's a mess it's actually a mosquito trap really but um you know you can't it's a mess then this stuff blows into it and so just letting you know there may be other places in the city but we're going to get this one fixed right now right okay any council comments yeah i'm saying it's like it needs things to go by i believe it yeah uh i don't know if you'll be so largely because of where you're at it's easy to get rid of it whenever it's a sea wall i don't know i don't know if they can do anything like maybe just re-pitch it but i i know i think i've seen the leader and it's it's bad well much much worse yeah any other council comments citizens anyone want to comment on this back to council last word that's the ontario i'm sorry gotta be fast there debra it's getting late we're all getting tired [Music] i see you now go ahead i don't have a dog in this fight but i just want you guys to be aware of this um you may or may not be aware of it but i'm just telling you because i hear it um there is a big feeling that you know all the people on over there they get preferential treatment when it comes to these things and when this came up before there were comments about oh their streets puddle and they get them fixed mine's been flooding for 10 years just like the young man who was here at the last meeting so i think you all need to be very aware of those issues and if you're going to put things ahead of i know that we've got the street flooding scheduled but i've been here for 20 years and those streets have been flooding for 20 years and so you know you uh you have a pr problem i guess i'll tell you jim we spend at japan's 57th street village we spent a lot of money on different projects and so forth in this city but you know you use 9th street as an entrance to the park which is one of our highlights of our city i i was never so ashamed that all my life going down 9th street the other day and seeing the valley curbs i am asking this council to take time we don't live on 9th street and go down there and see those valley coasts but premier city not with valley curb silicon like that they're pretty bad i don't know that we've had any valve look that bad in this city that i've seen so please take some time go look at them and and then encourage or move that forward i'm trying to do something about that that is that's not good it's really bad thank you thank you any other citizens back to council i don't know why um and i don't know if the citizen is complaining that the curves look bad or if they're puddling but i live on eighth street we had ours we're done all right and i think the baffle is too low and baffle closes at high tide and if there was a catch basin probably submerged 10 foot down with eight inch pumps popping out which was an 8-inch pump i'm not i don't get all this stuff anymore it's like 604 000 gallons you would never have any water in that street unless you had a tattoo this is just typical rain we get it and if that citizen is complaining about that amen i mean but i don't know why we when we designed all this stuff i don't know who designed it i don't know why they put these catch pieces i don't know why they didn't raise the baffles up a little bit higher but it's a mess we put all that money in there and i i really see a difference yeah i mean frank you know i built many a construction project and i don't know why these people are getting paid before it rains okay you know and i mine's nothing i've seen elita okay dave just said to me it's a puddle and he's right i've seen it okay but it doesn't have to be a puddle okay you know we had somebody in our neighborhood a couple years ago calling because there was too many mosquitoes it turned out one of the neighbors or something had like a bucket upside down and it was well we've got that in the driveway you know and i mean it's standing water and then we're hearing you know the valley curbs are a mess on 9th street i think i have seen worse i seem to remember going around last time and seeing some that were pretty worse but i know we're trying to fix all this stuff but when to me when i had a project you didn't get paid until final inspection and everything passed out and sometimes there was even a retained i don't know that maybe it's not a good idea on valley curbing and stuff like this to say you know we're going to hold 10 back until we get a little bit of rain in the summer that would be almost three days winter it might take a little bit longer but um you know we need to know if this stuff is level because if we're making things that are as level as a billiards table the water's not going to flow and frank's talking some technical stuff here but i'm not familiar with some of it but i mean i'm just i think we're we're a great city in terms of paying people but maybe we want to think about holding some retainage back and making sure the stuff works because i agree we are going back and doing stuff again and we put a storm water fee on everybody and um i don't see the money wasted well i don't think in the elita situation uh i don't it's just one little tiny spot during the whole street once that area and that's what we're gonna do we're gonna repipe it part of the problem is not just rain it's people running their sprinklers six and seven days a week and that's that's a problem uh that we even found on the leader having lived on 8th street for many years the water level is not anywhere near what it used to be i mean with the baffles put in and the plan excuse me for curbs was not to go in and tear up curbs if there's a stormwater project on it until we get to it because all you're doing at that point in time is you're going to end up tearing the street up again and you're going to replace the curbing again so that that was that's kind of what we've been doing is if there's a street and 9th street is probably i'm gonna say a year or two away from its cycle then you know there's been money set up for paving and curbs and re-piping and putting new new uh catch basins in so the things we've done to try to stop some of this uh ninth street we did put a baffle valve to stop it and people were telling me oh no it's the tide coming up there so i went over and did an unscientific test i went and got a water testing kit turns out it was rain water or sprinkler water it wasn't salt water and you know i i kind of explained that to everyone uh took a couple little bottles went out the street picked it up out of the curb and big then i went down here and put the sample of salt water up and you know actually some of the stuff in the curb unfortunately was i remember this almost drinking water because i wanted to see what the difference was with the drinking water out of the tap and it was pretty scary if you think about it i think the tap stuff came in worse in some cases yeah but i remember when you told me that that's my point i mean uh there was a there was a storm right after east uh easter this year and it was at high tide we had about three inches in an hour and that water went all the way down almost to golf ballpark and the one neighbor came out he says i haven't had water come down this far since the 93 winter storm my main storm and it was all rainbow as well as a catch basin that that water could have gone in and then pumped out but if you're if you're and people say that to us too if you're if the water is at the top of the sea wall you're not pumping out anything absolutely but it wasn't at the top of the ceiling yeah jimmy jimmy says we have a pr problem the way i characterized it i did it in the past is we don't do well in managing expectations we start our project we go into the neighborhood heavy equipment rolls in put down some conduit people says oh the city's here to solve this flooding problem after 20 40 years well we've been trying to say that you live on a barrier island there are going to be a confluence of conditions that are going to cause flooding and they've been we've tried to characterize them all how long does it last cars impassable is the street completely impassable how long does it take for the flight to declare to try to prioritize some of that stuff but the the bottom line is we don't do well as a city saying hey this is not the stockholm this is not going to solve your problem it's still going to be flooding when the moon's in a certain condition the winds are blowing from a certain direction the tides are a certain way or we've had rain for the last 39 days or something like that we don't do well and we need to get better on that there's also never any admission of whether or not the people who own those houses did their due diligence when they bought them things it was houses or that there was full disclosure in the real estate deal so i mean where does there's there's more arguments to this solving this equation than just hey we need to do better than this the engineers do a good job the people go in and they do the repairs according to the specs they're given and i'm not quite sure how you resolved issues well it didn't meet expectations or something along those lines are you with that mic closer they're all new cars by our lead to drive right and then and i was out there and they're all box cut form curves okay where that's that's great but there's curved machines today that would have done the grading maybe we should look at better contractors okay and you wouldn't have this problem and and i don't know how you people put up with somebody your roads was torn up for months okay and a lot of it was you know two by four bucks then they uh half inch plywood and box it tore it they poured so many feet a day you could pour a thousand feet a day and encourage you and you would get a nice yeah glenn i remember this issue well with these check valves and part of it was the city's fault okay it was sold in the city news that this was the panacea this was going to cure your flooding woes and i actually wrote about this because i'm saying is that i remember it happened during the last campaign and i was the one i researched the valves and i said these are sunny day check valves these are not rainy day check valves and i explain that it wasn't initially explained that way and i think you know people here maybe check the house it's going to stop the onslaught of hurricane irma well no it's not actually it's going to block it off and it's not going to drain you're right we live on a barrier island and i think what you know i think we did get the message out ultimately that these are sunny day check valves this is only going to help you lunar situations high tide you know that confluence that sometimes just causes our you know streets to flood in the middle of august for no good reason um so yeah i agree with you i think you know we need to just be very very clear because people if they read it they say oh check that out it's going to stop the flooding i could stay here you know during the hurricane no you can't do that you know well in the ever teacher time i think it's incumbent upon us to start in town hall meetings fellow beach city 101 these are the projects this is the timeline this is what our expectations are for what we're going to solve you just that means your expectations are not you know we don't want that in this massive expectation so in a future time i think we need to start talking about this stuff [Music] any other council comments before we call the vote um leslie you got the last word the last words okay item 13 authorization of the city manager to execute a purchase order for the elite to drive drainage project yes vote will pass this i'm going to do this for a voice vote if it's okay madam clerk yes okay all in favor all right anyone opposed pass a 7-0 city manager you'll go forward then with that project thank you any unfinished business i just have something we discussed about the buoys yes uh i put something at your place tonight with what i sent just some concepts what i would suggest we do is maybe use the walking easements as possibly the boat access areas and expand these but i just sent this to florida wildlife commission just to see what they'd say about swimwear areas so what they told me is uh if we put a buoy every 150 feet and we put one i i'm showing three swim areas but the bears are the three swim areas right right this is just proposed because it's kind of uh let's see what florida wildlife says okay so they looked at it and said yes you can make them as big as you want when you talk about the sides he did say that i recommend you put a buoy on the sides that are going back towards the shore [Applause] so what i'm probably going to bring you uh if there's some consensus with this is something where i take the four beach accesses and delineate those on the map and then say maybe we'll make it 300 foot wide at those and then everything else will be a swim area but those areas will be the access without so what you would have is an excess of each one of the walking easements for something to come up shouldn't it be the other way around i'm gonna walk if i'm using walking easements and i'm carrying my cooler and my umbrella which we could use in our city and all my other gear i'm gonna stay pretty close to the walking easement where i walk over and not go down so shouldn't that be the swim area and the other stuff be the boat area well what i'm trying to alleviate is and i'm just going to give you an example let's say alameda if you look at this map let's say elementary condo there's no swim area in front they might get theirself concerned that there's no swim area and i would also suggest that we have a discussion with the congress because this is really who it's going to affect and you know if you went down to like the bellerin beach club as an example if if you just took the three swim areas that i threw out there to the fwc well you'd have to walk quite a ways to go swimming and i think the intent of the whole situation was at least give the opportunity for a boat to come into shore periodically so that's why i was using the accesses and when i talk to fwc we don't have to go out and do any surveying this is an example from 20th street to 21st street is the first swim area that's how we'll describe that in 300 foot out so uh you know if you want me to stay away from the walking easements that's fine you know we can hash it out at a work session but so what i'm asking is is this kind of what you were looking for with the swim areas so the votes could get in i think it's a it's a consensus or not a consensus but a uh a good compromise so so what we'll do we'll get a little more creative and bring something to the recession in january and you can go a little wider on the swim areas because it's only like a block which is a lot well i just put 300 foot by 300 foot boxes on the map i sent it to the fwc and said this is what we're thinking about doing we may do more we may do less do you have any problem with this and what would we have to do to make it work and he basically told me you put the buoys out on the end but in the 300 foot coming in halfway in 150 foot from the shore put a buoy on the sides so you can delineate that hey just because you see this three buoys out here that doesn't mean you can come in behind them and drive through so we hate those swimming areas like that and i think they're big stakeholders in this because it primarily they're really at the beach and you know as much as we talk about beach rides and all that well here's a group of people who bought property because they want to look at a certain thing there and i would also not only their commentary but some people are more beachgoers than i am certainly and i think once we kind of have an idea of what we want we may want to have a public polling on this thing and run for 60 90 days to make sure we understand what we don't those are public walking accesses and if the if those are the areas yes i understand that but if you could go to the right or left of 50 feet to a swim area it wouldn't have as big an impact on the condos if because that is already in public access and what i see is the exact opposite of what we would actually have the swim areas would be the majority and you would have small yeah you'd have four four access points the rest of it would be swim area but you know to be reasonable i think they'd have to be probably somewhere around three hundred four five so if i i'm not sort of understand this i'm thinking you're telling me the square errors of the swim areas which are very small okay that that was what i i just wanted to run it by we had three or four boat areas that were 300 by 300 i think we've solved the problem i think we're good but i think we're good and glenn gunn's point is absolutely important we like it i don't swim here the condo people do swim here and i want to hear what they have to say because they have a whole different take that we just aren't even thinking about right now right now our condo is me um okay i would prefer to have a very extended swim area in front of that to keep the boats out and i would i would hope that we could switch it the squares would be the boat accesses and well that's exciting and that's what i'm suggesting i just gave you this map because this is the map that i gave to the fwc because i wanted to get some kind of preliminary feedback from them are you going to allow us to do this and they said you can make them as big as you want just make sure you do this and this and i said because they'll probably get expanded when i talk to them so my suggestion with the walking easements is those are not as impactful to the condos as putting the swim areas bigger and making the walking accesses the vote for obvious alcohol i i see the logic yeah i like it better yes that's yes because we're not i mean we morgan street we own that's not a problem no the walking eastmans because this way leslie just said and every condo is going to say same thing we don't want to have the boat access here give it access that's what i think they'll say unless there are a lot of boaters in there um so well i was going to make a boat access it in front of us but i just wanted to get the console's feedback and make sure that we were going the right direction so so okay i think you have consensus right okay we're you're you're on the right track very right track city any other unfinished city attorney i submitted an attorney report which is in the form of a memo that i think patty included within the packet the the highlights of the memo or that the qualifying is a candidate for several city council positions is december 14th through december 21st the pursuant to the charter the city clerk is the supervisor of elections for the city i've included section 97.023 florida statutes which sets forth the procedures for citizens or candidates to address complaints of florida election code violations given the full text of the statute and the purpose in providing that to you is to make it clear that the the commission has a primary jurisdiction over the election code violations and the circuit court as jurisdiction as well the city manager of the city clerk and the city attorney did not have jurisdiction to address complaints of the florida election code so i want to make that clear prior to the election season starting certainly with several positions will be a spirited debate and spirited competition so this was the right time to present this to the council stand for any questions i only have a comment patty i'd like to this is a very good memo and i know packets have been picked up by many people already but you know who those people are if we some of them are on council but others are not we can make sure they get a copy of this memo also this is very helpful because you're involved as director of elections here but they're not in fact the city attorneys actually specifically supposed to stay out of it for his contract and then reeves is supposed to stay out of it for his um icma agreement so i mean we're not this is not the venue if people have any problems with what they think is an election problem that's florida tallahassee so this this says that all and i'd like to see if they could get that but it was a good memo threat and i appreciate it forever anybody else in the comments fred do you have any other comments the city to me no sir okay thank you i think that this uh i know it's it's in the agenda it is in the agenda packet but maybe it's uh not a bad idea to post it somewhere else uh i have a feeling that patty is already receiving numerous phone calls and this is a good a good letter or a reference point where you could direct them to i'll make one more comment i work for another city and the other city has issues every single year so the purpose in presenting it to you this year is that it's better for everybody including the primarily the citizens to be aware of what the law is so that the city clerk is not inundated with calls and demands that she do something about it so that's really what i was trying to achieve and you know in saying it there is a recourse to the florida election commission there's also issues if you go there with garbage okay so but people know that this is not to try and gum up the works the candidates are all working hard enough to try and get elected if you file frivolous stuff there's penalties for that so people should know that okay i mean if they're tempted to go file garbage they're going to have a problem with that from you know they file the garbage against there's legal fees and things like that it's it's not just say anything you do want to do you know now try and nail people with false stuff that won't work so i'm not their attorney they need to get an attorney and they need to consult with the ethics people if they have any issues because frivolous complaints are not going to be flying with that i can tell you that city manager uh just a reminder if patty and i are going to be on vacation at starting christmas what the 23rd through the end of the year so uh if you want anything put on the agenda for the january meeting if you can get it to us by december 20th at noon and patty's going to be pretty busy because starting the 14th at 8 o'clock election qualifying begins and it ends on december 21st at noon and she'll she's going to be very busy during that time so we want to try to help her out with any agenda items citizens advisory committee uh matt and we'll bring something to the work session about what their thoughts are with the american rescue money and we've got another meeting on wednesday to discuss the digital sign amendment to the orders so uh they've got some information prepared something we've got a couple other cities digital ordinances for them to look at and they're going to do that on wednesday and thursday we are going to have a training session for the board of adjustment group just to kind of go over the sunshine how the rules work with the uh you know variance and the step in and i got seven more pages but i'll pass tonight uh and i want to wish everybody merry christmas to you and your family okay nothing city council comments um let's start with you this month comment everybody have a happy holiday thank you too frank banker yeah um the citizen that brought these pictures in yes i actually feel chief now i remember when the ordinance got changed i wasn't on council uh our city manager was getting beaten up really badly by one of the people that lived on eighth street over that they wanted i think you wanted them to cut all your palm trees down in the front yard too but um it got changed i wouldn't i wouldn't mind seeing it being changed back but this is this is really a block of view i mean we got we got a neighbor in town saying that you can't have a beach umbrella because it blocks their view and that's only up for an hour or two and then you can't even see after people so i i believe council should look into this i also believe on that sign out front should be turned off at 8 o'clock at night i don't know why we need it until 10. thank you frank merry christmas merry christmas to your family glenn i'll address uh debbie and rogers uh concerns about the sign the sidebar also but something i think the uh city manager he just it's all on one of his other seven pages or something but as late as this morning he was making adjustments to that sign because he's one where there are hot spots i mean literally you could come down to a causeway and from those condos on the other side you had a hot spot across you could see it and uh so he's well aware of the issues kyle's already made some adjustments to the brightness and all the neighbors and i need to kind of make a mental note of what it looks like but there were also some concerns about the scrolling times and the transition and that sort of thing and he had some very plausible explanations there were recommendations how you have to go through a procedure to burn in the leds and stuff but they're already making corrections to this stuff and let's take a look at it tonight while we go out there and let's provide some more feedback to the city manager to get rid of process and hey we want to take the high road and make everybody happy with this thing so uh i'll talk to you offline thanks leslie natal merry christmas happy holidays to you all thank you thank you and your family also um dave gaddis uh well i'm sorry for previous voters yes i would like to make actually more comment to the city manager asking for clarification really there's been some information put out in the community regarding this sign that's like 60 000 and i've been getting some inquiries from several people to clarify that to my understanding the sign cost about twenty nine 35 some change and that who did all the installation he got about four thousand forty back from the insurance and possibly still will get more so right now we're probably sitting at around thirty one two eighty nine excuse me versus 60 is that correct yes my first time yeah uh yeah that is correct as well regarding this 2.5 million dollar project on seven people are asking me for more clarification on that to my understanding the cost of that was around 1.2 and it was none of delaware beach's expense it was all indian rocks beach and also that it was decided by them's vote in by the county so do you have any information on that can you clarify that as well so i can make sure the proper information is given out there well you're talking about the capital project uh that was done a couple years ago yeah it it was a capital project from pronounced county for the sewer system and it was uh your number's wrong it's one million seven hundred and eighty thousand and it was for the pump station in indian rocks beach and uh they advertised it in early march and then they awarded it in june on their consent agenda that was a question and the consent agenda was a seven to zero vote it did help pump station 95 but it was pinellas county funds and you know the city did not get any funding from it but we got some benefit from it so because there's more pumping capability in station [Music] uh 190 which is it somewhere in indian rocks beach i don't know exactly where it's at so that's all i know about it at this point okay was my information correct on the sign cost as well i'm sorry i didn't hear you answer that yeah the sign cost was uh the sign cost total after we paid for the sign some engineering the permit to the county and another electrical circuit it was uh 35 329 and 30 cents the insurance has already paid us 4 000 40 and [Music] i will be getting the once the clear checks are back from the sign company which they should be here hopefully this week i've asked the finance people to give me photocopies so i can send that along with the invoice to the insurance because at the time when we started we were going to get somewhere around ten thousand dollars but because it took so long to resolve the sign uh but we are able to resubmit hopefully okay thank you and uh to all the citizens in our community have an awesome holiday and uh to our city staff as well as our state managers to the attorney have a merry christmas as well thank you thank you good guys all right going back to the sign uh i'm going to touch on that a little bit uh i agree it's it's too bright right now uh but we knew it was going to have some problems and it takes a little time to figure out how to work a new tour one of my recommendations might be and i don't know if it's possible or not because i've never seen the scheduled program but maybe we we shift from a white to a darker color whenever you you get to those those that time period again i don't know what the capabilities are but i think it's something that we can work out i come home sometimes nine ten in fact nine o'clock now i'll be passing that sign shortly and uh there may be something that i'd like to see but i think beyond 10 o'clock i think that that's sufficient so i'm against changing the schedule but certainly resolving the issue with the blinding bright light and while we're discussing lights there is a light across the street from that sign i believe it's uh it's held up by a concrete post that puts out way more light than the sign does when from the pictures that i've seen on the on the internet so they won't look into that i believe it's the one that's purple right now that bright purple it's a different yeah yeah that one i don't know why we have purple lights but the county was testing some i guess they are testing uh they had some even on the bridge the area that we would be responsible for and i said no i wanted them back to whatever they're supposed to be so that's that's what the purple light and i'll i'll talk to jeff about that and see from the camera but just to clarify what we're doing with the sign we're going to look at okay maybe the lettering is red or green as opposed to white or a different color and we're going to look at adjusting the intensity because we can do that and but as far as the sign without the digital that's a pretty much on and off thing unless we do something else that we can find it dims but we can work with the digital sign the company told us initially we needed to burn all the what i call all the little light bulbs in there i may be calling more i think but they told me to make sure you burn them in throughout the site they'll put stuff stationary uh make sure it moves rather quickly right now we're scrolling in about six seconds we're gonna do away with scrolling maybe run it up to 10 or 11 seconds and i think some of the standards are like 15 seconds but we're going to play with that and we'll we'll do some adjustments i think that'll help the situation so what's it been here a month maybe is that not right yeah so yeah we're cognizant of the neighbors we don't we're not trying to impact them at all but the time the question was on the floor was the timing okay but yeah we turned it on at six in the morning the digital portion turned off at 10. and the reason we thought that is kind of what just said you know there's people that come home work different hours people that probably robin goes to work at five o'clock in the morning she's going to miss it but if she waits until saves you'll see what's going on so i think after as we adjust the intensity then then we can look at those other things and it may not may be a new all right other than that everyone have happy holidays and i hope that you take time to spend some quality time with people that you care about and also remember your neighbors thank you dave thank you guys okay um so a few items just some random things um just comments i heard from citizens lynn i don't know if there's anything well-founded about this at all but i'm just going to give it to you for taking a look into the boards on the walking easements get slippery don't know if they do or don't know if they don't never been there when they were wet please take a look if you would somebody was complaining about a submerged piling on 7th street i don't know if that was cleared out when we did the um when we did the removal or not but if you could just double check there shouldn't be anything submerged out there right now so um i don't need an answer tonight i just if these are just for you to you know stick on the list maybe and see where we're at um regarding the two citizen issues that we have here yes let me add to that piling issue there's one uh there's two that tony gavin went out with friends over the weekend and they were just leaving and barely moved out of where the buoy used to be there's no buoy there right now uh ripped the whole rear uh the lower unit off of off of this boat and they went back and they looked and there are two concrete piers that someone has deposited there i made them call you about it today but uh thank you for it here's the reminder at the very end of as you're leaving our inlet you're kind of going around uh you're passing howard right all right and you know there's that that uh the very end of howard where it's got the big dock that's it's on an empty lot it's directly in front of that beyond where the uh where the the buoy was and i i think he marked it with a green crab trap but whenever i can't talk to him yeah whenever i came out looking for it i couldn't find it yeah low tide it killed the boat so yeah i mean there may be one by the seventh street area too so you know maybe they hit the oyster beds i don't know but just have a look if you would just like waiting to be deep yeah just so you know okay the citizens issues um start with the sign uh i have no problem with us getting the hang of this okay i know we're working on it and everything but i also want another part of the deal with this was to be acceptable to the neighbors and everything's going to be working out right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to put this on for the january 15th work session for us to discuss a resolution to get start times end times and actually kind of say okay here's the way it's going to be done so this way everybody has an input into it and we get something codified and hopefully by then we'll get a report as to if it's not bright enough too bright just right you know and we'll kind of know that gives us another month and a half okay i know some of that's holiday you're going to be away so play with it do what you got to do with it burn it in you know and then let's see where we're at revisit it let's put it on patty if we would for the work session in mid-january this way we can bring it to a resolution in february and at least start getting this thing done because you know i think we should have at least the citizens should know here's what the rule is going to be we're going to keep it on x amount of hours a day and let this council pass what that should be so i'm going to propose that i'm going to ask that to be added on to the work session that's the 18th of january 18th of january okay i didn't i knew it would be around the 15th 18th january 18th is our work session okay these pictures um thank you for staying around sorry we couldn't do this earlier i've tried i really didn't know it hasn't changed no problem no so so you know there's two things here okay we have a code that we've revised and revised and revised and look i like picture number one where you've got this beautiful view it's absolutely gorgeous and then you look at this last thing and you're looking at overgrown palm trees it's terrible um but unfortunately you're not entitled to a view that's one of the that's a legal concept basically you're not so we as a city though can say you know this isn't like a building that was legally built these are trees and maybe there's something we could do with this so my suggestion is this seems to be this is a slower process it's not like something we can just do up here on the council but there's legal concerns because you may not be able to legislate this i mean we're fighting the folks across the street because they wanted a view because they said an umbrella blocks their view we're fighting them right i don't know if we can we say cut down these trees or trim these trees to the wall height or something like that so there's legal concerns as to what we can do as a city can you know where we overstep or where we not overstep but this is something i think that you know we said quick hitters for the citizen advisory committee this is something the citizens advisory committee can work on with the city attorney come back with the recommendation i would be if it's legal i would be in favor on these type of lots to say that you know maybe the wall is as high as you can go there you know there's just no reason to go up this high because you're just destroying you know a beautiful view um the other school of thought is i'm the neighbor and i want my privacy you know so i don't know where we're going with this one but we have a citizen advisory committee that basically will research this meat on it kind of get their opinions a lot of them the good thing is our boat uh have you known waterfront properties so i think they'll be sympathetic towards what's going on and um see what they come back with and then the next step would be for us either to amend the existing ordinance which you kind of saw in process tonight it's a two process reading we have to pass it once and then pass it a second time and that's how it would change if we're able to change it at all so that's the best i can offer you because we're not empowered to just change it on the fly and i wouldn't because there's definite legal concerns on this you know so i've danced on this one um i'm just trying to help you out you know what i've got how i was just going to say the other four of them reviews i mean we do those on a frequent basis we're trying to get into that habit and you know it's going to change something and unexpected consequences and we've had a couple of those so i guess i'm going to say move this one forward because i don't think we have a code review planned in the near future i did think about that it's actually says review permission to take a citizen question anybody have a problem deborah please come up here so he gets on the record i don't know if this is still the case but we were a tree city failure beach i think we still are do you know lynn and so the only thing the only reason i'm saying this is because when uh frontier orchard was collapsed our driveway and we had to take out a tree and stuff we you have to get a permit to take out a tree if you are designated for a tree correct mr reefs no no we're not interested not now we have nervousness so i don't know it's actually been that way for a long time it goes back to when i bought my property in 2005. you know i'm not i know i checked because i was removing a tree that was going to block my view and they said no you don't have to do it i did plan another i've actually had plenty of two trees to replace it so um let's talk about that seventh street pier uh seventh street uh pumping station um i have real good recollection of how that happened and i've said this story several times uh june vancouver and i was shopping in sam's club and uh she introduced me to county commissioner long and um i met with her and i knew that was a problem and lynn reeves will attest to this one of the things he told me when i was running is mayor don't waste your well i was a mayor he goes don't waste your time we've been trying for 20 years to get that fixed and it can't be fixed and i'm like well let's give it a shot i met her in a sam's club she was trying to buy her stakes i think and i was like you're not going to buy him yet i need to talk to you about 7th street turns out that it was coming up and she agreed to sharpen this thing through and if you remember when you and i went right afterwards to the to meet with the people in the county and we were able to bring this project home um it was 1.7 million 1.8 million all rounded to 2 million they originally thought it would stop all the flooding if you lived in that area every time we got heavy rains we had these big sewer trucks that just went 24 7 jet pumps no one could sleep it was horrible people were just going crazy and it's really reduced debt almost to the point that i don't think we've seen one in quite some time so it still may happen if they get an exceptional one they thought it might undo it but that was two million dollars and that was because of a meeting in sam's club with myself and the county commissioner and june school and then a trip to the county with lynn reeves so that's how we got that i remember it well and it didn't cost us a nickel with that said i don't think i have any other comments other than the merry christmas if you've celebrated hanukkah i hope you had a wonderful hanukkah a wonderful new year and any other holidays that you might be celebrating um i hope i answered your questions for you thought i'll be here afterwards and you can talk with me okay um see everybody in the new year and uh i'll entertain a motion to adjourn second sorry all favor we are adjourned everyone happy holidays"
