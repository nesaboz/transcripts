shirley here council member rita swope here vice mayor glenn gunn here mayor joseph manzo here and city attorney i'm sorry city manager lynn reeves here okay thank you um i'm just going to let everyone know we this is a little bit different than what we normally do this is kind of scripted in fact it's actually scripted word for word um and the public comments are going to come before we call for the motion so when i ask for if there's any public comments which will be coming right after i speak um and talk about the millage rate um that will be the only opportunity to discuss anything with regard to the tax uh for the tax proposal so with that i'm going to defer to the city manager who's going to read resolution 2020-13 mayor console this is consideration of resolution 2020-13 a resolution of the city of bel air beach florida establishing the final ad valorem millage rate for fiscal year 2021 for the city of bel air beach florida at 2.0394 mills and establishing effective date okay thank you so the millage rate for fiscal year 2020 through 2021 is 2.0394 mills which is higher than the rolled back rate of 1.9557 mills the rolled back rate is the millage rate that will provide the same ad valorem tax revenue as was levied during a prior year the rollback rate is higher than last year last fiscal years due to an increase in this year's property values by 4.95 the reason for setting the millage rate at 2.0394 is to fund expenses for the general fund for the fiscal year beginning october 1st 2020 through september 30th 2021. that's a prepared statement that was presented to me by the city okay with that i'm going to open the public hearing this public hearing time is the only time the public will speak with regards to the tax uh millage rate so at
