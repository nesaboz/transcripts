    "transcript": "good evening everyone and welcome to the work session um which you need to follow that meeting uh for september 20th this is a work session a regular work session for the council again please join me for the pledge of allegiance i pledge allegiance to flag of america and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all councilmember frank banker councilmember glenn gunn council member leslie otero president councilmember rita swope vice mayor dave gaddis mayor joseph manzo city manager lynn reeves city attorney fred riley here thank you um all right this little obsession it's a little less formal than a regular session but we're not going to get so informal when it's just going to be a shouting match or discussion where everybody's talking about so one percent of time is the rule [Music] will uh normally we don't have um normally we do allow comments from the public it's not actually something that's in our rules but the council has always relaxed that role is there any objection to allowing the citizens to comment i'm hearing none so citizens will be allowed to comment the way we'll do this is the council will speak about it we're not voting on anything okay so as we get to a point a breaking point um where it's appropriate i'll ask if there's any citizen comments and the same thing just come right up here speak at the podium go back to you so you can speak once on any issue three minutes um and then we'll probably you'll hear consensus if we have something that's moving forward or sometimes this is just a discussion we're not allowed to speak to each other outside of here so this is our chance when we can discuss things that are on our mind with that said i'm going to move to item number one discussion of possible code additions and or revisions concerning derelict boats and vote lifts and dots in service disrepair vice mayor gaddis made this motion and the explanation is community health safety and welfare during environmental events gas sure we had a storm not too long ago and um i don't know if it was because of the storm but the timing was uh was very close i think a lightning strike hit one of the uh docks or boat list that was already in uh disrepair it had a boat that had not been started in years or dropped so that led me to question uh what do we have in place right now for these types of scenarios uh so i took a ride in the boat this weekend and just kind of looked around and i didn't notice there are quite a few boats that have not been started much less dropped in the water in years you see the cables the the gearing the the whole structure of the boat lift is rusted looks like you could easily just push on it and knock the boat in the water so my question is for the council is is this something that we really should take a look at and consider maybe adding on to our code i see that someone provided us with it looks like samples from what other people's code is is that right yeah mayor console i gave you our section of the code currently and then there's some uh sections i found from some other cities that talk about you know derelict boats and how they handle that so that's just some additional information i try to highlight where it was discussed in the back pages but the first section is our ordinance so going back to that not only is it a hazard as we saw in fact uh robin saw it also this boat fell uh it started taking on water they didn't know what to do i saw what was happening there were a couple of people trying to wrangle it up to a dock so i rushed over there with a bunch of line and it helped them secure it which it just stayed there for another week or two and it wasn't touched again because now it's floating on the water but we all know it can't run and eventually it started taking on water sank and then flipped upside down in the water then i watched people i don't know who they were because it was too far away but you could see clearly they did not know what they were doing and they were putting their lives at risk by trying to turn this boat the right side up and bring it up out of the water someone could have gotten killed and the whole reason for this is because we we're not doing anything about these uh these boats they're just sitting out there waiting to fall in the water or possibly even hurt someone i understand that we we do pay particular attention to the docks and the seat walls but i think that the boat lifts and the votes are something that we're neglecting that's my thoughts i support this i saw that debacle happening i mean i've talked to lynn before numerous times about docs that are half in the water that have been like that for years or a boat that had a tree growing out of it because it hasn't been moved in so long and i'm not talking little tree i'm talking country um so now i'm all for this i guess the question comes with how to police it like we'd have to have somebody on a boat going around and we'd have to figure out those logistics but i'm going to be dave on this with a safety issue because and not only that but that boat floated away and hit somebody else's dock and incurred damage and who knows hit the passing boat that they didn't realize and cause damage and harm to life there so i i'm all for [Music] one way or the other and that's generally where the last time that they lifted it they didn't put the boat on correctly it may have been not running correctly to begin with and they came in limping you know we're just lucky to get it on that lift but generally the way that lifts are designed they take care of themselves and they automatically balance the body that you put in the center you you know this of course but yes some of them are a little sideways i'm talking about the ones that are in the water right now are there any permanent boats that just haven't been picked you know what i'm saying i've not seen so many uh that are that are in slips it's more of the boat lifts the ones on the slips uh they seem to be and they seem generally they're the larger boats and people tend to take care of them it's uh it's usually the 20 24 27 29 footers that go up on the left and they're just they're tired of it and and now it becomes not only a hazard but an eye sort of everyone in the community well most of those lifts have a quarter inch tablet pulls them out any of your observations but there's cables because those are the osha rolls or whatever cable has more than three brakes and it needs to be replaced probably strands of water so that would be an easy visual inspection is what i'm saying you seen something like that i'm not saying the voice is any better the mountain of the voice could be rotted where as soon as the cable is put to a task and it'll pull right off in the morning but stuff like that can easily visually inspect yeah um my thoughts on the uh on the boat lifts themselves is that perhaps maybe [Music] a good inspection would be let's see the thing work let's see you lower it and raise it back up because i guarantee you there's at least a dozen or more that won't they won't do anything everything's rusted you can tell there's no power to them and there they are holding the boat those are the ones that i worry about the most and then for the for the boat owner something else that none of us have considered if that boat's not being used at all and it's up on the lift it's up in the air over time the uh the boat plug hole is going to get plugged the debris happens the boat we keep talking about we know for a fact that thing has to be full of water because birds have built nests in that boat as soon as it the boat plug if there's no power there's no battery operating the the pumps inside of it it rains enough that thing becomes twice maybe three times as heavy as what it's designed for and suddenly you've overpowered that lift and now you've got an anchor it's going straight to the bottom of the water whenever that thing breaks these are just my thoughts i don't really know what you know what the council would like to see but i think it's definitely something that we should be addressing in some way or another even if we decide not to do anything about it at least i i will have a good conscience knowing that we discussed it and talked about it you know [Music] can we go into a person's property [Music] let me say to see if it works well you know let's unpack this a little bit okay i i i wanna hear about i don't know and i don't own waterfront property so i have no dog in this fight but my dog in the fight is to make sure the city stays safe and i think this is a valid concern a boat that has trees growing out of it and is falling apart is clearly a boat that's not being used but i'll take the other side i can buy a boat if i want and set it up on the lift and never use it you can't tell me how much i have to use so i think we have to figure out a way to differentiate between the boat with the tree that's clearly not seaworthy which you know we don't permit it with a car you can't put an inoperative car in your driveway that's dead that doesn't move you're all rusted out you can't do that you got to put that in your garage if you're going to work on it or something like that maybe something like that takes care of these people who just say i want to just put a you know an old boat that i'm collecting well okay put that in storage someplace maybe not up on a lift um in terms of you're talking about seeing the lift i like that idea we could easily if we want have an annual boat inspection now we're gonna need somebody to do this it's gonna be more work but that's your inspection once a year you get a little sticker from us that says it works we don't have to allow you to drop you know multi-ton boats into the water um particularly as i recall these things are hydraulic but they can work on electric do they not um they're generally motor driven not hydraulic there's so it's electric yeah okay so there's a safety concern if that thing busts up so i mean i don't see why as it was a concern to the city that you could you don't have you know how many waterfront lifts we have would it be something that would be so difficult to go out and do it you know this inspection would take all of what i'm in take you longer to drive to the next place to get to see it but it would have to be scheduled and you could set that up in once a year to show how the boatlist works and you get it just like you get a registration on your car you get a registration for your boat list something that can be seen from the water so that if we send code around they can see it i mean that's one easy way of doing it as you know the ones with the trees are easy the one though that guy's like you're talking about boats not being used and i'm just saying well it's my choice if i want to use it i see a lot of boats that are not being used there i wish i owned them they were beautiful but some people just don't go voting they go twice a year so i don't want to say you got to use them x amount of time but right when trees are growing out you know that's a difference that's that's fine i understand that i just think that [Music] for instance you've got a boat that's not tight it's not strapped to your left and you and hurricane is coming you should probably have the capability of getting that thing out of there because you're going to damage something if we get any kind of storm surge at all it's going loose and it's going to wreck everything in our neighborhoods friend i'm not going to ask for an answer i'm just going to say we're getting into an area of law i know pretty much almost nothing about which is maritime law you know dave just made a suggestion that sounds great for us to say hey your boat you got to anchor it a hurricane is coming but then we get into the whole coast guard regulations intercoastal water regulations i have no idea what the city's authority is to tell you you got to do anything on that if we even have such an authority i mean it sounds great you know i don't think anyone can disagree with i don't want you both floating around but you know um i don't know you know i don't expect an answer but i'm just saying we're getting into a fairly complex area i know with maritime law are we not one second lesbian you're right after freddie i like the aftermath okay my answer would be that start with the inoperable car analogy you code enforcement deals with that in every sitting you certainly can put something in related it would appear to be related to derelict boats and that that's the easy one if there's a tree growing out of it then it's probably a derelict boat the one that's swolled in the water and is overturned that's the definition of a derelict boat i would say the question you're asking that's really related to how do you force people to do storm preparation that's that's something i won't even venture a guest with now and something to look into but to me the starting point would be look at how other cities have handled the derelict boats because that's that's one end of the spectrum and see how other people handle it and how far you could go that that would be my suggestion uh yeah shall be issued on the condition that such construction will be maintained in a safe condition at all times so it could be just a matter of enforcing that having our code enforcement enforce that provision i also love the one i guess this is clearwater beaches um was it just tell us the page or on something well it's where they started the yellow stuff 33-05 the second paragraph down from the top and it's yellow okay saying it is unlawful for a person firm appropriation to store leave or been any barrel invest in any inevitable waters so something along this line incorporating that into our code i think itself yes i have a question for the city manager during your research on this and getting all this together for us did any of the other municipalities run into any major issues that they discussed or you know brought up to you by enforcing these rules and regulations on their uh citizens no it's basically what they were talking about is derelict votes and they're you know our definition we have a definition in their life quote uh i know what dave's talking about because we did a tour of the city after i can't remember when that was but it was several months ago and we went around looked at docks and sea walls and then we notified the residents and uh that you know maybe their doc wasn't prepared wasn't in safe shape so we gave him a courtesy notice and uh i can tell you or just with a little courtesy notice we didn't you know do any more than that so uh and we're working on the sea walls follow-up because we gave some for crack sea walls or horizontal cracks and vertical seawall caps so i think i mean i kind of like the idea that the mayor brought up about hey maybe give them a sticker and if that if it's possible to even do that you know if we go out on a tour and we see something there's a concern then maybe we should ask them to show that their oak lift is in a safe situation as an example that the tree boat that guy he he did take the tree out flying after we told him about how many times but uh i don't have the tree right i don't think that boat's ever left the place but that's you know that may be an opportunity and i i don't know if we do the same thing we did with the sea walls and dogs after the storm maybe we could do the same thing there just give them a courtesy notice you know and ask them for an inspection and my guess is that you know those you said 13 16 that you targeted those 13 people they knew they had a problem okay you just told them like okay come on you know get this done you gotta just you know put the the impetus in for them to get it done um so that's probably all that's necessary i i think this could work but we have to be careful i'll say this i say this all the time be careful about overreach okay um you know that sticker can be if you know we can reserve the right to require an inspection and you know so like what dave is talking about we see some rustic one that's blown apart well that one doesn't look very operative it might work okay so fine that will give you a sticker we won't see you again for two years um or maybe you know for equal to keep everything equal we have to do everyone in the city i mean that's gonna be a lot more work um i don't know how much pushback you're gonna get i mean you know people will probably resent the intrusion particularly you know again i don't own a lift but if i just bought a brand new lift i'm like what the hell are you guys doing here again this works go away you know it's warranted for whatever years and i don't need you here so you know i'm not sure how do we do it without alienating a bunch of the citizens you know don't you need you need permits to put it left and all that so obviously maybe permits on properties like days within the last five years ten years whatever those are automatically stickered because we know they're fine but it's the ones that maybe are outside of that range or never had a permit because before the time you needed permit those are ones maybe you start with inspecting and i don't think that i mean i think i i like the idea during a hurricane to secure but and we've done that and we've also what was it whichever one everybody evacuated for when we came back it popped the chains we had on so i mean at that point if it's a real hurricane that's going to come through no matter what you do it's going to prevent it but it's a good idea we still do it but i don't think you can force people to do that part i'm not an owner of a boat but what's your liability when your boat takes off in a hurricane it's the libel for floating around and can we handle people's houses we have insurance okay so there's so i mean it's to their benefit but if you know like anything else if somebody chooses to be somewhat reckless is that the same like if my car was parked in my driveway and flipped it off and hit glenn's mailbox and tore yeah i mean do you have to anchor it you know is it prudent maybe if you know a flood is coming to move it to higher ground sure but maybe you can't do it you know i had a car that um when when we had the uh irma come through i was not able to move that car okay it was just not able to be moved it was in my garage and thank god we didn't get any water but it that was it i couldn't move it move it now but i couldn't move it then and um you know whatever maybe the person's not even here i mean we got a lot of part-time residents so you know they could conceivably be in their summer home and hurricanes blowing through so but i think if we don't overreach this works so i have one more comment about this we like to pick on the tree boat a lot but i will say a positive on positive note that same person has a brand spanking new sea wall and c-cap [Music] i'm trying to figure this out so you get a really nice dock and a really nice seat and you have a boat that has a tree coming out of it okay again they can do what they want but to avoid well and then going to leslie's point these yellow highlighted may there's another one a few pages later d of whatever section you're in but capital b um that's also highlighted that may help with the derelict doc seawall bulkhead just basically saying that it's dangerous causing unreasonable risk of bodily injuring any person who may walk there on like that what i told you did i have a day when that was half in the water that you were talking about too like that would be a perfect example that it has to be repaired or so maybe putting these two passages in our ornaments or whatnot would be a good start and then we can go from there and tweak it as problems arise with it consensus is to uh well what dave you would work with um fred to maybe craft some addition here is that what you'd like i think so yes i've got enough information here where i believe we can come up with something reasonable that's uh not too imposing on the citizens but uh make it clear that we are looking out for everyone's safety can you do comment can you put something together and either because i don't want to vote on it like at the next meeting is it something we can bring to the next work session or is this something you feel so yeah no i think that this is a uh i'd rather present in a second work session uh and we hash it out before it ever goes to council the right way to do it uh yeah mayor fred and i are working on the planning boards chapter 30 right now so um and we've got some modifications to it so before we even bring that to the console we'll just add whatever additional modifications there's no sense doing it twice you know i think this could work if as long as it's not overreaching and obviously you know when we're doing code you know we cannot be on people's property you want so we don't want to be going heavy-handed i mean if you can see that the planks are missing the boards are missing from the dock from the water you're fine but you can't go and take a better vantage point on their property or something like that because that'll get us into major problems right so some neighbors will all right so we'll move consensus is to move forward in the way we just described correct no one's objecting okay thank you oh i'm sorry how do you do it i promised i was going to do it citizens any comments okay and consensus is to move forward all right discussion of section 256 mayor b the mayor shall preside over all work sessions regular special and emergency meetings of the city council and shall at all times maintain and preserve strict order and decorum in each meeting this is vice mayor david sporter state of peace freedom from confused or unrelated behavior and respect for law or proper authority a specific rule regulation or authoritative direction that's for merriam-webster's dictionary decorum is propriety and good taste in conduct and our appearance to conversations of polite conventions i'm sorry polite behavior in aaron webster i'll turn it over to you mr davis with one caveat i read this i'm hoping that we're doing this in a constructive manner and that's the way i'm going to take it and let's go forward of course basically the last council meeting i really just thought that it didn't go in in the right direction i believe that we're all better than the way we behaved i'm not picking on anyone in particular i'm going to say wheat because we were all there and we all participated in the meeting however i i will say that it's up to the chair to control those meetings and uh as much as i hate to bring it up i kind of felt like the chair did not did not tone us back didn't keep us under control and keep us with that order and a decorum that the charter calls for um sometimes we do get into heated conversations and sometimes things do get out of control but as uh section 2-56 calls out it's up to the mayor to uh to dial it back and and to help us get through this in a calm orderly fashion uh i felt like last week's meeting was anything but calm and uh i think that we're all much better than what happened last week and so i'm asking this council and the mayor to have an open conversation of how we can we can actually get along better because if we're not if we're not able to work together as a group how are we ever going to be able to work with people out there so that's that's my kickoff speech and i hope everyone has something good to say and constructively i think one of the things that could help these meetings run just a little bit smoother and better is that we are consistent with our rules i mean at one point you know it was stated you don't care about citizens comments and now they do care at one point there was no clapping laughing talking from the audience but it depends on who's doing it out there that we allow it at one point it was stated that nobody needs to call out specific council members but once again it depends on who's doing that that it's allowed so i just get really confused with all the rules continuing to change even down to the point where when i make a motion i'm never asked at the end for the final comment vice mayor uh gathers me the motion at night same thing deferred to the city manager and you ask him before his last comment i'm just curious as to why the rules seem really really different that's all i just think if we are consistent with everyone then that might help things run a little smoother let me cut in a bit here and then i'll come back and we'll go around first off dave congratulations and thank you for bringing the topic up so that's on my mind and thank you for the way you can handle the professional map okay i mean i'm just gonna take care of a couple of technical things and i'd like to get into something a bit better anger read as well i always come back to you on asking the question no i do so go back and watch the tape and show me which one i missed you on okay because i always ask it and you typically say call the question which by the way is an inappropriate response i know i have to call the question you just have to say no final comments tonight by the way is a work session so there is no real we there is no last comment to be made on a work session this is just a discussion but i will always come back to you and if i don't before i call the question raise your hand and just say you missed me i have one last comment the rule is the person who makes the motion gets the last word now sometimes that person will put in the last word and i don't want i never somebody said the other time again i'm not mad i'm not but i take offense when somebody says you cut off discussion i never cut off discussion i never called the question i call the question to read it but i don't cut it off i'll cut it off if somebody's monopolizing it and i've been cut off myself jody shirley one time said is like anybody else get to talk and i'm like yeah sorry about that okay because you do something dave said you get in the heat at the moment okay and rita you're shaking your head right now so that's one of the things we're going to talk about which is the body language okay because that's another thing that's in the aquarius and we're going to talk about it okay so i have the floor now and i'm going to talk and then you're going to get a chance to talk everybody's gonna talk got no place to go tonight okay so in terms of the rules okay the rules are the rules they're to be enforced by everyone and dave i'm going to do something which it takes a real man to do i'm going to admit that i was wrong on the last meeting that some of the stuff i did and the way some of the stuff was handled but i'll also agree with you that every pretty much everybody not everybody there might be one person here who wasn't at fault but everybody over the group of meetings has contributed to the indecorious behavior and i agree with you 100 we can do better this council has six more months together then it may come back exactly as it is now or there might be new people here but there may be changes whatever but for six more months we gotta do the city's business and we can do it better than we're doing it and i agree with you i disagree with one thing though that you said and i do want to highlight that okay you're absolutely correct on what section 2-56 says um but give me a second fred i'm going to paraphrase you even though you didn't speak to this issue fred reilly always tells us you guys make it complicated more complicated sometimes than it has to be prince says that all the time to us um so section 2-56 talks about decorum and i don't know why that you know maybe didn't make it here but i think it is something that if we're going to have this discussion i think we really want to review this a little bit because um some of the issues that we have and my ability to control this how to do my best um goes back to what some people say okay um so it's a short thing and i council members this isn't speaking to the mayor but i am a member of the council but it says council members while the city council is in session the council members shall preserve order and decorum see we're in this together all of us okay and a council member shall not by conversation or otherwise delay or interrupt the proceedings or peace of the city council disturb any council member while speaking or refuse to obey the orders of the city council of the presiding officers now i've had and i'm not gonna we're not using names because dave did this unbelievably professionally i get my kudos to how you handle this because this is gonna turn into another match we've had people tell me i don't care about robert's world support have interrupted others which causes them to fight back myself included we had it happen last meeting with somebody people who don't request permission to speak just start speaking and again this is a work session you can go ahead and speak but on a council meeting we you look to me you raise your hand you can say mayor you can say joe you can just raise your hand i frank i never want to play poker against you you should never play poker to me i know when you want to talk i can just see it in your eyes and like frank i know you want to say something and i turn to you and i'm like go ahead you know i tried to go through the group first and then come back the second time third time however many times it is then we have to go out to the audience we have some people who persistently want to call questions before the audience gets to speak it's illegal i can't do it so it's delaying the magnifying it's causing fighting it's causing problems i wish you would stop we can't do it the public has the right to speak so it's everybody's job here if you see something going on in the audience and you don't like it call it call the point of order and if i don't give you the ruling you want unappointed order there's an appeal process use it but just remember something as an example let's say john doe is in the audience and he is well we had somebody doing this i don't know what the person was making noise on a computer over and over again making the thing ding and ring and i said something finally the sheriff had to ask him to step outside and turn it off you know anybody can do that it doesn't have to be me it's wrong one time is an accident the sixth time you're disrupting the council session so we're all in this together i promise i will do my best personally and also trying to control things i need everyone's help when somebody says i don't care and i'm not saying who the person is they're on the table to look at them i don't care about robert school's daughter i follow point of order as mayor and you talk over me and say i'm gonna keep talking to the point that i have to stop the meeting and call fred reilly and lynn reeves into the office so that we can dispatch the sheriff to remove the person that's the next step that's nonsense why do we get to that point it just says if i ask you to stop stop if you don't like the way i'm handling things march 15th i think is the election vote me out you can do it so that's that's what i want to say we're in this together i will do i promise dave i will do my part if everyone also joins me and does their part and be consistent again i can go through consistency i have a whole list of stuff where i have to do it but we're not personally attacking people so i'm just talking how we can do it better i think if we follow that and follow the mayor rule robin i agree with rita 100 that rules should be followed the same every time i've said this so many times about the belair shores issue about everything what's good for the goose is good for the gander so i'm completely in support of that and i will say on my point a couple times seeing rules like the audience clapping and i know one of the first meetings she told us you're allowed to do a point of order and stop but i'll be honest i have no problem telling you guys to stop yelling at each other but i'm a little bit more shy yelling at somebody in the audience hey stop clapping just that's just me i own that i'm not aggressive enough and i'm trying to try to do that more but um you don't have to tell them you just tell me you just call the point of order and say we have audience clapping it's my job then to say is first is it well-founded is there somebody clapping and then i can say look please refrain we're not throwing it out because listen sometimes we get carried away with our emotions i'm guilty i clapped last time i did one clap it was a funny bank card made something that i thought was very funny okay i shouldn't have done that okay but neither should people back there be opening up coke cans and banging things and talking we hear it i see it all that's why i sit in the middle here i see what goes on in that corner of this corner i hear it it comes out on the tape we see what's going on but i hate to say it right now normally in the past we've had issues sometimes with the citizens it's us right now okay go ahead robin um no so i agree that all the rules should be uniform um i do think that we have trouble getting along sometimes and i think we will bridges um i really try not to do that i know i've had peace with some of you with glutton and i tried to look at your opinion objectively like you know the doc i'm sure if i really want to i could have torn it all apart just to be me but you were right and even you know no matter what i'm going to agree with you if you're right and i take it like i do and someone explained this to me of how i view these meetings it's kind of like in medicine i'm a surgeon if i work with a cardiologist and i just cannot stand that person i just cannot stand them as a fellow human being i'm still going to work very close with them to save that person's life and do what i got to do that's right to help that person i don't have to be his friend but i have to do what's right so i see it as the same way i guess the this analogy the city is my patient and i'm trying to do whatever i can to work with all of you to make our patient better so and i feel that way i mean we may not after all out of office go out and hang out and drink a beer but i'm also not gonna try to run you over to my car so i mean you see what i'm saying so my whole point is is can't we just all get along with the meetings we don't have to like each other outside and just try to work together to do what's best for the city regardless of our personal feelings uh citizens would anybody like to talk about the council david you go around a second time and good luck sure um another thing that i'd like to add is is right now we look pretty darn bad to all of pinellas county i i speak to people all all across the county i've spoken to several of the mayors and everyone is asking me what's going on at bellar beach why are your meetings so crazy it's imperative that we fix this and it's not something we can write down we can't write a policy we can't we can't make it a rule but it's something that you know we all know that we need to do this to straighten this out i think that if we're able to communicate with each other in a civil decent manner our meetings are going to go much much faster we're not going to have to be here until midnight to get simple things done because at the end of the day every single issue comes down to a yes or no vote and we just need to have a civil conversation debate it vote on it and then go home and that's that's what it's all about uh again what we do up here is reflected out there the more we do it up here the more it's going to occur out there and eventually it's going to spread throughout the city i don't want that for my city i love this city it's a beautiful place we've got great friends and neighbors here and i don't i don't want to be fighting with anyone over what goes on yeah other than just a simple disagreement uh that's that's my father hey that's the way it's supposed to be i cannot disagree with any of that but i had one thing not just this incumbent on the council here okay you know i don't know that everybody knows this i know the people here are regulars i think they know this probably everybody up here on this council serves free of charge didn't get paid for this so when people take to social media when people form groups bash the people up here that's not a real nice thing that's not going to engender a lot of positivity uh nora's doing press conferences and other stuff so all i'm gonna say is it doesn't just end when you leave the door here you can go home in the car ride and say man i don't like that lady or that guy that's fine nobody hears that but if you hold press conference or you go on social media then we're going to see that as i always said to people i didn't become mayor what happened without having a lot of eyes and ears in the town i hear stuff so does everybody else say what's the golden rule treat others as you want them to treat you i mean it boils down to that dave you've got my commitment i will do my best and i'd like to hear that commitment from everybody else over here and if we've got that i think we could have better meetings and the start and we could show you how it could be done because we're doing it right now to go to what you said i mean i agree that's not favorable to leave and have somebody bashing you on social media that fortunately that's the job you took on the public office i mean look at you know the federal level i mean no matter what they do somebody's either gonna love them or hate them they're never gonna make everybody happy so you just have to have a thick skin with that do i think it's right you know do i think it's sixth grade school girls who boy petty yes but it is what it is so we just have to have a thicker skin so i will definitely come in and i think i've kind of been doing this but i will do it more if that's what needs to be done to work better with everybody and you know the next meeting all hard feelings get wiped clean we start new fresh we keep going and we can get along thank you robin anyone else like to speak thank you very much and thank you for the way you brought this up and again this is the way it can be so and you can disagree people disagree but we get it professionally all right item number three then this discussion to clarify the protocol of passing the gavel this is brought by councilmember gunn um i hope the phone is set up properly so we can hear them sounding pretty good before so this says once the cable is passed it does not return to the regular chair until the item of business motion has been disposed of or concluded blame them yeah thank you uh at the last council session and it kind of surprised me when after making the motion the game was passed right back and i'm not quite sure if that was the intent of the change into the charter and so i did some uh some research on it and most of the forums i looked at basically jacked up [Music] to be made by the chair the business is concluded or uh disposed of before the gap was passed back to the chair and i think that the basic uh thinking and logic behind that is basically because the chair has proposed a motion or upset that he's basically stated that he and he's no longer impartial to a different side so i think best practice wise and i just want to clarify that that's an effectiveness that blends against [Music] and there are representatives [Music] thank you glenn thank you for bringing this up also and the way you presented that um let me clarify something because maybe it got missed or it wasn't noticed properly i remember the motion very well it was because of the consent agenda and i said um we were talking first off the motion that was on the floor was to pass the agenda and i actually think i brought it with me um i did um and so we had the um the motion was the approval of the agenda that was the main motion i forgot who made it i believe it was leslie and taro but correctly if i'm wrong it doesn't really matter but that was the motion the main motion i had an issue there were several items that on the consent agenda that i thought required by law the exposure to citizen comments so i said i'm not going to let this council do something that potentially could cause it an illegal problem because if you don't take citizen comments when you're supposed to it could be avoid action of the council so i said let's not go down there i'll make the motion so my motion glenn was to amend the agenda simply to amend the agenda by moving certain items out of the consent ejected into the regular agenda i passed the gavel upon a second with that we had our debate that motion my motion to amend the agenda and then the gavel stayed with dave gaddis dave called that question and got the vote it was approved and then he passed the gather back to me and then we went back to the main thing which was the approval of the agenda as amended so it did not get immediately passed back to me dave called that question in fact i remember because he kind of turned to me and kind of had a little almost whisper kind of thing on on the proper you know question and how it had to be called so that's what happened the last time so um but i don't disagree uh our charter actually addresses this so it's not something we have to um really deal with it says in [Music] four five a uh may or may read all these says the presiding officer shall vote on matters as a regular member of council but shall not move or second emotion unless the presiding officer passes the gavel to the most senior council member who will temporarily chair the meeting that's what it says so i think part of the problem also was that was my first time and i got a little confused uh there were a lot of things going on all at one time and uh yeah i kind of blew that one but uh so that probably didn't work right did you think you just had a question at the end yeah that probably did cause a little bit of confusion but i did not really sense that anything was uh was done improperly as far as um handing the gavel back uh did you have something that you thought in particular that just wasn't right any particular instance an example or something that you could kind of refresh our memories about because i i don't remember that you know you explained that and maybe while within the technical letter of the intent there i think where things got off the rails is obviously those things that were pulled from the consent agenda or highly opinionated or whatever and that's what we got is all the discussion so maybe maybe we could have followed you and just passed it back but your explanation is on point and i accept that obviously we understand what the intention is and we'll be looking for that in the future and if there's listen folks i'm looking out for you i have multiple times told this council you can't do it this way you know it's not right or what have you if i sense something's wrong i hit it with that okay if there's an irregularity you know dave just said something it was his first time wow there's a lot going on yeah there is there's a lot going on you're paying attention to the council you're paying attention to the citizens you're looking for stuff you're trying to think about the next thing you're going to say yeah you know it's not simple and and i thought dave did fine he had a question and just so you know there's nothing stopping me from providing you a piece of advice if there's something you're uncertain about i will always do that i'm not gonna let you sit here and swing that's not what we're trying to do so i think we handled it right um if it should have stayed with him for the actual calling of the agenda item that wasn't my motion i don't have my notes but i think it was leslie mataros i'm sure the city clerk has who made that motion i thought leslie made the motion to move the agenda in last time it doesn't matter but it wasn't me i know that so um but i think we're all in agreement if i make a motion i probably won't make too many seconds but if i make a motion i'm gonna pass that gavel over we did it before we did it on dave's motion um i had to recuse myself and we passed it to leslie so and it worked fine so when leslie finished that item i actually left the room she passed it back to me so i think we're doing it right but glenn if there's a problem if there's an irregularity stop that that's a point of order or a point of information that i would love to have called because we need to resolve that on the spot because if we i mean if we get the agenda wrong then everything we do thereafter is just a waste of our time you know so um yeah i mean please call it that i think we're in agreement unless somebody has a different opinion [Music] he said i have nothing further he okay so you're good glenn yeah i think so okay citizens any comments on this bring it back i'm sorry [Music] you know i plan on going to the citizens and then i'm going to come back to you okay i don't have any citizen comments so um back to you and council with you getting the last oh well there's no last word it's your emotion be satisfied tell us about you want to proceed if there's anything we need to do further than keeping an eye on it i think we're all in agreement but um whatever you have else uh going back to the previous item interesting that they have something to ponder at a later time is like right now with the relax the atmosphere is being transacted very coarsely very simply poorly and badly it's very bad so i guess the questions apologize what's the difference and where do we get off the rail of this guy and i think it's just uh maybe we stayed our logical case we had an opportunity to express a little opinion but then we just keep going on and on with expressing opinions and a lot of times when i know when i called the question or something else called the question is to stop the endless debater opinions because i think it's quite apparent that people's minds aren't going to change and what's going on so let's just call the question and get the vote over and so that we can move forward and press business and keep open and glenn i think you know questionnaire can answer that's kind of the way i look at this not everything's going to go my way and then i think that our place comes with a better opinion that you have the opportunity to stage your case statement the logic and the facts state the opinions and at the end of the day when they're both vacant you had your day just because it didn't go your way doesn't mean that if you have failed or nobody was listening it's just it didn't charity today so it's there's no problem with making a motion to call the question after the citizens have spoken there's a big problem making it before i can't grant that what you're asking me to do is first ask for an illegal vote which i'm not going to do i'm not going to do that i will stop the meeting and i will not do that i will not make the council vote on something that's illegal does the florida laws say that the citizens have the right to speak on any item that we vote on now if we had something for example um like the budget when we we don't want to cut any corners here okay like the budget we've had multiple meetings where citizens have had multiple times for input we actually could restrict the citizens comments we don't we err on the side of caution and i mean glenn to your point um we've had some pretty long presentations with certain people we're not getting into it but here's the deal if this council wants to put a time limit you can't just say you can't talk that's not something that the presiding officer can make that decision we're going to run into major problems and people start cutting off people's conversation but we can't put a limit okay we put a limit on citizens at three minutes um robert's rules of border general i think the house of representatives in these other places unless you're filibustering it's like nine nine or 12 minutes we could say you've got nine minutes and that's it now that makes patty's job a little tougher because she has to time everybody but that would stop somebody from doing an exceedingly long presentation we can change that ordinance if we want i have no problem with it and then everybody will be held to the same rules right now we do not have a time limit and robert just so you know robert's rules of order generally calls for 12 minutes for a person to speak we don't get too many people speak 12 minutes um but sometimes we do but you know if you made a presentation we want you to make the presentation but if this council feels that they want to limit it then let's put it up for an adjustment or a modification to the uh to the thing we're really off topic over here but i think it's a valid point and maybe it's something that should be brought up again if we want to talk about it if we want to put a time limit on the council members we absolutely can do that i don't think we need to get like that and put the time limit but you know i kind of agree with glenn sometimes we just keep going around and around and around we get nowhere but i think the solution is instead of saying call the question if you maybe say let's get to citizen comments maybe that will kind of pause our endless tirade we can at least hear from the citizens and then afterwards if we need more discussion we can but that may be i don't think we should limit anybody see robin that's my problem is with with me to say well okay sorry you guys can't talk i have to i can't cut off the council's ability to speak you consider you're not breaking a rule as long as you're not insulting a person or do anything that's breaking our code you know our decorum you can talk you theoretically could talk all night now we can say okay uh you know we're not gonna go to midnight we've heard it we got it um but you can't put not me not the next presiding officer you can't put that on us because then we're making arbitrary decisions in trouble not just saying no we're talking about anybody having to make that call saying okay yeah sure you know what robin good point yeah we've talked enough maybe [Music] [Music] hey you know why don't we tone it down let's hear from the citizens but if somebody if like leslie's like oh wait i want to say something like okay anybody else want to say anything we can go to citizens you know it's not saying shut up stop talking or talking to citizens it's just a suggestion you have that flexibility that's all i'm saying instead of trying to let's call the question like but if somebody really wants to be heard i i just want to make it just so clear if you want to be heard mike is here and you really can talk as long as you want but we have to thank you in a minute but you can go as long as you want your problem's right i mean you make a point we're all trying to convince people we're trying to do what's that everybody here is trying to do what's best for the city okay in their minds no no nobody argues for or questions when when the protocol is off track and you've corrected me several times on that and i appreciate it and that that was the right call at the time but when you start making cheap comments about who who's a lawyer you should have loved her mayor who's flying boxes that's where it gets off track and i'm i'm saying it now because i'm calling call it the way i sit and it's anytime like you call the correct protocol you're doing the right thing you're doing your job and saying keep moving along but when things start getting off track or cheap shots or passions opinions or whatever that's where that's where intercourse changes and i agree with that i agree with you glenn with that but i think that's instead of inciting more and by the same calling question that's what everybody like dave's done before and i've done like okay and then let's get back on track and let's talk to the citizens and glenn you know we're trying to avoid individual comments but you've made some about me and that's fine um you know i'll also tell you that sitting here making hand gestures that you know i guess supposed to be speeded up or that that's inappropriate it's just an appropriate question whether i'm a licensed lawyer come on the florida website please check it i'm a lawyer in good standing okay if i wasn't i'd be arrested those three guys back there could arrest me for practicing so you know these are cheap shots they're all cheap shots okay we've gotten into this gutter and again we're back on topic too so i'm going to try and bring us back to number three but um dave has brought it up he brought it up in a very nice manner i think we've all agreed to try and get along better we're doing very well so far tonight and we can do it let's see if we will do it okay i i you know i'm gonna do my best and i hope everyone else will join me i'd like to add something to that also i think another part of the problem we have with our regular council meetings is we try to make a decision without knowing without really knowing i don't i'm trying to figure out the best way to say basically i walk into every one of those meetings knowing how i'm going to vote occasionally somebody will change my mind however it may take two minutes it may take an hour and a half on these topics that are what i'm going to consider maybe controversial because it's it's we're at stalemate almost um these are things that i think that we should all hash out in these work sessions we should not be having these these knock down drag out arguments over a topic at our regular council meetings this is a much more calm environment we don't have a large crowd sitting out there that's it's ready to get in the fight and basically we should be able to have a rational debate in a work session so that whenever we come to regular counsel and it's time to vote it's a very short discussion yes we give the citizens the opportunity to speak but we've already had our debate if they say something that's changed our minds well then that's room for more discussion during that agenda item but i i just think that we're doing it backwards that we're not taking advantage of these work sessions like we should be because basically you put on your blue jeans and your dirty shirt and you come in here and you do get out in the work session and then whenever it's a regular council meeting you sit up straight and we all respect one another and we act like the city council and that's that's all i want to see well to that end dave i mean when we get to number four there's an item that i could have brought up on the council session and i brought it up to there so to the extent that you know we drive a lot of these items now city manager drives a lot of items too you know he puts the majority of the items on our um agenda so to the extent that lynn thinks some of this can be debated you know you can utilize support sessions i mean now i like that idea that we have some of this stuff out but keep in mind too i think some people do play for the audience and there is a certain you know the reporters are here and the cameras are here and you know so tone it down that's what you're saying and i think it's a good idea and then we're gonna have better and more productive needs you still could get your point okay i made my point tonight about the taxes robin made her a point you made yours leslie papers and we got it done you know it could be something similar to that again i'll try it but the disrespect you know and i'm guilty of it and i'm also guilty of receiving it from a lot of people and um it can stop them but obviously if somebody disrespects someone that they disrespect back and it devolves and that's what we had last time you know so i'll add one more thing to that as chair unfortunately you have you have more responsibility than the rest of us i know it's hard not to fight back and not to disrespect somebody but as chair you have to control not only the person who's doing it but you also have to to control the person receiving it and many times that's you many times that's others and i know it's hard but you got to stay calm yeah we have to stay calm in these meetings we we just look really bad i'm tired of talking about it i'm ready to move on okay yeah we kind of got off track because we went backwards so let's try and move forward we have anything more on passing the gavel so we think it's being done we think we're all in agreement with what has to happen um absolutely there's seven people on council if there's ever not only with the gavel but any other protocol i mean one time i think i went out of order you know like dave said it's not easy okay i got all these stuff up here i got little remarks you know if i forget to go to the citizens please somebody remind me joe you forgot to go to the citizens i'm not going to be insulted i'm going to say thank you because you know i don't feel like some citizens come the next day and say i want to talk and i didn't have my opportunity citizens if i forget to go to citizens like wait a minute i'll remember what i did that used to happen a lot you know in the past um sometimes in council meetings some of the ones that i saw in the past it just happens it's just the way it goes person up here is not perfect by any means all right let's move on to item number four then um this is my item and we have uh a discussion of code enforcement hours direction to deputy communications best practices priorities council first and field observation and any other applicable items that should have said this is the pinellas county sheriff's office community policing department code enforcement i had a very um direct discussion of this a couple meetings ago and i'm not going to do that we're going to continue with the spirit of doing this in a professional manner the reason why i brought this is because there has been um some at least some information that i've received with regard to code with regard to where our city manager is taking this i want to make sure that it's the direction that this council wants to go in um and that is the direction that the city should be going in okay i have some concerns these are not directed as a knock against lynn reeves it's to make sure that we're all on the same page i'm not picking on glenn gum but i'm going to use a quote that he made a while ago when i received a series of complaints from one citizen who was building a house didn't like the fact that um contractors were parking on the road okay and she was complaining about the city manager said manager i had several comments i didn't feel that the city manager had done anything properly okay i am fair all right he didn't do anything wrong lynn and i had that conversation when knows exactly what i'm talking about and um but there was complaints about you know about what was going on and glenn said well the buck stops with me i brought it up to council i want to correct that tonight because the buck does not stop with me i'm not a strong mayor i'm not the leader of this city um the buck stops with all of us if i get complaints that we're being too heavy-handed or we're being too light-handed then that's something that's going to come back to council if i get an individual complaint i do my best to investigate it including spending in one case two hours with a person on one block who was just totally screaming to me about the city manager's performance and i spent some time with that person okay and we went through it and it probably got corrected it was that simple so it's not here to rehash problems and figure out where we're going so here's where we're at right now okay we had code um being done in about eight hours a week but we started out with code being done at 12 hours a week then we got down to eight hours a week and now lynn is proposing that code be done with 20 hours a week so we're all over the place okay what is the optimal level for a city of our size that's my question i believe uh captain liners here is going to represent the sheriff tonight um we give direction to the sheriff and i think that might be something that is maybe not known or not um not being observed well um the city manager reports to the city council so it's our job to tell the city manager what we're looking for and we're supposed to know what the citizens are looking for because the citizens are above all of us right it's you folks that we're working for so you're telling us hey we like bella beach it's a pretty city keep it green there's a fine line between keeping a pretty city and going around busting everyone's chops because we got a really complicated code you leave a bicycle in your front yard for more than 24 hours you're in violation of our code you want a sentence for that don't you dare do that in my name as mayor because i'm not going to tell you that i think that that's a good idea so some of these things we need to say as a city council where's our focus we know what the focus is folks and the focus is forever in battle beach short-term rentals parking cars on grasses uh rusty boats and trailers and all kinds of debris in the yards and construction that's not supposed to happen that's what we're talking about that's where the big prime folks overgrown yards overthrowing grass overgrown shrubs that's what coach should be out there doing it's a learning experience liberty just told us about the boating thing 16 people cited not cited but given courtesy notices 13 of them on their own take care of it that's what you get if you're nice to people and that's the way i would like to see code enforced since danny dougherty's taken over we've had an excellent excellent relationship with the citizens i received very few calls and i'm the one who's going to usually get him sometimes let me ask him but most of the times it's going to be me and he's been spot on with his enforcement now there's something quite disturbing that um i heard and i want to make sure that it's not happening okay i'm hearing that danny is being told or discouraged from speaking to the mayor and to other council members that needs to stop danny is an employee of the pcso as is every one of the gentlemen in the back and the mayor and everybody else has a right to speak to them i'm not speaking to people on duty and if people want to speak to me i think i'm entitled to that as the matter i think i'm entitled to get some information about my city it's your money that i'm spending so i want to know how code is going to that end i'm going to propose tonight that as part of our pinellas sheriff's presentation we typically get the crime presentation i would like our code officer to come in we typically get a code report you may not be able to see it from there everybody knows what it looks like that's our code report sometimes it's in our package sometimes it's on our desk and it gives all the code things that happen for the month it's prepared by the sheriff um [Music] prepared internally that the sheriff gives the information i'd like the sheriff to come up so that we can talk with him we'll pay him only 15 minutes he's the beginning of the meeting it's not a big problem it gives us the one-on-one opportunity to talk to him and tell him you know you're doing a good job like i tell the sheriff gee zero crime you guys are doing great or hey you know what you're doing great but and then we put in certain what the butt is that they have to focus on the code the code the contract calls for ling reads to give direction to them but that direction to lynn reeves comes from us that's our responsibility so what i'm asking everyone tonight is take a look at code where we stand right now what's the amount of time we want to spend at 50 an hour what's the level of enforcement we want to put through to this town and be ready for the blowback you can say enforce every single thing and when that nine-year-old kid comes in and tells me they got a citation don't say the mayor told me we'll do that i'm going to tell you no i want the code enforced i want to keep the city pretty but i want us to be reasonable we have been reasonable very reasonable ever since danny has come on board before that when i went door-to-door campaigning for mayor i received numerous complaints and i vowed that if i won that was going to be one of the others we're going to fix it is fixed right now and i don't want to see it slip but i'm only one person here there's six other people so that's what the purpose of tonight is with that i've said enough captain liner at some point do you wish to address us and when would that point because i've kind of given the introduction and where i'm going with this do you want to hear from council for a bit and then come up here if you have any other questions i'm sure there will be okay we'll call you up okay i open it up to the council what frank i think it's a good idea for his whole time if he has to sit here for two hours before he gets we usually haven't come up right away but these gentlemen believe we're all on the table i bless you all right we're the only ones who work for freight [Music] what i'm saying is that i've talked to dan on the street he's pulled i pulled him out where i called him he's not only an officer or always in general complaints very professional i couldn't ask for a better job let me tell you something and this couldn't have been better timed i watched danny in action today now captain liner one of the things i'm gonna ask you about is doing these ride alongs i will sign any waiver you want promising not to bring any legal action under any circumstances i'll even post a bond if you want okay danny has spoken about it i want to see what his job is like but today i did a ride along from my home office because there was a person who had a um let's just say something in his yard that he shouldn't have had okay danny spotted it glenn's laughing he knows what i'm talking about okay i mean if you're gonna hide something don't hide it on golf boulevard okay danny nailed them all right so this person is not an easy individual to work with okay this is the same person by the way that danny got to really clean up his house and look really really spiffy it looks great so danny spots this he gets out of his thing and i'm watching this all go down and he goes over he documents it took about 15 20 minutes for him to do all of this he's almost done goes back into his car couldn't get him okay they may have been in the house and they just didn't want to answer the door i think they knew what was going on but they didn't answer the door so danny goes back because he did have a prior conversation with him and i see him in his truck in his police vehicle picks up his cell phone and i think i'm like he's calling the guy he did the extra thing he went and called them got in touch with him well the item that was in his yard no summonses no brandishing or weapons no body slamming just could you please take this out of your front yard on gulf boulevard because it's been there for you know a couple of days it's gotta go it was gone within two hours it was gone that's compliance no hard feelings from anybody by the way he found that no one called that in okay that's what we're looking for okay your lawn's too high you know i had 102 fever my wall got hot in my car i better get this cut i had 102 fever i got out as soon as my fever broke and i cut the lawn but you know if you come in heavy-handed and it's like boom boom boom you're got you know your lawn's too high well that's what they did up in dunedin and it turned out the guy's landscaper had died and he was a veteran and that they went viral and the mayor was getting death threats and it was a horrible black eye for the city we don't have that we got a great code enforcement officer you hear that captain miner great not good great okay i've seen him in action and he is the consummate professional not just with me not just with frank but with all the citizens i saw it again today you cannot handle that situation better and this is not an easy guy to deal with now i'd like to say that i've been very pleased with him not just with his code enforcement but with who he is my mom was taking care of my kids they were off school and my son i guess was bored and he was throwing the baseball up against my house and so danny stopped and said hey you want to play catch and so for like five seven minutes ten minutes whatever he played catch with my son which my son's always thought the most amazing thing ever and not only did it make an impression on my son but it made impression on me and my family and just those little things that personal touch we've been missing in this city and yeah so that's why i fully supported him in my eyes he could do no wrong at this point so i'm fully in support of him robin in terms of i mean i'm trying to get a feel you know my personal feel is what i saw this morning is what i want to say okay when danny the first time they were fixing a leak okay and and i saw danny okay i had a link on my roof they had to come and put a little patch then on it and this was two years ago danny look i'm the mayor here's here's my take on this okay you're not the gestapo just come in here and tell people what they did wrong most of them don't even know it we've got a code book that's crazy okay nobody has one bigger um just tell them what they did wrong they'll fix it most of them now you're gonna get the guy who's gonna say well you know you go to look wherever you're supposed to go to well that's fine then you deal with him okay and he has he's dealt with him very fine and he will ratchet it up but i like the idea of getting the compliance and the fact that he made that extra step he could have just slapped the thing on the door and walked away he's like you know what i can take care of his right on the spot that's going that extra mile that's what i was talking about when he's done things for people he'll take your garbage in if it's out there he's not going to sit and sight you because your garbage is out 24 hours and 15 minutes he's not going to do that he's just going to throw it on the side of your house and go on his day he doesn't have to do that that's not his job he's excellent so i mean this is my idea but i mean if the council wants a crackdown well then we'll say that but we're going to do that uh you know we're like dave said we're going to kind of hash it out here but i'll put it up for a resolution then on the next meeting and you authorize that crackdown but you own it okay and i'm not going to vote for something like that um so you know i want to give the direction to our city manager to say the council wants a pretty city we want him to use his judgment it looks very pretty now and i drive around it i like the look of our city so unless somebody's looking for something different and i do want to hear from the citizens on this too so but council you've got the floor sure one one piece of the puzzle that's missing is uh is basically the the i guess the way that uh directions are given to them i'm i'm not aware of those i've not seen them i don't know if they're published or if they've come across our desk but i i don't think we have enough information to determine if there's a real problem or not and so what i would like to see is is what type of instruction set he has given from from the city manager and uh and then we start there and and kind of start analyzing that start at the very very top okay here's your instruction set well are there any sub instructions that are given verbally or at a later date or something like that or is is this your guide now go go out and do good things for our city i'm i'm not sure i've met him one time i've had a couple of neighbors say that they've uh either been visited by or a next-door neighbor uh was was being visited by uh by the sheriff and um you know i haven't really heard anything any major complaints um but i definitely would like to look deeper into the uh the whole situation just to see if there is any room for improvement or if we need to dial something back because i don't know i just like i said i'm looking at this i don't have enough information i agree with dave that's a good idea and then one of my concerns too would be to make sure that the direction is uniform not this side of the road and force this but on this side of the road don't report like it has to be what's good for the use it's good for the uniform rules everything's enforced equally and honestly i think because he is not a city employee and because he is the sheriff i think he's the perfect one to be able to do that to enforce everything informally and not take sides on an issue not have an opinion just like hey this is the code this is what it is i you know you can't argue with me that for whatever reason i don't care who you are i don't care that you're the mayor stole the code you gotta follow it sorry he but um and then i would say as far as the take of whether or not to be stripped or to be lenient i'd say common sense i mean you're not gonna you don't know that bike has been there for 24 hours maybe the kid moved it three inches to the right or went around and dropped in the same place there's no way to you know and then if you go after a kid's bike well what about a rocking chair that could be a toy a form of entertainment so you're gonna attack everybody in the city with a walking chair on the porch so if you get too strict then you're gonna get into those little nitty-gritties because yeah i would be very upset if i got a summons because my kid's bike was there i'd be more like hey maybe you should bring it out of the rain so i don't want to buy a new one you know so that's just me just everybody gets the same enforcement there's no special favors and uh common sense yes and then frank yes i'm going to actually direct most of my questions to the city manager the direction you're giving him currently um when he gets turns in those reports is that following the directions that you're giving him because those reports are very thorough very knowledgeable and it appears to me that he is covering the same things you know doing what it's supposed to do on code but also on both sides of the street because i like to see what streets are on there and what they you know what's going on that's uh one thing i wanted to ask you the next thing is um this council firsthand observation honestly i am not a big fan of that i think it would hinder our code guy as well as put us in a spot with the citizens because now we're out there we're the ones uh picking on him so we pull up with him and he writes a ticket or whatever i'm not a big fan of that i think that's his responsibility and like a personal life for that stay under him but i'm just curious that the reports match the direction that you give him and do you give him directions and he doesn't do i mean that's what i'm curious about well we don't danny has a process we if if we have a complaint that comes in we'll give it to danny and that may be his first priority for that day but other than that we don't you know i don't really tell him to go you know to this house or any other house he does that on his own unless we get a complaint now if we get a complaint then that's what he does and for the most part he he goes through the city uh he comes in at the beginning of the shift he stops by says if there's any complaints the end of the shift he comes back and updates his book because what happens typically is somebody will call and say you know what about this and that's why we we keep the log book that we do because then we we at least have the opportunity to say to that citizen well the reason he gave you a courtesy notice and for the most part that's pretty much all he gives other than a short-term rental or uh grass we have a system where if we've told them to cut it and they don't cut it then we send a letter out that's in a paper letter because you can't keep going back to the same people over and over and over they'll they'll tell you they're going to code tomorrow and there are some that will tell you that so in that process we don't contact in the second you know the second or third time we just go cut the grass and send them a bill prime example is the house on the car okay goes we've been down that road many many times with that homeowner and it doesn't work out the house is on 15th street which the mayor is well aware of danny's been there probably 30 or 40 times it's the but it's the same complaint well they're not doing anything wrong it's this person just doesn't want to park across the street from her house that's the bottom line well where do you go if you're building a house you gotta park somewhere and our code authorizes southern department but for the most part the doc thing uh we didn't give him that list we went around got all that stuff the docks and the seawalls he was given a list he went around and left if he talked to him he told him if not he left him up courtesy of us so that's pretty much the the only real direction we give him is if we know there's a short-term rental i'm going to give him some direction because i'm going to say and sometimes you know we don't get all the information we need so he ends up having to go back the second time but for the most part that's that's the direction we give him and i want to leave i mean i do want to have a kind of get a better idea what i know what other cities do i mean i've reached out to some other cities i know as i said i know a code officer so i don't know that we really need 20 hours every single week that's a thousand hours a thousand dollars a week to patrol i mean it may be better you know it seems like 12 seems like it's kind of in the middle it seems like that's about the right number with the proviso that you know sometimes all hell breaks loose for no good reason right and all of a sudden i mean here's a simple thing right there was a thing in the guy's yard and you say maybe i should take five minutes well it didn't it took like 15 minutes i can swear i could swear under oath he was working every minute that he was there he's taking pictures he's knocking on the front door he's looking stuff up he's checking things he's checking his code but he's writing this stuff up he's documented for the sheriff's cad system i mean it's not just a quick thing yeah if it's a garbage pail yeah you can toss it on the side of the house but i think some of this takes time i guess there's weeks or days that all hell breaks loose in the city and everybody decides they're gonna break the rules at once and then you know other ones where he can sail through the city and just complete it quickly so i'd like to leave that flexibility that we don't give direction i don't i never have ever given him direction i've told him here's the way i see it and if it gets to be a problem then the council will be here because everybody here has an opinion too but what i'm hearing tonight is that i think we're all saying hey common sense continue steady as she goes as dave said we don't have all the information i think it's a good idea to hear from danny keep yourself some flexibility maybe with the hours we don't have just because you're budget 20 you don't have to use it and maybe you use some of that for special enforcement like what dave was talking about like maybe we get in a boat and we go take a look at these boats and docks and stuff that could be kind of a a special hit or whatever yeah you know he's as an example i've never had him work on any days that the office has closed other than sundays and so he understands that as an example but what i'm proposing to do with after october will be october 4th give some more hours to him we'll put some additional weekends in there and then fall back you know and if if it's too much we'll shrink it and do something something else you know if there's a particular problem but for the most part to be honest with you we don't really have a major problem in the city it's it's a few i think i have i think i want to say 12 or 15 houses that have an abatement letter because we told them and you know they'll maybe cut strip around the yard and they'll say well i cut my grass well i know you did you need uh examples actually in vdi there's a yard we cut a couple weeks ago on 20 seconds here so this house on the corner another example uh but that's you know the public works staff don't want to go cut this grass but you know we have to do it to keep because you know another resident says something to us about it so it's better that we're more proud i think we you know as far as the ride-along that that's what it is field observations are right along right now you can't do it uh because of colvin my understanding is what you have to do is sign away when you have to get approval but anybody can do that that you know any of the council members want to go for a ride the plastic seat in the back's pretty comfortable and he's lying well you know if you look at the japanese cars and usually the front seat passenger seats you don't want to be in the back seat so uh yes so that that's kind of wrap with this if a resident calls and complains then definitely we're going to send the government right there and communications i mean i want him to feel free to speak with anyone certainly citizens and absolutely council members you know not on duty this is you know when he's on duty he's on duty he's there to work i mean it's hard enough to get through the city but um any council member that has a question and i i would like to see him at least for a while i'll come up and do this i think it gives the citizens a chance quite frankly sheriffs you guys do a really good job in this city we don't have a lot to talk to you about during the sheriff's portion of the show okay i mean when you come up here it's like yeah we had like one burglar in the whole city well what am i supposed to say that's bad i mean most mayors and council members would kill to have that kind of situation so we don't have drug dealers on the corner we don't have crack houses i mean we've got a wonderful city and some great work by you guys to make it happen so we're not gonna you know spend a lot of time but yes he frank to your point he will be paid for every minute it's the beginning of the meeting and if we have a night where there's gonna be a million citizen comments for some reason citizen comments do come first but i mean if that's a situation we could always slightly on that day change the agenda move the sheriff first take care of it because that would be a quick one you know we don't usually get too many citizen comments but we could call them all if we have to and move that one on the agenda so captain captain i'd like to invite you up to just fill in any blanks here and then i'm going to call on citizens and foreign you want to speak before yes i'd like to read uh two provisions from the contract that you just recently approved and they relate to the first is paragraph five which relates to sovereign immunity and part of that says the parties agree that the city's determination to provide code enforcement services by contract is an exercise of the legislative planning function of the city and that at no time will the city exercise any specific operational control over the activities of the employees of the sheriff or shall it perform or undertake any acts that are over and above a planning level function with regard to the administration of this agreement so that's the code provision that applies going forward the next provision is section six which refers to the provision of service and one of the sentences in that sentence or section says these specific hours of work of this community policing deputy shall be determined by his or her supervisor after consultation with the city manager so that's what lynn is supposed to do the whole discussion tonight from from my perspective is the city council should talk about these issues and give little lynn direction as a city manager and then lynn is the liaison with the the sheriff's department but they were a sovereign immunity and they will act the way that within the scope that they they think is appropriate the delegation of authority with code enforcement in many ways comes down to due process and you'll need to as the council since you have delegated it to someone else to do it in many respects i would encourage you to be largely hands off other than giving the city manager direction so that answered several questions that have been raised and i wanted to make that clear before he had an opportunity to speak although i probably took some of the words out of your mouth one more thing captain before you go and then we're turning it over to you i just also want to add another piece here is that the sheriff's an independent contractor so it's not up if we have a problem if danny's not doing the right job again as council members is our point of contact okay no one's asking for that to change but if we have an issue with them or we're getting complaints or something like that we'll bring it up that's why i'd like him to be here but then he will communicate with the command staff cap the captain and whomever if necessary all the way up to sheriff culture to get the proper thing danny's not the only sheriff who does code enforcement he does an excellent job we're thrilled with him we don't want to let him go but if for some reason there was a problem there's alternatives with the sheriff's office but we're committed we just signed the contract with the sheriff's office so with that captain over to you all right i'll try it your mic is on no there you go all right i'll try and answer any questions that weren't already answered um so realistic back when you all first started doing this and we do code enforcement part-time code enforcement for five other risk patterns so every one of them what are they the cities uh balor shore bell or bloss northerington beach burlington beach and oregon shores and danny is actually the one he'll do reddington shores bellar gloves and y'all but anytime we start up i have never walked into a meeting where there's a mayor or council member that says our goal in code enforcement is to hammer our citizens and we want revenue you know it's never it's always just to have a nice community safe community and all that um and then they have rules so you have that so everyone i've ever talked to was if we go out and talk to somebody and get compliance that's what they want and then if you didn't get compliance then there's a certain procedure you can go through that elevates things that's kind of that's how we're doing things here it's how we doing the other five municipalities so that was day one it's like coming in saying that's what you all want is what we do everything is that's the direction we got so we started off with that and then we were talking about renewing this contract was talking about hours and such and i mean with the city manager about it and this time i had danny down there these aren't billable stuff because obviously i'm salary so these guys but anyways danny's on the hours out here but we come down and we have a meeting to make certain we're all basically the direction you give in and we're all in the same boat and we talked about what it really came down to was trying to get a baseline and when 20 hours i think a part came out was kind of like well if we did four hours because sometimes four hours is too much and sometimes it's not enough it just depends on whatever day anybody can go out in five minutes and write an ordinance violation hanging on the door and go but you saw today to do it the way we believe the town's interested in doing it and talking to people and getting compliance without you know money watch types it took 15 minutes instead of five so if you're talking to a couple residents you get sick street and you're done with your day so it just depends on what's going on so the way we looked at it was if we had four hours a day for for the week and then adjustable not the same hours because then everybody watches one right and then as soon as you go then everybody's calling because he's gone so we did a little adjustment there then we were talking about sunday construction stuff like that so it's like okay well we can adjust one and come here maybe another ones we adjust for the meeting or you know for if we're going to get a report one time or something so there's a lot of flexibility but whatever you tell anyone want he'll call me and i'll sit down and make sure it gets done so that's kind of where it is and then when we talked and then already talked about this once we get that baseline it's like hey four hours you know we're just stealing money here we're not looking to make money or anything uh but if it's too much code then you talk about it you're going to back it up through the do the traffic whatever it may be but that was talking about october 1st to kind of kick this new new coat off to get a baseline that's kind of where we got all that and just so you all know danny's day realistically he'll come in and then i think every hit on this he'll come in he'll check in the city hall see if anybody caught in any complaints and he'll start with those hearts and then after he does that let's say he'll start at the very southern portion of the city and he'll start working street to street he'll go as far as he can until about a half hour 20 minutes before the end of his shift but go back to city hall give lin an update on it complete the book the law excuse me um to show what was done that day and that kind of that's kind of the end of it so if it's a day that there's everybody's in compliance it's not going to take that long to drive the streets and he'll get the whole city covered if his day everybody's out and everybody's got tarps up or cars or their lawns which is funny they hear all these different things then he might let's say he just stops at 18. okay well the next day he repeats the same thing come in check in anybody having complaints he'll start at 18 and he'll ground up groundhog dog day he'll go up to the end of the city and he'll come back around here to get back up to 18. it kind of works like that ron robin type thing so he's doing patrols as well um so if residents call in lynn's the one who lets danny know what's going on and we address those so your all your constituents their concerns are yours and other than patrol and then it comes down to split specific i've obviously heard grass before that one seems to be a big one short-term models i hear uh so but it just depends on what each town is which each city wants so realistically the other aspect of not talking i know your attorney talked about the only thing that kept bringing my phone um the only thing i told dan was i'm like danny get new code enforcement what do you think how many hours you think it should be what your schedule should be that's from being a city manager workout i said other than that just just please just do code if you need to diddy's a great guy you guys all the you know ladies know that and just so anyways that's where that came from i'm like quit talking about all this other stuff you're making my phones driving nuts so that's what i and i told him that but so you know dean and i go way back to our community policing days so he was my corporate community when i was a sergeant so he's built that what he's built with let's work with people to get things done and done it's a nice way i mean we could be the hammer if we have to let's try it this way first danny retired from here as a lieutenant i coached him back because when we started talking about coke uh and but he started at reddington shores and then we expanded when you all came on he came up here and then obviously to build their shores but rather short excuse me came online he's doing that as well so so i joke with him he is he he's built for this position specifically so that and i'm obviously biased i should say but i've worked with him a better part of my career so i think he's the right person i think he's right fit for the town and stuff for the city excuse me but it's like whatever you all want i just want to kind of at least tell you that's kind of how it's working right now and that's i can fall apart where the 20 hours came from and then once we hit this october 1st and we kind of get a baseline then i'm sure mr ruiz come back give me an update and stuff and then so once we're past the code protocol the right along is going to be an issue and then we can schedule out all they're not going to get on the schedule to see if you have um if he wants to get a code enforcement update type deal so i have no problem sending them here to do i got to sit down and say look you're going there to talk about you know this is the code of course needing to under the report just like the monthly report but i got to watch the sidebar that's the only thing that's why i'm here he'll be here to discuss code your other um you know you send everyone it could be anybody we have so i have sergeants deputies with whoever you send you yourself i think have made them so um whoever does the regular report but i would like to just at least temporarily until we kind of particularly now if we're going to try something new um the the only thing i just wanted to add though is he has a couple times heroically gone what's a hot call okay we don't get too many of those in bellar beach all right from my perspective not as mayor just as a citizen i can't thank him enough for do that if that's me who fell down the steps or me whose house just got a home invasion i really don't want him worrying about the grass that's too high on 12th street or something okay leave the grass you come back to it later which is exactly what he did he kind of hit the timeout button went and cut you know handled the hot coal and again we only get you you don't even have to go through it you know we don't get a lot of these take care of the business and then come back out and you know and do the other stuff and the other thing i don't know if you're aware of what he did with the one lady who it was almost like a commercial or she had fallen and couldn't get up for days and she was near death he found her in that house i mean that is incredible work for any police officer for any sheriff and i mean he's not a big awards kind of guy i'd give him an award tomorrow for saving that person's life okay but i know he's not a big rewards kind of person he's just that's him but he he deserves the highest accommodation he saved that latest life for sure that was by doing gold here that's a little beyond what he did what the normal code officer ever would do but um you know i don't want that to change uh captain and again at least there's six other people here but you know he's not here for a typical you know somebody's having an argument with somebody but somebody's you know busting down the door or drawing weapons um yeah this is the second obviously the secondary benefit of us doing the code that we're not gonna turn away from an improgress type thing danny's danny's just committed is what it comes down to i mean he's the only one i think in the one meeting i told him he was doing extra on his time which i'm like damn you can't do that there's all kind of federal stuff here and i go dad you are going to be [Music] anybody else anybody has a question for this one here it's on their citizens i love the citizens that have the opportunity to know just curious how does he uh since he's patrolling three municipalities how does he keep up with the differences from city to city and obviously the code is going to be different in every single one of them for every single topic so it's going to be a height issue things like you know you know what i'm talking about how does he keep up with it all he's still learning a lot of this like stuff with bellar beach and stuff but he's got references so i mean realistically there may be a difference between between the height amazingly a lot of the towns in the city have similar issues so there might be this might be eight inches this might be 10 inch ideal height but so we've always got to know no is the difference in that and it really comes down to i mean really what's germaine for this city you know and really when you think there's probably about ten ten things that are on everybody's mind um nine of those things may be readings and shores and then you have a tenth one here but i'm telling you when they sit here and listening i'll rattle and stuff off yeah i got that there they're all they're ultimately a commonality have the other uh municipalities uh offered some sort of a chi chi or something does he have what type of materials does he have or is he's please don't tell me he's having a look at munich to figure out how to do his job he's got he's got access to munico um i haven't talked to wreston shores in quite some time so generally generally what it is you come into the city you have these top 10 things you have those top 10 and then you dig for the other ones so you already have that kind of in a little i want to say on the board roll it um as i said i guess today would be like some type of computer but you'll have what's most prevalent for the city and then you have access to dig down into the other stuff when you encounter somebody or something that's off the wall then he still has access to that so it's kind of like i guess a quick reference guy i'd have to i'd have to give him because i know the other day i don't know how he does it they kind of developed their own little quick reference guide for that um he actually showed me maybe this will help you out with your question this the deputies that are in charge of each city they go around looking to which you know with the beauty code in most meeting codes when you look at them the cities are pretty similar might change like you said push shrubs but the depth the the full time deputies is what i'm trying to say get in touch with danny and tell them these are issues that you should be looking at that they've already noticed and if you look at the file you can pull up any resonance or any problem and there's a case history right right with it and i think you guys just do an excellent job i mean i sleep well because of people like you i mean i really thank you for your service thank you very much i'm going to jump to the citizens then we'll come back but i don't want to lose this opportunity we have the captain here so anyone would like to speak john hensey and then june captain i'm just gonna so if you'll just step just slightly to the side they'll come up and speak and then you'll take them out back outside over here this way i'll stay covered proper here you open up this discussion was something that i have heard multiple times that i find very troubling but i kind of sort of understand it but still don't that yes danny is an employee of pinellas county sheriff's department but what bothers me is that unofficially i'm going to say he's prohibited from talking to council members if that's going to change tonight and if i may yes our council members they're also citizens of the city and i have an issue if this is actually true i've not had an opportunity to interact with danny maybe that's a good thing but i've heard nothing but good things outstanding things actually where he consistently goes above and beyond to go play ball for a few minutes with a boy that goes back to the original community policing or saving a woman's life he's a keeper this is one citizen one taxpayer in this city i do not want him to go away but i'm concerned about this unofficial order he's not to talk to counsel i have a real mission with that and if i may i'll give you an example in my duties as a command master chief of naval command part of my responsibilities was to mentor and teach junior officers sometimes they didn't like it you can't talk to me i'm an officer um excuse me i'm a chief petty officer times three by then that's part of our job as chiefs is to mentor and groom you to be better even the commanding officer in his advice this is the right way to go or no it's not so i really have an issue with this and i'd like some clarification let's get it captain liner captain i'll tell you where it comes from okay i make no bones about it oh danny and i from the get-go i never knew him before he came on our city i've been impressed with him we've had conversations he's afraid to talk to me not because he's afraid of me but he's he's got the let i'll keep this because we've been so well behaved tonight he's either gotten the impression correctly or incorrectly that he's not to talk to us and i've heard that's happening with other counselors it's cleared away right now okay not only for danny but for all the sheriff's officers okay they should be afraid to talk this is prohibited just let me know and i'll discuss it with shadow of goldberry as soon as i can get an appointment with you i want to know are sheriff's officers and code officers i've never tying up their day i don't expect them to talk three hours when they're on duty but if they're on duty off duty if a council member approaches them are they permitted to speak with them and give information about the city and discuss what's happening what's going right what's going wrong what problems they may be encountering is that permissible within the pcso rules any of the deputies and talk to anybody the only thing with danny where it came ahead was when it comes to operations and direction and saying you're going to work these hours or you're going to do this like dang that's got to go through me and the city man absolutely so talking to daniel when the conversation was obviously was just to say i would hear this and they would talk about this hour and things would come back to me you're killing me when you're talking operations operations leading up to me in the city manager other than that i expect them to talk to everybody talk to all the residents and talk to all the citizens and talk all about that that's obviously no issue there that's that's where it was where it was from and i think some of that too if he comes here every council meeting i mean first of all might be longer than the next one but he's right in front of us we can ask the beginning how's the 20 hours working you think we need more we need less what do you think one thing i don't want to do i don't have to tell you this we don't want to tip our hands okay so you know if we want to step it up on the weekend we don't have to tell everybody that but you know if we don't we just don't want to say you know we'll be out on sunday well i'm sure then everybody works saturday but um otherwise i mean i think we all should get our information i've you know i've had conversations with you i you know you and i have discussed many things so i think it's fine i don't give a direction i can't tell you hey you better start patrolling you know fifth street more you know but if i see something going on or there's something that you and i had a discussion not too long ago i'm like i don't know if you really want to do that you could say hey i don't care what you have to say or you could take that and keep a little piece of your mind and change something it's up to you but i mean i'm not no one here should be telling hours or here's your new schedule for next week that's not our job that is clearly the city manager's job but in terms of him talking to us about anything you know which is but then again within your code you should you know there's a criteria for he can't talk about active investigation or something like that no one's looking for that information i don't think i guess the real way to try to clarify it like the citizen's perspective is anybody else you bring it to the intent to call anything to the attention of any of the difference to include a code enforcement issue with deputy daughter i guess where it goes from there is that then deputy doherty based upon our chain command in our direction we'll handle it how we tell them so i get so they came up and said hey someone sews got tall grass you need to go down there and cut it that was kind of the difference so if you say someone says you've got a tall grass fine it's that's not an issue then he already knows the direction we've given him he's going to follow our stuff so if that person down there sues for him going down and cutting the grass then that's us that's not the city because he's falling hard direction so i guess that's kind of like if that makes sense it's just so he can talk to anybody about anything it's just when it starts getting into operations it's like oh come on that's that's what it's like i think that's very expensive uh anyone else i thought i said june coming up [Music] a couple things we talked about the maybe the deputy going out and inspecting the boat docks and the sea walls um i just want to remind you all that the fire department had mentioned last year that they would taking someone out to do these inspections that we they could start warning for safety reasons all our bloggers in case they get an emergency so it's just something to keep in mind because then you have maybe the deputy riding with this somebody from the fire department no liability to our city by having a personal you know a citizen doing it so because they're all on the clock for the county so it's just something to think about um the other thing is uh i i'd like to make a little report if that's okay if i'm allowed um i'll stop if you can okay [Music] two days this week um we had the school bus to beat the horn i want to save him i don't know six o'clock more i think somebody's blowing the bus stops you know blowing by the school buses over on the sixth street so i just wanted to mention that because they don't normally blow their horn and usually that's what usually the school buses do so if you could just maybe have them kind of keep an eye so thank you thank you captain just for clarification because i i really wasn't sure where this came from you're basically what danny has been told is don't allow any council member to cloud their directive is that basically what it's it's like you can have a conversation but you still have a job to do and after you've had that conversation don't let any one of us give him direct orders you can tell obviously of an issue but he works for the sheriff not the council correct right okay okay in my conversations with danny he's afraid to talk to me and not because i'm a bad guy he's not great with me he's bringing me by the repercussions so we've cleared it up tonight we'll be glad to talk to everybody here and we'll reach out to him and we'll have him right in our presence and the citizens didn't tell them whatever they want but yeah that's where that's the vibe i was getting okay he knows like if i tell him go bust david gaddis's house he's not going to do that okay i would never tell him that um so he's not going to take direction lynn reeves gives the direction we work through lynn but we need to give away the direction that was the purpose of tonight and i think but i'm sensitive we're pretty much all on the same page thank you very much thank you mayor of the council noted about both sides of the street so obviously it's equitable enforcement across the board so if we go down this side and it's this side and it's just like the mayor said it's not like go get that person go get that that's why he's driving every street so i don't know if you didn't see some one thing but we're going to go down and make sure it's equitable enforcement that's everyday so that's so pretty if they don't do that that's a big and in response to juicing i appreciate the heads up we'll be with the patrol deputies and make sure they're out there that's part of that's actually in your contract city duties document different ways that when schools in session that they're watching so well i'll send it out before i go online they are out there last week yeah we've got a 361 update good morning did we see didn't we see a sheriff sitting in the sixth street thing one of the days too so yeah they might even be aware of it already so but just so you know yeah that's great it's a standing another thing we have we have a contract city duties document and i'll meet with the city manager we'll discuss this based on our discretion as well um typically you all know we change shifts every six months using smaller [Music] and some people move around but as we move i'll meet with lynn we'll talk about this document and what it is it's basically like a little template for each individual city to kind of tailor the services so one of the things that i think i don't know if it's in the contract anymore but but in that document is the the bus stop or the school bus stop for the extra patrols during that but there's a whole bunch of other things that are in there parking enforcement variously whatever but the intent of that is when you have a deputy come into the city that's not familiar with the city what i direct is they read that document and it's pretty pretty simple you think about it read the document follow the instructions uh so they'll go through there and they'll see um what's like an ongoing issue with each particular city and then they know to basically if they're coming and haven't been here before hey i need to go check the school zone or you know whether they've done school zone but the school the bus stop and they'll do that all right but i'll make sure that we do specific enforcement as well on this complaint and i didn't want to insinuate that danny ever treats one side the other i just want to say i'm all about equal rules equal enforcement for everybody i appreciate it i didn't take it that way i just wanted i took a note when you were taught to say you know actually to the contrary captain i've never heard that complaint other than a person who gets busted who really gets busted i mean we had somebody on one street had like converted their whole downstairs and lynn's laughing he knows what i'm talking about yet they were complaining i'm like sorry that was like the guy who when we were running the undercover stuff came off the bridge at 55 i mean i'm sorry but you're just not going to get the you know soup if they had 36. yeah all right they know they were heavy-handed but 55. so i was saying deal with this one this guy had the whole basement the other lower level converted and it was supposed to be a garage so you know pretty much typically just like anytime you hit it on the floor you don't have 90 of your people doing wrong things for 95 it's a few bad apples here and there and that's what the procedure and the process is for and it's people you pay your turn to go to the next level most overwhelming majority of your residents are good people and sometimes things happen and it's able to get discussed it's not a punitive thing we're not trying to get this money or that money and it works out everybody lives harmony so it doesn't happen everywhere like that feller beach real estate is it's pretty good my my mike so we've had a chance to see him um if we can agree here that we can have him come to our meetings and just give us a quick briefing and yeah i'll give a lid to see how we work out uh the code report and stuff about the work some some things happen so you just really print and let's try it for a little bit until we get our see how it's working with the 20 and we get we don't have to necessarily announce this to everybody how many exact hours we're going to do you know we can talk in general and then you can hash out the yeah that's pretty good at adjusting some different components perfect captain i want to thank you for coming tonight it's a pleasure to have you here and hear all of us and just tell danny at least from may and i think from a lot of us here that he's doing a wonderful job and really he is a keeper i agree with what john hansen said when was the um i think there was two when how long ago was the lady was that last month or no it's been seven it's a couple months ago i didn't know i think we just started longer than that okay i'll i'll give it i think the angel the other code did the same thing for the amazing ways and sounds another person in a different city that was out but deangelo saved that's two that's weird she's too code unfortunately last six months in those situations presented themselves it's just nice to hear you always hear the bad stuff it's nice to get out so i appreciate when y'all i take notes on that i will go back get with his supervisors and let him know danny i'm pretty certain we can give him our highest award which is the accommodation but i just because i don't think he's a big awards kind of guy but it's i will have to take a vote with our council but i don't think anyone will live against them if he wants it it's his i just want to you know we don't hand that out we only gave that out twice so it's he absolutely deserves it thank you thank you captain good seeing you again don't be a stranger you're allowed to come to our meetings you know yes all right thank you anything else on code enforcement frank i don't want to start from uh square one but citizen i brought up the idea of having the fire and the i don't know if danny would be the proper guy i don't know how much schooling he has with boats and docks and whatever but we don't know how to vote to my knowledge so maybe three or four times a year to have somebody do that would be a great avenue to address and we'll keep because truly we don't want to use a citizen to use a boat to go i mean because some of those things can catch on fire you see the frail wiring and that on those electric voices i'd rather not do it i mean i know dave has done and i know other citizens have offered we've had so we didn't approach right we didn't i mean we were 25 feet away and you know taking pictures with a camera and it was more of a joy ride wasn't it i didn't think it was it wasn't even my boat not just him never just have something general business do we have anything i just had one item i just and i gave you a copy of it friday i finally got not finally he was pretty responsive the guy from fishing watermark so he's given us his blessing on the buoy ordinance for us just for us and then uh frank and fred and i had class yeah and uh there's a letter in the back that was drafted to possibly send a shore to see if they have any interest in that but i want to get some consensus from the console that because what was brought up that we would pay for two additional buoys in the installation can we help them work on getting their permit the one caveat and all of this is bell or shore has to change an ordinance to meet the current statutes so there's a draft of the letter um actually one sentence will be changed because now i've got uh back from florida fish and wildlife to say it's our ordinance is fine so uh we'll bring that first reading if everyone's fine with it on the first meeting of october so when [Music] [Applause] compliance with them so we can review this individually uh do now review individually direct comments to you and you'll take them to fred said we have all the barrage right if you have any comments at all yeah yeah your comments will go to the next council meeting and hopefully pass yeah if i don't hear any comments then we'll put it on the agenda for whatever this is this is what uh the next council meeting would you like the comments might allow you fred to do your thing you know if there's any changes to it then we'll have to send it back to the state before we bring it to you so we try and minimize changes comments do by 9 27 until then yeah and then what's the consensus on uh i would like to wait till after we uh figure out the rest of the questions that we want to ask and stuff because i'd like to know the cost of these queries the cost of the maintenance because that's going to be forever on bellar beach correct if we do this it would be our expense forever to maintain them well technically they're bell or shores beller shore has to get the permit i did talk the fish and wildlife about that and they would still be the permit holder it says here in the letter that beller beach is willing to pay the cost for purchase installation and maintenance so we would be the caring well there's there's money in the budget every year for buddhists in fact there's more money i think for carpets than buoys so i think uh the markers and buoys are more important than the carpeting here i mean if the carpeting was frail or frame there's going to be a triple hazard replacement i appreciate our priorities in order one question um i had was liability would this release us for liability even if it's hurt because of those bullies or if they come loose i mean those are kinds of things that i'd like to have before i give a consent my vote on saying this about our shore do you know sydney today whether we do legally responsible for any lawsuits if anybody got hurt out there they come loose go up on anybody's property or do any damage that way i mean those are some of the things that we probably should have the information on as well are you talking about the buoys that are within your jurisdiction or the buoys in the other cities the belief that we're looking at picking up a bella shore and covering the cost of all of this and the maintenance and stuff i'll talk about these well i'm not going to tell you there's no liability for putting up a buoy but if you put it up consistent with the procedure that the florida statutes require and you follow the administrative code instead of opening up your liability i think you're going the other way and you're absolutely minimizing your liability the worst possible position to be in is recognizing there's a problem and then doing nothing about it or doing it inaudibly or negligently so then this we we spent a lot of time with frank going over this lynn and i have spent considerable time on it and the whole objective was to make sure that this was being done consistent with the law so i you know i've been a lawyer too long so i'm not going to rule out a possibility for somebody filing a lawsuit but i i think you're going the other other way on minimizing liability right just for clarifications the longer we wait and i brought this up in our meeting since we were the ones that removed the buoys and dollars shorts which fwc should have gave us permission because now we have to have we have to get dollar insurers to ask permission to put ability back since we're the only ones that require the movies to be removed if there is an accident you got three lawyers in this room okay i think we could be liable okay this letter here where i would like to see a little bit stronger i'm prime with it this ladder here i think takes the liability away from ballarat beach if there is an accident right now so the longer we wait i think just just to be clear bellar beach did not remove any buoys the buoys broke away and floated away no one removed any boobs we put our buoys in the jurisdiction of the city we put those back in this ordinance is done what it's going to do for us actually is put us in compliance with the statute and then we're going to have to change the stickers on the buoys and we've already got that price it's going gonna cost us somewhere between two and three thousand dollars for our booths and and that's what this ordinance is it's for our buoys what we're asking that are sure to join us join us but you know everybody keeps saying we removed them we did not remove them they weren't there yeah the permit i think it's 01-020 clearly says that we were to were the sole maintainer of those buoys and if they were missing we were supposed to replace them i believe the word immediately so you put all that together you bake it into a pot it comes up big there's an accident i mean look if somebody gets carved up by a boat and these buoys haven't been attended to there are three lawyers up here and you don't have to be a lawyer because you know what's going to happen every every one of us again so you know all the cities are getting sued um so you know we know there's a problem they you know should know there's a problem and hopefully they'll work with us certainly we fix powers and then that's maybe as far as we can go but you know frank has worked incredibly i want to thank you incredibly hard on this issue since you came on um and you know your dedication to the safety of these citizens is incredible i'm very impressed say thank you okay good i just had one thing um and we don't even have to decide it tonight i just want you to think about it but we can decide tonight and fix it real quickly we spent a lot of time last meeting we do it a couple times sometimes with the agenda these consent agenda items and i kind of looked around to see what somebody did and i wish i had printed it out i swear it was either daytona beach or daytona shores or one of the daytonas and i thought they had a really simple system that worked really well any council member any council member can move an item off of the consent agenda that would have ended about half an hour of debate okay so lynn could make his best call as to what he thinks is consent agenda and any one of us can move the thing into the regular agenda if there's no discussion on it boom it's done in 10 seconds but we will spend less time going through the agenda because that's usually the issues that we have with it that's what they did it seems to be a simple solution we don't have to have all these debates and is this really critical do we really need the city uh residents to comment on it we just any one of us any one of us no debate frank banker looks and goes i want the minutes moved off oh they're moved off he had a reason for doing it and i think that's a simple easy save a lot of time we're looking to cut the meetings down this cuts the meetings down you move it into your regular agenda you get your discussion whatever that person's concern was is addressed citizens have the right to speak on it and we're done and we vote on it and it passes that's just a proposal think about it or we could change if everybody has consensus we could make that adjustment so that that's always been the case no we have to right now to change the consent agenda we have to have a motion second and then any console member has always been able to remove something as an example if you said number five i'd like to move it to the regular agenda that's that's what you do and then you i tried to approve them i tried to remove minutes and they didn't get removed i asked for a motion there was no motion or no second it didn't happen and we actually had a mo there was a it wasn't like they were so erroneous but i would like to have the vote reflected it was a six to one vote and i wanted to reflect how the boat went so that's true [Music] so that's incorrect i don't know to change an agenda we've been changing it via a typical motion format so if you're telling me that we can do that then there's nothing to change and then that's the way we'll change and the agenda can be changed instantaneously i was not aware of that and nobody made me aware of that so sorry about that if i missed it i thought we had to do with the irregular amendment to you know because we have a motion to accept the agenda and then we had a motion to bring an item out of or change it however we had to change it so if you're telling me any individual can do it then that's the way we'll handle that no need to change anything then i'm not asking you to know it won't buy any comments so you want the meetings to be longer all right everybody that's all i had um fred i i have something sure and it it is an incredibly challenging thing to the city council but i'm going to ask it nonetheless i'm going to describe a situation and i'm going to ask you to give me a yes or no answer without discussing it okay and i really mean this might not be possible it's it's infinitely reasonable so it should be very easy to do it okay so let me explain the situation all of you are aware of it you were here a couple weeks ago and there was a robust discussion and this is in this these consistent with this evening's discussion there was a robust discussion about the section 2-6-3 and the city council debated the change to the code and the city council on first reading ultimately amended the language that i had come up with and i thought what i had come up with was fine but the count the council has a prerogative to change it so you changed it and you passed that on first reading by a split decision i should add the thing i will ask you or well i'll get to my my real quandary i left there and i have thought about this ever since and i thought about it endlessly because i had council members ask me to give assurance that this is not going to result in a problem and i had a different dissenting opinion that this is going to result in a federal lawsuit okay so i'm in the middle trying to find a way to uh work with both sides of the spectrum and at times it is incredibly challenging so the up or down yes or no question is prior to me doing some what i think or minor changes to the the code so that they can be presented at the next meeting i would ask the city council to give me the green light to talk to members of the city council about how can we find a solution to this problem and i think that's a very reasonable request and i would like you to give me the consensus to do it and what i don't want to do is you know not have the consensus me spend a bunch of time me right off a bunch of time me being more frustrated than i am already this one should be easy okay yes okay hang on let me take this hand one second just gonna keep this officially correct we're not allowed to actually vote on something we can give you a consensus so i'll ask the question that hopefully we'll do it the right way do we have consensus that fred riley can speak to the people he believes he needs to speak to regarding this ordinance an effort to address any issues that he may have as our city attorney fred has always been responsible when it comes to hours of billing so i'm not even i don't have to put that provides away does he have a consensus from us anyone against it or for it yes or no just all in favor i mean is anybody close that sounds good to me every it's good so please go ahead thank you very very much wonderful thank you uh glenn when you join us here preparing for elsa i i forgot to mention this before i finished in bel air living our public works staff they did an article on that so make sure you take a look at it some pictures where they did setbacks so uh you know that's it's real real nice showing some pictures helping the residents is that the device they created for youtube yeah yeah so you can do 10 sandbags at once i think frank got some experience with it i actually uh helped out um actually i think the last storm they had two more i think they actually had three now yeah yeah we do yeah so i just you know i wanted you to be aware and it's good that you've got that recognition we've always recognized recognize them internally and we also recognize frank as a sandbag does anybody else have any other issues council this was a very nice meeting being here and thank you everyone for participating um we have motion to adjourn and everybody in favor hi thank you have a good night"
