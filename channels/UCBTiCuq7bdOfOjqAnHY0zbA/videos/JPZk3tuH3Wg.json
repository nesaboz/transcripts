and Pals costume contest so this year it is on a Sunday and it's from four to six so there'll be a costume contest for like the animals hopefully dogs nobody brings their chinchilla and the kids we

parade this year but if you would like to donate a bag of candy for like our version of a trunk or treat please drop that off at City Hall that would be appreciated and if you have any other questions feel free to call either myself and there'll be more details on the website um and then in November for the entire month of November we're going to do a holiday food drive so non-perishable items in a box you know we'll have something in the lobby of City Hall leading up to our chili cook-off on November 19th and that is on a Saturday from 12 to 2 we do have information sheets over on the table so if you want to grab one it kind of gives you all the information that you would need and then the second page is an entry form that you can turn into anybody on the park and rec board or just drop off with um Laura at the front desk and I believe that's it um we're selling tickets for one ticket for ten dollars you get your entry fee to tastes all the chilies and then you get two drink tickets so we are having a beer and wine at that event we have our license and insurance um and you can also get those from any parking record member or you can contact the city oh and last but not least we have our health and wellness here on January 14th we're moving right along with the participants meeting the wellness participants but I would love to get more people from Bellaire Beach that like say Dr quick or clean eats they own businesses outside of Beller Beach but reside in Beller Beach I just don't know how to contact them I would love to have more people participate in our fair that actually live here so like just trying to get the word out we do have I think 15 people already signed up and we have room for like 23 health and wellness care providers so we're moving along but we do have some openings and some pendings and any of the residents would be interested in actually having a table for their business that would be most welcome I think that's all I have does anybody have any questions thank you very much okay thank you any other citizens like to speak yes sir hi folks uh Jeff Keith 109 Harbor Drive first off I'd like to thank you guys for doing what you do do a great job you know I'm here every week every month watching it in too great so I know most this is it's probably really respect that and what I wanted to ask tonight is the last couple years there's been some talk about the paving of our easement in the back of walking easy and I'd like to just um go forward with whatever's Happening Here The Simpsons aren't really too aware of I don't think and I'd like the council to look into it and maybe see why we wouldn't pay that and then go through the cost of um that's all I've done thank you very much like any other citizens like to speak yes sir good evening city of Illinois Council um I'm Victor bergenic the video guy I am not a resident of the city yet I hope to one day be able to afford such a beautiful house and a beautiful Community like this but with inflation I'll have to work harder I'm here to talk about the video that you guys are discussing um I would just like to I listened in on the last word session that you guys had that I was not in attendance to um and I I see that there wasn't any direction that the council came up with so I'd just like to further that discussion and let you guys know what my thoughts are um the first stop I'd like to also address that I did approach mayor Gaddis and I addressed him and said hey going forward for this Zoom style meeting what do you guys Envision as a budget mayor Gaddis in turn replied to me and said you've always been fair with us you've been working with us for seven years so just present a budget and we'll go from there so I was a little bit surprised that the budget that I came up with with Kyle we hashed it out was a little bit high but I feel like I did give the opportunity to put some discussion there but um furthermore I'd like to also um address a few things um so you guys are a premier city um you guys spend a lot of money on digital signage to look like a great City and in turn I think the media should follow I invite you all to look at other cities such as yourselves on YouTube and see the production somehow I feel like the Zoom direction that you guys are going into looks like an office meeting or a school board meeting and it's a little bit um it's hard to see who's talking hard to see what's happening um and and I don't know if you'd want to Canvas the residents to see what their thoughts are but I do see views on YouTube anybody can see those numbers and I'm seeing like 5 to 15 people watching the zoom meeting versus the production of where people are close up and they're actually on video uh is in the hundreds of views so um but that's obviously I'm speaking for myself so you'd have to ask the citizens what their position is on that but I do think that the views speak for itself there was also some discussion on my pricing and it was compared to council like I said my pricing is not meant to be as expensive as your town attorney he works a lot more for you guys and if you look at it on a monthly basis it's quite different um the the hourly rate again which is negotiable is just based off of other Productions that happen I know when I do a wedding uh the the raids start at about three thousand dollars and go up to ten if I do corporate videos they're much more expensive so you guys are really getting a bargain um so those are just my quick thoughts um it really helps to have a professional production to um for example I get often ask why I have two cameras if something happens I've got redundancy so that um if there's a problem that is taken care of but anyways in closing I'd like to just point out that I've been with you guys my family as a glad contractor for seven years I've never missed a date I love doing this as a job and I hope you guys see the value in what I'm doing I think I was speaking with Kyle and I saw that I didn't raise my raids at all for the past seven years I was actually under the impression when we negotiated I did but I did not so that's my two cents for you guys I just wanted to um give you some thoughts but let me know what direction you want to go in and and I understand thank you any other citizens all right let's move on to number three which is a presentation from the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office beginning with law enforcement monthly report step us to the Imodium is your name and when it's happened council members I'm Sergeant McKnight with Pinellas County Sheriff's Office let me want to present to you the July 2022 Sheriff's Office report for the first page the only information gathered there was two assaults for the month for July of 2022. the second page is the arrest report there were six people arrested in July of 2022 for a total of nine charges for the third page there was 948 events that required 1065 decades respond to those events and for the final page there was one traffic crash in the month of July and there was a total of 222 combination of citations in the mornings per month if you have any questions sounds like a very slow month Council sure just briefly so the two assaults were directly with a traffic stop one was another one was one of the deputies on the opposite shift as mine found a couple people under the bridge two of which were run by juveniles one of the juveniles capable of the Dead piece so that was the the other um charge okay thank you anyone else thank you sergeant thank you next code enforcement monthly report good evening Mr mayor council member of Staff citizens Steve clacker for the record um from the August uh agenda that we've had we've been fairly busy with several things again going after people with building or doing work without permits and Licensing the other is also had a couple of complaints about some docs that we're looking into and also again because of the rainy season we've gotten a lot of complaints from overgrown grass and weeds most of those issues have been taken care of a lot of them hello how's that oh way better all right you want to start all over sure okay um again Steve clack here for the record uh had a pretty busy uh month with the in October oh sorry August um we've had a lot of uh incidents again with contractors licensing and not permitting um the other side of that we've got a couple follow-ups that we're doing with some docs that need to be repaired I've been in contact with the the homeowners to let them know that work needs to be done again because of parts and so forth and getting contractors out here to do the work the other is because of the rainy season we've got a lot of complaints about overgrown grass weeds and empty lots and we had taken care of most of them but other than that it's all I have for you help sure um I want to get into handyman I mean he's getting a big push that you're checking people at their license but with a handyman and say a minor thing say if somebody wants to just have them come into the house and do some drywall we're talking non-structural they're just cleaning uh you know dead in the wall um do they really need a license I mean that's the home between the homeowner and their insurance company uh if it's a homeowner doing it uh no if it's somebody on the other side they have to be licensed what type of license well it's uh up until July of next year um if they're doing any type of drywall work or painting they have to have a license and again when you're removing drywall or you're doing any type of work the county considers that demo work so you may need a permit for it and again it depends on the size of the job that they're doing and what they're doing now what type of license are you talking I might be very specific what type of license are you requesting because there's business licenses there's Contracting licenses well again it depends on the status of the work I mean um I've had people just replace 300 feet of drywall and by the county code you have to have I'm talking really underground I'm not talking major projects I'm talking about somebody's got a one by one sheet of you know they banged it in with their door and it's a homeowner doing it no we're having somebody you know a lot of people here can't you know I can do it no problem well unfortunately with the with the county ordinances um they have to be they have to be licensed and they have to be insured just to do a tax job or and again that license you're talking a contractor's license with a county yeah there's different licenses for different type of works that they're doing um but yeah unfortunately unless their home set it at the property they have to have a licensed contractor worker in the house and the reason for that is is because if that person falls or something happens to them they can go after the homeowner well yeah but that's between them and their insurance company not the county well that's what we're trying to avoid so why you know our my big thing is I don't want to put the homeowner at risk this is you know people who are licensed insured um those are the ones that we're really looking for see what I'm getting at it's the homeowner should be empowered to select who they have worked on their house and how they do more and I again I'm not talking major construction work I'm talking about that passion most people don't know how to take special and repairable or they bring in a handyman that has a business license fine they're just taking care of that simple little patch and you're saying that they have to be fully licensed you're going to come out and check on the work just for that app for the door well and again sir I I gotta look at what type of work you're doing because again I've had people say well I'm just doing Patchwork and next thing you know that they're actually tearing down walls and moving I mean it all depends on what the work is through the licensing board hand even really don't exist in her name or in Pinellas County all right it depends on what type of work they're doing and again there was an issue last month with somebody painting the house well it's a friend of mine is painting the home you see Homestead of there that is he being paid well I'm not paying him directly but I'm going to take them out of my boat it's compensation you can't do it I mean um so if you're telling me if they're understated were very clear yeah if it's your home your homesteaded you can do the work but you may require a perfect depending on what kind of work you're doing but you can't have anybody on the outside come in and again that's the ordinance and that falls under uh chapter 489. okay we'll be looking at that thanks okay um follow from Mr Sable's comments I believe our code actually leaves 90 square feet of sheetrock you don't need a license or a permit because I discussed that last year and I guess that's where I'm a little bit confused I think you're as confused as I am exactly yes I am yeah because like you said the door goes in smashed it you and I would do it no problem anytime you want to compare each other but what I'm saying is I we need our codes you do a great job I just don't think the citizen should be you know scrutinized as well as I think Mr Sable was applied or whatever or little little circumstances like that and again it's hold on one second membership yes this is really something for our code for you to go over is probably if you're doing a great job thank you thank you um and we have there we have pcclv which is the licensing board for contractors and all of this work we're talking about those questions are probably better geared towards them so we might want to invite them to a meeting after that comes I've been trying to get them on the phone to get some details and outs and I can't get that information but it's it's our code that's the issue not so much the enforcement design correct and that's where uh we need to sit down and look at our code and occasionally things do overrule for whatever reason a good example is the county requires so many feet away from the neighbor if you want to install a generator Miller Beach doesn't have that same code so there are some I'm sure that there are some various some differences between our code and county code and I think what I'm hearing tonight is that there may be concerns that um we may have some rules that give us a little bit of leeway versus what we're following right now but I want us to get to the bottom of this and have more discussions on it absolutely and we're meeting on the 21st of September and uh my supervisor Sergeant Skipper is going to be in that meeting if they would like I could get somebody from the licensing board to sit in on that too so everybody will have you know a great influx of information so you you know I think that that's a great idea and uh and it should certainly be an home and an open conversation so because there are many concerned citizens right now they're they're not used to someone right it was such a great job you yeah and again one thing that I do want to express is education over enforcement that's my big thing you know so people understand it so it's not like we're picking up people you know it's just it's a protection for them any other questions all right thank you very much thank you have a good evening all right we are all into item number four in the city attorney report City attorney Warren thank you Mr Mayor uh briefly uh I've been in contact with you folks in the general Sense on a few on a few matters via email the first would be that the where we left off in our last meeting the candidate for the interim manager position had withdrawn his his candidacy I followed up by providing new correspondence from last week where he found solutions for the disputed issue of the health care coverage for his his spouse and was open to continuing to serve if you'd be willing to approve the agreement on those existing terms in addition to that option I also provided you the beginning of some resources depending on which direction this body ultimately wants to to move but ultimately the councils at the Helm of the manager selection process and that's where my involvement stands at this state another matter that we Workshop as recently as August 15th was the FWC or as it's being called FWC voting restricted areas both the Mexico safety zone however you wish whatever moniker you wish to give it um I've been drafting that ordinance I was on the phone with a representative from FWC as recently as today just trying to get a general sense of their impression of their code and how it has been how the code is administered and I I expect to have a product for you by the end of this week if not the very beginning of next week I I would recommend ultimately that we should likely have a workshop at some point this month so that we can have an ordinance that is in first reading form next month so we can show dark and Faith effort and good faith attempts to resolve this issue it is my goal though I'm not a the driver's seat is my goal to give you a product that we can put this matter to bed in 2022 for lack of a better term if a resolution can be found by a majority of the body but my attempts are to draft something that aligns with your general direction and the code is it is administered other than that I continue to be in contact with the manager on a daily basis we joke with one another if a day should go by that we don't talk that something must be wrong but we are in regular contact that one other matter that I do want to make sure you know I have no sight of is providing you an estimate relative to the code rewrite including the signed code revision I should have I hope to have that next week I've just been putting attention on a few other things but that is not all otherwise I'm available for any questions you may have no questions good thanks I was just wondering if if you have a subtotal for the legal sign what we've expanded on the city manager search and contract and negotiations I have given my new tenure to the city and the need of it this has thus far been a relatively straightforward process I have thus far put all of my time for that under the retainer depending on how this goes and what my role in that process is I reserve the right to request that we made a special matter through the inner manager as I've done for the voting restricted area ordinances is that ordinance once was on a retainer second was on a retainer kit this month we're having multiple workshops it's a special project but the the process of the any of my time spent going towards the manager has been fully within the retainer and I think you'll find you'll see that the billing on the retainer far exceeds the retainer in terms of design specter thank you very much Mr Baker uh PCU are probably feeling contact with our internship manager yes sir what uh have you found any errors in the last four months that he's been with the city manager that he's uh hasn't been able to address properly or whatever because we have a guy that wants a job now and um clearly told us if we don't abide by what his demands were he wasn't going to take it and we have a guy sitting right next to you who I think is fully capable of doing the job if I'm being misled by me saying that you're talking to him every day which you can say anything negative when hurdles hasn't been he been able to tackle the European Union ultimately I'm going to leave your hiring process in your capable hands um I wasn't finished where I understand and I'm I'm answering the question but I want to make very clear what my role is and it's not because I have in past situations been accused of putting my thumb on the scale of the process and that's not my role you'd ask me a targeted question and I'll answer it I've dealt with Mr riesler on a daily basis I will tell you that he is one a professional too kind and respectful three prepared when we speak he's also a human and that means he does make errors he is capable of errors I'm not going to say he's infallible I'm not aware of any complete Halo that surrounds him and all he does so I I will not represent to you that I circumspect review of his performance will not review will not reveal some way that something could have been done better I'm also not an administrator I from a legal standpoint he responds to feedback he calls me with concerns in advance generally speaking and he seeks my counsel and is responsive and where we have a disagreement and I'm not suggesting conflict just hey here's how I'm seeing it while I'm saying it this way we're able to resolve it he's a professional that I work with and I I have enjoyed that process ultimately whether or not he's the best fit for the goals and vision that you wish to achieve as a council and the direction you wish to move that's a policy Maker's decision and I leave that to you thank you thank you any other questions from the council hey Mr Mayor can you hear me yes yeah just a quick question so where do we go with respect uh of discussing what our options are with the candidate for the city managing positions that's something that goes to unfinished business that we'll discuss that's ultimately your decision it is business that remains unfinished about how you wish to structure your meeting or when you wish to discuss it I defer to the body probably leave that to a work session I sort of have an idea that there wasn't as much interest as originally thought in this candidate that's my gut I I have nothing to back that up but we'll talk about it in a later date and this is what happens okay all right thank you very much Mr Mormon next we are going to the city manager report interim city manager reefer and thank you mayor council first up I have the 12th and 13th Street Bay Drive BMP 788 Strongwater project our projected start date for that is now September 26th but we're currently waiting on this for a utility conflicts to be resolved Duke Energy needs to come in and embrace some polls and actually remove wood pole to put back a leader D after the product is completed the Clearwater gas company needs to dig out a utility line just explore exploratory day just to make sure that we're not going to come into conflict with it some of this stuff is just things that you know known to get down on the ground Pinellas County has approached us and want to make you aware that they're looking to do a joint project agreement with us so that they can add some fire hydrants and replace them older style pipe water pipe while we're in underneath the road so the you were going to put together a it's going to be a complete reimbursement but wait you'd have to approve it to to do the work and then pay for it up front and then have a reimbursement accounting so once that's together that will present it to you the Golf Boulevard underground project we discussed that in the work session of the last one we did and I did the presentation and I have those two items for the utility consultants and the Duke Energy agreements on the agenda uh Seawall Seventh Street 16th Street Seawall and 7th Street boat ramp project that we are still waiting for the water navigation permit to come through I did speak with one of the supervisors for the permitting department and get the permit to the accelerated and assigned so she told me that they're understaffed in the process of trading new staff so if you can't guarantee it's going to be fastest turnaround but it has been assigned so it is so-called expedited so I'm hoping that comes within a couple weeks the contractor is prepared to start the sea walls of the project so um hopefully we move forward this month the 17 18th Street starting line Improvement project which will be the next project on our list I put in a request for a proposal from Google Associates for the design work so I'd like to see what number comes back to them and then I've discussed with them at this time around that we'd like to not only look at the original design but to really investigate different options of life but it's going to give us the best cost to benefit from the project so what instead of just doing what was importantly in the original design and kind of figuring out what we're going to get on the stand for our podcast our code enforcement analysis project that was scheduled for this thing second back to the 21st and uh in that meeting right now the staff is going to be council member Roberts myself uh Laura Malinois the executive assistant in our code enforcement officer Steve plotka um I heard tonight that after they spring into supervisor who's uh wants to kind of get an idea for how things work and then at the same time we'll try to pull in some of the front Pinellas County License Board um to the all Seawall project that again is um we have money in the budget for the next uh budget year um I plan on trying to or putting a bid out for any new members to see what the number comes back and make a decision that's all I have questions from the council um we all received an email from a resident on the pond in the back here am I under the impression that that's County property the pond area it is a kind of property that we have an agreement to maintain the reason for the agreement is if the camera was to maintain the the rate that they maintained the wrestler attention Bonds in the county it wouldn't be up to our standards so we've kind of Taken on ourselves to can we get like a schedule like every two three weeks to go out there and just clean that up for that Resident we're going to adjust the schedule to get out there more often thank you other council members all right thank you very much all right number six clear before thank you thank you mine is just updates um nothing new we had that board of adjustment hearing for the variance for the pool height and that variance was approved and then the city manager search process that's still you know in a pending phase so that's kind of in a standstill we have a contract with the supervisor of elections to hold their primaries here so we're a polling place for them so we had that and that was completed and we had a code enforcement a special Master hearing for the uh Tower structure and the special Master issued the order and the fine and uh would you mind telling us um thank you it's not involving the quasi-judicial process directly both parties presented evidence and ultimately the special Master included a special Ministry of enforcement Master concluded that the property the property of the required permit to have a structure of that type at the property there was no evidence on a permit in the file and the respondent affirmed that he had not apply for a permit and so the order was directing them to apply for an apartment within the next I believe those 14 days until I understand he has already secured some of that paperwork and made at least an initial submission I don't know where that is in the review process but that was the order was that it required for my application you know very reviewed as any other current point of this I just wanted to call them just as a note to date the the permanent application is incomplete thank you any questions for these student work all right thank you very much Miss Gentry all right now we are on to the very painful consent agenda I'm going to read this just everyone bear with me okay this is covering items six I'm sorry 7 through 16 for the approval of the June 20th special council meeting minutes June 20th budget Workshop Phoenix July the 5th city council meeting minutes July 12th a special counseling meeting minutes be July 18th budget Workshop minutes the July 18th special council meeting minutes the August 1st city council meeting minutes the August 15th Council work session minutes the August 22nd Council work session minutes and finally the August 22nd special counsel meeting minutes all in favor on this room before we go about that just refresh my memory you know we moved and sent agenda number seven to the regular agenda 17. okay all in favor of approving the consent agenda I like any opposed agenda passes thank you Patty for getting us almost caught up you know it's a lot of hard work we've been very busy and I greatly appreciate it thank you right now to the regular agenda starting with item 17. which is to authorize the interim city manager to execute the contract for code enforcement Services now if we could actually move that behind the budget items the budget items have to be the first to order business budget Idol okay so we need to look in to amend no you've just moved it to that General place of business you can move it to the very last thing or not think about this first but as a matter of I think we're saying you for uh for clearing that for you so let's move on to item 18. consideration of adopting the proposed and AD Valore military for fiscal year 2022 between three so I was placed on the agenda by interim city manager reefer and is the first public hearing on setting the proposed final military for fiscal year 2022-20 23 first off do I have a motion Leslie Notaro and do I have a second second Jody Shirley will you have before um thank you um so chapter 200 of the Florida State Statute the determination of knowledge we have to set the statutory timetable what procedure for the calculation uh and notification public process to set the final app for tax eligible and not the budget so this year the preliminary gross taxable value came back for Miller Beach which was a 730 million 194 961 which is an increase in profit value of 14.07 from the total of from the year prior the the final military at the current military which is uh 2.0394 with a new property values we'll produce approximately one million 429 590 net appalon tax that is tax calculated with the early payment discount so that represents an increase of Abalone income yeah the revenue in uh 177 775 over last year's budget and um it's also a requirement to calculate the rollback military and um that would be the the middle grade that would generate the same amount of tax revenue that meet the prior year the rollback rate would be 1.7916 the proposed goes rate of 2.0394 is 13.83 higher than the whole pack rate the staff said it was evaporated up 1.7916 the staff respectfully requests the city council uh to send the proposed and Delivery at 2.0394 for fiscal year beginning October 1 2022. so it was the first adopted budget must be adopted but I saw separate votes personality for the adopted military thank you for their information Council he would debate and roll back to the proposed rate or the current rate to 1.9155 how much of an impact would that you want our budget well we're giving back some of the money to the citizens they would essentially cut the uh the increase in half so so you were told anybody said 86 000 880 Micah again Floyd Roberts did you have a comment um I know we discussed this at the workshop in depth um my take on it generally interestingly enough like I did get some emails from citizens about how their tax proposal was impacted um I almost started laughing when I saw mine because my overall tax bill from the county actually went down which was interesting because as we all know there are several line items that make up our overall tax bill um Bellaire Beach as a city standpoint is really not a big percentage but it does impact us so um I think overall that our part of the overall tax bill is is fairly small and the fact that it's spread over all the citizens of our city when you add up those little small uplifts if we don't cut it back it does provide significant money to the city for us to be able to get projects done that have been requested by most of our citizens so that's my take on it thank you any other comments from the council before we go to the citizens would any citizens like to speak on this topic yes sir Robert 2218 that I know I appreciate y'all taking a look at this appreciate the hard work uh City staff has done I think retaining the military where it is is fine I did a little bit of research City developers at 6.5 dollar collects of 5.35 and those are just a couple of comparison Clearwater Largo they've got a lot more infrastructure but I think just you know for the infrastructure means our city has as Mr Roberts pointed out we need to do a lot of work I think it's a good move and I agree I looked at my development in my bill overall per post is going to go down by a little bit but you know I think it's good for the city to stay at the 21394. thank you other citizens you know and let's go back to the council and then I will burrow the last word council yes vice mayor any thought of what's happening to the expenditure that we see I mean they're not going down at home only 12 percent of your tax bill goes back to Middlebury Beach so I mean just the 13th Street storm water increased two hundred thousand dollars that project and we're talking about rolling back it doesn't make sense the uh the economic climate is just too unpredictable at this point to the global back taxes in and yeah it would be nice to do that but it would be even harder to explain next year when you have to increase the income of taxes so I propose I would just leave it where it is along with the reputation of the city staff and use what we can now to get ahead in the infrastructure and that said Mr gun you are going to probably be facing the Pinellas County Fire it's at 3 8 in the middle it's going to be increased so I just think in this day and age with all this inflation or increase from 177 000 to 85 000 86 000 would be substantial uh and give the citizens the right to spend their money more wisely and weaker thank you Mr Banker um I have seen some High online uh I occasionally do actually get online and work around and and I think the most of it the biggest complaints are new homeowners they buy a house and it's the old appraised value we're assessed by you and then next year whenever they're reassessed and Christ they actually bought their home at that's whenever they take the big hit and it is shocking it looks like the the city is robbing from it but the truth is is that uh the cost of these homes just continue to go up and uh put people that have been here for a while and haven't haven't bought a new home these have been very minor increases overall so I am also for maintaining the same military that we've had for of years now something like that it's been quite a long time where we have not raised the military so that's uh that's my thoughts anyone else oh yes um you know brought up at this point about the inflation uh and I am too is uh maintaining the military but we have seen so far in the short term of our Council that uh providers to us for services have all dramatically increased their prices so basically in this rate of 10 percent you know inflation rates uh we're keeping our price the same and still will continue to provide the same services that you need to any other council members before I turn it over together okay Vice America just as a point of Interest I mean how many agenda items are we talking about tonight where we're talking about increases in the expenditure we're talking about the code enforcement we're talking about video and we're talking about some of the other issues here so I mean our costs are going up and they're not going down and I think it's it's only fair that the residents share in some of those expenditures and or maybe the city needs to start considering more usage or special assessments because the city can't cover all this stuff so when you have a issue in your neighborhood or on your street or whatever maybe we shouldn't start considering hey if the city can kick in this amount but maybe we need to go to special assessments for the problems because there are problems thank you vice mayor Lesley material um I think it makes perfect sense to use the same and more ratings that we've used for many many years 2.0394 given the increase in costs projects things like that it gives us a little more old buffer rather than going back to our to the enrollment rate so thank you very much with that being said would you please call the road council member Banker no council member Notaro yes councilmember Roberts yes council member Shirley council members Abel I vice mayor Gunn I mayor Gaddis hi so it's a six to one uh carries that is the first public hearing and we'll have to do this one more time before it becomes foreign consideration of approving the city of Bellaire Beach budget making Appropriations for certain expenditures expenses Capital Improvements and certain impedance for the year beginning October 1st 2022 and ending September 30th 2023. decided was placed on the agenda by interim city manager riebler and is the first public hearing on the 2022-2023 budget do I have a motion until vice mayor Gunn do I have a second second my example vice mayor you have before I'll defer to the university manager okay so retired City management preparedness budget for the council we've gone over it in multiple two budget workshops June 20th and July 18th uh We've made some adjustments during that time some of them were updated expenses increases decreases based on estimates that we got the final numbers for and then others were under the city council's Direction uh some of those budget changes that were made in that time period where the state revenue sharing was increased based on the state's estimates city manager budget was increased up to 191 780 based on the proposed city manager contract finance department was decreased that was primarily due to the accounting software that we decided was not necessary the sanitation has gone up that will be covered later in the agenda the library was decreased to half up based on the needs of our population and the non-department on the Professional Services was decreased from 10 000 not to two thousand now is the space on the estimated needs for that type of service as far as capital the biggest set of Park improvements have decreased to a budget of 15 000 and that is just to cover the replacement for the playground so the attached budget is this is the uh the first quote on the budget but there will be finalized as part of a budget resolution submitted to council for approval of the second and final public hearing a motion will be on September 19th at 505

first reading thank you very much in this story for Council let's go to the citizens with any citizens like the speed and all the things about you nope all right we're back to the council again the vice mayor doesn't have a flash work I would just request that uh perhaps a quick statement from the chair of the citizens advisory committee because I know they they reviewed the budget and they've been intimately involved in the budget people would just like to know if he's on board and if he has any questions or additions to them all that please come out thank you uh so we did review the budget in advance of the first draft we haven't sat back with um city manager reporter to review this about sitting through the budget sessions personally I believe it's fair and it's done appropriately and is in line with what our original discussion were I like the way things have moved around thank you very much last chance for the council right okay Patty would you please call the rule council members Abel I council member Shirley councilmember Roberts yes council member Notaro aye council member Banker yes vice mayor Gunn all right mayor goddess all right so it passes unanimously it's the first hearing more at the end of the same system the demander is supposed to announce something and there was a similar one on the military I can read them both at the same time [Applause] the first one is on page 55 of 199. [Applause] I'll hold a taxi at the bottom of them all right we'll we'll uh first take care of the proposed military to propose Village rate of 2.0394 males Which is higher than the rollback rate by 13.83 it's above the expenses of the general fund for the fiscal year commencing October 1st 2022 at the end of September 30th 2023 final approved military for the city of Bellar Beach will be

the city of Bellaire Beach will be presented at the second and final public hearing that will be held at the community center on Monday September 19 2022 at 505 pm you were supposed to catch me on that thank you very much all right so now we are on to item number consideration of appointment of an alternate member to the citizens advisory committee the candidate's name is Tim Hawley before we go forward do I have a motion Jody Shirley do I have a second second I disabled Jody Shirley you had before um [Music] explanation would build Mr Holland here Mr Holland here rods again accepts an advisory chair okay we've got an open advisory position and I I don't know Mr Holland but I look at his application he's got a great background I think working on the future budgets and the workshop item that I put out that we need to address him a financial perspective his funniest background would be the great help because we have those discussions so look forward to it is important thank you very much I've been told that Mr Holland is not here tonight but not just for formality Mr holik here tonight to address the council I say that because we're different now and he can always be zooming out there somewhere thank you that's a good question which seat did come open it was a uh it was a it was just an adult yes thank you Council any citizens would like to speak on behalf of Mr Holly or their okay well let's go back to the council the last word right it was speaking to a boat since there's only one candidate with two of boys all in favor all right see that none are opposed congratulations go out to Mr holik and if you see him thank him for serving in our beautiful city all right do item 21. moving right along this is to authorize the interim city manager to execute agreement addendum with Waste Management Inc for Florida for residential single-family and multi-family residential complexes solid waste collection services so I was placed on the agenda by interim city manager reefler and he has a note here that this is uh you execute addendum number four increasing the agreement amount from 304 380.50 to 33 330 985.90 annually before we begin do I have an emotion I mean surely you have before I think this complies with our contract and the opportunity for those rates because it's not a very large increase and uh they do a great job they're out they're picking up trash on Labor Day so if there's anything more you want to add feel free I just want to have the yeah the number four is included there was also a letter from Bill Griffin who is the public sector Solutions manager for our area and he addressed the increase in the justification behind Council yeah if we could I just want to go back to the Village discussion um I just want to point out as you can see here just in this one instance that prices I mean just in this case Alone um you know went up uh 26 000 so again keeping the military is this somehow leading into the contract with Waste Services uh yeah I just want to point out that this was a very significant increase and I would be voting to approve I just wanted to point it out this this is one of the things that that military pays for okay thank you very much all right all right anyone else that um I don't I don't believe you know which gonna pay for that I believe that can reduce back to the service when he comes out to or their citizen or conduct their order it's trash or whatever I believe that um disabled we should show an example that everything is going up yeah but um why is it going up nine percent they give you a reason um so the one thing that does per section 9 in the agreement there was a gap on the amount of increase for the CPI it has a maximum of four percent uh if you read the letter from Bill Griffin um they cite the increase in fuel um staff management and the other crisis of I'm the president of increases in the CPI and that their uh the respectfully requesting that the the cap this year be revised to allow the full increases CPI and then the other increase that it comes into that balance is in the contracts of section 9 which is when the county increases their base rate charges for disposal then on that directly influences their cost they are a contract with LR how are they allowed to work on the holidays or other contractors aren't allowed for work believe in their contract they're allowed to work on the holidays our code of ordinances says contractors are not permitted to work on holidays though monkey's a big trash pickup here and years ago the FED established one piece is the holiday so I'm just curious why we allow that to occur nothing on you okay and meanwhile we can't have a resident have a contractor come in and work on their house I believe this is actually a service and not a contractor it's not some hired licensed contractors and utility providers well their relations contractor Waste Management I've dealt with them for 30 years they are definitely a licensed contractor that they are also a public service to the city of Miller Beach and uh I like to see them guys have a day off on uh on their holidays rather than servicing us I mean I might even reduce the nine percent cost actually I'd probably make I would beg to differ on that one you've seen strikes uh across the world when this stopped Refuge collection and select a pestilence disease uh spells and I know that none of the number of our citizens would ever stand for that and as far as days off yes they are union representative and yes they do have comp days off so they are getting those days off excuse me I am floor my point of order you're oh correct [Music] please Minister yes and I I again I do understand they open into employment with their company and they do negotiate the days that they have often the time that they have off they do a great job it is not for the freedom heart to do that job and uh just I put one o'clock in them but I definitely want to make sure that our streets are clean from refuse Mr Baker I'm 100 for our streets are clean uh they're not Union represented I can talk to them times they told them to go Union um so they would get the days off but uh I think they should have a day off like most of the other people here thank you Lloyd Roberts did I see your hand uh no I'm fine okay thank you very much um let's go to the citizens like to speak on this topic nope right let's go back to the council Judy Shirley having the last word thank you very much Patty would you please call the role council member Banker yes council member Notaro yes council member Roberts aye council member Shirley council members Abel I vice mayor Gunn aye mayor Gaddis aye so the fandom agreement or uh agreement that Daniel writer and taxes item number 22. approval of piggyback agreement for consultant Services related to utility undergrounding and authorization to execute a purchase order with utility consultants in Florida this was also placed on the agenda by interim city manager replay and he also has a statement here that is to underground utilities on the east side of Gulf Boulevard phase one for 847 thousand 424.50 and phase two for one million one hundred thirty six thousand eighty one dollars and twenty twenty slowly move on this one do I have a lotion excellent I'd say well do I have a second second blame gun might say well you have the floor yes I deferred to our interim city manager thank you so this is the uh to approve a piggyback agreement that was drafted by Mr Morris firm and that is going to piggyback the contract pricing that's currently have affected Indian Rocks Beach that in turn is what uh our phase one and phase two uh amounts are based off of it and requested Council approves the purchase orders to move forward for phase one phase two for the installation of the conduit via hle undergrounding um so this was discussed in the presentation of the the underground we pay you for Pinellas money and this is the first step in in consolidation phase is to approve these agreements and to start installing the conduit and speaking with the contractor we believe that this phase one at phase two can recently get done within five months I'm even really first thank you very much Mr Ray for a council yes just to verify that those prices reflect the consolid meeting they do I believe we actually came out uh yeah I just briefly had some various questions coming in for me about the the timeline now can you give us like a broad scope book phase one includes this there's start date here's the date phase two broadly includes this start date and date and again approximate ballparks Hallmark um so for this part of the project the utility Consultants will be starting in approving it this month to start in October um five months time frame is is the goal and uh as soon as they complete phase one of that which could be you know two or three months it took either south of cosmic Boulevard shortly after that June which is the next agenda item can come in and start their work so they're gonna work directly behind utilities so broadly uh until what's the date say phase one that everything's underground nice you know ground Camp all that good stuff uh ballpark two years trying to accomplish both the utility Consultants will be done and then do follow up with phase one through phase two really depends on availability of Crews they might be able to get multiple Crews working at one time at the same time on any kind of emergency that pulls those security did not understand so broadly speaking uh from today uh it's going to be two years before everything's underground in that's phase one phase two basically filler of each underground and on golf yes and the only other variable is the Communication company which is uh spectrum they have undergrading they need to do from 12th Street North to Harrison that either get squeezed in somewhere in the project between Duke's phases or it might have to wait a little after because they are not through experience we've seen that they do take longer period of time and that would be good at least and priority to accomplish ment Floyd Roberts uh yeah we discussed it a bunch of the workshop I'm fine with it I have no further questions any other comments from the council before I go to the citizens on this topic no all right back to the council I might say well you have the last word life says for the vote um council members Abel I counselor Shirley hi council member Roberts aye councilmember Notaro aye council member Banker no vice mayor Gunn all right mayor Gaddis hi Pastor 6-1 3 where you were authorized to see with a piggyback agreement all right we are on to number 23 which is for authorization to execute underground conversion agreements and purchase orders of the Duke Energy Florida LLC which was also placed on the agenda by the city manager reefer before we discussed this what he would like to make a motion move forward Jody Shirley do I have a second second Leslie 30 unit before [Music] these are the uh two conversion agreements from Duke Energy that were based off of The Binding cost estimates that we had done for us they are pretty straightforward they were reviewed by our City attorney and uh with uh with these agreements the authorizations signed these agreements it would also be to create purchase orders with phase one they would need the money in the front as part of the agreement I discussed with uh Miriam who deals with the contracts for a Duke that when we got to the phase two we could postpone the pavement on phase two and keep our binding cost until next year's budget starting October 2023 we would execute that purchase order very much other council member Frank Baker um one of one big thing I haven't done underground wiring is the transmission of electrical energy which is reduced when it comes from doing underground to above ground most underground you know it will carry about 11 KV um all these new electric cars coming out and everything like that as duke addressed possible increases or the wiring capacity it's going to be able to transmit the electricity you can see we're going down Walmart that will feed into the neighborhood and while there's other things that I think we should have been spending this money on because one of I think the total cost is over five million dollars and again once government gets money they'll find a way to spend it I think we could have used it to cure our storm water problems out here rather than Duke Energy to hide wires but uh my big concern is with this adding electrical search on the grid as Duke Energy ever been addressed and saying is this going to if everyone has a electric car in the next five ten years or the underground wire is going to be capable of carrying that chart for that boat I know that they have a team of Engineers that have worked on the project and designed it but I could follow up with that thank you I had two I know that when we've done some underground in the city it was a huge requirement to upgrade service the service was upgraded by Duke at the time we mined very in a long-term seconds you're talking about residential I'm talking transmission for going into residential there's big there's a big difference once it goes into the house well I'm not going to argue with that I'm just saying that I don't think Duke Energy is going to take the lines that are overhead as they sit and bury them there's going to be new lines laying no oil must not happen back and forth on this let's uh let's take it one at a time I'm going to step in just for a second and add that I did see a presentation at one of the Big C meetings from dude and yes they are increasing their transmission line capacity are they prepared to handle 25 electric cars on your street probably not I don't know if that will ever happen but they are as they do these projects they are increasing the money capacity capacity and my point is it was above ground that will be able to handle the 25 cars no way would they ever take it off but um it's usually 11 KV Max on underground lines the service that you can thank you for that opinion and uh let's go right quick to the citizens anyone like to speak on this topic okay let's come right back to the council that Tony sure we have in the last word I think this has been a priority for the city for quite some time and I'm happy that we are aggressively moving forward with this project thank you for the support thank you all right so uh Patty we're going to do another roll call vote again this is to authorize the underground conversion agreements we do please take the vote council member Banker no council member Notaro yes councilmember Roberts aye council member Shirley aye council members Abel aye vice mayor Gunn aye mayor Gaddis hi so it passes six to one just read that you are authorized to proceed with executing the underground conversion agreements and purchase scores okay and now we are back to item 17. which is to authorize the interim city manager to execute the contract for code enforcement services with Pinellas County Sheriff for fiscal year 22 and 23. this item was placed on the agenda by interim city manager refund do I have a second second Frank Baker might say well you have the floor uh yeah just uh before uh I have to see if you're in city managers wanted to point out that this contract gives us a not two amount it does not guarantee use of the full amount but it's under our control as to how much where when and the enforcement is under our control okay up to city manager reported responsible thank you as mentioned in the work session we we're increasing the uh the hourly rate is going up to 51.80 per hour we discussed starting October 1 the code enforcement officer going to 15 hours per week as opposed to 20 hours per week we're doing now um they'll also be followed up and discussed in our code enforcement analysis to find out where we end up what the best solution is for code enforcement in lower Beach thank you other council members Mr Roberts I have nothing to add all right let's go to the citizens for comments right back to the council that might say we'll have it for five four it's my move to vote all right thank you for anybody else thank you very much all right so uh this is to authorize the interim city manager to execute the contract for code enforcement services for the Pinellas County Sheriff for fiscal year of 2022 and 2023. hey would you please call the roll council member Shirley hi council member Sable aye council member Banker aye council member Roberts I am council member Notaro aye vice mayor Gunn aye mayor gallis and the mission passes unanimously you are offer us thank you very much all right I'm 24. unfinished business we have any Unfinished Business Council all right let's move right on the end to the services well I guess I a question on uh with respect to the city manager or Marion and responding to Mr Griffin's latest communication with the council I just I guess just to be professional in response and to request do we have a timeline in mind for response to that I I didn't pick anything out I haven't said anything yet I was uh I was actually hoping for a nudge from the counselor basically contacting city manager of the City attorney and and giving me some direction on whether we need to have a special counsel meeting I guess I was just wondering if a City attorney Moore picked up any Vibes in his discussions with Mr perfecting nurse to timeliness or a response when I spoke with him last week I informed him that this body would be meeting tonight that I had not yet received an occasion that a special meeting would be scheduled on the manager selection process and then ultimately it would be at the will of the body whether or not they make a decision tonight and that I could not guarantee one would be forthcoming or not or what that decision would be I was very explicit with him to manage expectations to state that the offer as from the city's perspective was not open but if they chose to extend it again and you chose to extend it again you course have that option as far as process and timing he bought he did not say and I need to know in x amount of days he did Express that he was was and remains eager for the opportunity that he welcomed the opportunity to work with and for this this community and ultimately he respected whatever decision the Council made but wanted to make sure they knew he remained interested and eager depending whatever decision you make whether you decide that you certainly are able to make that as a body tonight if you so desire a thesis to that and that suggesting you hire somebody tonight either way but if you wish to offer some closure on that or have a Direction you should move simply provided and I will execute as appropriate thank you I would be interested in hearing the council's general thoughts on what they would like to do so that we move forward and offer the opportunity again or are we take a step back and continue working in another Direction um I would be interested to know um during Wars that he contacted someone at the Florida League of cities and what is the status of that um thank you uh so in recognizing that you were in transition and that I've facilitated similar processes in the past I wanted to make sure you knew what your options were what regardless of what you choose upon learning that Mr Griffin had withdrawn his candidacy reflecting on what next steps might exist I reached out to a contact with the fccma FLC senior advisor program it's a program of retired managers who offer consulting services to managers and communities for free for communities that are I believe under 10 000 residents in which where they are I reached out to see if they were open to working with Bellerive sometimes they'll say hey based on history or based on availability we're not in a position to help they said that they were they were willing to and and gave me as I provided to you the list of managers in transition that is the list of managers who don't have positions are affiliated with the organization and are looking um ultimately it was there there's no status update because I had no client Direction given the way that the as you all well know and I'm not suggesting anything contrary given the operation of the Sunshine Law I haven't been in contact with any of you directly as to this is what needs to be done or have any sense of where this body wishes to go I make sure you have information and when you have an opportunity to deliberate and provide me direction you do so I there's no status beyond the resources available if you so desire just like you know the world remains your oyster thank you very much Mr Banker well I believe the last session Mr Griffin was here he argued for his wife's health insurance to be paid and when he didn't receive that he bowled in front of this room and said volumes to me because of meeting went on for about another two hours I'm going to discussing a five million dollar job my opinion he showed no interest in the cities moving ahead when he didn't get what he wanted um one resident Saint Paul Council I believe a few articles he was terminated for the cause I'm not sure why he was terminated I think he should be taken off the list I think we have middle of diamond in the rough sitting next to Mr Moore he eventually promoted and that's my opinion thank you Mr Roberts would you like to weigh in on this I would um as all of me know I was one of the four initially that was in favor of moving forward with Mr Griffin um I I wasn't exactly pleased when he came forward with a request to add an additional sixteen thousand dollars approximately for his spouse I shared with him openly there that there were options out there that I know were available to now that would allow him to get coverage for his spouse at a much much better rate and a very good coverage so I wasn't real pleased with that reaction and then as we all know he came back and said well he wasn't going to be able to move forward without that so he was withdrawing his application then um through Mr Moore we were contacted and everyone we would let know that um he did find something else that was better and he wanted to proceed in addition to that as Mr bankery reference we were copied on some articles from the newspaper so that coupled with the information that Mr Moore provided to us regarding tools available to us to find potentially interested in parties that were previously or currently city managers around our state I personally would prefer that we not move forward with an offer to Mr Griffin thank you very shortly okay I'm not in favor of moving forward with Mr Griffin I am in favor of reaching out to some of the resources that are available uh with an effort to try to streamline this process I think we lost some candidates because we because our process is so long moving through the review of the um resumes lack of response on the city's part to those individuals who showed an interest in the position um you know I think there's and that's where that's what we could be more successful if we brought in an outside source to spearhead the project rather than us waiting a month in between every meeting and not being able to move quickly enough with parties that are interested in the position I don't think it was a month between every meeting maybe we had special meetings but even then uh our hands are tied trying to extradite anything and there is a very good possibility we lost a very new candidate because of Tolerance and uh so they have another offer so I would agree with you and I'm just going to say in Patty's defense for she is not a human resource officer so it's really tough to sound her with all the responsibilities when we could potentially use one of these senior advisors or firms thank you I tell you but yeah I'm agreed in not moving forward just want to remind everybody that you know how come we don't have a city manager you know things are going on it's a due diligence due diligence it's precisely that it takes time you got good days you got bad days let's continue to push pull on every way just want to point that out and yeah we're at our time you know certain mechanisms that we cannot unlike a private firm immediately hire somebody go on you know right after the interview boom you know two days later they're working um it does take time but having said that yes I would recommend again not going forward without hiring and then going back to a working session to look at our options and I'm saying you know back to all the options from the canine uh you know interim city manager up to looking at the new people that's all thank you vice mayor God after the last meeting with Mr Griffin kind of fell out of my favor and I'm not in favor of supporting any further discussion with Mr President I think the train has left the station but I think what's important right now is we moved forward because we're at a decision point on how to proceed for this thing what I see is just gleaning from the discussions here we've we've got a some some Alternatives here we had suggestions about a headhunter service we we certainly can repeat these cities job search and take this project on ourselves once more we can look to Alternative sources I mean the city and attorney talks about the Florida legacies one we forget is the icma they do a lot of this this kind of work and they have people standing by also to support the city manager there to that sort of thing and what I will also throw out there is in consideration of extending the interim city manager duties kind of in the form of like a probationary period extended out six months a year things are seem to be proceeding on a on a well-balanced approach to running the city while we take the time to sit back and decide how we want to do this thing you will the expression comes to mind May case slowly the job's getting done let's take a take a breath figure out where we are and how best to pursue I would agree with you also on that um if you look at just all of the minutes that we went through it's been it's not been a toy ride we've been very very busy and we've been trying to somehow work in hiring a city manager at the same time Maybe taking a break is letting things The Isle released previous budget and uh during the budget period and uh in the next work session we discussed a little bit more what our game plan should be and uh and we take our time and uh and we come up with a solution that works for everyone on the council and uh and they will move forward on it I like the fact that we do have other resources that we were not aware of before we started this process and I greatly appreciate that so I am not in favor of bringing Mr Griffin in I've heard the body's Direction I will communicate the same too thank you very much thank you very much any other unfinished basis all right so let's move to city council comments it makes it up a little bit this time I'm going to start right in the middle with the boy Roberts thank you Mr Mayor um you know it was interesting I heard some talk about you know moving as quickly as we can because we felt like we lost opportunities with potentially the candidates and then at the end we were talking about slowing down so I think I stripped some gears on that move there just a little bit but obviously you know I don't think there's any perfect answer there but I think it is great that um Mr Moore gave us some opportunities there and actually some names that were given to him by the Florida Legal cities um I think it would mean in the best interest and obviously you may mentioned um we could have another work meeting where can we discuss that further and if we could have that sooner I think it might be better so that we can get the wheels turning on this uh firstly I think that would be a good idea and as we've said multiple of those people that have said that we have a good um University manager who's doing a great job somebody told me that you know the city hasn't burned down so that's a good thing but I think he's doing a great job and we should move forward to check and see what other people are available because I'm sure there were people available now that probably weren't available when we were openly advertising previously so um I think we have some options available to us and I think we should pursue all of them and move forward thank you thank you very much Judy Shirley yeah I just would like to thank Kyle for um everything's done during this transition thank you for you've been a great support and um especially thank you for taking care of the their Coastal booties for us and getting those underway and pulling together this underground project if you've done a great job thank you it's been a pleasure Mike Sable yeah unfortunately got a relay some values but you know Community has lost one of their own this past weekend uh Mr Bill nolden um bill was an eagle scout one of the first in the city to have achieved that Rank and he's also a Navy veteran ran a company that provided at least on the Continental side um special tables to the U.S Navy and their submarines to the melbins you know our thoughts and prayers are with you he will be missed so just a reminder you know you know look after your neighbors we're a small community not everybody has you know family looking you know your neighbors sometimes they need help of some sort or another and I also want to extend an apology I got an email this morning for Miss Maul and uh you know I apologize you're doing a landscaping on behalf of the county you shouldn't be doing that but thanks for having me out to your house earlier this morning then again apologize for you having to you know do that stuff I'll let you do Kim's work so thank you thank you Mr Sable up next is Frank Baker [Music] um earlier citizen got up about paving at the evenings I've been told to a few people tonight first I haven't found one person in favor of that um a wasteful money I think it would bring in all sorts of uh electric bikes and everything like that going right down the street litter um I think that thing should be tabled it definitely the thought process of doing this I know it was discussed at a work session this year and go forward I talked to Kyle um last month and he was saying they were thinking about doing it I guess on the 12th and 13th Street project since you've already had Barber green out there and paid units but I think that should be squashed for now the other thing I want to say is I attended the magistrated here in last month about a tower that the mayor was heavily involved with over the last I guess two three months our City attorney and our interim city manager did an excellent job in defending our code and bringing safety to that Resident I just I thought Leslie material no comments vice mayor with regards to the switching of years I I I think the strategies would really take me to use to slow down just a little bit to decide how best to proceed with this but once you make a decision on how you perceive them time is of the essence and that's when the amidst create on this thing so I don't think we need to continue to completely okay the best practices I've seen at other Council meetings is that it would be nice that maybe during discussions or something like that in between rather than just having a great family picture on the screen would be nice if we had the agenda on the screen so that the people in the audience could see what we're talking about and they can see some of the dollar values stuff like that I've just seen that so in between kind of just we can have the agenda up there so they can see which line item we're on and where we are in the agenda and also once a while if if possible we can Flash up uh one of the the charts or whatever we're talking about specific data so they can follow along with us wherever they just sit out there and try to clean all this knowledge from the conversation just just a best practice I've seen at other Council meetings and some of our sister cities here the attention Pond across the street at one time my understanding was there was a fountain out there it was it's flown and that's how they kind of controlled some of the stuff that maybe it's time to revisit that is you know it may be a cost recruiting cost for power but it might solve some of the issues with cleanups and that sort of thing the uh along with the the consolidation of phase one phase two for the undergrounding we really need to work into the discussions of the strategy of how you plan to pay for that 1.2 short you'll get a shortfall want to make sure that there's a kicked down the road too far we need to start working that entire budget discussions that's all I have thank you very much thank you I also agree with the vice mayor guy on the holiday the slowing of the year's conversation around that really gears start moving quickly whenever you say go and that's whenever you have a brand new set of uh candidates at any given time as long as once we say go and we we begin with the search process that's whenever I think it's it's more important than it is uh being in a hurry to formulate a plan uh I will admit I that one was on me I put something together that I thought would would work unfortunately it was not a realistic plan because of what I mentioned earlier about how our hands are tied because of the Sunshine Law so I think that if we work together on a plan and whenever we say go we step back and let it happen as practically as possible and we'll have a larger set of candidates and better chances of agreeing on someone also there are several issues concerning our current code for new code and methods used to enforce our Municipal and County codes I'd like to address some of these issues in our next Council work session until then I would like to thank everyone who attended either in person or on Zoom Allied to thank the council and staff for your dedication to this city make my job way easier than it should be and with that being said do I have a motion to adjourn motion adjourned Frank Baker do I have a second very surely all in favor aye aye any opposed all right good night everyone"
