    "transcript": "things start feeding everyone it is July 34 2023 and the city council work session at city of Miller Beach will now come the order let's rise allegiance to the flag the United States of America to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for our home Patty would you please call the road council member Belinda Livingstone here council member Leslie Notaro here council member Lloyd Roberts president council member Mike Sable vice mayor Jody Shirley mayor Dave Gaddis here city manager Kyle wiesler here City attorney Randy Mora president and council member Frank bankerd was unable to attend we have it looks like we have six genuine 10 items tonight however due to recent events especially on social media a lot of confusion disinformation concerning the whole proposal or possibly purchasing a boat city manager riefler has uh has asked me to add an agenda item so he can further present his case as to what he plans on doing with this boat and the size the cost things like that so we're gonna we're gonna amend the agenda to be item zero for uh for a discussion of the boat purchase and and I would like to start right off with that aisle so that being said I'm going to hand before and over to the city management thank you mayor I'd just like to go back over the timeline of events of the proposal and go over some of the some facts and uses and discover all the information where it's at right now so uh the first budget Workshop was on June 19th at the budget Workshop it was recommended that we look into starting a savings program for a code the reason why I had was to have the ability to address the inshore issues that would have come up periodically with the city so after that budget Workshop I did some research and found some existing government contracts I realized that for our news in our shower inshore environment it seemed that the rib rib boat would be in the epidemic folks that most of their agencies tend to use for the purposes and have things for a rigid inflatable vote actually located a GSA contract for a 21 foot rigid inflatable boat that contract that use as an example for Budget learning purposes the uh the contractors for about 81 000 for the for that boat and it was valid until 2028. um so in preparation for the second budget Workshop I put in the savings program for the boat and put it on the five year timeline at twenty thousand dollars per year that's more than what the contract was I just put it in for some little room um at the second budget Workshop it was discussed to look into a possible faster timeline and purchasable as opposed to five years we kind of Summer on board with purchasing in the next Leisure here um I kind of a lot data to keep them over two years later program doing some further research since the last budget Workshop I discovered that for the specs on that GSA contract for a similar boat right now seller if we were to go out to bid I talked to vendors they could offer a lower price and we're looking more in like the seventy thousands for that vote so the boat acquisition would allow the city to perform and address maintenance issues in the future Coastal Waterway on Clearwater Harbor the one of the all this quote in order one of the major components of our maintenance that we struggle to get to is the stormwater outfalls we maintained 46 out of Falls throughout the city currently 14 have check check mails right now we're on a monthly program to get to each one of those check valves and clean them out we struggle stand-up struggles getting access to those males mainly because we have to crossover private property to get to the Mills so depending on when we're talking about the tides you know for the opportunity over Seawall we have the kidney contact with these residents to get permission rather than just go on their property this would enable us to get to these outfalls in a lot of quicker fashion it was last about a year I purchased a small John Boat which is I believe it's about 600 we've been using that as a the last resort on when we can't get on the private property to get to the unfolds is not exactly the best but it it provides us an option because we have only a saltwater trolling motor to use to get to these unfolds and you know to get into trouble but a decent distance from from where you can actually put the phone again and that's only a battery powered motor so um increasing in accessibility and also we have several downfalls that do not have the check files on them they have oyster farms will build up in them typically by the time we know we need to check clean out get back but balance they've already we've already seen back up it's having a lot of Bayshore Drive so it would be a lot easier to be getting around and doing our inspections even be cleaned as opposed to just waiting for just the signs of problems next maintenance issue or enable us to address is the buoys we have currently we able to maintain 16 uh movies that we put it in on the Beachside and then we have roughly 10 on the Clearwater Harbor Side the the buoys need to be replaced they eventually Break um from tie line which is down to the Anchor but oftentimes the buoys experience the issues before you need to replace the whole components like the the line down the main career system a lot of times I don't know if it's a vessels that are colliding with these movies but they they break down and they have trouble saying I'm currently on the Clearwater Harbor Center we put in standard number and it was less than a year ago it was last fall and they're already experiencing issues and a lot of times you have to hire a diverse and sort of re-rank the whole system but if you have just an issue with Hui itself that's that's something that we could just hold on and switch out before the actual paper line goes another maintenance issue that we're facing right now is the side edge for the slow speed zones on the pilings those exist predominantly on the south side of the city but I purchased eight new uh low speed signs to be replaced um it was at a requested residents to live on the water what I told them is that I would replace these signs of the last time I replace the signs it was actually a resident who has to have them in place an offer they took me out on their boat to do that I told the resident who was leaving the request and I purchased it sometimes I love them only had a great stuff to record me at a time when somebody would hope to get up change them out the another um another use for the boat would be the dock and see all inspections the docks and lifts are frequently failing throughout the city and by the time we're made aware when there's usually been at least some bodies and there's alert there's debris this is something especially with the docs that we could keep up with by um you know invisible signs of falling apart being poorly maintained before they get to the point where you know you know some high winds or wave action to to push a multiple independent um on another note with the sea walls we've we have had since sea walls were brought up by thinking Council meetings three to four years ago we actually had a sea wall Bayshore giveaway has collapsed on you know part of that backyard is in the water I mean you know that's not a good thing I'm sure upon inspection there were very obvious signs that see what was going to fail the idea would be for us to have to monitor this not saying that we would have an engineer on board but we would be able to identify obvious signs of concern for seawalling to be able to take pictures and relay that to the city engineer for opinions um another thing we could do with the boat would be the South Island um clear back there from the city hall it attracts a lot of people on the weekends that has accumulated tables chairs and all that garbage there's been fires out there from whatever people I don't know if they're cooking here if it did it on purpose but we've actually tables started on fire in the island there's also you've seen the American flagging some other flags from time to time but it's some sort of hard to describe makeshift I'm boldly erected on the island um that relates allowed that you know American flag is great but we do get political Flags out there I tried to address it one time and did remove it didn't dig them back but it was not easy to do I got some curriculum in the process of trying to knock off the uh deputies against the island take the flag down that's something that I think we could consider actually it is our jurisdiction putting up a real flag holes and then flying in America flying you know and keeping what belongs out there there uh another thing would be um debris in the water a lot of times we eat like I said in the Dodge scale or sometimes just uh Contracting is not doing what they're supposed to we've had enough you know 20 plus put filings floating around the water uh people usually call us concern that it's going to collide with their boat or their dog and our answer is supposedly we really don't have a full week to address that you know if it comes in to an inlet Channel area which we had in last winter we came close enough to get in the water I just towed it over and hadn't pushed it out but again it's difficult and we've had trees that were down and off bridges that were just we didn't have anything to pull those on the water um another issue we have is red tide we get out there on the beach side and you know pick up all the fish that are on the beach it's not only the beach where those fish wash up they wash Up all In Between the Clearwater Harbor channels and although they don't come right up within reach that kind of just float around and smell and people tell us that they're out there and again I don't know if you can do when we try to research with skin nuts but if we have a boat that we could also take it out and provide a quicker cleanup for the residents um another form of degree is the sunken degree that's out there we've had people hit sunken concrete forming sort of Shoals and they've lost their lower units under 100 Motors if in the very least we could locate these we could mark them so that there was something that was a hazard but we also would be able to pick up all about that would probably jump deeper into a little into the bed of the underwater it's not as easy as which are obstacle um and then it's come on from time to time we have these derelict muscles you know anchored out there the sheriff does their passive reporting stickering them but we also could monitor that so we could put have a little share in trying to keep their other vessels to learn how to call them just floating around with like the settlement that came loose and flutter into the bridge try to stop that before it happens um the proposed usage in my mind would be a minimum of two or five weekly patrols for a month to address these issues but it would be eligibly routine and then there would be maintenance projects um or cleaning a storm holder balance I have got some research into the boat club and Rental options that was brought up at the last budget Workshop uh just to run through some things for the um trying to remember the USA Boat Club Freedom yes there to start with the the program that we would probably be interested in is the Monday through Friday program the startup fee would be 3000 and the feed 349 dollars and that would you could have a boat from as early as 7am to Sunset from the year because it's roughly about a 20 minute drive from here I did look through the malls available at the closest club which is an equivalent of Arena and they do not have the script models that we're proposing to buy so you given the bottom of the Hall of those who really is usable in the waters and we have to navigate through but I mean it is an option to consider it um the other thing I I believe um we have to consider possible damages for using it for maintenance purposes um I did some research on the Clearwater Harbor we currently have 350 waterfront homes and that makes up all of our single seven homes roughly about 45 percent the taxable value of our single family homes on the water make up about 63 of the total taxable value of single family homes they they make up about 44 of the total City taxable value and of the total homesteaded taxable up value funds the waterfront homes actually made about 64 so it is almost half the single family owned half the population we might say that is living on the water and kind of just just the homes or not the kind of minions but most of the Condominiums are not Homestead of Photography so it is interesting that at those waterfront homes do think of a significant portion of the taxable value that comes into the city the Coastline of the cold water the total sign of the city about 7.5 miles in the Clearwater Harbor makes up 6.65 of those miles within our Metron is about 285. and just to put that in comparison we have uh 7.25 miles in city streets that we've been using and 2.8 miles another interesting thing is if you just compare the the distance we invest in a re-budget a savings plan for fifty thousand dollars for our tractor or a B training primary primarily four or five times a year um and again the beach front makes a point a lot of Intercultural Coastline that we are also responsible for and I guess one of the kind of control those numbers out there is thank you very much very uh detailed information Council let's start with lesbian materials do the property in the universe holy brokers I'm also in favor I think sometimes it's difficult to always cross Justified and has said a position sometimes it's just work that needs to be done and the cost of the equipment or asset to do that work it's not always going to be as a scenario we say by blind episode whether we say this much money I think I don't think Kyle would come forward with this request if you don't mind this is an asset if you've purchase so I'm comfortable and confident that that Kyle always going to be used to go to the city there's a Livingstone I only really appreciate all of the um [Music] appreciate the time that you took to explain the reasoning behind that I support you 100 in the big very valid information lightsaber um great question um this will be a trailer boat and store here on our site yeah so the primary trailer um except we were using it planning on using it the following day or whatever project we made use the slip monitor Arena whatever oh yes yeah I'll go back at it it's uh most of the things that we see here large expenditures have all been concerning flood prevention safety our beaches and support of our taxpayers and frankly that this boat is needed we need to maintain our Avenues to prevent flooding we need to provide for the safety of not only those on the beach but those on the Harbor this is needed and it's extremely well Justified thank you very much that's a lot of detailed work and really it every requirement as to why we do this I'm definitely affairs vice mayor Shirley so I agree I'm very much in favor of it I think I initiated the savings and then I came back to Ohio and said I don't think we should save this over the next five years I think we should buy it this budget cycle especially after um having a conversation with some residents and so forth I have been one of the residents that has lent my boat to the city on a couple of occasions we talked about for many many years how we can't maintain the waterways and maintain the things that we need to do we are on a Barrier Island and we have to maintain those Waterfront areas and so many times there's a recent City can't do anything because they don't have a vessel to take care of the problem the um I've been involved in removing the sea life with my vessel calling out the door aquarium letting them use it I'd like to see use it we've been very involved in trying to keep our Canal clean and safe because we don't have the no wait zone signs or missing things like that a lot of the no-wing signs that are listed on the south end would be beneficial because the manatee just loves a pile of Love out here the you know there's a lot of things that are outside of Resident needs that are also just Wildlife needs that we're not doing anything about because we don't have a dozen we've spent a lot of money on infrastructure but we are not able to maintain it all and we're not possess when we can't do that um I'm sorry if there are residents they don't understand the concept of what we're trying to do here but I would invite any Resident to phone me if they have any questions because I will walk them through the reason we need this we've spent a lot of time over the last 10 or 15 years trying to take take care of deferred maintenance on infrastructure and we don't let in back up with that same problem we started with when we started this storm Mark project so I am in total support you have my support on purchasing investment sooner rather than later thank you very much I would like to thank the city manager for uh shedding some light on this topic he actually brought some items to my attention because I was not even aware of whatever I was trying to think of what would we do how would we use this both if you take all of the benefits that that the entire city receives by having a boat to help maintain our drainage the check valves uh so Grant High issue because we all hate whenever that happens looking at the eyesore boats if you remove all of those things and say this is only for voters this is only for people that live on the waterfront well everyone in the city needs to realize that approximately half of the people that live in this community are both we are a boating community we do have waterfront property not everyone does but we all benefit from it we have a boat ramp right down the street that anyone can use and I see many of our residents use a meth program so it's not just Waterfront people so just removing all of the benefits that help maintain our city and just assuming that oh yeah this is just for voters just for Waterfront people well it's still half of the city and we owe it to whether you're half One Way half the other if you live in condos if you live on the beach whatever it is we owe it the city to maintain and take care of all aspects of this city and I'm sorry that it doesn't openly appear to benefit everyone in this community but I am 100 behind your decision to ask for this and I will support you all the way all right we have nearly comments or questions for the city manager of concerning this topic do we need any special vote to go forward and we've already come to the budget party and I just wanted to go on public record and and give more of a story than just what's being bled out on social media which is a lot of it's incorrect it's disinformation it is so if you get any questions please direct everyone to come listen to this recording all right absolutely all right thank you very much thank you okay now we're going to get right back on track with item number one uh which is discussion of consideration to reduce the city council from Seven members and five members I placed it on the agenda uh you'll notice that I also included a page of data which shows the populations and the number of council members or Commissioners that are on all of the the cities or communities in Pinellas County as well as the Pinellas Board of accounts Commission um you'll notice that we really stand out for having seven council members overall at seven there's a four I'm sorry four seven member councils and there's one nine member then I remember is the city of Saint Petersburg they have over a quarter million residents it was at the smallest above us that's the city of Seminole they have seven and they're at nearly 20 000 citizens um I I bring this to your attention because number one we're now having to face this whole financial disclosure report and I I know that some people are not going to have any interest in running Indiana I'm very proud of this Council and I think that this is this is a great group of people and I appreciate all of your hard work but I also understand why you may not want to run again whenever you're in some sort of some form of government and you're not having to answer questions to your next door neighbor because you're discussing matters that they have a little concern about it's probably not as big of a deal so the people in Tallahassee can make rules like this and it really has no impact on them because they were already new again whenever you get down on the municipal level uh or an intimate environment you know your neighbors but you don't know all your neighbors business and this is just another tool I believe to to disenfranchise us from wanting to participate in the municipal government so the last thing that I would ever want is for us to have or this community to have a council that elected seven members because they didn't have a choice there were seven people out there and that was being there at any given time right now it's four or three depending upon which election you may have one good candidate your life and there's three more you don't know anything about them but you have no choice you have to vote for them and that's the last thing that I would ever want for our family I only want what's best for that means we need enough candidates where we actually have a real election instead of just there you go there's your there's the four people who stepped up I hope they do us right I believe that our community deserves a choice so by eliminating two council members that's going to tighten it up a little bit and they will overall sample streamline the meetings we won't get caught up in sometimes needless discussions where people are just wasting our time I think that we can reach a consensus easier I think it's easier to have a conversation and reach a consensus whenever it's a smaller group you know not everybody's always going to agree but whenever you look and all these communities all over Pinellas County they all seem to agree with me that five members is way better to work with than seven or nine on a small scale such as our city it is so that's why I'm proposing that we that we seriously consider reducing the number of council members and now I will hook up for [Music] and I can imagine reasons to do so all the reasons you expressed about why I'm making the most sense in addition to these numbers that you provided I think it's I think it's a no-brainer I think all four of the issues it'll be interesting Randy so that I kind of view this as a blank piece of paper that was starting with so it's okay we are talking about and discussing these various options so at the beginning tonight however we have felt as a group is one piece of paper is not going to be populated then the next question is and I think Randy's going to be involved with this you know how do we move from where we are now to this I'm sure there's a very valid answer and process we can go through and make that happen so that would be the neat part I think at the end of the day but I'm definitely bored thank you Leslie I think I'm bored yes compared to these other cities okay I asked what um what made you change your mind I think looking at the other I was surprised at how many of the Cities very surprised any other comments Miss Livingstone and so given the data I was in agreement prior because we're such a small City you'll find is a good number but given the data that speaks for itself I'd say um I gotta tell you it came out this like a doubles Advocate first of all was then I'm going to look at the whole line here I was one of people on the charter that said yeah I'm going to have the term limits but if you can't be a transient about that I wanted I thought every single thing said look how can I justify seven how can I justify the term Limitless the election Cycles everything I couldn't and that was kind of the indicator of these are solar proposals I mean going down from one yeah I agree down to five members places Us in cities basically from us to much larger cities I agree moving to four years for the tournaments I agree with the term limits from two to three if foremost aligning the election Cycles Dave's emailed to hear and the employment with it you put it Forward very good precisely and frankly we have to deal with changing infrastructure of Tallahassee is doing we have to maintain home rule and you've piloted us in a way that we could still maintain home rule yet still have vibrant elections a vibrant communities so well done I agree with you thank you the five finger Shirley well since Mike just moved the meeting along oh boy on the topics of though I am definitely a support of reducing the number of numbers uh on Council I don't I don't know how we ended up with seven and you know I think it's one of those things you start the process and then it just becomes habit and you never consider changing it so with the facts you provided I don't I can't justify a reason for us to have more members we have so few citizens that are willing to step up and it's always a struggle to get people to fill those seeds thank you very much I've already already made my points on it I tell you before obviously there's there's four core points bullet points on this discussion really they're all tied together but before I go to Mr Mora for for his take on all of this what I would like to do is go ahead and take each one of these one at a time so if you don't mind let's face just on track and some of them actually go hand in hand but based upon what I heard from Mr Moore we had a conversation about it these are going to have to be on the mileage ceremony if they if we actually have citizen support and decide to to actually take this to an election so let's uh let's move on to item number two as a discussion of consideration of extending council member terms from 40 to four years again and my reasoning for this I think all of you have heard it over and over about how we have very little plow in the county we have friends in the county so as far as having long-term relationships it just uh we need more time not only that but this this one is actually kind of a spin-off of the Ohio four which is uh to align the elections and it's the only way you can do it can't align the elections without doing the four years but uh I think that three years is uh if we have good candidates three years is not enough time for people I would I would give anything to have this counsel as is for a total four years but we know it doesn't work that way but just think about how much progress we've made and uh how well we're able to get along we're at we have civil conversations and even whenever we strongly disagree we're able to work through it and reach a consensus so that whenever our regular meeting occurs where we vote together even though we you know occasionally we'll have one that's you know one or two that's one way or the other for the most part we already know how and that's the way a good council is supposed to work so that being said let's move right on over I'm going to go this way this time let's start with Vice May Shirley so we're discussing extending in terms of the accounts correct okay Mike saved I am the support of this living Stone the tarot yes Mr Roberts I am as well I mean and you already talked about the link between two and four because obviously if you have three years it's an odd number you can combine that with even numbers of the midterm in general so it's the only way to do both of those makes sense all right thank you very much we'll just move right on over to item number three which is uh this one's a little tougher it's discussing uh increasing term limits from two terms to three terms again this goes right back to building those relationships I've seen that there's it's kind of scattered all over the place there's two-year terms three-year terms four-year terms but because of where we're trying to go I think that we still run into issues by the time you get let's just say on The Big C or you get on the Sunday news illegal cities and you start representing yourself if you're in usually you're going to be in your second term I think the city is is pretty much learned let's not let's not elect a mayor without learning who that person is so the first term you're here you're building relationships in the community the second term you go out and you're you're on these mayor councils and you're representing our city on a bigger scale and now you start building relationships there well that third term is what's missing from actually getting the job done under where you can now you have pulled in people that are more willing to work with you because now they know you and uh they have respect for you and they're in the same boat we're all trying all trying to accomplish something the way you do that if you as you have great relationships so I'm going to start with this Livingstone this time on item number three a woman of a few words Michael okay uh during the elections just about well a few of us who are all um accused have you seen this as a stepmother to County to state to Federal literal elections and that can be farther from the truth what this does is it enables the sitting Council and the mayor to actively work to protect the citizens by working locally none of us here are running for State Council we just want to protect the community and this is really the best way and again I told you I only wanted to continue and I'm voted for that but with the changing conditions I now believe that this is the best way to adequately and proactively protect our citizens and further their cause you know like I said The Big C or to the county so again well done I'm definitely in favor of this thank you Mr Jose vice mayor Shirley thank you this one I'm not in favor of because if you give someone a 12-year span on Council is what we were hoping away with by quotations so if we extend the term from three to four years then it just puts someone in that seat too long in my opinion so I would not be able to support it all right I will withhold my comment but I will come back to you I understand why you're laughing anyway Mr Roberts I'm in agreement and obviously even though we're saying we want to increase it to three terms in this case ideally your terms the individual is still having to run for election voted in that camp so if you're not doing a good job I would like to believe that the citizens of our City who take care of this and your comments in this Livingstone I'm sure you've never posted which is why I do know or at least not a list um increasing the length of the terms and increasing the True News together at the same time and I go for one or the other but not both all right thank you and so my justification for this is uh is twofold obviously extending the term two to three I think that that's a requirement to continue building the relationships outside of our community I know that for a while we actually were just sort of here really didn't have we didn't have much of a relationship I'm not saying we didn't have relationships but I even today as hard as I'm trying but there's many times where I feel like I'm just being financed they get so long and but someone who's been in an additional term is serving their second term as mayor uh really safe to give more of your voice they get more full with accounting accounting Commissioners are it seems to me they're more willing to listen in ahead of you know myself however I am very annoying and I think they're all starting to figure that out so being forthcoming yes you're right this would take us from a total possible possible total from six years in office to a total of 12. it's all possible again I'm worried about the number of candidates that we have if we were staying at a seven Council and open the door for 12 years and I would I would be very worried that I think that by reducing you can take away some and then you give some I think that in my opinion it would be the best for our community but if it actually makes it to an election I guess the citizens will decide one way or the other and that's why Randy said that these would need to be separate issues so the elections um every two years would be three people and then two people so I'd like to believe let's say we go to the three-person election and there's somebody in there that's not doing a jump properly that we can fly the city would have at least one person or two people that would step up you know at that point you know I think that was proven the last election that happened so um but I know what you're saying if nobody else was running and the city felt like occurring candidates that they're running again for their second or the third term I just can't imagine them sitting by the wayside it's just letting it happen I hope so that's my thought but I understand what it was just saying but that could actually happen just um two times big risk Rovers any other comments or questions okay so uh right now we are four to two um any other comments that you would like to make it all right so now let's move on to the last one which is uh item number four lining or election Cycles within the general and midterm elections going back to what I said about sometimes you don't get a lot of love from the county I did reach out to the Board of Elections I sent a nice email requesting what would be our savings hopefully the process what what would happen What would be the benefits for the pros and cons of switching to being aligned with the general and midterm elections and unfortunately I got credits but I know for a fact we've been told in the past that there is a savings I don't know how much it is but it's a because they're already running an election that goes to everyone in the county it's much cheaper just to tag along on a big a big set of ballots rather than the smaller ones I did look at the election dates and how many communities are aligned with us and it's it's sizable but I think overall we would have better turnout because everyone knows the president and if if it's heated it doesn't go well and if the midterms roll around everybody still goes to the goals and they and they both so I think that we're we're going to have the best turnout if we align our elections with the general admin terms and uh and then that goes back to the the four years it was just simple simplify things for us so I'm hoping to comments I'll just [Music] don't go through the three years before right that's right it's out of the question if you don't change yeah I I think it absolutely makes sense my link question would be logistically as an example so we have in March in election coming up correct okay so taking the chart we would have to have these items during that election correct that election or a following election again we're opening the discussion and uh and then I would still encourage everyone if we decided to move forward on any one or all four of these items to uh to reach out to your constituents and see how they feel about it so far I've had a very positive feedback concerning this this matter they see the writing on the wall with what Tallahassee is doing to us and they think that we'll be able to defend ourselves better if we moving in this direction so this is just following that process then so in March that election would take place for how many of us four or three history this next one is through the reading history so three individuals would be elected and they would be elected for a three-year term [Music] I'm going to let Randy that start addressing this we sort of professionally it's not an easy path but it's doable yeah all wonderful questions um a few challenges to know in the process you're talking about four separate balance at least at this stage these four um assuming let's say you I don't know that we received consensus that's the last one yet but let's say we get there as there has been on the other three what I would do procedurally is put together an ordinance calling for the special calling for the election and it would State whether it was at the you know I don't know that we'd be on the timeline for the over election yet if there is uh we would likely be on the motorcycle which gives us more time to figure out how it's all going to work but ordinarily when we do a resolution or when you do a proposed Charter event you do an ordinance calling for that um for that special for that issue election and then you do a separate ordinance and resolution setting for the actual ballot language which has to be limited to something like 75 words or so um and uh and then from there we also have the ordinance that says okay and it's been approved it and submitted the language that an accident the challenge that you have here when you talk about the four of these is for some of you you're like well I I like the idea of one and two or one and three we don't know what the voters will do ultimately any Charter amendment has to be put to the electorate the electorate can take one and not the other and then we'll have to adapt accordingly provided that we don't need these things conditional and so you know for example in one way you're talking about changing the seven to four you may have battle language that suggest changing or seven five that changing the seven to five and other such necessary revisions to affect this change so we fix the core and element we're not going to put a specific thing just Quorum number but so that it all is is consistent so a lot of your questions will depend on what the what the electorate does and ultimately moving forward how we excuse me how we very particularly say okay does that mean we have to make this operate so these two seats that's the details that we'll have to figure out as we get closer to determining precisely the value language and its function so I'm not in position to sit here I do want to allay the concerns of any viewing public or casually observing members of the public that the consensus of this work session is simply to move in the direction of putting the measure to the voters the charter cannot be changed to work session it's not changed tonight I know you folks have sometimes had to deal with an understanding on the Civics process I want to make very clear that all you're agreeing to is to have things look before you for your later review to affect these proposals for the voters to vote on and that's what we're discussing tonight as far as the specific is on what every single measure would say I'm waiting to get some guidance from you and I think we're there now on which ones are improving to learn but then what if they're interplay and how to what conditions if the statements do we need to put in this to make this make sense does anyone have any questions for tomorrow so let's say and I hate to use scenarios that are fictitious so let's say John Doe runs for Council C in lunch and at the same time all four of these items that are affecting our Charter also on the ballot a normal periods this would be that assumption so then the general election happens in November just your good deal with those um those same three people because in this case it would be three that were just elected John though Bill Smith and Don Johnson they're all in now that's right so now November comes out would that make the most sense for all three of those people to run again to be tied into the new Charter guidelines it's a good question I think the the more narrow part of your question is what is the effective date of these changes and I think that's part of what we would need to resolve as one of these does it make sense much in the same way that you have a charter provision that says that you folks are available to vote on a raise but it shall not take effect until two cycles after right we can say and and if as you look at the language here you can see what year it was that they started to make this change to um you know seven members on these terms because they have on three-year terms because in the three-year terms provision section 2.02 they start laying out these terms will begin in 2012. these terms will begin in 2013 By 2015. everybody's on the same schedule so clearly in the last 15 years roughly your community has already done a version of this and so the effective day element is going to depend in large part on what you folks decide to do and we'll have to look at what does make sense if we do you may have to have the ballot language is not going to lay out chapter and verse the decision tree of what happens we may have to have you know if this measure is approved this cycle if this measures for this cycle I'm not sure I have to look at how we would do that candidly this isn't something communities do all the time if it gives you any comfort I'll say it's very pressuring of you to be looking at some of this and a lot not on this legislative session but in the last legislative session one of the preemption bills was to force all municipalities to move to the November site and there was a lot of resistance because of how different communities have you know evolved and keep their their own process going but those kinds of discussions are being had and it's proven to evaluate if that's something your community wants to do proactive but how do we make that work it's one of those the devils in the details and I'm not in a position right now to tell you if somebody's elected in March how we would do that we would look at things like well who's who is the next set to cycle off maybe we tier it that way there's a whole series of ways to do it and that's not where we're at yet but it's a very good question it really just gets down to effective dates of what of the actions taken okay thank you so it would be like shall we beginning in 2015 transition the council to or rather let's say it's 2022 now beginning in 2027 child accounts will transitioned to a five member body or something like that that you make that kind of thing clear and uh just to add a Mr Moore just stayed or told what just said is that it could very well be that the last Council on the seven member Council they made sure that they make their term may be a little bit longer than what it would originally have been or it could be that on whichever side of what it is that it falls on they could be a little bit shorter but it would be something that the council would have to agree upon because we have to write an ordinance to actually be able to address this so it's a single use ordinance that once the transition is made it would be accepted by all that okay maybe instead of three years or three and a half years or something like that or maybe you're two and a half years just to make every line up with the general and midterms okay all right any other questions or comments all right um obviously we still have some some things to discuss and uh in the tournament where where we would like to go but before we do that I highly recommend that uh you do you go out and you speak to the public and get their tape and see where they stand are we wasting our time because it's something that will never pass or mayor before we move on and perhaps I'm jumping the gun here I don't believe I I got Clarity on the individual members positions on the fourth proposal for aligning with dimensions I mean it just missed the number statements but people just answering if we can if we can I think everyone's in agreeance but we would just answering them okay that's all the questions I just wasn't sure if that was indicative I think for the most part um we were a little weak on the increasing term limits from two to three right and and I totally understand why but what I'm hoping is that uh if once they once everyone goes around and they speak to the community we get a little a little more opinions and we'll see if we're still on the same page next month whenever we have the next work session understood thanks to everybody okay with that yes sir okay great my my last question given the posture of okay there's a general uh in addition to move forward but we're going to you know talk to our constituents and see as a function of action items for me should I start preparing documents ordinances Etc or should I hold off for now with an understanding that that's unlikely Direction but let me ask if you're just thinking about it is that available I don't I don't do the I thought I can't charge my shower time or no no that's not where I'm at um if I lose a whole night's sleep maybe no um no no I'm talking about if you actually want me to put keystroke to computer pen to paper um yet or if it's give us a little more time we think we're there but we're not sure I just I wasn't I think for the most part the council is on board with this um have something that's high on the priority list to move forward so I can wish you award so we're not wasting time and that gives us more time to say this is what it looks like we don't want this we do like that saying I have no problem doing it I just want to make sure I'm not doing work with you don't work okay but well in that case uh what may be what might not be a bad idea is beyond what we've we've written right here maybe some sort of a pathway how do we get from here to where we'd like to go to something not I don't want you to spend a lot of money on it but something brief that we can actually show uh show on the community this is kind of where we're going right here and I'm able to answer very helpful I can I can do that I can do a sort of a point in a summary of it the mayor you all know the one thing we'll have to be mindful of as we get to about measure is the city's inability to advocate for the results of that um allergist as a friendly reminder of the statute to change and inadequacy for official City circulation we could say purely natural this is the but I just want to make sure because we do have some new reminders not everybody being aware of that you know you know this is where I'm a little uh a little confused confused are we allowed to actually once we come to an agreement as a council is that where it stops with trying to communicate to the community or are we allowed individually are we allowed to go out and speak to our neighbors and say this is what we're thinking about is that as long as we're not Old City time in other words in this meeting or we're in City Hall is that are we pretty much free to speak as we'd like individually generally speaking yes what I prefer just because it's been a moment since I've seen you reviewed the election hearing statute it's very familiar once it was adopted in 2022 I want to revisit it on what that looks like I can tell you electioneering Communications are you know Divine by Statute it goes into limiting what that looks like in Camp I just want to make sure I will provide you folks the supplemental guidance on where that line is I think that would be a critical part of this process as well I appreciate it Mr Roberts you had a commenter yeah just a quickie on page 202 of the document that um provided for us where it says discussion of increasing term limits from two terms and three terms that highlighted area at the bottom that actually wrote this before and the same follows comes up I think based on the language I know the answer but I just wanted to clarify it says council members including the mayor show people inhibited from holding office for more than two consecutive terms without any additional language there that kind of tells me somebody could go to consecutive take a break come back to two consecutive is that what the intent was foreign cycle if you wanted to come back okay but if you you're required to at least take one year off and then the citizens decide whether you they want you back or not perfect okay that makes sense any other questions or comments all right Mr Moore I appreciate all your help and Council I appreciate some of you giving me a time to uh to run through this all right now we are on to item number five which is discussion of Marina rental policies this is placed on the agenda by council members there uh Mr zabel you would have it before okay thank you um my task basically was response to the mayor was to use the mayor's outline recursion three is a three uh assigned Summit you know basically large ink and small um and factor that is to working a waiting list for the marina they could address individual boats in those areas trying to balance fairly the interest of Resident owners non-resident owners residents Etc primary Council throughout the community I set this out about a month ago I have a name updates uh to this I just want to know if you have any updates I mean I'm free for updates you want changes Etc I would be willing to uh to just let you go through it's it's not a very long policy and uh I think it's uh relatively early I have no problem with you just going line for line right further okay explaining uh what changes are and uh if we have any questions on each one absolutely um obviously we'll look at first one's data issues are purely administrative what we wanted to do was provide a procedure to address the marina waiting list and how to do this fairly background we maintain the waiting list for 18 votes list of nine eight to 19 feet and links for 24 to 50. and that provided the basis for the three zones the large medium and small now the procedures um with the city and these are my updates who are splitting the waiting listed to three separate zones and it turns like the slip size a person Desiring a slope will make the decision as to which some of their boat fits and places themselves on the list that allows you if you open a boat you can say I want the 1940 quote slip so I put my name there I can't put it on a small or large I just got it on the medium there but it also allows the person with notebook to go hmm large media are small if the wife approves some want the large okay put your name in there because later on we'll address those with no vote we have so much time to get a vote put it into the slope if you've been accepted now you can't move from one zone to the other once you're in that SWAT large medium or small and you stay there that allows others to populate the waiting list for save me a different small we don't want one person taking up three slots that can be a little bit wasteful at the time and it works against other citizens that are just like you again trying to be balanced now the list here the if you're ready to just look at the city you have to fill out the marina weightless one obviously the list war is not unlisted on this but that details would obviously your address phone number contact information whether or not you have a vote what size of the boat what size of slip are you going to be requesting again which of these three largely or small are you intending to place yourself in now like today we'll have uh over to see how based it by December 31st we're going to go through the you know confirmation of Interest we want to make sure that this list is current and updated we want to make sure that we're going to send your letter saying hey you're still interested you still want that large you know if you maybe change your mind well you could move your game from that that must be everything back again maybe move it up to another list but again you're going to be at the bottom you may have been number two at the large but now you change your mind you're going to go to the following us it allows people not to really be bypassed now we get into a little bit of the detail here you have to and like rested before that put your name on the list without having to vote you're agreeing by signing over the documents that you are able to obtain a compliant vote within 90 days of accepting the offer of a slip so day one I get the phone call I had placed myself on the small list thinking that's all I'm going to get away with but in the meantime my aunts died and left me a considerable amount when they want to go to the large well you can't do that you have a you were on the waiting list for a small you can't move around so you're going to have to obtain that vote to fit into that small slope that's your name was it or you already have your boat one you ever run on it and complete the transactional city yes yes I was just going to ask the question so what would be the downside of not having to stay at the beginning what size boat you're going to have to be on the voted at all because that would take the place of somebody else that might already have a boat and it is waiting to move their boat right now into a slip for example if you signed up for the large your name is down the list maybe you're number two now foreign not to accept that oh that's why you really have to narrow just one of those lists down but some people in fact most of the people that would be on this list will already have those and that's an assumption I made Detroit instructors if I don't own a boat yep you've already got your mind and you uh you contact me and say well we have an opening just based on where I am and who is and as far as this sign so therefore you have to have a vote of this size well you were already on the list that you've already picked one of those scriptures if we didn't do that if it's just a list of people that are whatever the order is and then we're giving them the flexibility of choosing them both I mean even if they had a book away they might even have a small vote but now they're mixed up with the best go forward you're not on the big list only those people are big so you're forcing in the beginning to gate yourself into one of those three games that's my question why are we of course I'm gonna check out here a little bit number one um okay you suddenly change because a 40-foot boat is available but you that's not what you planned on and you you actually whenever you put your name on the list you're sort of thinking logically okay well this is the science quote that I think would be the most practical for me but also I'm perfectly capable of handling this size but whereas certainly he realizes there's a 40 foot slip over there that is coming available and he can just jump over there and get to the front of the line and so he goes and buys a 40 foot he's not he's not weighted and he's uh probably not qualified either here you can go in all sorts of ways with this with this uh conversation but I think that you if you're going to release a slip from Bellaire Beach you probably need to know what it is that you want to put against there and I think that that's I think that's fair and it also creates more opportunities for the residents because now we've got three lists instead of just one list but everyone's going to have their own opinion I thought that that was the most logical way to do it okay and like you mentioned earlier you said you're assuming that most of the citizens already probably a small percentage of people that are signing up I'm assuming no scrub Maple is to have a vote will almost challenge you too very close and I'll tell you why I would get angry document that there are people that don't have boats in Maryland reach where we have nowhere to put it and they don't want to go down there and put it in a high and drive then there's no more really bad yeah but the issue right there we already put that into the worrying work to sign up for those you don't need to vote yeah I would just make it out there remark I guess most of the people in The List have those but yeah you're totally able to just have 90 days but which to put a boat that matches that large being small into that slip and I'm also going to challenge you on the 90 days the reason wise the bigger the boat the harder it is notes but to find the one that you want and you still get a lot of past marine surveyor and that's why I was actually okay with the six months I think it gives somebody time if you wanted to buy a boat in Mississippi it's a big deal to get that thing here but sometimes that's where the good bugs are at yeah and so I was okay with 180 days just because find one I think even with a little 24 foot fishing boat that we've all it took us probably four months to actually decide on that boat with the one that we have now we ordered it took a year to get that thing and so um what I would have to do is knowing that I had a boat coming and I had nowhere to put it hope that they'd get it opened up and then put my name on the list I'm still gambling on the six months so you want to move it to I would say 180 days would be more realistic okay [Music] yes you would pay rent okay with this application I don't know what's on the uh I don't have the audience currently so they're not putting any money they're not putting any skin anymore no no it has to be on the list if your name comes up and you have signed up with the largest slip that we have well then you have to start paying rent right there and there and you can keep that rent that slip paying rent the whole time for up to 180 days it might be the time to put the uh the lift in it but that's the only way to see that's the luxury of being able to have a slip and look for a boat but here's my point if you can just add your name to a list all over town because one day you hope to get a vote you're going to add your name for this all of the town and there's no requirement to put a deposit in which I know it might be created an accounting nightmare but I'm just saying there should be some skin of the day at the application I see what you're saying so put some put some cash down for just to uh foreign [Music] and still we're back to now that that's football sitting empty for six months and you got other residents so it creates this appearance as though where they have cold in most of them so I would just be cautious about playing with that too much um typically if you have a 20-foot boat yeah right exactly yeah it's the bigger ones that are harder because they're so expensive right I mean they're all expensive but I'm just saying they're very expensive and it's hard to find your way I would be all for the uh the deposit however because we're trying to make sure that the marina accommodates our residents I would be all for the deposit provided they Supply towards the first months we're in yeah application fee called an application fee well it is replaced yeah what happens if the person who's mixed up their line we paid that fee we'll get back when you're over there if they're offer the slip and they have not to take it and they would not receive their demons personal entry you can pull out prior to being offered the same once you're offered that's it I gotta write that down hold on hold on I think that makes any sense otherwise you've had to enjoy these concern which is we're just going to sign up if you're concerned with a length of time maybe the smaller the boat last time so maybe 90 days on the smaller ones and 180 or science like that was a larger ones it is it's very difficult we we should offer info for over a while and never could actually reach a consensus in my household you being the consensus being no no no no okay so let's say small medium 90 day large and again use these interchangeably within a large 180 days as long as you're willing to pay rent and the one thing that you know would challenge you on or or suggest or is that whatever that size slip is that you're preserving we need to have a default rate which is probably maximum yeah whatever the maximum footage is for that slip if you're going to have it empty for six months that's the way understood are going to build next they're not you're not going to get a different rate say within the small category of anything from one foot to 20 foot that's all 24. you're it's three separate prices or a Criminal by fluid or square footage it's a very separate prices that's what I think if we were playing um go ahead the worst case scenario very long so they've been paying for nine days they're deposited going towards the first one they're paying anything they still couldn't get the vote so then they hit the bad news figure out what I'm reading is yeah put your rib in my slope for the next time I hear the engine is on a container all in the water it's good I like all those Porsches that are at the bottom of the Atlantic right now hiding for small medium 90 and the large is 180 days I'll be honest we've got this whole I got to redirect this send it back out to you all any changes in that obviously when it goes forward into the account then we started voting on it but I'm trying to get on here what's right now again hey lean all over this thing okay let's go into the selections now this is where there's going to be some different viewpoints now it breaks up five minutes and then we'll take a break there right let's take the burger yeah all right we don't want to get too far in the weeds here all right so uh let's take a break Let's uh resume first you got it all good yeah session [Music] thanks okay might be some discussion here um again remember I'm trying to work for a point of creating opportunities and fairness and balancing the needs of citizens Beller Beach residents that have their own home slope are not allowed to register for this list and will not be considered for placing that diverting why because obviously they have access to maybe a smaller boat that they want but we have to allow other citizens to have access to that Marina and it just seemed kind of unfair I got one on my back and if I registered there now I have two subs I can put two votes for so it doesn't make everybody happy but at the same time it makes everybody unhappy so we're here in the middle world can I say something sure I don't agree with that at all okay and um I'll just use it for instance if you are in a minute I'm going to do things inverted uh you know yeah a lot then you may not have enough room to have a big vote and if there's a slip open for a 50-foot boat what's the harmless I don't I don't see where that matters that that homeowner is paying as much if not more taxes than a home that doesn't happen and I think that it should just be across the board available to all homeowners period great thought but again it goes toward I guess opportunity those that do not have a their own slip of that have been slowed them back this is their only possible accessibility and they have those trying to to cross a balance here but um I mean I'm going to go forward to this graph but if you want to I guess confident one gets further up for and they can't put a slip in or if they do they have they have the cat walk out to it it creates issues with neighbors and I know when resident who helps us quite a bit that I know that that's a problem in this backyard yeah the person that argument doesn't work because I said if you have a homeless today is limited to the size of the boat again a lot you know it's not good it's not going to make everybody happy other comments on this particular section but yeah we're going to get into it later yeah just my gut feel again I'm not a local person now now but it sounds like we're creating a rule that's handling citizens differently just because they haven't lived before that doesn't seem fair that's a good point because we're going to get into differences a little bit later on in a real thing in the movies now at no time will any household regardless of how many homes the applicant may have you may have free homes you only have one voter registered for marine you're more than one we get that that's it again can we just go ahead and stop and just stay focused on the very first sentence sure because two council members have valid issues with this I'd like to hear what the others have to say foreign [Music] about an iron art but we can fit a certain size of which we have well if my husband wants to trade in our boat for a larger boat heaven forbid say we did have a slip that person is infiltrating and in for a different size because he wouldn't have access so I think it's and I'm using myself as an example even I don't know about the water but putting myself in somebody else's shoes that just limits your ability to get a bigger boat if you want one so you were against this first sentence I'm assuming that right now that we're going to look at remove at least up to place them at the marina from slip assignments or well I'll leave the slips assignment to prioritize remove the other beaches have their own little slip are not allowed to register for the list and will not be considered for placing them at the marina yes secretary here okay so I'm going to delete that but now at no time will let me out regardless of how many homes the applicant may have in the middle of each have two or more votes registered at the marina so that allows the case where if you have a slip at the house you're getting the big boat you're not violating that it's only if you have attempted to have two boats at the Marine correct okay and I think moving forward if anyone has issues with any one of these just speak up otherwise just let it move and Ride Along I was given two constraints one was size small medium large next was really uh who is allowed to hit this list first of all is resident owners now these are full-time residents that also offer their own bill their voting citizens that own the house that's evidence and this is a rough day current voter registration copy of their ownership.com hey here's my mortgage here's my voter registration yeah now you're a priority One priority to resident non-owners these are you know renters long term they have a voter registration again these are people that actually vote here I heard comments about Robert shafted again being a non-resident well you're not a voter I had to make some stipulation and that that's where I came down third non-resident owners these are people that obviously I got a home in Tampa where I live in Charlotte um this is the third they own the home but they live elsewhere somebody that is in that house probably right now um that is frankly they're paying the property taxes I don't think it is when owners are going to hand over property tax up and they are active voters in this area so that helped us the Church of to that Resident lawn mowers and finally non-resident non-owners their last in the priorities we're trying to take care of the voting citizens number one so you know it's an attempt to Trail make that any thoughts I have a question Mr Moore looking at their priority tree I don't want to raise it a numbers versus president non-owners constitutionally do you think that there's a possibility that that rule could be challenged that's a waiting question I would say that does the possibility that that could be challenged absolutely I think that's true of anything especially where you're starting to make distinctions within your own Community further still in this particular context this proposal is contemplating divisions based on those who are registered voters if somebody's unable to be a registered voter for some reason I know that we're in transition on the law on felony convictions and the like but otherwise that that can lead to challenges I am sensitive to the dynamic that we have in a lot of our Barrier Island communities where it used to be that your resident base the majority your year-round investment makes me have made the majority of your community and that's shifted substantially in a lot of communities especially those unlike here where you have short-term rentals permitted as an industry but yes I do think that there's a potential for a challenge there I haven't specifically analyzed it I've analyzed it for another community in the terms of access to Parks um and saying you can't come in this you know if we have better Beach Park oh you can't come in this park because you're not a resident that never is allowed um public parks are long recognized to be Public Access there have been permissible distinctions on resources within parks and saying well these gazebos are reserved for property owners who have paid in and there's some Authority out of Rhode Island on that but there is a potential for a challenge yes you know it's merits I would have to get into more with one else was there still a same opportunity for a challenge if it were a state issue identification such as driver's license or just a an i issued by the state generally that means you're a full-time president of the State of Florida and that doesn't mean that you're here full time with the majority of the time if that's where your driver's license is at and you're here more than you are elsewhere that we think that that would be the gospel challenge less of an issue you're I want to make sure I understand your question you're not saying because I obviously state issued ideas is routinely used to validate the identity of somebody you're saying the eligibility decision tree here would be you would have priority if you had some form of State issue identification from the state of Florida is that what you're saying this shows that you are a resident of Miller Beach okay that shows you a resident of Bel Air industry um I've not specifically analyzed that issue of course communities make divisions all the time I'm just I'm reticent to opine on constitutional law issues you've had this on the fly as I was looking at this primarily from an administrative standpoint and not that that is something as we look to develop this policy I'd have to look into I'm just not comfortable issuing a blank and statement and I'm not comfortable with differentiating between resident owners and Resident non-owners is this is how I look at this one property one slip I just don't understand the resident not older idea of the property owner of wise for the slip I don't I think that property ownership should be on the list I don't think and it's up to the property but you're not a renter to come to spread the slope of the property the property owner wants to be responsible for that slip because Runners come and go you think they're going to be with you for a while and they're not you know things happen um I think it should be limited to you get on the list are you a property owner yes okay you can be on the list you gotta choose your Zone pay a deposit that's it that's it all of this these different tiers and all of the things complicated um trees just don't it it doesn't make sense to me and if I own a property that I use on the weekends in Delaware Beach and live in Tampa and I want to get on the slip rental Woods I should be able to I just don't I look at it from that guy who has a weekend home in Melbourne Beach probably paying a lot more money than any of us sitting around the table on his taxes because it's non-homestead and he has every right to get on that wait list as any one of us do you know it's back to property ownership should be the only criteria I mean and I'm playing Devil's Advocate at this point but they're not a voter in this kind of community just stated that you can't I can't use it what is registration I think it's a driver's license but that was the fun and I know there's a lot of condos that are you know people live in Tampa and they thought they were right I can tell you from my limited experience where communities have attempted to make as release access to City resources where they've attempted to make the distinction between their permanent residents and their property owners regardless of legal challenges that from uh from a Community feedback standpoint those those have been some of the more divisive debates I've seen and again I've not gotten to the point of legal Challenge and a court opinion on those but I can tell you that those tend to be the more contentious hearings where people started saying I am a property owner I pay more in Texas yes there are these are the voters I think the both of you are really encapsulating the microcosm of a larger dialogue that's being had in our communities in that case that can get us license for sure and we go back to the document then the way I built it I can pull this out look here's a list your behalf or go to Bible you're willing to place the deposit um should we put one exception in here I understand bye if we have and we have it's currently a non-resident non-profer owner somebody from Tampa that just wants to get a swim for a while or or should we and again this is priority listing should we place them above a citizen down here in 9th Street that doesn't have Etc I think we already decided that non-resident non-profit dealers are bottom of the list no matter what I think we weren't even here to take applications for a while that's what we talked about okay so I keep that okay I'm going so Judy which word would you think is more comfortable property owned or not publicly owner or a resident you know if you're a property owner yeah I'm not even gonna I'm not even a place that I'm just gonna go to the opposite here's the prohibition so if we're using the term property owner then what about those individuals that rent yeah um earlier about one application per address that way you leave it up to if it's a home for instance it's between the property owner and the renter but if it's a condo it's an address on its own that person has that right to it to do that so that's why I was taking this approaches this allows condo owners or residents or anything to get this whole deal there's just a Prohibition in there to say that if you're non-resident non-owner you can't yeah we'll put you as well as quickly at the bottom of the list everybody else will be right he's owned the little template in all the combinations yeah and I see I see problems both ways personally the way that I feel about it and not everyone's going to agree but there are going to be they're going to be living in Tampa and they only come here every six months and they have a slip integer to have a big boat taking up a slip and it's never going to be you and you're preventing someone who actually wants to use their web they're going to use it often monthly you know bi-weekly whatever I will always appreciate everyone who's invested in Melodies but I will always give preferential treatments or just somebody who will happen his own property and that's that's my take how often do these slips turn to do so out of all the schools we get one or two openings we're spending a lot of time on this is it that big of an issue in the grantee the whole city no but we've had that conference of the past month why wasn't my I've seen other people get buzzle I said where's my name that's kind of how we came to this for our team Belinda brought up a good point which you said earlier in many things so let's say I own the house but I hope long-term rental yep so she I want to vote because I'm in demography and I'd like to keep the boat there even though I may not do it and I don't live there obviously because Jody's five years about a year of Mace from the house and she wants to vote because she does it there [Music] earlier it's like Gary May will be I pay more taxes San Diego just because I'm paying in Tampa here so therefore the owner is really looking to do it you can't extend this um well actually maybe it's your Runner the earlier at the moment well if you own five homes if you're bringing them all out there four times a day than anyone is but you're also making sure that someone who lives here is not going to have access to this well the way a place that was at any time any household regardless of how many homes the applicant may have in Miller Beach have two or one votes for a certain Marine that was under a I was trying to catch catch air I agree with that situation closing time my fleet um let's get through b right quick yeah so what's your what's your proposal now that you've heard everything oh no I mean delete those session all I'm going to do is put a Prohibition there basically just saying non-resident not owners they're less than priorities non-resident what non-resident no no does everybody agree with that there's no this part here just that it allows me to sit easier into the rest of the document okay waiting list is going to know don't apply a four size of the book hold on a second yeah and that's where we're at currently is that right non-resident non-owners currently as long as you're on the property you can get on the top side because the resident was um where the distinctions drawn is if you get the opportunity to run a slip if you have a driver's license as other mechanics you get a resident ring you don't say that the taxes fails so we do have non-vertisement non-own orders there for them um so background that they brought Steve waiting let's just put another plug for size of the boat proposed by the applicant removed priority status [Music] we're going to sort by Zone and then I'll just remove that um list will be certified Zone as a hurricane City checks which of the three is located for that those Consultants because you pay the deposit a person may decline but if that occurs the name is removed from the waiting list for zenmate to the next one of the list and so on until the split this building I mean um priority [Music] actually this may be a republic size and one foot I can safely be accounting so you know I think we should remove that because that throws away all the prior page I think that was supposed to be uh um you actually unless you start applying for example you can pull your name for the small you want to go to medium starting a lot of new year you can't use your number two and medium to go to one or two of mine so priority is the time you have on the list that's it responsibility [Music] um you know obviously like the only thing I added on that section was the city assumed no responsibility for the state of operating conditions just wanted to make sure hey I know just wanted to identify that's it currently we're currently able to move yeah but his subject to inspection whole lot of it is I'm updated this okay but because it's just going to be like looking at all the other knots that's like go to pushing you know a dinner agreement I got to keep myself an improvement on a property I mean think about it just think don't not for the night I just it came up with my thoughts whoever's coming into the slit you know they take over the ownership will work part of this modification probably should strike that because aren't hurt if I'm reading this right this is what you did when you decide and that's one thing I thought there was a lot of wars that weren't consistent like we call this the less the less CEI definitions here and up here we call them something about something else so we're not confused at the same word for the person writing this system but is that the agreement of the code yeah it says adolescent uses to use the lift the lesson cost to maintain them order um and then we add some language to take it seems responsibility the problem is until it means right okay well I'll do is I'll just I'll leave that there but we'll just keep in mind that's gonna go for approval so I'm trying to make it but everybody's changes into this send it out of the Kyle and then there's one I guess order okay at the next one all right Mr Jose appreciate you uh we're good working on this and I'm sorry you didn't get past the grammar police I told you leave alone I don't care because they don't documents I said it's okay we're working together it's a rough draft and that's what we expect sandbag regroup we're not just being consistent ly we're just quite a few my masters in software engineering um exactly no it was prior to your view all right moving forward we are now on to item number six discussion of sandbag station proposal again members able you have Roger okay uh the original proposal was trying to move it to the north of the city but we're looking at it so you know let's place it here you know keep it where it's at but how can we improve inverse you know getting into it getting out of it and one of the ways we made it proposed is I took photos is we have a dead end right now it's called the snap and instead of filling your sandbag and take a contract to turn around and going back out the other route to potentially blocks traffic Etc we use this potential exit it is between two buildings it's between City Hall and that substation I guess from Verizon and there's enough room apparently it's about uh yeah they said 23 foot something like that width which basically could accommodate a car so if you were to throw up at the station you come to the end of 127 take a left you can considerably drive out through that way and then exit out onto basically the pharmacy although uh that eliminates backup traffic problems the only thing that needs to be some changes here and live with me basically we have a place for cigarette boats a trash cans and more importantly there's a bike rack if we could remove that bike we're having place it elsewhere we could use that Alleyway only for you know somebody use this period of wood Etc as an EXO Brown um I think we had enough to get distance you can see my photos later photos where that black heart is part it actually is not occurred it two amps down it's part of the handicapped access so it's just a ramp so you wouldn't be able to bang in your car accident with sandbag at the time it was say 23 or 12 and a half or number four on here it's actually 11-6 downspout and the uh right if you wanted to remove those um it depends where it is in the city of Boondocks County freeway I'm sorry yeah so it gives you room you know food and errors and stuff even if you bring a truck in there you're probably okay and you also have people back there going you know slow down okay I want you to go here so there's always some good evening I think it works it seems tight when you look at it but you go out there around yeah yeah the bike trash and if you wanted to you could always remove that pile on and redirect the downspout but you're getting 11 cents it's living still how are we going to ensure safety the rest of the time you have these vegan folks that come in and they park over at the beach and then they see this open Alleyway they're going to just zip right up here there never mind that we've got kids and families we're playing football and running around riding their bikes in the parking lot not ugly ensure safety because we're removing all of that we're just making it an invitation for folks to fly through there I don't want to zip on that road uh you're asking for damage because it may look nice and smooth but you're gonna have to go kind of slow through there that's actually a curve to get up like that burn right I'm just talking about your average person non-resident is here to have some fun at the beach isn't thinking Zips through there is rather than removing that ball if I would leave that there and make sure we installed on my agent corner but then you put them then you install them just like on a bike trail like they have like tourism so basically goes in a sleeve it's there all the time yeah unless Kyle um but I think to protect the building so if we do get them you know person they can't see it Dr Carl today not myself [Music] I mean it's a little investment but it makes sense too I think it's more of an investment than you think it is and and about her stuff I'm not I'm not opposed to this idea but I want everyone to be aware of what it is that we're actually wanting to thrive on [Music] this is reclaimed water that's reclaimed water and that's sewer sewer okay that's on um right there on the back side if you look on the front side in front of it there's more reclaimed water there I don't know what else is under this but I'm afraid that loading cars down with his Handbags and driving on this may actually cause damage um also once you open that Pandora's Box people are going to try to use it with by the way they're saying there's a water main right there and somebody's going to turn in and run over that the point is there's a lot of Plumbing under this Pandora's Box you're going to need some way to block the access it's continue to want them to go in there so now we go we're going to have to put up some kind of laws or blockades or or I can't remember who mentioned the uh the removable water hose whatever colors just things to consider because I'm the last thing that I would want to do is uh create a problem even worse for us for Verizon and they come after us because we uh we ran over something important so I think that we would need to do more of a study to find out exactly what all is under there requires site survey I'm also worried about if the county requires any type of if they may have any special law events to actually creating an Alleyway if they're setbacks involved and if it requires permit and so just all things that again I'm not against this idea but I just want to make sure everybody's aware that it's not just a let's start driving cars through here and it's going to work because I don't think it will yeah um I see a problem if they come through and then they're going to go out and they're going to return a lot of time to Causeway Boulevard that's not as an easy way to go all the time that and then traffic can be terrible turn left and we're going to get a backup and I also obviously give up a Verizon that we need there I'm assuming we need their blessing of some sort that goes back to the initial thought that what I was striving for put in the sandbag station is very normal because you're already from the citizens on that street reply because the last Forum now you have basic screenable parking lot of your parking people are trying to slowly evacuate I don't remember evacuation but she now blocked outside of the street now people coming back you're either having trying to get in so you're putting in the backup on golf get in but now you still got a problem left and right onto golf which is difficult too so we're trying to again there's no optimal solution we're just trying to provide another way to to allow those citizens easy way to egress having those citizens come and fill the same days to get out easily and not tie everybody up and you know put back and forth in this cul-de-sac so again I think the best is nobody really loves the idea which means that we're sort of in the middle right now let's see if it can work out a good way I'd say so we got to do a side survey so nothing says we have this I have another question could we set up a secondary sandbag station you know we don't need this that often but in the parking spots over here um so it gives two I mean I don't know how um because I didn't participate in helping people saying it backwards would it make sense to have you know certain addresses go to that yeah just go with this one and then that kind of solve some of the problem because it allows half of the residents so they're half of up here I was going to recommend it again it's like you could have one down here from the south because too often you're going to say it's the north is disenfranchised it's always South South people go up there and then South can come in here that way this street is not over taxed we don't have to use the variety of new buildings can is kind of gave you these balance because now I can easily working until we get their bags without in the Marines and against the wall where you're storing all the equipment here or to access yeah I was gonna say I agree with that I think the left-hand turn on the causeway is a big station I really do especially if we get close to people are beginning to panic and they're wanting to live because I think traffic is going to get pretty heavy and it would be a bad scenario if there was an accident and now I I'm ashamed to say that I've had a business to take care of whenever the sandbagging was going on but realistically what was that what was the cracking problem because we have a we have a whole sack here and yeah they're coming in and out of the same street during that time but was it really backed up that bad or was it just a nuisance because there was a lot of traffic it was badly [Music] you really have to kind of come around and get into right now that just happened to be the timeline game for those long-term staff here so now you have basically one side of the street cars Reaching Forward and you only have that one exit and that I mean I was trying to ignore it because people in that street trying to believe you may be trying to back up but now you've got all these people come to mind you really kind of wait it's not critical I know but that was the only problem okay so currently the sandbag station is on the left side of this street right here is that correct there's a lot of fun you're right yeah bring it all on the right side is there room to actually move that that station to the right side and the reason why I'm asking this is not it's not going to solve The World's problems but I think that it would help the reason why it creates more room to stack traffic they're circling around the cul-de-sac and now they're right there so you probably added 20 cars of space by just putting it on the opposite side of the screen thanks to the tennis courts and then you're bagging all the way out instead of all the way in I'd have to look at where our property lines are and you've got it the way it retention bond is that drains that way I think you've got to notice I mean obviously they're working you have multiple fills it's not drive up my car is building no what it ended up is car car car car car all these families bailing out now the car in the back is being you know there's cars here being filled still filled filled people run back and forth as they could fill so if we were to do that now trying to do if you're still blocking it again because you're you're not just getting one card at a time that's back back you're still blocking no matter what what I'm saying is if you at least added more footage of allowing the cars to stack up it's uh I don't think that that's a candle solution but if that alone would probably help a little bit as far as the second the second sandbag station up north where do we get our sand from and do they have a problem dropping off in two points well and what we faced last time was the capacity issue which I think we're always going to have if the storm kept coming towards us it really got worse I think no matter if we're facing a serious threat we're going to have a capacity issue but some cities that have a protocol gets to a certain points what we do and this definitely a cut off of wine given the situation um it may be something where we utilize the main sand station and eventually reach a point where we're backing up and yeah you just don't understand it and then really at that point you know you got in mind you want to try to keep monitoring that the residents are using it um you know not taking more than 20 you know put it really it gets to that point it really cross-checking lists and I don't know so the game deferred to North End cells to a gas station here gas station up there yeah you use either one of the traffic early it it apps no access problems either way I think it would ease you know ease the traffic and I think moving it all into one place or the other is not the best physical air some of it down here and I think that we've done the best yeah I would agree with that because before last year yeah everybody okay with that um how is that man by the way [Music] and volunteers directed the traffic like we just don't have the staff you know throw away against that bad okay the previous schedule would create a volunteer list of people basically and you come in and look the furry you'll get your sandbags first of all but you could help not only still but in some cases deliver soon things they refuse to leave I've been here five thousand years and currently is the Houston Marina and is there a good spot you've got it on yeah we got one of them um [Music] is there a price tag on any of this it is in the floor okay Mr Roberts I don't know if you guys have seen the Flex Seal commercials seriously the values of that crap yeah they show a house and and the house is under three to four feet of water and they develop this Flex Seal tape specifically for blank and you do the bottom of the doors and the side of the doors and the windows and they flooded three to four feet of water completely around the house flooded in a short time it's coming through the same bag as you can put it in unlike flexible it's the sandbags the sandbags other than making you feel really good about what you've done really it's the stop the glowing Sideways from billing under the door and that's how fast all right do we have any general business I just over there don't get me into the changes um all in favor"
