providing for an effective date or dates proposed for amendment amendments this is the first reading i'll also know judy shirley is here in 602. um do i have a motion mark the move makes the motion second body we'll open it up for discussion but he hasn't i had only one comment this was um i went over this just tonight with fred reilly our attorney it concerns charter amendment number three and it's just a style preference of keeping the title um not a standalone title so what happened is i read this thing separately and i didn't know what it was saying because it says shout out article 5 section 5.03 of the charter entitled eligibility eligibility qualifying to be amended to require a registered voter to be a resident in the city for 12 months immediately preceding the first election qualifying day so when i read that i said why do i have to be a resident for 12 months before i can vote that's not what we're shooting for so the change that i wanted to put in here was shout article 5 section 5.03 of the charter entitled eligibility qualifying be amended to require a registered voter seeking elected office to be a resident in the city for 12 months immediately proceeding the first election qualifying i think that clarifies it and it stands alone from the title other than that that's the only suggestion i mr riley i don't know what your opinion is on that that was my only answer i think that the clarification is fine that you suggest clarification i think it was a little worried for me too okay that's that clears about uh okay so um i'll open it up if there's no more city comments to citizen comments any citizen comments on this there being none i'll bring it back to council with the last word going to more than this was approved by the charter uh review committee so it's their recommendations okay guys i gotta read it one more time so as of as amended on under charter amendment number three for the adding in seeking elected office consideration of ordinance 20-05 an ordinance of the city council of the city of delaware beach florida relating to pre-proposed charter amendments for submission to referendum providing for incorporation of recitals providing

providing for appeal of ordinances and conflict here with dividing for several ability providing an effective date and providing for an effective date of proposed date or dates of proposed proposed further amendment or amendments this is the first reading a yes vote we'll get this on the ballot providing we give it a second guess vote mr city manager would you please call the role councilmember bean council member gaddis aye council member shirley hi councilmember slo aye council member rocky aye mayor manzo hi so it passes six to zero that's the first reading we'll have a second reading at the next council meeting on december's another shaking your head we have to advertise the second reading the we'll have to have another special meeting on the 21st of december 21st does that leave enough time to get into the ballot to the uh on the ballot yeah and translated we've got it we've already sent it we'll just have to make some modifications we have to publish it but the cost to publish it on a sunday it was like 2700 the cost to publish it on a weekday was 500. so we've got it scheduled to be published and we have to do it 10 days prior next week from december december 21st okay so that'll be the second reading okay um before i ask for adjournment lynn ridge is telling me that there's a special uh work session on special access in a work session called for wednesday and he said that there's not a quorum so um what day are we available if they're not available immensely for me this month is really difficult now we're talking about another me for um for a second reading on these amendments and i i just don't have i don't have it in my schedule at all so i don't know what i could i mean it would have to be in january for me just can't wait till january why don't we just do it on next monday night on the 7th it'll follow our council dude it's going to be a late one but everybody will be here so the night's already reserved and i may have to recuse myself from the meeting because some of the accusations in the email i don't think i can be present in that meeting okay and i'm going to go ahead and echo councilman to share with his comments well mr riley any recusals has to be done in accordance with the flora statute so anyone can put that on the um on the record and that's up to them well i'm at a disadvantage because i don't know whether you're referring to so i'll look at it and certainly discuss it with both council member slope and council on your shoulder right so we're going to schedule this for monday then december 7th right that's the next meeting our next meeting you have a council meeting already this will follow okay do we have a motion for adjournment okay"
