    "transcript": "all right good afternoon everyone I'd like to call to order the March 14th 2023 Park and record meeting could you please call the roll um Tammy lavender Patty Roberts John Wagner and do I call the city manager also yeah okay city manager Kyle reichler and Aaron glance community service so all together let's say we're all here all right that's okay so we're all here um oh and me yeah it wasn't understood okay can I please have a motion to approve approved today's agenda so I moved may have a second second all in favor aye aye all in favor agenda's approved may I please have a motion to approve the February 2023 um Park and record meeting minutes I'll second it all in favor bye okay all in favor of did we get those they they were attached to this so there would have been a page two three four five okay maybe it's over there oh I thought you'd hand them out before the meeting so I did not make a copy next time I'll make well I have extra copies of stuff if you need so usually like patty just makes one copy for the two of us to sign and give back to her and then she just emails them like the agenda okay yes she did oh my God February I did look at the stuff at the board package okay well here's an extra agenda anyway uh what is that it's like the minutes I'm gonna use but it's and you need an agenda John but I can follow along here she printed agenda I didn't see minutes I just saw agenda yeah she doesn't reprint the minutes I don't think I just have to sign them thank you okay okay since we have no citizens we have no citizens I do have a quick question so they're saying they didn't see the minutes is that how it works though I just sent send it to Patty Patty approves it and then we sign it she sent it out to everyone okay yeah yeah it's attached so it was page probably two three okay four depending on how long they were so like everyone had an opportunity to read them like as soon as she sent them out and then if anyone had anything they wanted to correct or add or delete okay oh but you know I'll ask her and if not maybe I could just run copies beforehand if she doesn't have time I mean I didn't even make myself a copy I just read them right I make a note save the tree and all that safe of leaf um okay so if you already get some copies with you just John do you want to copy right now okay of uh I have the agenda do you do you want a copy of last month's minutes right now I I seconded the deal I read them oh I mean they were fine I didn't yeah no no I'm okay I remember that they were perfect but I just met do you want us to bring our copies or you know I'll bring she usually makes copies and so it's almost like we're gonna be I don't know what happened yeah okay usually happen yeah okay so if they're here I'll pick them up when I come in and if they're not here I'll just make sure that everyone gets a copy okay if they want one um okay so agenda item number four inventory of Bellaire Beach logoed merchandise so there are two things that Nicole used to do besides take minutes and I'm not gonna just assume that Deb wants to do them but Nicole used to do the inventory for in the room and then post on next door neighbor and best of Bellar Beach for the beach cleanups will you do the industry okay are you sure okay great yeah as long as um Patty you just communicate with me and I'll do the postings okie dokie so Patty's going to do the inventory okay and then every once in a while like if we were like say they didn't sell like a beach towel for a while or say we got the hand towels back in stock Nicole would take a picture and post that too hey we have those in stock so if you're going to do the postings literally I started I've been posting for the last two months um but like I just went back and looked at hers and I changed the verbage a little bit but you can do what you want as long as the pertinent 19th Street at the time yeah yeah you just snap me a shot of what you've used in the past yeah and I'll go forward if you're doing the inventory and there's something new take a picture send it to me and I'll handle it from there you're a very good poster I am a good poster that I can do good yeah I know I was like I'm like inventory I can't okay and then with that being said um I know last month like we um we went through we did get the beach towels in or the hand towels in stock so those are on the updated sign for sale for ten dollars and um I don't know so we had like maybe four hats left but you said there's an order coming of a different color yeah khaki the Khaki ones okay and I think maybe more gray hats hats yeah they're nice and then um and then we're still looking into possible cups like this with the logo on it so that's up and coming maybe what about beach towels we have Beach shelves yeah okay yeah so we have license plates hats beach towels hand towels and we only have the last time I looked in there we only had three of those logoed fanny packs left which I announced at the city council meeting and we're not reordering those because when they put them in the machine because it's nylon it has the tendency to slip a little bit and it's very very difficult to get them smacked on Center and um so just for that reason alone that's why we're switching to something like the cups because they did sell but if you know we just had for the first time we had several issues and we're just not willing to chance it again so hopefully that's okay everybody discontinued those bags are they are cute if they were if it came out right they were super cute but like if they didn't you just want to take [Music] which there was no moving it so anyway does anybody have any questions about the inventory or no okay so we don't need emotion no no motion gotcha um update on welcome bags for new residents okay so we are Kyle did the list of people January through current and I came in earlier John helped me bring the boxes in because I had Stanley it was just fun because she was so excited and everywhere but so I put just the four bags together with we did add a license plate for now but those may not stay in there just due to inventory but we did put is that a frame damn it just a frame right yeah okay and then we did put a hand towel a logoed hand towel and we put um a kitchen towel which those are logoed life is better in Beller Beach but those are only for the welcome bags those aren't for sale so those are in there okay and you can count them in your inventory but we're not they're not listed or posted for sale okay only new residents get those oh that's a good one it is a good one so we could maybe rethink that I was gonna say why why are they just limited to new people why are you smiling this was probably I bought it for the bags but we could buy more if we think they're hot yeah I was kind of waiting to see if if they were liked yeah okay take my inventory which is about roughly all the items in the bags are about the same and if we sell too many of those and also know I'm just missing piece of our bags so right now my stove says Housewives of Calabasas so I don't think a life in Bel Air Beach is fabulous type in a towel would be a disappointment that would be nice I can switch out my California one I like it there you have it I agree so maybe we can order some because in a different color like keep the blue ones send me the link I guess it's still I guess I can check if it's still on no I could send it to you again we could order more um say keep the the Blue on Blue for the welcome bags and maybe do a different color white a white towel yeah something yeah keep it white and keep it white yes all right so anyway so those are moving along they're almost ready so all I um I just need to add like the different things that we got from merchants and then Kyle you're working on with maybe Patty and Lori the um in like what needs to go in from yeah I mean I was just gonna do what or listen list that we have and then like um I don't know we have something that maybe like our newsletter or something or what we put in a newsletter it talks about the beach passes or something like just a I'll throw something together quick you know what I thought we didn't I couldn't remember if we included on that list the form to sign up for the city newsletter because you know how you have to fill the form out like that might mean yeah right that's probably a good idea so you get it yeah they get the door hangers so that we can put them on the doors oh another door hanger yes isn't it just a handled bag yeah all I used to say is welcome to Bel Air Beach please go to City Hall to get your welcome bag that's what those door hangers need to say we need to order more then because I know we have what what other door hangers are you doing just for 15th 16th and 17th Street before that's not the thing that's like 20 to 60. you still probably have enough for a little bit but we should order more um yeah so you gotta you gotta really grab their attention with these they're gonna be like oh I want to go get that bag okay let's come get your free gifts at City Hall and then they'll be actually excited extra time okay did you hear that Aaron what was that please come pick up your your free gifts bag with all important what what do we have in here for uh picture we have anything in here uh vendors I mean local vendors yeah they have like how do we uh how do we do um Outreach to see if people want to participate I've been knocking on doors and just asked when you're there doing business so like I said that those can be always changing and those can be whatever we have we put in those don't have to be exactly the same like the city information or the gifts so like for vendors I want to say we have five or six that have given us enough to put in the bags right now so if you guys are out and about and you work with someone a lot and you think that they want to they would like to put something in the bag just ask them and bring it in and we'll include it it's it's not anything that has to be like set in stone and so it's not so it's not formal but is there like a time like what are your son you're going to do these like once a quarter prepared yeah I'd say once a month okay because I get the reports once a month so all you gotta do is who would they contact with the contact you or Kyle or four no or if you went to City Hall again a door hanger that says come and get your free gift um so like all okay should we do the health fair right we get all these people coming here because they want to interface with right so that's one way to do promotion so like if as opposed to doing that with other vendors just to throw that out there uh if you I'm sure public like to would have you know they already have Publix I I just an example yeah but so if they wanted to participate say like you like that furniture place okay or like the people up there at um Bel Air Market or the cafe or whatever hey you can do this and if you want to put something uh here a free breakfast or something like that just go down to City call Hall and contact who okay so the examples that you gave so Bellar Market Publix the furniture store um say just Gold's Gym for another example and clean eats those so those are the five that we have right now so if I are if I know them and I have their email which is pretty much all of them I emailed them and I said hey would you like to participate and you could give a coupon you could give a whatever you want to give and um just let me know and I'll come pick it up and so pretty much that's what I did I went and picked them up from every place except for clean eats dropped them off with Laura at City Hall so most of them I didn't talk to again it was done through email or text and I just have their contacts but like say the dry cleaner I didn't have his contact information I just verbally asked and so it doesn't have to be set in stone either so like if if you email someone or text someone or talk to someone and you can either pick it up from them or if they're driving by City Hall they can just come and give it to whoever is at the front desk and they'll give it to Kyle right and there's no you'll just go in the next deal that's all yeah we want to try to make sure it's actually worthwhile about it I don't want crappy ads crap your deals you know what I mean like we want to like how to be selective I mean that's no they have them did you hear that so it's like if they're just gonna give a business card we really don't I mean it's well it has to be something has to be an incentive to be yeah it should be in a setup it's got to be like mutually beneficial why why do I want to look at there's a jillion of stores or whatever it is like this I mean it would be like I mean it would be just kind of expected that you would do like uh if you want the people to come up here give them something yeah so they're all different publics put a very nice gift bag together and every person gets a shopping bag with Publix on and there's a bunch of stuff in there so they're actually getting a second bag and then clean eats literally put an example together dropped it off sent me an email saying is that okay is that good is that enough and I said yes and so she made more and she dropped them off Gold's Gym gave six months free membership to new Resident so which is substitutional yeah so it's just they're all different but like if they say oh what does it need to be worth we don't really have a dollar value assigned to it and even if someone just gave me a business card I didn't say oh well this isn't going in there I took it and said thank you and I'm let me figure out the window I didn't throw it out the window yeah so they kind of killed tubers of one stone with that um you know they have those coupon cards yeah you know I'm talking about you take it in 15 off um so it's obviously a form of advertising for them but it's also a benefit to those people that are going in there so I think they're very cheap to do I don't know how many people want to make but um I think it's a it's an easy way to track two um I did when I was a coach for the softball team so uh and we'd go out and you know sell those at least but here you know we could get those new residences they'll have them they're not going to get rid of those technically because it's worth money so to speak they're saving money with that it's going to be advertising for the businesses that are that want that promoting and it's a here you go thank you for coming in and getting your gift stop the welcome so I think I mean it'd be a little bit of money out of our pocket to do that but um I think that would be a better way of passing out business cards at least does that make sense I'm a little confused I don't know if I missed the first sentence like yeah so these cards are they're coupon cards right yeah they're not paper it's a little credit card okay um and it has a list of those people on Earth so say like oh participate so we would have to go out and try to ask people to give us a discount I'm not willing to do that I'm just being honest like I'll go in when I'm doing my thing or if I know them from well that's almost fair or whatever when I was because I don't want to do businesses I would I hated getting product I'd rather give a discount because I can mark up my phone and they're more than welcome to offer that on paper yeah we don't want to create more work though yeah yeah we're more like if they say well like what I can we can suggest that but like to go out and ask people hey will you give our new residents a discount well I just would rather leave it I think they have to take the initiative and they have to you know demonstrate that they're going to put it on the morning to take out initially but I'm just talking about for like uh you know like the little strip mall up Gulf Boulevard up there there's a bunch of there's a group of people up there you know that would like hey check us out you know it's all these different stores and they could say you know come and get a free drink at the deli up there or something the people up there just as an example you have a huge grouping at the Bel Air Market you've got that cafe and then you've got all those antique stores there's furniture stores and all this other stuff come up just to kind of let people know that they're there because it's close it's a real you know they're both easy places to get to obviously it down this is a little bit less organized down uh Gulf Boulevard down down Indian Rocks but obviously Publix is the big anchor so I mean once you're up there but there's some vendors up there that hey just come out here check us out and you know come in and get a free whatever bag of dog biscuits or something from these guys like this that's that's what I was uh that's what I was thinking about and yeah they've got a uh there's a person up there that is sort of the the queen bee if you will and I pray I worked through her Coastal furniture that not I would go up there and do it okay I would do the same thing up here and say who is sort of the person that organizes this thing would you be interested in doing maybe if they can't get their stuff together I don't know not my problem well there's one guy that owns like six storefronts up there if you can get a hold of him like that would be great but yeah anything like that like this is like I said it's not set in stone it's whatever each of us want to do and if we each bring certain things to the table that's you know they give us 10 they'll go in the bags for the next 10 residents so it's it's whatever we want to make it whatever you guys want you know to do it's all good um yeah if it falls off it's no you know fine it's done going there it's like I'm not gonna yeah it's not gonna flog people to promote their business but yeah we've got this thing yeah we'd like to make it values well so if we kind of get the flywheels spinning on it and it works if it doesn't yeah yeah well at some point though like you know we need say we're only putting so many businesses in everybody that dilutes it so like you know maybe we cap it at 10. 10 businesses or 10 10 businesses because somebody's like little strip malls they might have you know 15 businesses right up there at that little strip if you want to just promote the strip mall well if it literally says you get a discounted everything in the Sand Key strip mall and you or you get say six of them on and like so that's only on one card like say for his example then that would count as one if we get individual things from every single store in there then they count as the 10 so there could be if they all want to like promote their individual businesses then it would be one two three four five because the world to her Point get diluted that's that idea is telling you about that's kind of kills instead of doing a bunch of different pieces we used to use those for baseball yeah no that's a great idea I do want to say one thing last week we discussed this and um pretty much I thought every person agreed if we're in an area and if it's a store we frequent we would go ahead and hit them up we did and I haven't done that yet so but it's coming yeah and that's fine yeah so when people say so it's a it's a Max of 10 say but it's there's no minimum so if we only have three in-house then that they get three yeah so like right now I want to say we have five or six in-house so that's what I'm gonna put on the current welcome bags and it's fluid so there's no pressure on this it's not meant to be like a work or a stress thing sure if you're out and about and you know someone you do a lot of business with them and you ask Bingo it's great so don't you don't it's nothing pressure wise well nothing just like go say look at we have this welcome bag you want to pull together something here that you know might have people come in people are doing discounts only 10 pieces of mail are going in there if you want to do it put it together bring it down to City Hall here we'll look at it if we've got 20 of them these guys say I can't decide to bring them there we'll look through the stuff and we'll say take 20 minutes and say pick these 10. done and then the other thing is is um kind of it goes without saying we wouldn't put two dry cleaners in there at the same time we wouldn't put it through huh rotary rotary can't have two accounts and rotary only one club just kidding there you go so anyway is everybody good on that yeah pretty clear clear okay um agenda item number six um each cleanup was good we had nine people considering it was red tide and disgusting out I was happy we had anybody um so I got Atlas yeah it was a very interesting day it was for you why it's a long story I'll tell you later but yeah it was a very interesting day it was the first time that we did the no Donuts we did the granola bars and protein bars what happened uh what somebody should go okay what yeah she just got monopolized and didn't make it out to the beach the entire hour I got told the business wouldn't leave her alone and I'm very empathetic as you know and a very good listener do you say you stay there when we leave do you stay no I typically stay like 10 minutes to catch the late people and then I go out to the beach I walk down to pick up garbage I walk down to Morgan Park then I come back maybe like I'll speed back so I can set everything up but no I never stay there the whole time that's the first time I've ever done that and she was very apologetic um so question how did the granola and healthy snacks go over as opposed to the cupcakes well I don't know what does your wife think we don't need to we don't know if you don't eat those things you gotta understand Tammy those things that's like that is like getting yogurt okay it's the most unhealthy stuff you can possibly eat if you're gonna eat garbage it might as well and then I want to say it was about a 50 50 on the donuts versus granola bars and to be perfectly honest I agree with you John I would if I'm gonna cheat I'm gonna eat a donut I am not going to eat one of those bars where you might they have as much sugar but I would like to say that when I said protein bars I did not place the order uh-uh that's why what they're not healthy protein bars yeah you didn't order healthy snacks you sent it a link Kyle she's freaking throwing you under the bus I know what I'm joking samples but they're not healthy you said you set the lids they were a bad examples okay I did do that I will but you know why because they don't have like they don't have Quest they only have Kirkland brand the Kirkland brands are very good though they are good and I'll eat them but for some reason I didn't want to pass them out you have to change the website the website says see the one who said your wife would appreciate no Donuts yes every month because she she gets yeah don't you give me like you find too many of course you know how many people are going to show up well that's the whole thing we order the same amount if we have more people we get down at holes I know but right now we're sitting on a lot of protein bursts because Kyle needed free shipping they can't sit out in your garage I have a shelf life of 12 Years yeah that's that's not good food for the hurricane put them in the hurricane boxes that's exactly what I was gonna say welcome back there you go you guys are out of control so other than that how many bags did you get of cleanup oh well you know like there was at least a bag per person so I didn't I do nine bags and and only like this mother daughter and I we picked up fish which we shouldn't talked about we did and other people picked up trash we shouldn't have picked up fish should we you're not supposed to put the fish in the garbage can so I was told no no no no no no I don't do that because they stinks no don't pick up fish don't put them in a garbage can that you'll ruin it you can ruin I mean it stinks for a long ways somebody did that at Sixth Street beach we could smell it where we live you know 100 yards away much less people are honored never do that you'll never get the shake out of the garden the bags were outside the garbage cans they weren't inside hey Kyle what do you think because honestly like the donuts and there's a few people that literally didn't come this last month but like they come for the donuts so what why don't like I take the granola bars for the people that don't want the donuts yeah and then one box maybe one box of donuts is that okay yeah I was I thought people would be happy no no no it was my idea because people were like I don't want donuts but it was only like again I think it's 50 50. so I think they'll get eaten I think that um just a few people are missing the donuts I like the donuts they just had a different feel than these things feel felt like uh you know we're doing it but the donuts were like you know this is once a month that's the only time I ate Donuts I'm making a move that we have Donuts at the next cleanup can I have a second second all in favor and we don't have to change the website this is a very important city hey we have a new plan okay um number seven okay did everybody have an opportunity to look at the list of parks that was sent out to you after our last meeting yes I did but I didn't get one that Big Lots I didn't print it large on purpose um should I go make copies of this so we can pick or no that'd be nice well I have to yeah everything we gave you um there's County Pond across the street is that what Aaron provided yes okay impaired there I just said I don't think I had something like that did I I just printed it as it came it must have just printed okay guys [Applause] say what are we all from the south part of town you guys I am so so you're North Side okay because you said we should pick something on the other side of town pick something you don't know like I've been to all of them because I've done it so many times but yeah I would like for you guys to pick parks that you don't know and then um I'll ask Kyle I mean you don't really need it yeah but like we were given these nice little yeah there's a format temporary yeah to put in your windshield so we're very on very official business all right I like that a lot to it huh or you could ride okay all right temporary for my bike I've done all of it I've ridden my bike I've driven it just all depends on how much time I have yeah yeah so it's just like when we each get one of these that's what I last um Aaron can you make it I'm gonna punch holes in mine because I'm going to use my bicycle or I'm going to carry around my neck let me take a picture of that real quick hold it up a little higher hold it up hold it like a mug shot yeah so he can see it I I will go where everybody else doesn't want to go I don't care I'm good I have not sir is your original thank you where's your city cops um we got to include Connie's mom because I didn't I'll just turn it over okay okay all right um Patty will you take South Park because you're the only one that's not from that side sure on Second Street sure and then we're South Park I mean you you're at the welcome to Indian Rocks Beach sign so it's like you turned out and go down golf turn on First Street and go right and then Second Street you go left okay oh are you turned on Second Street so which other one do you want Patty or which one haven't you been to um I actually prefer to do the closer ones but you don't want that well I want the orange juice where well I know where hibiscus is oh I know which one that one is I've walked past that one I don't care anymore okay Deb do you have choices yeah you want to stay in your side because nobody she wants us to do different ones so um City Hall about um she's doing first and second I can probably do 7th and 16th I'm May the 20th am I doing second also yes Patty a second okay you said 7th 16th and what twenty that's Doug seventh mm-hmm and 16. you where's Crosman and 20th is you well we have 11 left and there's only two of us left so we gotta okay like right at golf it's really it's just you know the little sign that says then I'll do 25th as well Patty you're going to take another place that is going to take at least well I can easily do 20th she's got 20th and I can do hibiscus park at hibiscus Park East sure and then what about Morgan Park or the marina sure I mean tell me I don't care John Deere preferences I don't I mean I'll uh I'll take whatever's left over I'm gonna walk them that's what I'm gonna do for the next three Saturdays that sounds like a good plan Saturday over Saturday morning program so whatever's left is what I'll do thank um but I do what I want at least five properties so take them I'll take the I'll take the easements I think all the way from North to South where are those oh these are three basements and I'll take the beach accesses okay all right where are those and uh and I'll take the city hall grounds because I got some ideas or somebody else overtake that no huh or with the easements okay I got these ones I got the accesses and I got City Hall grounds okay how do you want Morgan Park I was gonna say fell out but more yeah Morgan's fine I don't I didn't write it yet so yeah Morgan's fine all right I already did so okay so Patty do you also still have hibiscus then yeah so South Streets I'm gonna take well I only have you down for four wait Bayside Park is City Hall grounds isn't it no do you have yourself down for Belle Isle or did you change your mind I don't have well I'm in this one every day so that's why I didn't want me to take it okay you know what I mean just okay is Bayside Park taken no I'll take Bayside Park and I'll take the city hall grounds okay you have a lot John and yeah I'll take the marina and on the back page there is on the back page there's County pond so I'll take that too I don't see that yeah because she had a double-sided paper just right in here and that's Tammy right so are you doing Morgan did you yes I have Morgan oh and I have Crosman Park in first and second okay if you guys can just read through your list and she can look through in the minute so for South Park is Patty Second Street is Patty 7th Street 16th 20th and 25th is Deb Bayside Park is John Bell Isle Tammy City grounds John Crosman Park Tammy hibiscus Park East Patty Morgan Park Patty Marina Tammy easements John Beach accesses John and County County pounds 12th Street tammys County upon who 12th Street okay yeah Tammy everybody good with that total sure perfect okay is there a format for doing these evaluations so the format is General observations safety hazards and general upkeep so like like just say if you're looking at it and basic maintenance isn't being done like there's palm fronds everywhere it's not mode the garbage you know just things that are supposed to be done I don't you know that's a good question like what's the rotation time frame because I know we've had some like ish you know like just Manpower things so we're fully set now okay I'm so we're getting caught back up so we're doing tree trimming uh that's going to restart tomorrow or maybe the next city because we're taking care of some of the odds and ends but it's going to get back on regular schedule so um but yeah we are about a month back so okay plus the red tide yeah exactly right oh no and I knew that so like when we're doing these we're going to kill oh you know but like like what if they try to mow each Park like once a week every 10 days yeah growing season once a week but you can get away with longer during when it was cool but we're starting to pick up everything yeah it's a couple weeks from now if you can just let them kind of catch up with their handwork okay yeah so about when should we start April 1st or whenever you want I mean you don't have to report back until the next meeting I will be perfectly honest and say I do mine two days before the next meeting because just whatever procrastination or I put it off or whatever the reason I just usually don't do it until closer to the time that it's due and like what we have done in the past which kind of seemed to be helpful especially for the city is if you take your phone and you bring pictures um we can print them out here and then everybody can have a packet but like only take pictures of the things that are safety issues like we don't need you know a 35 picture packet of every single part because like then you look at it and you're like so but if you see something that's like a metal Spike sticking out of the ground that or like a lot of times you see those covers for the utilities and they're supposed to be firmly in and they're literally like this with a big hole in the ground that's an immediate call to Aaron or Kyle and I've done that several times for you know where like it didn't get put in right or someone stepped on it and it went and like all it takes is someone stepping on it in the dark and someone's broken their leg so like the safety issues but if it's something like you know that can't be handled that day or the next day like you can that's what you take a picture of like the sea wall is crumbling there's a big crack in it or like say there's I don't know um like for the marina or no like for Morgan Park like you know the parking lot was terrible so I took lots of pictures of the parking lot the last time we did this and then I took pictures of the bathroom because there were tons of paint missing and like different things like that so it's like I took pictures of that stuff because it's kind of an easy fix and it would look super nice if like it obviously the parking lot's been redone and I think the paint was redone too yeah so um like stuff like that so it's just it's not again set in stone use your best judgment but we don't need you know you to take a hundred pictures and bring 100 pictures and us make copies of everybody for that because this is the thing so safety is number one but as far as having pictures of these Parks I mean there's there's an archive of what they look like and I barely I mean you know if I look at 100 pictures like this I don't even know where this is one one General overall picture like that we should have an inventory of you know the city should have an inventory of you know this is a picture of this thing here this is what's here if somebody was interested for a realtor or something like that yeah that's hibiscus or um Bell Isle that's Belle Isle okay um so some of them I do recognize I can't say that but if I just get a picture of grass I might not know it um so this one says beautiful landscaping I you know I don't it's nice I mean we can bring fluff pictures if we want but just bring like one fluff picture one picture every year I can't hear it I might have missed that I'm just saying use your best discretion it's not set in stone but like safety issues that can be immediately fixed call Kyle or Aaron all right um but if it's just something like paint or something that's maintenance but it doesn't even be done right away that's what you report on and then Kyle will put we've been using this corrective action list so he pictures help though like if you want to email me pictures just go with pictures I do appreciate pictures because sometimes but more of a description yeah I mean one picture you do the mowing take the picture I guess I'll Envision is you're probably walking around and take one picture see like there's this like a metal Spike sticking up that someone hit with the mower and you know so like that needs to be yeah that should be safe yeah oh yeah what what is like here's one like if someone's gonna fall in a hole Yeah so mostly take pictures of the safety here's a picture kind of like really upset right on South Park Bench it looks like a snake skin is that recording yeah okay I guarantee that's youngsters okay all right oh I thought you might like that I'm like too much so like it's ridiculous it's indicative of activity that uh like the dangerous wild animal well maybe maybe not anyway what is the rotation here in other words how many times a year do we do this like twice twice you can do it every month if you want to but no I don't want it officially it's twice I I wouldn't mind picking up the the easement uh once a month but and we've never done the easement before that was just added listen John if you want to walk that easement every month do it Kyle will be happy to know I I don't know I mean like I should so I'm going to be gone for the summer that's why I want to get on so if I do this now in April okay and I come back I have it ready for the meeting in April then if I come back at you know in September whatever just like that so if I do not so if we do it on a six month rotation like that I can do that yeah we do it when you're here sure I mean so that's that's a that's enough that's frequently enough it also hasn't been set like where we do it like once in for the April meeting and once for the September meeting it hasn't been set it's kind of like based on time frame and what we're doing but we can do that like every April and every September just because we don't have events either a month well that's right so because it's out of our main event season so if we try to do it for you know March April and September October something like that and we try to so we'd have a meet we'd have a report we'd have a summary at the end of April and a sun summary at the end of October and then you've been going to the city council or something or one of us wouldn't sail here we did all this stuff and here's what we found out about our reports about our Parks I don't know like we usually just give it to Kyle I don't know if Kyle is even really brought it up as in your in your quarterly reports yeah quarterly yeah that's right yeah all right so what's covered it's covered yeah well we're doing a we're doing a kind of a it's a it's kind of an audit activity just to make sure that everything's getting done and it's part of our responsibility for what we're doing here I guess as I see it for sure all right okay is everybody good with that I get it General observations upkeep and safety yes yes there are primary objectives and like say for example I know like um if you might want to make notes of like it has one bench or two benches like the amenities because it's like we Kyle and I were just talking about this recently as far as like the like everything doesn't have to be even Steven but like one Park shouldn't have six benches unless they were donated by the person that lives next door and it's a memorial bench if that's the case then there could be a hundred not but you know what I'm saying like there can be more benches but like you know where it shouldn't be where one park is beautiful and has six benches and another Park the grass is dead and it doesn't have a bench and the fences are falling in like we wanna like the end goal of this is one for our parks to be safe for them to look nice and for them to be aesthetically pleasing not a hundred percent equally but at least at some point they all have some really good qualities that people are like this is a really nice park that I live next to as opposed to oh my gosh like all these other Parks look so good this mine looks terrible so well good along with those with those observations if I'm not mistaken I've seen that inventory this somewhere in the uh on a website or something this park has a fishing a dock it has a bench uh this one has a fishing dock and a ramp this one that's where is that um that's like we do it on the website We Do It um as a total summary type deal like some of that information in our budget um but uh could we that does change it does well could we have a printed out you know what is the current could we you know like I'm saying yeah we go there that's what we should expect to see there's a bench here is this what he's referring to well that's our last that's our last action lesson okay so that was what we were addressing he's referring to what's on the website that will tell residents if you're looking for a fishing pier go to second store if you're looking for a kayak launch or a boat launch go to 7th Street if you're looking for a here's a good thing this website is not easy to figure out because I know yeah and I've been here three years now so list of Park amenities Park amenities right list of Park America combine that inventory tell the people how to get to it and then I would want to go out there and say I'm just what I expect to see when I get out to this place and right I'm going out here this is what the city says we have here I go out here and I say this is what it looks like in terms of the suitability for the purposes for which it was intended I think which is what we're trying to get at here yeah your point regarding yeah if we have one bench here and we have two or three benches here I guess I don't and you know I would look at one thing I have talked to people they're not real excited about promoting these parts because the people live next to them everybody likes quiet I've figured that out everybody likes quiet so nobody's looking to have people flocked in these places or have events or anything like that but little amenities that could be added could make them more useful but I wouldn't put that in the public record I wait for a citizen to come up with that I want we want to be clean safe suitable for the purposes for which they're intended go out there and take a nice look at the bay and consider as long as you like and there's a garbage can and there's a safe sidewalk to get out there perfect yeah so is this with you that's what I was thinking after we do this yes okay East Park and we come up with something a plan if you think there needs to be an adjustment then you guys can recommend that and yeah and I doubt that I think I've been to all these places and every one of them seems to be like yeah this does the trick I mean it's like you can sit out here look over the bay or something like that I can walk on easement over here it's nice and quiet you can see nobody ever comes down here sit on the bench for two minutes and get up and say I'm bored to go do something else no but you could do it that's how it works well okay once I sat for five minutes okay but it was there and it's nice to have it everybody doesn't live on the water so there's a nice and these are very nice things these are this is really top shelf stuff this is rare this area is rare it's golden it's golden just like that 2011 rocks right now and that sag Bel Air is this is an old memorial look the more you like this place Amen to that amen so that is right right down to the 2011 grandfathering on those so we want to tout this stuff for people to come here but we don't want to you know and say it's available I don't want to say gold but we want you to know that it's here especially a realtor should say do you know about Bel Air Beach give I had I personally I had no idea yeah I'll take our copy for Anthony there you go yeah no idea so yeah me neither sure I certainly didn't know you had that many parks here it yeah it took me a few years Clark's raised property value sure yeah so I don't I don't know why we we should discreetly promote it and say it's here did you know okay but it's not like hey go down we don't want to have events to attract people but people should know you take a walk you have a destination if you walk when's the last time you know you want to take a walk to some particular place take a walk up here and take a look at the view from the 16th Street uh Park sit there and go back with your dog it gives you all these different little walks you can do all right no it's good does anybody have anything else nope we're good on number seven okay number eight is other business and like there was a couple of things from the last meeting that I know like I don't there's no time frame like there wasn't a due date of today but I think you were gonna maybe research yeah nobody has responded well positive Zumba or what to do no karate karate okay I'll keep looking at places but yeah like I said it's not searchable we did add another yoga day so Tara's here now on Tuesdays as you go and we go no no okay but she will yeah yeah um I do have something to mention about that though um so I do go to Weight Watchers on Tuesday and we were informed today that they're coming out of retail stores now and they're looking for a new home for their daily and sometimes evening meetings so I suggested they reach out to you guys it would be consistent like it's great to do it in City Hall and it would be consistent every Tuesday at this time and every so I did ask them to reach out to you whether they do or not I don't know but you know that's something to think about down the line yeah so do you say it like the it's because I'm assuming it's they're gonna have to like not they have to run into it of course they're going to have to run to wherever they go they're looking at churches the Elks Club so I'm like hey just do it right here a great place to do Weight Watchers they set up the easel that's what I told them I said they'll do the chairs for you they'll do everything so um that happened this morning I'll push it a little more I thought it would be I study income on if you could work with them on the dates or whatever another two quick little mention um we had to call the cops the other night it was two Saturday nights ago we had um some kid come up we didn't know who it was and very very aggressively with their flashlights shining at my at the camera pound on my glass doors downstairs or upstairs which nobody and nobody goes upstairs to my house because it's so high they no it's just like a weird entrance so I have a downstairs door but they came upstairs we were eating dinner it was eight o'clock at night pounding my mama's with me scared to death so we called the cops and they never came and they were all on the park they were all in the park next to Patty's house they probably did a drive-by because then were unable to locate unless they're asked to make contact they won't I mean we hold immediately uh yeah but then they transferred us to whatever like you know non-emergency what they'll do is you'll come down and let them transfer you to the the dispatchers that are in charge of that area that's how that works at the end uh so see if it's a noise complaint or suspicious circumstances call the officer will hold out their based off elicit hey so nothing newer announce anybody they'll check the area if they find something they'll make contact they don't they'll they'll just or they'll disposition it out yeah you know we had video and everything and the kids were still in the area it was just like he almost put his fist through my glass door I was always on someone to request contacts suspicious activity oh yeah there you know what it was probably a dare go up there yeah a dare a dare yeah like I dare you to go up and knock on that person's door but they knew enough to flash their camera right at my camera you know the light so I don't know always request contact afterwards on something like that okay from the officer sorry I didn't mean to take up extra business with that well I think that but I think that's relevant I mean I mean we're talking about quality of life that's what we're primarily concerned with here we so on something like that if you have something you should call 9-1-1 and request that they come and check it out so I mean I'm a retired police officer so I'd always tell people if it's something that alerts you it's an emergency you know they always differentiate between non-emergency emergency so that's an emergency that it still so yeah honestly the biggest issue I saw with it was my husband was ready to get his gun out yeah and that's right that you know what no it's not funny because it's a kid right of course you know and the first words out of my husband's mouth is I'm gonna get the gun yeah and you know I would uh if I were you that's how aggressive it was if you recall about the time frame let it happen that call yeah you can call in and request even today request uh like contact with an officer okay I just like to check up on this call that I made this time and they'll be able to look at what's called cat notes and tell you exactly what happened I just never expected the cops to not show we like shot there and waited all night and then yeah and if they didn't show up they said that there it didn't show and he knows to do with that I'd request to speak to a supervisor okay okay thank you love slime yeah okay business um I would like to request that the garage sales not be on the same day as cleanup this is the third time they have nothing to do with garage sales and our cleanup has been consistent so maybe garage sales could change yeah because they're just twice a year right freak out about everybody the second Saturday you don't even charge your garage sale one committee's in charge you never know yeah okay and I just remember because I can't be in two places at once and my husband's not a garage sale person he just give everything away why why would something like the garage sale which is kind of like an activity why was gonna ask me something not that I'm looking for more work okay but in terms of coordinating activities right right right why wouldn't that be part of like Parks and Rec I mean who traditions under volunteer business it's volunteered I mean it's all residents to call us in and register so that we know that they're having them and then we just put some signs out that point their direction oh that's nice yeah sure this isn't that this isn't a city is this city wide or yes what was your comment so like right now we have on reader board so in other words to avoid having everybody do one every weekend what do we do we say we do we hold garage sale on a particular date I don't understand every time yeah so you can right you could you could do your own garage sale at any time just gonna notify us okay garage sale but we have like the plan garage sales to try and attract people so if everybody does on the same day then people are like oh crush it was all over the area yeah they just go from house to house yeah that's kind of a good idea to have them all at the same time there's no places do it for Saturday but it's too late to change this one right but for the future date to be changed so that means you would probably have to do it on a Sunday instead maybe everybody go to church outside don't change and then when is um the bridge cleanup again is it every quarter yeah third Saturday third Saturday perfect yeah the bridge cleanup is April um April 15th and then the um Earth days the sunset social is the April 22nd you know everything was wow I guess it's going to change because if it was this April would be the Saturday before Easter right yeah our video I mean we could I don't know we did it in May I think last year but they might have it's not six months spread because we've always done in November and then six months would be may but maybe it was too hot I don't know that they pushed it back to April but I mean we can we can always adjust it if you want to talk about it yeah we'll talk about it another time because there's no real reason why it has to be on okay it's a good point Patty I think yeah I do too because my commitment is to the cleanup well there ought to be so if there's going to be uh you know city-wide kind of things there ought to be like there ought to be some place you can go to coordinate to make sure that we don't have conflicts like this there's no no reason to all it does is reduces participation on both sides so there ought to be some like Clearinghouse oh they're really a City calendar but then it required too much planning no that's fine I mean we don't have this many events yeah okay I mean in all honesty the government's been kind of you know not really set for the last couple of years anyway so now that you both are in control and you're really running everything I I see that you can start narrowing it down to the areas that were not going well so anyway right so I will figure it out and then so just because of the Easter holiday well this we'll just look at it because I mean it's a couple months out you know we can always decide before it puts his posts open so we'll bring it up next year but we'll play on the second Saturday of November okay that sounds good thanks yeah okay does anybody have any other business I had one quick item uh a dog walker that I talked to um brought up a question regarding dog parks okay is is it ever been discussed setting aside a space for a small dog park okay like an actual weird occasion area yeah a Cajun area yeah I I don't know the history I'd have that patio probably my best resource at this point you say what Patty I think would be my best resource I don't know the history if they've ever considered it I know they went around probably in early 2000s and get all the dog bag stations started providing dog bags but I don't know if it was ever talked about it's a minutes thing where she would know maybe offhand patty patty yeah but um I just wanted I don't want if it's already been hashed out it has yeah well I just know when I first moved here there used to be a dog park under the bridge and then they started saying no dogs and then every once while you'll see a dog under there but I don't think that's our part It's not I mean over off the bridge yeah that's County property yeah so I mean as far as in Bellaire Beach it's never I I could be an amenity if it's not something that's unpopular and cost a lot of money it doesn't doesn't have to be real big yeah my whole thing is like I know 99.9 of the time they're totally fine but like what just happened in Indian Rocks Beach like two months ago like if that ever happened here it would be the end all I mean what happened um somebody brought they newly adopted a Husky and they took it to the dog park and they let it all go and it got a hold of the small dog and killed it and then the owner took the dog the Husky put in his car and ran so it took them so the dog died the lady is posting on next door neighbors going you know my dog was killed today can you imagine if that happened to Stanley you guys somebody would be weird fail like that I mean if someone killed my dog in a dog park so it's like to me people bring their dogs and they let them go not everybody these are but they they got a lot more transient honor this is why I'm getting the questions but how do we keep people out like if there's a dog park controlled access and you have to be you have to have a uh you have to pay all right so you have to pay to get a card to go in there and I realize the song is complicated but yeah no I get it only for Bel-Air residents I mean you could always put a gate like lock on it or something that gives you a swipe of code to get in but quite honestly I don't I don't I'm not in favor of it because I don't even like the fences that they put up around it and I don't know I get I get like people like them and it's a way to because even like it's not our Park it's IRB Park it's Brown Park like kitty corner from us and it's a nice big fenced-in Park and people are constantly going over there letting their dogs off the leash they're sitting there on their phone their dog takes a huge dump they're not looking and they don't see it and then you have these little kids walking around with a piles and it's like so for a hot minute they said absolutely no dogs in this park even on a leash no dogs because people just are irresponsible well don't know is it that those people live across from you with that that they have the the six foot privacy fence that borders the uh North End of uh Brown Park if they leave that gate open I got a couple of big pit bulls oh they moved huh they moved they moved well believe me the house is emptier scare the hell out of me yeah one day they're babies those little dogs are babies but yeah we had a tough time handling I can tell you that because they're big dogs they were big dogs yeah Daphne and we are showing other words so in other words well I don't I don't I don't know I just I it is not a big deal my dog doesn't Chase balls or anything like that but the other one did did and I would have been one of the but I'm not somebody left my dog just take a dump anywhere but I know you're a responsible dog parent but there are so many ears responsible dog parents out there I mean I saw this lady do it and she didn't even have a dog back she was thinking it is called Brown Park like it was funny I was like that's so funny name and address please I'm like but it's not it's not Bellar Beach so I just you know but I've literally watched someone do that like they're like we couldn't take our old dog down there anymore you can't I mean yeah and like I've I don't know so that scent right like I know you know your life and fear and lots of people love dog parks and if they don't have a backyard or a fence or whatever you want your dog to get exercise I get that but like I don't know Kyle it's up to you I was just giving my opinion because that's so important to be a council on the top of the neighbors of which Park you choose why would I I would I I yeah in my mic again I'm not even going to use it because we just our little dog he's like I mean hell I gotta I got a dog run around my backyard I don't need you I don't even need it yeah I just it wouldn't be no one would I mean if we said we're gonna put a dog park at 2nd Street traffic it would have to be by the marina well there is no traffic that's what I was going to say there's no part it has to be here Kyle it'd have to be here at City Hall that's what I said that's why I put it I'd put it a little house in the park the house okay okay one word okay so we'll talk about it later but um one more agenda item next month's meeting date so we're good with the Tuesday or Thursday correct yep so April how about April 18th or 20th April um 20th would be better for me huh I prefer the Thursday okay are you good with Thursday is fine not usually but no are you Tuesday better for you normally it is um you should have a regular time Susan Mr parts and I have guests here this week let me see when she's coming what time did you say the meeting is it's always at
