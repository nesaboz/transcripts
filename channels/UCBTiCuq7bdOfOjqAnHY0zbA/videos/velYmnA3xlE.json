member mark beam here council member dave gavis here council member jody shirley here council member rita schwab here vice mayor glenn gunn here mayor joseph manzo here city manager lynn reeves here city attorney fred riley here okay thank you everyone first item of business to approve our agenda i'll entertain a motion shall move marv beams making the motion second is by jody shirley's second do we have any discussion on the agenda uh yes i need to amend uh an item into the consent agenda uh the communication uh committee presentation was uh left off that be the uh what was sent to us today dave uh that's part of it but uh the the report is normally read okay so you're just putting that report that was given to us and then patty could you make patio make that public uh i i don't think anything was mailed out other than uh there were let's see there was a draft postcard and uh a list of priorities but as far as the actual report from the meeting uh that is not the report but you don't want it under the consent agenda you want it on the regular agenda then i'm sorry yes regular agenda okay how about i put it in under number 12b would that work that will work okay um i'll need a motion on that dave you're making the motion we have a second i don't know if i heard a second second ago okay jody's seconding it um i'll say discussion on well discussion on that first let's clear that one item to at least get it on the agenda before we vote on it does anybody have any comments on that too so we're adding the as item 12b the communications committee report that'll be presented i hear no objections um so is there uh so let's take that to a vote this is just to add it to the agenda that we haven't approved yet so um we can uh we'll just take uh patty we have to do that by individual correct can patty hear me i'm sorry i had to unmute myself yes let's do that okay so if you'll just run through the role real quickly on that before i do that is there any public comment on that uh hold on i i have to switch over to um public okay uh no raised hands okay okay good if you'll just call it then so the question on this is this is just to amend the agenda adding as item 12b the committee report for the communications council member aki yes council member bean aye councilmember gattis aye council member shirley aye councilmember swope aye vice mayor gunn yes that's an i so seven to zero that's on for the um for the agenda to be voted upon do we have any other changes on the agenda before we call that question so now we're voting on the amended agenda it's what was presented by patty the 17 items in addition to item now 12b which we have uh added to that so vote in favor of this approves that agenda before i do it is there any public comment let me check no sir okay thank you um so this is to approve our agenda as amended patty if you would council member aski aye council member beam aye council member gattus aye councilmember shirley aye councilmember swope aye vice mayor gunn aye mayor manzo all right so the agenda's approved seven to zero next we go to citizens comments i'm not sure who's out there so if the count council knows this already but if they'll just bear with me normally when we're in session we have around the room some codes of conduct uh which has been approved for how we wish to be um to run the meetings so essentially in a nutshell without reading you all 20 items basically if you come up to address us please give us your name your address uh speak to the council as a whole if you ask us questions we will not be able to respond to you it's actually against our rules so later on in the presentation uh when it comes to council comments we may choose to respond to that that goes for the city manager too sometimes you have a factual question he's not going to be able to respond to you so we're not trying to be nasty by saying thank you we're just saying thank you and we will try and get to it later on these comments that we have here or for any item that is not on the agenda if something is on the agenda you will be given ample time three minutes to speak on that at the um at the time when we hit that item so this is just for something that's not on the agenda that's within our control okay so with that um i will turn it over to patty if there's anyone in this public i would like to speak please have them come up three minutes and we'll be listening there are no raised hands on the attendees okay thank you so then i'm going to close public comments and uh do we have the sheriff present today patty uh i believe they were just here talking to lynn mayer they're not here they furnish the report and the deputy that came in did not have a copy of the report but uh i think what i'll do in the future if we're going to still have more of these will get captain liner or somebody to dial in but there you know the the report speaks for itself uh we only had one larceny in uh june and uh they had uh a lot of house checks we had four crashes uh total in the month of june and 61 citations and warnings were issued by the sheriff and if anyone has any questions i'll be glad to send those to the sheriff and get you an answer lindy oh jody shirley go ahead yeah i don't have a question just a statement and lynn is that is we do need to have um liner someone on these calls you know i kind of was on that bella shores call and i was taken back that liner was on their call and you know participating quite a bit in the meeting it would be nice to have that same participation in our meeting from him okay we've had several questions for him in the past and haven't been able to answer ask him so i'll pass that on to him i'm in a second what jody said in fact i've been to two of the meetings across the street captain leinard not only sits through the um the police portion the sheriff's portion he's just through the whole meeting um in case there's anything that comes up so i think i'd like that same courtesy back that would be fantastic um the only other thing is i did ask last month that the data for the um for the uh beller shore for what's happening in the beach accesses the policing they're providing that across the street and i ask that we get a copy supplemented to our report and the deputy uh and he's higher than a deputy who's probably a sergeant but um he said that he was going to work on that but i didn't see it here so i would still like that information i really don't want to have to do public records requests so i think they could just let us know because that affects both of us and that's why i'm asking okay i'll pass that on to him also and also pass on another good month another good job i mean one larceny is not a real big big thing it's it is if you're the person whose thing was stolen but overall very very good uh good work dave davis yes uh i was just wondering if uh the sheriff is being emailed the um the goat the zoom meeting information or is it up to them to go to the website and download it we will make sure in the future that it's emailed i'll have patty do that as a panelist and then they can assign who typically captain liner's not here but i didn't know notice the last two months he's been on uh bellar shores okay uh worst case scenario i would say just provide them with a telephone and let them dial right in okay any other comments on the sheriff's report uh any public comments patty no sir okay thank you council if there's nothing else then i'm going to accept the report and we'll close it anything else okay and again lin if you'll convey uh the information we'd appreciate that move on to item four this is a mouthful here is a public hearing this is for the uh charter the the charter amendments here i'm going to read the whole thing then i'll open it up to the council and then the city for comments uh and this will be the second reading so here we go it's a long one consideration

the alternate so i'll be supporting her that's that's i think you know i i believe in bringing the alternate folks up if we can possibly do that and it would make sense anyone else is um is ms bizio here um i don't see her by name there's a couple of phone numbers but so i i don't think so let me open it up to public comment first but if miss bizio is there i'd like her to be first to speak in

passes seven to zero tammy lavender is now on the parks and recreation board congratulations and thank you from all of us for your interest in the community appreciate it so we move on to item number 11. this is consideration of resolution 2020-12 a resolution of the city council of beller beach florida approving the fiscal year 2020-21 non-ad valorem assessment role for the bellevue islands estate island assessment area directing certification of the assessment role to the pinellas county tax collector and providing an effective date the description on this is it's the certification of the assessment role to the pcpao the item was placed on the uh on the agenda by the city manager and i want to get a motion first and then maybe we can defer it over to him for explanation but i certainly the person who makes the motion speaks first if they wish so with that do i have a motion and second morphe dave i'll go to you first i'd like to yield to the city manager mr reeves it's mayor and console this uh is an annual uh certification that we have to send to uh the property appraiser uh tax collector uh certifying that these are the assessments for the coming year we did the preliminary assessment to them uh in june and the final one is done in september of this year uh the current assessments are going to remain the same when the project is closed out which will be it probably by the end of this year then we will be adjusting the assessments in the next fiscal year for and and there'll be some refunds given and but this is just normal business for the assessment role city manager you expect that the cost i mean i know you've had cost savings so far on this you expect that that's going to hold through this year we shouldn't have anything that's going to affect that right right there's no increase but what i see this will we've got one more piece of the project to finish that's the section between bayshore and gulf boulevard on 22nd street once that is finished we'll close out the project and any remaining funds will be adjusted will be either paid back to the people that paid in full or paid to the bank to reduce the loan amount and then the assessments boat will be reduced okay and i anticipate that happening i see a canned up glen gun uh yeah for the city manager just uh what's the update on the timeline for the bridge sub-aqueous bore and the 22nd street extension well the sub-aqueous boar is done the 22nd street uh according to duke uh they're trying to get started on that in september they have asked for their permits we've for the right-of-way on 22nd street we have approved those so it's in the designed in qc phase with uh duke energy right now so you're anticipating the end of september we're done well i don't know if it'll be the end of september i'm saying they told me they were going to start in september got you okay thank you and and i think that's going to depend on their crews in the hurricane season and a few other things that are going on thank you any other questions any other city council comments or questions uh lynn marv yes the question i have is it possible with all the um juke energy trying to harden their infrastructure throughout the coastal communities in florida will there possibly be any uh future rebates from duke or the government the the we got the rebate we we got the 70 i think it was 73 000 rebate uh i don't see any other rebates at the current time well i know the 70 000 was for you know the transformer turn back and some wire and credit and whatever right but i mean if anything goes through the state then we get some money there to possibly reduce the cost that we had out there yeah at this time i don't know of anything that the state is proposing i know there there is a hardening theory out there but i i couldn't tell you uh that they were going to bring any of that to the beach at this point and they haven't released that to anyone yet all right thank you any other city council comments or questions let's open it up to the uh to the citizens there are no raised hands okay then we'll come back to the council with uh with i believe it was dave gaddis i think who made this this motion correct yes i did great great job uh i'm looking forward to seeing this project being wrapped up okay then let me call this question it's consideration of resolution 2020-12 resolution of the city council of beller beach florida approving the fiscal year 2020-21-21 non-advelorum assessment role for the bellevue islands estates island assessment area um i'm sorry i said that wrong bellevue estates island assessment area directing certification of the assessment role to the pinellas county tax collector and providing an effective date a yes vote will bring that uh move this forward and move the the role to the pinellas county tax collector through the city manager madam clerk we please call the roll council member swope hi councilmember aki hi councilmember bean aye councilmember gattis aye councilmember shirley hi vice mayor gunn aye mayor manzo hi so seven to zero city manager would you please move forward with this and bring the role uh to the uh pinellas county county tax collector and thank you for your work on this item 12 is to uh this is 12a i'm sorry we made a change here so item 12a is to authorize the city manager to execute contract for law enforcement services with pinellas county sheriff for fiscal year 2020 through 2021 placed on by the city manager and this is the renewal of the pinellas county sheriff's office annual contract do i have a motion uh mayor uh isn't this still 12 i mean we haven't started 12 yet the next item would be 12a you know i said this is 12 it's this is i i split them so 12 this is 12a and yours is 12b the uh the communication committee yep we put well b out of the communication so this is 12 a yep and so it's formerly an item number 12. do i have a motion thank you mark beam second second second okay mr bean council member beam okay lynn the only i like i like the contract the only thing i'd like to say since we've had questions throughout the year of where the officers are or whatever i don't think we need to know where they're at but at least if each one of the officers could get a copy of this contract and realize what we'd like to ask them to do and at least sign this so they've read it um the bus patrol i very seldom see anybody out there and enforcement of local ordinances such as contractors working after hours and holidays i think there's a lot of question with some of the new officers that come on board they don't realize what we're asking them to do and i think a copy of this given to each one of them would help that situation yeah i can uh i mean i could provide him one i guess uh i'd want to go through the sheriff to see if he wanted that uh if he's okay with that i don't see it as a problem so we'll we'll take that up with the sheriff's office all right thank you lynn i would like to say that um you know i've been very supportive of the sheriff through the year i think they're i think their professionalism is is excellent i think they do a great job in terms of keeping down our heavy crime but to what marv said and i've actually had citizens now contact me they want to speak to sheriff galtieri they're not happy that they don't see the sheriffs they're not happy that enforcement isn't happening same stuff we've been talking about speeding easements you name it um it's the i call it quality of life stuff and it's getting worse it's not getting better and i said it about the easements and everything blew up across the street so my gripe with our sheriff isn't with the professionalism nor with the crime stopping i think they do a fabulous job in that regard but it's this quality of life stuff and if we let it go our city is going to go with it so i'm going to vote for this but there's no alternative what is our alternative we're not going to we're not going to defund the police okay we're not portland but but you know i do have an issue with this okay i mean if there was a choice if i had three choices i would be bringing three sheriffs in or three police chiefs in right now saying what can you do and can it be done better because i know it can be done better and this is not going to work if this keeps up we call ourselves a premier community let's step it up okay thank you jody shirley yeah does the um when when we're talking about patrol um bellar shores has their own officer is that correct or do we share because we share okay well the reason i'm asking is i just happened to be out walking the dog at sunset and was it down by the marina and i watch person after person park at the marina and not pay tol not pay their parking fee and walk over to the beach and i thought i wonder where the sheriff is i'm certain he's probably out looking at bellaire shores parking situation so just a kind of observation and to the point of i don't know that we can share i don't know i mean it i know we i know it's the same stretch of town but it still seems to be that uh maybe there's certain hours or certain days of the week that we need to consider that you know they need to pay for their share if we need to pay for ours i i don't i mean do they do they contract with the sheriff's department when yes and and we receive uh our contract originally was 538 000 and we get a credit back uh of 35 000 for our for the work that they do in bellaire shore uh which mainly is their three beach easements you know that that's that's really all the sheriff does for them other than if there's a felony or a break-in or something like that i know they talk a lot about people trespassing on their properties and whatnot so i don't know that that's necessarily true that that's all they do i think they're policing the residents of belarus shores too and i think that they're getting a heck of a deal and we're sacrificing because of it well i can have some further discussion with the sheriff uh you know about that patrol issue i have asked them uh because i've questioned a couple times about this patrolling and uh i've i had some conversations with the it isn't captain liner it's a new captain nick losaris uh that's in charge of the patrol and uh he did discuss with me some gps tracking of officers and uh i think what we've got to do is be a little more uh this directed patrol stuff when when we keep directed directed directed i i think we've we've got to look at that a little closer and and maybe not have so many directed patrols because they're trying to do this they're trying to do house checks they're trying to do directed patrols on the beach at this time and that time and i i think what it does it takes away from some of the actual what they should be doing for us is the residents seeing them on the streets yeah i rarely see them on the street i'm sorry glenn let me just make one more point i really see them on the street and um i noticed like you know i leave my house around very early in the morning and you know typically it's like 5 30 in the morning and i never see a police officer they see plenty of them down near indian rocks beach but nothing um at our end of town which again leads me to where is our officer i used to see him on the i used to see him on golf boulevard i don't anymore so if we can check it out and report back something yes i had hands up so i have glenn gunn and then i have dave robin was next the eyes are so it's glenn gunn robinaki and dave gaddis that's the order so far glenn gunn yeah i would say that uh we're being kind of coy with uh we're talking about the amount that baylor shore gives us a credit for the sheriff but when when you compute what that's worth as i understand it talking to lynn reeves on the side regarding this issue they're paying for 45 minutes of sheriff's time per shift is that correct yep that's that's what i calculate well it it might be 46 or 47 with the new contract okay that was last year but my point is by the time you figure out how much time it takes to unlock those gates and open up the beach axes 10 to 15 minutes per i mean you've already gone through their 45 minutes per shift so i so when a deputy parks in the beach access and is running up and down the beach looking for somebody who owns a car without a sticker in the parking lot or is chasing down somebody with an umbrella i'm not sure we have an accurate uh man-hour audit or accounting for the cost that that officer is devoting to bel air shore issues that's basically coming out of bel air beach's finances so i'm thinking it may be time to update a man-hour audit for how much time is actually being devoted to checking locked doors and property and windows for those residents who are not at their residence in air shores and maybe on holiday or at their other home and uh also i guess there's there's two ends of the spectrum on this directed patrol thing i mean we're hearing people well where are these sheriffs during their patrol we're not quite sure what they're doing well we get pushback from the sheriff's office because they like to come on duty and have the widest latitude possible for how to spend their patrol and optimize their personal discretion on that and i'm thinking perhaps we need to be a little more prescriptive in those things we want them to do where we want them to be what we actually want them to do uh i i just have a tendency to lean towards the other end of the spectrum on this thing the last question i have is is the contract amenable during during the year and and how difficult that is i i had asked lynn reeves to kind of put out some feelers with the other municipalities and his network to see if if our increases uh in this contract are apples apples or apples to oranges or if everybody seems to be getting a a equitable increase in this and what what those increases are going for so that that's it is your contract amenable are are we getting a uh an equitable uh increase in this just like all the other municipalities that's all i had thank you councilmember rocky i agree with glenn and jody i mean especially now with this new umbrella ordinance and it seems like the belair shores residents are going to be expecting the sheriffs to enforce it so that means more time on the beach more time talking to citizens about taking down umbrellas and we want more time you know monitoring the easements to not let non-residents in and the stickers and we want more going on which i agree with however if they're only paying pennies for that how is that fair you know so i think i don't i mean maybe it's not an issue with the sheriff it's an issue with bel air shore but i think it's time to get back to them and whatever i don't know if it's a contract we have with them that they owe us 30 whatever it is or if it's time to say hey you want more ordinances monitored and enforced well then you better pay up for that extra time because i mean if those ordinances are negatively affecting our residents why should we be paying to be negatively affected when they want that more policing they need to be paying for it so i mean i agree with jody and glenn that and like jody says they're getting a sweet deal they're getting the benefits of the sheriff for pennies and that's not fair that's got to stop and i'm starting to think with belair shores we seem to be treating them with kid gloves and that's obviously not working so i think it's time to start putting our um our fist down a little bit and start demanding you know just not more just equal and what's right and what's fair then that's it i'm done thank you david gaddis um i feel a little bit differently uh at the beginning of the the uh coven uh thing uh whenever that that started happening i noticed that all police cars disappeared they were all given mandates that they had to go and monitor buildings that were not following the rules i think since then the rules have been relaxed and everyone knows what to do and businesses know they'll be shut down if they're not following the rules so those resources should have come back to us but i've noticed that going in both directions over the bridge hour in the morning to work rush hour in the evening from work uh i don't see the sheriff patrolling the bridge at all on either side so my question is is where are the resources in general i don't uh i'm not absolutely sure that that we're getting cheated i'm just wondering if uh they're here so little that that's all we notice anymore and uh i would i would like to know why they're not patrolling the bridge because uh they're certainly not uh we used to see them uh over there at bonefish and um uh that the uh the other uh strip mall over there and i never see them in either parking lot anymore uh so i do see them occasionally in ours but that's generally they're parked in the back and not out front definitely something has changed and i'd like to see a change back especially with the rate increase that we received recently any other comments on council like i guess just so what's the next step we have all these comments but like what's the plan let me ask you this mr reeves i mean what i'm hearing is a lot of negativity and and i'm not saying that in a bad way these are valid points that every council member has made points that should have been made a while ago and so are my points i've got a citizen committee that is asking me okay as a private citizen who just happens to be the mayor to arrange a meeting with sheriff galtiary because they're fed up they don't if it was up to somebody's citizens they would vote no on this the problem is if we vote no we cut our own throats because we have no police protection so we're not proving anything by doing that but voting no or voting yes and being unhappy it doesn't sit well with me so when and how much latitude do we have on this because it sounds to me like we need captain liner in here for to answer every one of these questions that was just asked tonight and probably more because the citizens want have questions too i was approached by two citizens and i know there's a third that want to meet with me and and ultimately meet with the sheriff they're they're ha they've had it and these are it's just ongoing we're like a broken record for those of you who remember records so what's our latitude on this can we push this a month or push it a couple of weeks uh you know if you want to table it tonight we can push it till the september meeting because it's you know it's uh it's effective october 1st that's that's up to the console uh i can see if we can get a meeting with the sheriff and maybe at the work session i'll ask uh if the console's fine with that the work session on the 17th uh i'll ask for the sheriff but i'll also ask for captain liner to come and answer those questions and that would be i mean that would be great if you could do that and then i can have those citizens that have approached me say hey sheriff galtier is going to be here um captain liner's going to be here i mean i know they've sent the top brass before when we had some issues and concerns so again their receptiveness and their professionalism is unquestioned they're they're great these are these guys are and then ladies are true professionals but in these these all those questions that were just asked need to be answered at least in my mind i can't make the motion but um to councilwoman hockey that's what can happen dave i just saw your hand go up um the only uh comment that that i think uh i i think's a suggestion that might be helpful would be um if they if each patrolling officer maintained a lot of what he's doing well they do they do they have that but we don't right yeah they they have a uh log for their directed patrols uh and you know as an example if they're doing the beach uh or they're patrolling the city they they do log that and they have a gps system i will tell you when i asked for the gps stuff previously i was told though that's not something we would give to a city so we could ask that again and but i did ask for that previously one actually council member beam asked me to ask them that and was told no and what about bel-air shore like that 30 whatever it is i mean how is that decided how's that figured out has that been decided like 10 years ago and it's never been increased no it it it's a formula the sheriff uses based on and the as vice mayor said i kind of calculated that because we keep talking about you know we we want the beach accesses patrolled and things of that nature well the the three beach accesses aren't the city of bel air beaches they're the town of bellar shores and so the sheriff takes that to some degree that we're telling them to do directed patrols on them too and bellar shores telling them to do a directed patrol so in essence uh they may do more patrols there but realistically that's not for us to tell them and that's what i was kind of trying to explain about if if you look at go back to the sheriff's report and you look at uh in section three and you look at uh the third the third page of that report you'll notice that they do a lot they you know they're doing like 10 directed patrols a day for us and that's what i was kind of talking about i think a lot of times the directed patrols except for our parking lots and beach areas we need to separate them from the town of bellair shore uh and you know they do a lot of house checks i i i mean they're doing uh if on the average about 10 a day you know it may be a night shifter that's a lot of house checks they're stopping that's that's taken i'm guessing just based on what i've seen with the house checks the deputy pulls up he gets out he walks around the house by the time he gets back in the car and logs the house check in what have we spent 10 15 minutes yeah yeah and and you know that that's spending a lot of time on and i'm not saying do away with it i'm just trying to explain that you know we're spending a lot of time on uh stuff that really isn't getting a bang for the buck i guess is what i'm right but i mean i don't want to stop those either but you know if they do one of those house checks for a bellaire shore mansion that's going to take 30 minutes just to walk around one of those yeah i don't know how many they do there but regardless where it seems like we're paying for a lot of biller shores sheriff benefits and i think that needs to be stopped and maybe we need to talk to them about their formula that it needs to be adjusted and maybe we can do that prior to the next contract because i don't want to wait a year and especially now with this these organs and ordinances that are out of control they're going to want more share of presence they'll they need to pay for it right councilwoman shirley yeah um just a couple of points is the 35 000 that dollar shores pays is less than what uh we pay for for our code enforcement so just to kind of give you put it in perspective i think we're paying them fifty thousand dollars for a code enforcement so that kind of puts it in perspective and and to lynn's point there's so many things on here um i think we just all need to go through this but i'm like looking at the sheriff's verifying garage sale permits i i don't think that's their job i mean i think that's something we can do in-house um making the city's bank deposits i'm not sure why the sheriff does that you know i'm just looking at some of these things that they're posting notices in the park i mean it seems like staff should be doing that those sorts of things so if these are what we're calling directed patrols i understand why they're busy they're doing that that we should have staff doing um and and we're paying a premium for it so um i i would i would suggest that we table this and move it to the work session where we can get the sheriff and um lieutenant or whoever it is that would be who we should talk to about some of these things these items and maybe tell them they need to sharpen their pencil a little bit they really need to identify how much of their time is spent in bellar shores versus beller beach and um i have to believe it's more than what we pay for for our code enforcement i mean i i can't i can't imagine that they can control that patrol that beach and not and not spend at least what we're paying on code enforcement which is 50 000. so um i think we table this and move it to the work session and try to vote on it the next meeting cody shirley is that a formal motion to table that would be my formal motion yes do i have a second second taken by robin hockey discussion on tabling this motion i holy agree i hope we vote for it anybody else on it i'm good with this uh i think it would be uh good also if we move into a discussion that we actually invite uh this chair uh or representative of the sheriff to come and uh sit down with us and let's talk about what you know face-to-face what we're missing and i'm going to ask lynn reeves patty gentry if you could make sure the citizens know that this is their opportunity to respectfully address our police force good and bad i mean listen i'm the first one to say they're doing a great job with crime control but these are all issues that need to be dealt with and let's deal with it um and they can send whomever they feel is necessary but i i think we should enable it at this point in time so we'll need a majority vote on that but i do have to go up into the uh to the citizens before we do that if we have any other council comments this is on to table no no other comments then patty gentry is there any citizens just on talking about the motion to table there's no race hands no okay so we're back to council with the last word on the motion to table being uh glenn gunn and then jody shirley was has last word glenn yeah i just want to say i'm all for tabling and i think we need to do a little homework on this thing when when i did a quick calculation you know i had sat down with lynn reeves and and when you divide the seven by 24 by 365 days a year uh i mean you're paying 57 an hour i think is what it worked out to and when you think about the amount of training the overhead the admin costs the you know dispatcher all the paperwork and all that stuff it's probably a reasonable cost but i i do have some doubts about billiard shore when you look at our costs drivers in this city law enforcement is invariably one of the top three or four line items here and i would be interested in where law enforcement is in the budget of miller shore and i'm i have to plea ignorance in that i'm not quite sure what their budget is but i would just be interested in whole how that all uh levels out i'm all for tabling this thing and doing some more homework vice mayor i can give you an approximate answer because i sat through their budget meeting last time and um they're spending about 35 000 with us and i think their overall budget for the year is about 135 000 so probably about 20 25 percent maybe about 25 30 percent of the budget yeah their their budget amount is the sheriff's contract is 35088 that's what it is for the year any other council comments before i take that to vote jodi shirley you have last word no further comments okay so the question uh before us now is a motion to table item 12a which is the authorization the city manager to go forward with this contract if you vote to table it we're going to move this to the work session which is scheduled i think for the 17th uh coming up august 17th and lynn reeves is going to attempt to get um the highest brass he can get in the sheriff's office to come out and discuss this with us and we're going to publicize this with the citizens because i want them to be able to speak also so a vote yes tables at a vote no we will move to approving this contract or not approving the contract tonight madam clerk would you please call the roll council member aki aye council member beam aye council member gavis hi councilmember shirley aye council member sue hi vice mayor gunn aye mayor manzo hi so it passes seven to zero this is tabled um lynn reeves you'll please proceed and patty gentry please proceed to notify our citizens i would love to hear from people on that night i would like to see uh the sheriff coming you know lynn if they can listen to what everybody just raised i think those are the questions we've been hearing these for a while i guess there's some new stuff and new concerns with these um you know with bella shore and uh so let's see if maybe they can come prepared with some answers and um let's hear it okay not a problem and then we'll put the contract back on the agenda at the september 9th meeting absolutely okay okay so the next item then up is uh what we have made the change to make item 12b which is the communications advisory committee report um david gaddis you're going to do that for us uh no uh leslie natara is okay so is she here uh patty yes yes okay then um this is we don't need a motion on this it's a report so i'll turn the floor over to leslie natara one second okay there we go chair no tarot i just didn't unmute did it unmuted yeah we can hear you okay all right um you folks should have gotten in your emails today a couple of documents several versions of them um one of them being the um communication strategy a spreadsheet which goes through what we need to communicate what kind of priorities they are how often we do it and how we do it this has gone through several changes at our committee meetings um so we get safety issues down to long-term plans you know some on a regular basis some on an as needed basis a couple things on the safety issues alert pinellas we i think we we need to push that put that on on our website so that people know that they can sign up to that and something that the county does that gives you information i don't know if any if all you guys are on it or not but you get information about storms coming through and infrastructure issues and such [Music] dave can talk about the auto call auto text system which he demonstrated us called quicksand click send something like that where you can you have a message and broadcast it out to people's um cell phones it was a very interesting um system i have an issue which i've raised with our committee about communicating via facebook i'm not sure that there aren't sunshine law issues record retention issues does the city have if the city develops its own website how do we maintain do we have to have a full-time facebook manager to maintain all those records for city um you know the state rules about what you have to go through and i talked briefly with fred about that and i think there may be some issues doing a facebook page i think the fact that we've got our own website could be a much less dangerous way to maintain things online you also should have gotten a copy of a community response requested it was started out as a postcard it's now looking like more of a letter that we would send out to everybody on the we got our property tax rolls send it out to all the residents and say hey this is how i would like to be contacted we changed sort of from a postcard to a letter or something they could do on the website because some people thought it was it people wouldn't want to send a postcard in the mail with their address and phone number and you know email address and all that stuff but this would give them the way we could develop a you know list of these people want websites these people want phone calls these people want like hard copy mails and so on so that's something that we would look to send out to all of the residents within the city we've scheduled our next meeting for august 13th at six o'clock to kind of pull all this together come up with you know how do we measure the success of these communications with the citizens citizens to the city and city to the citizens um but um that's sort of that's what we've what we've done um i don't know if dave's got a demo we tried his quick send or was it quick send or click send david click sand flick sent it was a very interesting um way to get out messages to to a group of individuals very easily you know we're concerned obviously about we don't have a ca a staff of thousands at city hall to be just you know have somebody be the communications director we have to keep that in mind and this seemed to be a reasonably um efficient cost effective way to do it so that's what the communications committee has been up to now dave oh sure i'll i'll take it uh from here basically uh i introduced a service we uh we were uh talking about the various ways that you could communicate with an individual in our city and of course there's the the normal methods which are the website or possibly email or snail mail but one of the items that's been missing is is by phone most people monitor their phones and rarely even get away from their phones if they're not in their hands they're in their pocket especially when they're driving right so i searched around and originally i found services that were roughly around 100 a month and uh and i thought you know that's that's uh too much i can do better uh so i kept looking and i found uh a service that offered messaging at a flat rate and uh basically you could you can uh construct any message that you'd like uh you have a a pre-built send list you decide whether it's a a voice call or whether you'd like to send a text message and in either case you're looking at less than two cents a message per person so it's very affordable the the service gave me three dollars to play with and i think i sent about 25 messages and still have uh like i don't know about maybe a buck and a quarter or something like that uh but uh i demonstrated it uh at first with the city manager and the city clerk and and also kyle and uh once i verified that that it worked for them then i went back and i demonstrated it for the communication committee and uh and it was relatively fast uh so uh although we the the city of bel air beach should not be the go-to person for uh catastrophic events such as hurricanes and things like that whenever we already have alert pinellas in place uh it can certainly be used to notify people of uh certain items that they'd like to they'd like to receive on their phone rather than having to stop what they're doing and log into a website or uh or go to facebook also extensive records are kept whenever you send these messages you get a very detailed log of who what numbers they went to if a name is attached to it what's what the person's name is and whether it actually went through or if it failed uh but it all happens very very quick uh i tested it uh with our workforce uh on my job and uh i was able to send 80 messages to 85 recipients and every one of them got it within one minute so uh it seems like one one way to go it may not be the only service out there but this one seems to work and it's uh they're not requiring you to pay a whole bunch of money or a monthly fee up front to get on their service uh so if that's something that uh that this council decides that they'd like to look into i'll be more than happy to do a demonstration uh david yes one of the things i think you said it would require a dedicated phone line correct well okay so let me explain that basically uh right now uh i'm using their shared number so what that means is you're gonna get a phone number that you're not sure who it is you'll obviously get the text message but let's say that you elected receive a voice message it's the same thing a computer basically converts text to voice to speech and then uh we'll call it's like robocalling um in that case you may very well block it because you don't know who's calling you with a dedicated number we could actually post this is if you receive a phone call or a text message from this number is the city of bel air beach and that way you could whitelist it in your phone and you would always get the message uh if you decided to subscribe to that the cost for a dedicated phone number per month is i think it's like three dollars something like that to have the same number every time that you uh received a message from the city uh some great ideas here i i the timing is uh uh you know uh fortuitous right now we're going through the budget thing and i i don't recall is there something in our budget so that we have some provisions to take some of these ideas and put some money behind it so you can have a trial period try some things one of the things i talked to about with the city manager was we've got this huge pile of reserve money set aside and it was originally labeled hurricane and we have since rebranded it as a disaster or emergency funds and as we go through our budget uh city manager and i have kind of looked at some stuff and we maintain reserves for some things that we would fix on condition for instance if a a a light burns out or gets knocked down on the bridge we take money out of these reserve funds to fix that light and maybe we need to expand our thinking on the utilization of these emergency or hurricane funds so that we don't have to have these little separate rice bowls of uh reserve funds for things that happen on condition or some unplanned event where we weren't it wasn't forecasted or expected and yet we've got to cough up the money to fix something or or replace it bridge repairs something like that obviously we can reschedule the money and reprogram the money down the line to back fill this emergency fund but some of these communication things if it's addressing emergency actions or disaster preparedness or something like that can be short-term funded out of our emergency or disaster reserves and not maintain a ongoing fund for communications but i just think maybe we should put some money aside to give the communications ad hoc committee some latitude to try out some of these things and see uh if if you get some value for for what you're proposing that sort of thing so i'm just throwing that out there thanks any other council comments yeah i would like to make a few comments this is councilmember swope i want to thank councilmember gattis and mayor editorial for all the work you are doing and as well as your team on this uh the information i received today i was very impressed with i'm very impressed with this automatic call what quicks whatever you called it council member gaddis but i think we're moving in the right direction on communicating with our citizens as well as them communicating with us so i just wanted to let you know that i'm extremely impressed with all the work as well as the reporting and the status reports that you're providing for us thank you thank you any other council comments uh jody shirley and marv beam yeah just just quickly um great work you guys i think it's good sounds like a lot of thought went into it and dave thanks for your expertise on um the texting information and just a quick back to what um glenn suggested i'm looking at you know some information i have from the finance committee and we have a reserve fund balance at 2.3 million and our mandatory reserve is 540 000 so i think there's a little money there that we could push your way and have available as needed for um communication i mean clearly we don't need that much money and i don't know that you know it needs to be a separate line item but clearly there's some latitude to provide funds as necessary that's it council member b yes in regards to the mail out card or letter once we determine um what we can do and that's on the list i think it's a good idea that everybody then will be on record for either accepting what we come up with or not then there won't be any argument going going uh into the future good job dave and leslie thank you thank you everyone um was there any questions from the public on this um city clerk no raised hands okay council do we have any other comments i thank everybody for their hard work on this anybody else have any questions or comments okay thank you that'll conclude item 12a now we get into the standard part of our uh agenda which is unfinished business item 13. do we have any unfinished business marv beam questions for lynn lynn the pathways north and south that we were going to take care of and put shell down and again there were some encroachments on different properties that were going to be taken care of what's the status on that one well we've got we we've got to have a further discussion with the consul on going forward if you want to make it a project uh the encroachments i think we can go ahead and do there there's only a couple small ones uh but the console uh that's kind of been put on the back burner but we need to have a discussion maybe at a work session to say okay do we want to expend the funds to to do this project all right could we put that on the next work session for a discussion yeah it's it's getting bigger it's okay this one this this can has been kicked down the road so many times the cans falling apart so yeah it's time to address this robin aki another can i think we finally need to put some time and effort into addressing is the marina we keep talking about ideas about the finances and charging and rent and i think we finally need to either do something about it or decide we're not going to do anything officially and let that be our stance but that can has been kicked down so we need to talk about that the next worst work session if we can also add that online please it's already there it was planned to be there awesome good let's do it marv i'll come back to you but instead anybody else have anything first we're going around first round anybody else on first round then marv second round all right there's two things um the waterside code seawall issue coming up with the codes or at least talking about them we've got uh we we've kind of re-drafted the the uh let me tell you what city it was that we had uh marco island manual and what i want to do is send that out to an engineer and see if he uh if if there's anything we missed and we'll probably do that to rube carson and then we're going to just have to determine what what code from that manual because realistically in doing research there's not a lot of cities that have any codes specifically for sea walls and the inspection process well you know again like i like i stated these sea walls are 60 70 years old and there never was any requirement to have them inspected so mainly right now it's a break and then fix type right so i mean the obvious the obvious was um kind of put together in that marco island information i gave to you and it's the basics if if the cap is cracked if you have soil falling in by the seawall that's number two and a low tide inspection if the if the separations between the slabs show that they're eroded away that would be the three basic the basic i would just say flags that would go up for a required inspection i mean it that would be the common sense one uh that's what i feel i mean those those and there's a lot of them in the city that are in that condition and the last thing i want to talk about is the line of sight backing out of driveways um you've got some people that have run six foot bushes all the way to the street and you can't see if a kid on a bicycle is um coming down the road when you're backing out of your driveway and the thing that's bothering me is the corner of causeway and gulf boulevard that house on a corner on the south side on the east eastern corner if you try to look at traffic coming northbound on gulf boulevard you can't see it unless they're at the light if you stay at the stop sign line that's in a road where you have to pull into the walkway to see traffic coming down so sometimes you interfere with pedestrians trying to cross and that's it thank you thank you um dave gaddis was next to then glenn gunn after that yes i uh also agree that there there are some issues with our sea walls but i think before the sea walls are dressed i addressed i would like to see the docks addressed mainly because uh they're an immediate hazard there's floating debris in the in the water with every storm nearly every tide change uh it's it's ridiculous and it gets caught up under people's docks if you remove it it weighs a million tons and it's nearly impossible to get it out of the water uh all of this could be stopped if uh if people were uh written a citation with dilapidated docks that were in the water also uh staying in the water area i noticed that there's a buoy that's way way way out it's uh in front of uh steve marsh's house that that direction uh there it there's no way it should be that far out uh and then also i wanted to ask lynn about the sailboat that we have moored now [Music] it's anchored it's anchored out i'm trying to think of the best place basically if you're looking at the causeway bridge from 22nd street uh it's it's well you can't miss it it's a small it's a small sailboat but you know i we all dread seeing those things show up if one shows up we're going to have plenty of them before you know it because they're going to think it's a it's an anchor leave your boat friendly neighborhood and we don't want that so that's about all i had to say about the water and the docks and sea walls thank you glenn gunn i think some of this goes to the the gap in the the code review i mean we we've been discussing the idea of having that follow-on code review and some of the things with the sea walls and the docks and things like that are some of the gaps that we we need to plug with the next code review do we have some kind of timeline for when we're going to spool up that next code review and again probably the charter we give those people will say hey we need some specific guidance and direction on sea walls dock ordinances that sort of thing so just a timeline from the city manager or the council when we'll be looking at the next code review thanks yeah when we we talked about that previously uh i recommended waiting till the fall get through the budget and then start spool that up in in the fall i'm going to suggest that we start farming right now for people who want to be on it we let's get that word out jody's nodding our head and these things take time it is the middle of summer let's get this going we've again you know these are all things we've talked about and these are all great things let's get them going folks you know i mean we can work on two things at once so i agree with glenn gunn jody shirley looks like she's agreed with me we're all agreeing let's let's get that word out that it's coming okay i don't see this council voting against that so we're gonna give that charter in charge out to them i have some issues we've had some stuff recently obviously with sign ordinances and things like this so yeah let's let's get them charged up and get them working on this yeah absolutely sorry about that the cell phones alerts going off no problem okay anybody else on council okay unfinished business is up for us so um i will move it then we'll close out unfinished business and then move over to city attorney fred riley do you have anything for us i do not okay um then i moved to item does anybody have anything for the city attorney okay then we move to item 15 city manager lynn yes uh the the changes we discussed at the last uh budget meeting i sent you new pages out last week so you just need to insert those the storm water fee is progressing our first millage rate hearing will be in our first council meeting in september which is september 9th right now on the work session i had the marina i've added the sheriff uh we'll talk about the paths and i will send this document for the sea walls out to the seawall engineer for him to review you got a copy of the code enforcement report for the month of july uh also we finally got our final payment for hurricane irma the management portion uh we got that in last week fifty six hundred dollars so uh it was a process but we we got it back so that that's good we didn't expend anything but that's that's a bonus for the city uh and we'll start on those the code committee advertising for that and uh i think that's everything i have at this point oh the yeah i did talk about the marina uh mr uh lusk is is gonna uh provide some information that he did some research on for the marina at the work session also so uh he'll he'll be making a presentation as it stands now based on the uh what the governor's last mandate was he he said that he extended the virtual meetings till september first but in that same mandate he said the budget hearings are virtually or extended till october 15th which is kind of contradictory since we do our budget and millage rate at our council meeting and i did talk to the property appraiser tax collector about that and uh they basically gave me the direction just go ahead because he did authorize the millage rate meeting to be virtual so as it stands right now we'll just continue virtual into september and i presume the governor will just extend it another month sometime he waited very late i mean we had already sent the agenda out and he told us the update uh it was like eight o'clock on thursday night so and if you have any questions for me i'll be glad to answer them questions i have one robin and denmark had a lot of citizens with this whole umbrella thing there's so much confusion as far as mean water line can they do the wet sand dry sand no sand never anywhere i mean there's so much confusion there needs to be a consensus like this is what's allowed this is what's not and i don't know if we need to put it on the website or post it somewhere or we could say the rules are listed here that way there's no well he said this she said that i had my umbrella here and the sheriff said this there needs to be something concise and that everybody has the same information because it's so confusing right now well just uh give you a little information uh which you probably don't know anything about i'm i met with some residents last week last wednesday for about a little over an hour uh it was let's see i think there was eight or nine uh and and we kind of went through that process i have talked to one of uh beller shores commissioners and i have a call in to the mayor i don't know that he's back in town yet but i will be talking to him before their next meeting and i'm still working on trying to get them to do some uh relief for the umbrellas at least but to clarify and it'll be up to the city council every city has a jurisdictional line and i've i've explained that to a few people but every city has a jurisdictional line fred and i have talked about it and belair shores jurisdictional lines ours happens to be almost 10 miles out into the gulf and i'm sure theirs is probably in a similar fashion we'd have to get a survey or something to tell you exactly where but what those jurisdictional lines anything they pass means that they can enforce them uh and you know this discussion about wet sand dry sand i mean watermark erosion control line all of that stuff is still in their jurisdictional boundary so uh and i you know i know that uh there's some concern and i also based on what the residents told me uh and what the sheriff has told me they aren't enforcing it right now and there haven't been any complaints from bel air shore so i mean i think those are things that are positive and i suggested to the one commissioner i spoke to you know if if we're gonna get into somatics then you know maybe the beach accesses themselves the boundaries of those are are the potential places and if you go to the right or left and you get on somebody's private property then it's the private property owner's issue not not ours glenn glenn sorry i'm in complete agreement with robin here uh everything that's out there is misinformation urban legend innuendo sidebar discussion whatever there isn't any one consolidated place for what is actually going on and what the latest information is uh there's there's nobody out there speaking with any authority or any uh uh engagement with the city we we we need to show that the city is engaged on this issue right now because there's a a lack of a consolidated authority reference on this thing our residents believe that the city is not engaged on this issue and that's not correct i mean the people in this video right now lynn reeves is engaged with the city of biller shores i know people here have kind of a good idea of how this stuff works but the information is not getting out there so you got people hey what's this a mean high tide line well they can't enforce it because the florida constitution says this what's this jurisdictional stuff how far did it what what's his three league stuff i mean we need to show that we're engaged on this thing and whether or not we need to put out a flyer maybe we need to put a letter out to the residents maybe we need to have the city manager's corner of the website to say hey you know i'm hearing this that's not true this is the actual status of this thing but we need to take a a leadership position enrolling this thing for our residents and that's all i can say on that i just want to throw something in then i'll come back to jody and then over to fred riley so it's jody next after me and then fred um i don't know why the confusion the ordinance couldn't be any clearer no shade coverings anywhere within the city limits takes you into the water that's it they're not allowed okay i want to thank jody shirley glenn gunn lynn reeves and i thank myself we were four people who went and spoke at bel air shores town council meeting to try and get them to reconsider this um that was based on a person-to-person discussion that i had with mayor schmidt it wasn't mayor to mayor it was person-to-person and he said he had to run it by his counsel and anybody who heard that tape it no sooner got out of mayor schmidt's mouth about trying to postpone this then it was immediately shot down there was no consideration jody shirley went through every one of our suggestions to them toway zones and card control they didn't even say yeah like wow great idea they said nothing so you may not know this i received that i haven't been around to give this back because i was away but um i will be forwarding to patti gentry tomorrow a letter i received there's two citizens that have moved forward with a notice of lawsuit um they are going to sue the city of bel air shore to invalidate this ordinance and they also are going to seek to have them removed as trustees under the uh the um the deeds and this is the last word i'm ever going to say on this okay i've held off till tonight to do this i went through ethics clearance all the way up to tallahassee i'm not joining them i'm going to preserve my own rights with a lawsuit um i will not stand for this i bought my property here to be within walking distance of the beach this has been taken away from me without compensation i will not stand for it i'm not joining their suit i'm bringing them my own on behalf of myself and myself only not as mayor as joseph banzo property owner and because of that and because of what i've just told you i now cannot can no longer participate in these discussions they will have my letter tomorrow and um i'm moving forward with this enough is enough we've talked about this enough everybody in this city has tried they don't want to hear it so they'll hear it from me and we'll let the judge decide how we're going to work this thing out because i see no other way of working this thing a law on the books is a law and i cannot as a licensed attorney run the risk of going across the street and being arrested for bringing a beach umbrella they arrested somebody for drinking coffee on their beach 15 years ago i can't have that and i will not have it so thank you everybody for your support i will moderate any discussions on this but i'm no longer going to going to participate in any of them so i think jody was next and then fred riley yeah i was just going to point out what you'd said um may remain though is that we did have you know conversation they shot down the even thought of talking but i think in closing on that meeting the other night was that you know i suggested a task force and um bella shore's mayor was receptive to that and i'm saying a task force so we have a representative from bellaire beach and representative from belarus shores you know clearly all of us as council members cannot but maybe one person can along with um along with lynn go meet with them and try to come up with some solutions to mitigate this but clearly the council members were not interested in a second thought of not passing it they they were clear that they didn't want umbrellas i did walk the beach from uh our very far north end of beller beach all the way down to indian rocks beach the other day and what i noticed was there are two houses that everyone has vegetation behind their house so you clearly cannot set up an umbrella right behind someone's house it's not likely that you can get up into their sea walls and things like that there are two houses adjacent to accesses that the ground cover is cleared out they're clearly keeping the sea oats off of that ground and i found that interesting and i bet those are the two that are complaining most about people being um in their backyard because they've cleared out the cos they don't allow they're not allowing them to grow which i would think would be you know an issue that i mean i would think you would want those sea oats in that ground cover to stabilize the sand but um and and i don't i'm just making an observation i have um i don't know that i have a solution for that i'm just making an observation so that's it really and lynn just please follow up on the task force and try to get that set up yes i that's that's my call into mayor schmidt i know he was out of town and i don't know if he's back but i i did talk to uh as i said one of the commissioners commissioner bloom and uh in the conversation i think his or i felt like his uh thought process had changed a little bit but he did share with me that there are a lot of residents over there mainly in the first through i'll say first street maybe up to second or third that are just getting hammered by unfortunately people from indian rocks beach and you know i i don't know what that solution is there's nothing we can do about that you know i think we can find a solution for our residents but what happens down there and that could be part of the the hard uh struggle because three of their council members are from that section of the beach uh i did find that out so and i i know there's a couple residents down there because they've called me complaining uh about you know somebody setting a tent up in front of their or sitting on their seawall or what have you yeah riley i happen to know there's a um an issue with a young family that you know they are on the internet all the time and they're setting up trampolines in the water way down near that first and i can see where that's a problem and there's a lot of kids on the internet watching what's going on so yeah i can see but that's not something that's been iraq's problem not arms right council freddie fred reilly i just wanted to respond quickly he's muted we can't hear fred fred yes that's better okay i wanted to respond to the point that dr rocky raised i i looked up bellaire shores charter and the language of their charter establishes their jurisdiction and it includes it says into the waters of the gulf of mexico to the limit of the jurisdiction of the state of florida so it's it's very similar to what uh is the jurisdictional line in city of bel air beach so you know it goes out into the water so they're really that their ordinances apply out into the gulf thank you glenn gunn we still haven't addressed robin's issue here and i think it's a it's a it's an important one is how do we get the word out there what is the truth and what isn't the truth maybe it's just a a just a short postcard or whatever but just some frequently asked questions as to can i can i take an umbrella on has the ordinance changed no it has not and just a couple simple statements to give people an idea of what the status of this thing is and yeah hey we're still in discussions it's not a done deal yet hey some some residents are bringing legal action in this thing but i think how are we going to do this when are we going to do it and who's who's got it for action well i think i think we can post something to the website and uh we could put a blurb out in a mini city news that just says you know because because the group that i met with last week uh you know they have the the misunderstanding of where the jurisdiction is uh they talk about the supreme court and the who owns the sand and you know uh maybe if if we just put some question and answers to that and got that out to the residents uh they were expecting more people to come but unfortunately only a few came and and i explained that to them individually as a group so maybe we should do that and put something on the website next and then dave gaddis well uh lin do we have anything official a letter from bellaire shores with any signature from a mayor the clerk or whatever that that has passed the ordinance the ordinance uh i'd have to go on to their website but you know the the ordinance i know passed passed in june yes unanimously five years yes all right maybe a copy of that along with the questions and answers yeah i have a copy just to say it's an official deal there's no question yeah i have a copy of it the copy i have i don't have a signed copy but i do have a copy of what the ordinance says okay dave gaddis and then robin aki and i think jody was next too so no okay dave gaddis robin hockey okay so i'm looking at the uh bel air beach website and we do have uh under residence we have the the second item is bel air shore beach boundaries uh right that doesn't really help all that is is okay where are they at uh i would like that section to actually be changed to bel air shore or beach information or just beach information in general and uh and and the important parts uh within that area pertaining to what's going on with bel air shores beach uh i would like a link right there on the home page so that everyone they don't have to go digging for this if they make it to our home page that that information is available click here to find out what's going on and i think that that would be more than enough to give people uh the information that they're looking for we can do that yeah that map's just we created that map to show where the private property was that's that's what that was for abennake um yeah no i agree with dave i like the idea on the homepage that way people don't have to take and um we need to also when you add those little blurbs of frequently asked questions you need to address the beach accesses because people think that oh that's a bell or beach so that sands bellaire beach we need to clarify that that as of now that also means no umbrellas just to clarify that that's another confusion and then um i was also gonna say maybe once you have that on the website maybe someone obviously none of us but somebody can go on to next door and say refer to the website for questions on because i feel like next door is blown up with he said she said in all the misinformation that maybe if someone could just post hey updated information guidelines frequently asked questions please see the official website for your answers i think that would help solve a lot of these uh questions and provide some clarification yeah maybe i can ask martha to do that it's just not us obviously yeah yeah because we don't want to do it any other well this was lynn this was your topic but we've kind of all taken it over because there's some good information here but do we lin do you have any other information for this before we close this out does anybody else on council have anything else on the uh the beach situation and then we'll give it back to lynn if he has any other comments in his segment lynn i'll give it back to you yeah i've i've shared everything to this point and uh we'll get something put up in the next day or so on the website thank you okay so now we move to city clerk um patty gentry no i have nothing thank you patty i have something for you and relax it's actually i think good but um i need to bring this to council's attention um i got a phone call on my city telephone and um it was a complaint about patty gentry i never well you know i don't think i've ever gotten a complaint about patty gentry okay so i was pretty interested in hearing what the person said what followed was two minutes of just vile hate speech yes file hate speech okay and i'm going to copy it and i'm going to give it to patty to make it a public record it is disgusting i will not tolerate it it's personally insulting to me to my heritage and i don't even know if it was directed at me but it was disgusting so i will not call the person back okay and anyone and i probably i'm going to turn it over to the sheriff um it is just unacceptable behavior i can't believe that this is the type of stuff that people would even utter out of their mouth absolutely unacceptable patty if you hung up on this person and they were talking to you like this i'm 100 behind you okay because i would have never listened to this person robin aki um is there any way that we can hear this call so we know what's the exact what happens we're all yes i'm going to give it to patty i'm going to try what i have to do is it's on my telephone so i'm going to actually i think i'm going to i'm going to re-record it off of my iphone and then i can just send it via email so i'll send it to patty and if you want patty i mean you've got my permission it's public rec i'm gonna well i'm gonna make it a public record let's put it out can you get it can you get that quickly i'm talking to june she's sitting in here if she can pull it up i'll play it for you and you could hear it and we'll put it right on the record i'll still forward a copy of it go ahead if you can get it go ahead i'll wait we'll come back we'll circle back to it okay circle back to it i'll let everybody hear this go ahead robin i just want to say patty's amazing patty we all love you we think you're doing a great job so i'm sorry if somebody was mean to you but that was obviously understandable they were mean to me you said it was fatty well i'm sorry you too i don't know how mean they were to patty i could only imagine poor patty but i was i was wow i thought they were talking about patty i was like okay it was me that's fine no i'm pity that's not a mayor yes i don't think we should even hear this and tell you the truth okay um that's between you patty and um the sheriff's department i don't think i'm going to give it to patty tomorrow if you want to hear it then ask for it okay mayor manzo yes can i make a comment when you're finished yeah go ahead i'm finished yes um just that this person has a history with the sheriff's office and with the city and um so when she started speaking and using as you heard just profane language i advised her i said ma'am you know you continue using profanity i'm not able to consider or continue this discussion and she then she had a few other things to say and yes that's when i hung up patty i'm going to stand behind you 100 if this is the way you were treated i would not have tolerated this i will not return i will return every call i return every call ever as mayor okay i've never missed returning a call i will not return this call that's how horrible the language is you cannot call these names to me and expect me to help you out i'm just not gonna do it okay it's horrible language it's it's ethnic slurs and i'm not gonna tolerate it okay it's that simple so mayor just to give you but everyone in city hall has been gotten that phone call or email or from this individual and it's evidently been going on for long before my my time here i can tell you that uh and you know i i know the the individual was uh i believe it baker acted at one time and it's probably getting close to that point again because it's gotten out of hand and well lynn to the extent that anyone at headquarters had to endure this again i'm just gonna let you know i mean you know i'm one vote on council but i i think i understand my the council here and i don't think they will tolerate this for anybody i will support anybody at headquarters who terminates a conversation like this this is not something you have to endure they can disagree with you lord knows i disagree sometimes with you mr reeves and with other people but this is not the way we do it okay this just this this goes to a whole different level no one should have to endure this kind of nonsense it's hate speech and it's unacceptable so you as far as i'm concerned you can hang up you don't have to tolerate it it's that simple mark beam you're next yes i again i said i don't think anybody needs to hear it and i would suggest letting the the city attorney and uh the sheriff's department and um city manager analysts will do yeah that's fine unless council wants to that doesn't mean paddy will have it i'll try and get it to you tomorrow i have a busy day but by wednesday patty you will have it and my apologies that you had to go through this from one of our citizens thank you man i'm sorry i misunderstood i thought you were saying they were insulting patty but either way no one should be insulted no they they complained about patty they said patty hung up and then they proceeded to just rip it i mean she didn't direct it to me but she i don't know who she thought she was talking to because it was all about me and my italian heritage and it's just unacceptable it's just totally unacceptable it's a major insult so not my heritage what she said about it um no go okay thank you council and thank you for patty and lynn and to anybody else at city hall uh you don't have to tolerate this garbage okay um city council i think we're up to city council comments if we had no other comments for the clerk uh it's an even month so we start with robin hockey and we go alphabetically no i think i addressed all my issues and they're coming up again on the work session so for now i'm good and again patty you rock so just want to remind you thank you thank you mark beam no i think i've uh addressed everything and again uh patty i'm sorry that uh you have to go through this and please once you get a copy of it you know i would confer with the attorney and make a decision on what you guys want to do dave gaddis nothing at this time jody shirley nothing further rita swope uh yes i want to state uh for the record that it is important that this council works together with that being said i feel it's necessary to set the record straight i believe that it's completely unprofessional for any member of council to make false accusations and threats towards anyone especially other members of the council during the july 6th city council meeting there was a lengthy discussion regarding an alleged conversation that i was accused of having with the six j judicial circuit court judge patricia moore patrice moore on march 18th although i called point of order and adamantly denied having such discussions i was still threatened i felt threatened with removal and the accusations continued i felt it was necessary to reach out to the honorable patrice moore and ask her for clarification since these accusations were very public and very heated i sent a registered letter to the judge on july 20th i included in the letter a link to the july 6 city council meeting video after receipt of my letter the judge reached out to me when we had a phone conversation on july 23rd at 1 49 pm during that call she assured me that she had watched the segments of the video mentioned in my letter and that no such conversation took place she also assured me she did not have a conversation with mayor manzo and miss van scoy regarding me or any conversation regarding a sunshine law violation after that meeting she even assured me that any issue would have been handled on a one-to-one basis to clear the air and most certainly would not have ever been discussed with another colleague towards the end of our conversation i asked the judge to send me something in writing so that i could have it for my records she volunteered to do just that and suggested she also copied mr manzo and i agree on july 23rd at 2 32 pm she sent an email i will not read her email in entirety nor my letter to her as this has been sent to patty gentry to retain as a public record but i will quote a statement made by the honorable patrice moore in her email response i have no knowledge of having any conversations with you or anyone else about the sunshine law on that evening end quote she also mentioned she was not sure why such a conversation would have come up in the council meeting on july 6. as i previously stated all correspondence between judge moore and i have been sent to patti gentry to retain its public record anyone that would like to request to copy this record please feel free to do so these accusations were made in a public meeting and were completely false and yet the council and the public were intentionally led to believe that i somehow violated laws i violated my oath of office and that i was unethical and even subject to recall in doing the fact check on this specific incident it makes one question everything that has ever been said by this member as a city council member i'm not only concerned about the guidance that this council and the residents of bellar beach have been receiving but the validity of the information presented as a member of this council we are not always going to agree on things but for a member to blatantly try to discredit another member with total disregard for the truth should not be tolerated just as the call regarding patty gentry and to the mayor that should not be tolerated i'm just wanting to state for the record that we're all supposed to work together but yet this occurred on july 6 and it was against me and i took it very very personally so i just wanted to make sure everyone knew how i felt as well as to clear the record on the fact that i never had a conversation with judge moore thank you i'm going to respond to that and i'm not going to drag judge moore into this any more than she's had to be i receive this letter everything i say i stand by judge moore said she did not recall it june van scoy recalls it with particularity and june has asked me to arrange a meeting with the judge you know i haven't reached out to judge moore because i just feel that we've embarrassed ourselves as a city enough before her i stand by everything i say because it was told to me by june she did not lie and she will swear under oath if necessary i'll be darned if i'm going to have the judge hold the hearing you can be sure that this judge will probably never want to come to anyone's swearing in after this embarrassment i stand by what i said and council member swope how dare you conflate me telling you that you were subject to recall i did not say that for that i said you were subject to removal and the reason was was because you three times i asked you to stop you were debating a point of order it is against robert's rules i'm sorry if you still don't understand it but it's against the rules it is not debatable nor can you interrupt me while i'm talking i didn't interrupt you and i said it and i said it three times and the new policy we have thanks to fred reilly is that we give three warnings and then i stop and then we call a timeout and then we discuss removing that person that's what happened with paul moreno that's what happened with some people in the in this uh group sometimes in the audience we give we're going to give warnings you didn't stop had nothing to do with recall i said you were subject to recall for what you did to june van scoy getting along as a city removing your parks manager for retaliation she's gonna handle that don't you worry that's why i said you were subject to recall it was a totally different incident i'm restating what she's what june said to me i don't know i don't i'm going to call judge moore because i've been extremely busy and i've been away but when i have a chance i'm going to call her i'm going to give her the opportunity to speak with june and maybe that will refresh her recollection i don't believe june made this up and i would never say something that's not true in a council session and i would never say something that's not true against a judge mainly because it's unethical as a lawyer so this is what was passed on to me and i restated it and that's where it came from we heard it that night i believe if i'm not mistaken june said that jody shirley was a witness to this i'm not going to hold a hearing tonight that's not what the point of this is okay if it happened it was very unprofessional it doesn't subject you to any recall it just puts a black eye on our city it's not the first time that our city will have a black eye it won't be the last time i'm sure that's why i brought it up as for points of order and as for debate i listened to every word in your removal about june van scoy and you proceeded to cut me off and somebody else tried to call the question in the middle of my thing it's unappro it's inappropriate it's against the rules and quite frankly i'm not going to tolerate it i don't do it to you i had to listen i didn't say a word you don't call a point of order because you don't like what someone's saying if you break the rules or you personally attack a point of order is appropriate when you state what you believe to be a fact which is exactly what i said a point of order is not appropriate i was not personally attacking you i said that there was a lack of understanding of the sunshine law it's over with as far as i'm concerned i appear before judge moore and understand when you reach out to her you're interfering with my business so tread very carefully tread very carefully i'm a contract employee by the state of florida who appears before her you're interfering with a contractual relationship go ask your friends what that means so stop please let's not make this any worse and more worse than it has to be i believe uh if council member swope if you have anything else then i'm going to move on to glenn gunn i believe he's next glenn gunn yeah just to uh i've had some sidebar meetings with lynn reeves with regards to this beach ordinance thing and uh he's he's got some follow-on information that maybe well i don't think he alluded to it here the basic conclusion is obviously this thing is kind of tapering off a little bit obviously we had this big uh bonfire immediately after the covert thing kind of uh was relaxed and people started going to the beaches that's when this this whole uh shade ordinance thing came about uh the situation was aggravated but it seems to be tapering off and uh city manager reeves can probably expand on this a little bit there haven't been any uh enforcement actions on this thing recently right and uh we're still waiting to uh get some readout on this thing they there's there's some conversation going on between lynn reeves and members of their council about possibly uh relaxing the ordinance within the confines of our beach access is can you expand on that a little lynn to uh yeah that's that's that's what i would you know that's kind of where i'm focusing because in speaking to several of the residents their main concern was they were being told they they can't go here and can't go there so uh i did have that conversation with commissioner bloom and uh it was a good conversation and and i'm gonna have that conversation with the mayor uh also and uh my thought is try to talk to their uh commissioners individually and just get some feedback from them and you know it's kind of a two-way street to some degree you know so that's that's where we're at right now i've got one uh ahead glenn one last item here uh this meeting had so much promise here before we started down this this last uh uh thread uh yeah some of this stuff's going on is an embarrassment and i i i don't like being included in this we are an embarrassment to the city i would suggest that there are other avenues of dealing with this stuff but besides the uh the innuendo the finger pointing and stuff like that there are provisions for ethics within this state and dealing with some of this stuff and if you feel that strongly about some of this stuff rather than embroiling the entire council embroiling the entire city and the residents and everything else in this stuff take some action go to the city ethics people and make a report and let some outside individual come in and look into this situation but i'm just kind of getting tired of this uh round and round stuff so that's all i'm going to say on that thank you very much marv i can't come back to you we're we're we're in a we're in the the stuff do you have something quick we're this is not open discussion we're going through the individuals look ahead real fast all right the only thing i have to say is um lynn uh with 18th street comment you got from that gentleman that's go you're gonna just hold to the the list as to when it's gonna be repaired rather than move it around yeah you know if if i look at and i think all of you saw the picture if i look at the pictures and i go look take pictures of other streets at different times that's a minimalistic amount of water as opposed to uh 12th and 13th street when it's really bad uh so so i don't want you to take any action no no we we're gonna uh as part of the stormwater fee we have to take out a small loan for the validation and what my proposal was to do is go ahead and buy the check valves and if we can get those installed in a cost effective way that could alleviate part of that and then we'll do the project on the timeline that we've got scheduled we're on council comments so let's let's stick with it and let's wrap it up are you finished uh vice mayor okay here's a thumbs up okay so um i have the floor um i'm stunned that glenn gunn would suggest ethics wow wow we just jumped from the fire into the fire pan you want to go down that road bring it on every one of you will be subject to ethics charges and by the way those are taxable legal costs back to the person who makes the false ethics charge how do i know because jules chandler made an ethics complaint before the ink was dry on my certification jules chandler's rita swope's best friend you connect the dots okay i'm not going to play this game and i'm not going to ethics on anybody but if anybody goes on me rest assured i have something probably on everyone on council and maybe 10 things on some of you so don't go down that road and embarrass yourself or the city anymore please i'm asking you i haven't done it and i can and i can go with former council members but if you want to go down the road let's go now speaking of the road what some of you don't know is that protesters have now come to our beautiful city of bel air beach um we have a gentleman who's standing out on the corner of 6th street every morning 8 30 in the morning for up to two hours waving a sign that says support blue as in the police that's good we all support the police and we're getting about 100 to 200 cars honking their horns violating the city and state ordinance he's been asked to stop by code he refuses to stop our city ordinances are pretty much inadequate to do anything about him individually he wants to speak with the city attorney he's probably making a nuisance public nuisance in a private nuisance he's a doctor he's got three properties and his primary property isn't even in the city it's in indian rocks so i don't know what to do other than say it sounds like times square it's not funny it's not cute no one would tolerate it if it was in front of their house and we're gonna have to address this as a city too um unfortunately we our existing laws really doesn't stop someone from standing out with a sign and encouraging other people to respond and they're responding with honking of car horns you know it's not lost on me that directly across the street from where he's protesting his council uh council member or they don't call council member council commissioner um tolbert from bel air shore the same one who voted to keep the bel air beach people off the beach and not use umbrellas because he thinks that we don't know how to act properly so i submit to you that we're probably playing right into his hand okay it's disgusting it's unacceptable it's illegal he got a positive response when he called city hall um and so obviously this is something now that we're gonna have to spend legal money council time and everything else to address because our existing ordinances don't do it cities are entitled to make reasonable time place and manner restrictions on this stuff obviously we cannot have a city where people are going through honking their horns at all hours of the day disturbing the peace it's disgusting and add that to the fact that we can't use our beach it's more disgusting it's just the city quality of life and then you could add the speeders and then you could add the motorcyclists and then you get out all the other stuff we've been complaining about and little by little the city is slipping premier city huh okay let's try and be one so i bring it up to you fred reilly um i think we're gonna have to i've spoken to you briefly about this in the past i think it's going to have to get addressed it's not getting any better um we have to obviously you know work within the parameters of the first amendment but first amendment gives the city some rights people don't have to sit here and be tortured because this guy is getting response from every car that passes by on the road other than that i don't other than that oh mark beam go ahead i'll i'll call on you yeah go ahead uh with this incident down there that you noticed i haven't but isn't that road and some of that property under county jurisdiction versus bellar beach yes yeah he's on the sidewalk the sheriff doesn't want to enforce the law sheriff said we're not going to enforce this even though it's against state law and even though it's against our city code sheriff doesn't want to enforce it there's fred reilly i gave a case that actually was it wasn't a published case but it was a slip-up from pinellas county where another city did enforce the law and it was upheld that you can't beep so the individual himself isn't our law if you read it he's probably not violating anything but it's the response that he's getting and obviously people aren't just beeping horns for no reason they beep when he goes out they stop when he goes home so for an hour now and now you say oh it's an hour no it's not an hour it's an hour and a half it's two hours and you multiply it by seven days that's 14 15 hours a week of listening to car horns anybody who thinks that's acceptable i'd be more than happy to come outside your door and beat my horn for 15 hours and see what you think it's disgusting and it's being heard around the entire place some people don't want to complain i've had complaints by people they don't want to complain because well we've talked about how some things just don't get done so they don't want to stick their neck out so once again the mayor has to stick his neck out um code did try and talk to him the sheriff thanked him for his time thanked for support asked them that they told him he said you're not supporting us here you're just making our jobs tougher that was danny doherty our code officer but he's in full police uniform and they went right back the next day and did it so you know they're 78 years old i mean they're nice people and i'm sure they mean well but it's just disgusting and and i you know if this starts to go to other parts of the city or we bring it to other parts of the city um it's not going to be much of a very nice city to live in fred reilly yes i i you know i don't know where we go with this but i wanted to let council know again you and i have spoken about this but what do you mean do we you know we can't have this go on week after week and the police don't want to enforce the law so what do we do well if the guy wants to talk to me i'd be happy to talk to him and i will do my level best to try and defuse them and persuade them although it sounds like other people attempted to do that and that didn't get any traction so if you want to consider changing the code you can do that although because it's a first amendment it's a um you know there's parameters that are uh have to be considered about as you indicated reasonable time place and manner and you know it it's one of those things that's fought with problems i will clearly say that yeah it is fraught with problems and but so is the diminishing of property values if you have you know times square outside your door okay there's a two million dollar house that he's in front of and then he posts on the internet that oh the house is vacant i know that owner i'm going to be contacting him i want to let him know what his neighbor's doing okay letting him know that his house is vacant and that's that's just irresponsible so you know again i i don't know what the solution is i know reasonable time place of matter does not mean you can go on the same corner every day and do this the city manager said well you can't move it someplace else well that's exactly what's going to have to happen it's going to have to rotate so everybody gets a sample of this and maybe we can do something about it i mean you you this just can't you know you have a city ordinance and a state ordinance that the police refuse to enforce but yet you're going to tell a guy that is playing a radio too loud he can't do it well his radio is a lot softer than a car horn so you you can't selectively enforce i've been harping on this for a year and a half so i i i don't want to see us get into a lawsuit i don't want to see us getting problems but we need to do something other than let this guy trash three blocks of the city and i can't believe they're not hearing this at bellar shore they are so yeah just city council uh just to kind of give you a little more background on this danny did go talk to him uh unfortunately what danny told him to do was not really legal he told him to go down to first street and and realistically you know because of the i guess their constitutional rights uh he he can't tell them you can't do this unfortunately they called here at city hall and i said you know maybe you need to put a sign up that says please don't honk or something of that nature their signs just say support the blue and you know unfortunately people's theory of supporting the blue is to honk the horn which is is not a good thing either at uh they're usually out there about i'd say 7 30 8 o'clock in the morning about 8 30 in the morning yeah yeah so so uh you know that's a that's a discussion and you know we we've discussed the sign ordinance and people holding signs and that's their as i understand that they're right but you know maybe if we go back and talk to them i know that uh mrs purcell yes uh called and or supposedly you know that i heard this second hand i i didn't see it supposedly she put something on next door saying that city hall said we can't do this anymore and unfortunately she took what danny told her basically to move down the street to to another place which you know he shouldn't have told her that he should have told her not to you know like i said to her i said to her you know maybe you need a sign that says please don't honk you know we're not telling you you can't show your sign no no and the last thing the police want to do is start ticketing people that are trying to support them but by the same token as a citizen we can't tolerate this anymore right okay so what i'm going to say is this as a solution if council was okay with this i would like to speak with lynn and fred riley and maybe see if there's a way that you know i like fred they wanted to speak with you maybe you know you you're a great broker of peace maybe you can try i think they mean well i don't think they're out to hurt their neighbors they live here they live on 6th street i don't think they're trying to get everyone annoyed so i think they really mean well maybe we can do that i mean if they want to meet with the sheriff or one of the liaisons maybe we can get them connected with the right people so that they can really work to support the police in a productive way because beeping a horn on sixth street isn't getting any support to anybody you're just violating the law and i know they're not beeping it but they're causing it they're making it happen so i'll be happy to work with you on it because you know i i just it's it's becoming unbearable and i know the neighbors are going to get together here and you know what's coming next go ask bella shore tomorrow what's coming next i don't want to be doing this i don't want to be doing this okay i really would like them to just stop and they could hand out leaflets and brochures and go on websites and they could come and i'll do a resolution i'll put a resolution forward on council to support the police but you know but disturbing the peace of the neighborhood in any neighborhood for any cause any cause because this time it's the police next time it may be a cause that we all maybe not believing in so strongly so you know if you don't get to pick the cause okay and and i'm afraid you know these police protests sometimes invite counter protesters which also gets a potential of danger in the city so i'm looking out for the city above myself but it does affect me and it does affect the neighborhood and it affects the whole city if this continues because we that that thing can be moved any place we'll go hold the trump flag in front of somebody's house we'll see what happens you'll have horns all day long it's unacceptable that work for you later yeah yeah we'll we'll reach out to mrs uh thank you so much i don't have anything else other than to say there's an election on the 18th it's a primary election please everybody get everybody out go vote vote for the person of your choice and uh make your voices heard oh and if you have anything to go else to go on the agenda for the work session please get it to us by the 11th of august and one last reminder for anybody who might be listening if you haven't filled
