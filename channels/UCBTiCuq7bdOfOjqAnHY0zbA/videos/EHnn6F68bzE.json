    "transcript": "[Music] good evening everyone it is now 5 14 p.m on September 18th 2023 this is the city council work session for the city of Bellaire Beach please the United States of America to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all Katie would you please call the road council member Leslie Notaro here council member Lloyd Roberts president vice mayor Jody Shirley here mayor Dave Gaddis here city manager Kyle wifler here City attorney Randy Moore president and city council member Belinda Livingstone was unable to attend and council member Frank bankert is not present okay hopefully everyone will received the email at the items have changed a little bit so we're going to move right on to review stormwater Improvement project plans people he text him he's outside so if you want to jump up to the proposed ballot measures first two item number two that's quick okay do you think he's do you think he said he was right outside okay all right so item two uh this is discussion uh proposed measures and this is the only attended by city of man it's a City attorney for thank you Mr Mayor um in the past few months we've discussed proposed ballot measures and I want to start by beginning for the clarity in the record this is a work session you are not voting on anything you are not changing anything in your Charter tonight nor are you putting anything to the residence as of this evening we would do that by an ordinance and a resolution in the case of each one of the four ballot measures that you have raised in previous work session discussions and so what I presented to you this evening are four separate ordinances and resolutions companion to each and a fifth document that reflects what your Charter would look like were you to move forward with these and if all four were approved by the voters these would all be put to the voters but if they were to be approved this is how the the document that begins on page two of the packet materials and says pages one of three two of three and three of three is what the charter would look like if you accept it if you and the voters accepted the changes in the form in which I have proposed them so we can take them in succession as they've been written here and they would not be highlighted and in red text in the future again for purposes of a work session I just thought it easier to draw your eye to here's what's going on so the first one is uh specific to the term limits and what what I did there was change the language from two to three break up the Clause into independent clauses or sentences and so that's really the first one the first thing you discussed in the ballot language that's being proposed for that and by the way by Statute ballot language can't be more than 75 words so you're not working with a lot there it's plenty for what I'm trying to do here but the valid question that is to be clear that the intention is to be clear to the voters is shallow City amend the charter to prohibit council members from serving more than three consecutive terms as opposed to the existing limitation prohibiting a council member from serving more than two consecutive terms yes to amend the charter provision no to retain the existing Charter position provision and so that is the the proposed language and you'll see that that's um the resolution that follows the ordinance they don't have numbers yet because it's working documents but you can see that there so rather than take all four of them at once I find it's easiest to eat the health and bite at a time so with that as we talk about the first Charter Amendment that's proposed here it's the term limit one I wanted to see if there was any feedback concern about the way it's phrased how it works Etc Works be approved by the voters you're saying we have the bound language in here yes ma'am there's a resolution that is uh three pages long and uh that resolution follows I'm looking at a PDF I went from the digital side of it so the resolution is two pages on the second page it says Charter amendment number one referendum increasing limit on consecutive terms um and then it's right in the middle of that page there we go and I know I know it's a little distance there's two actually I have some positive comments to me I thought it was pretty amazing how you put all this together when we first started discussing this I just kind of went out on my own and was trying to logically in my own mind and on paper try to figure out how it would actually get through this and then when I read what you put together I just thought it was very very well done thank you I appreciate that and I I do understand because the packet materials aren't separately paginated I can't point you to page 42 or 41 but it is the first resolution in the series um yeah so the citizens would be voting on this one so all of you would be voting on all four but as to this one issue they would go there and when they went to The Ballot Box that's what they would see Charter amendment number one reference that's the title The title's Limited to ten words right um it's a referendum increasing limit on consecutive terms and so that's clear what's happening and then the language says we're increasing it from three to two yes or no and the yes or no element is a required element of a ballot it's clear so you know my request to you as we go through each of these four topics is one if you feel the battle language is confusing for some reason let me know and two if you feel hey yeah that's what I want to change but that's not how I want it changed in the charter let me know so we can address that that's really where the rubber meets the road here most of the stuff that surrounds it that's not yellow and highlighted um is the existing language so I'm not really looking for too much or required whereas Clauses and the like um but you know the really key thing is the how the charter is changing and the battle which as we as we go through each of these it makes perfect sense for me I'm looking above where it says charter number one special election shall be held on Tuesday March 19 2023. yep does it all be changed to 2024 thank you it's just thank you that's one of those uh copy things and that's why we do this so I was really focused so much on the other things I promise and that probably you'll see that globally through each so I will just I'll make a point to note that everybody okay with that section yes all right so the second one um is specifically the change from Seven members to five members and that appears in a few places in your in your Charter and as it presently reads it appears in section 2.01 where it says there shall be a council of seven and we're striking that to five in the election in terms presently I mean the dates are retroactive in in other things but I I've inserted language to say how it would be handled going forward and I'll explain that in a moment and then you are limited to a single subject when you do ballot measures but the the majority vote here is stated as an explicit number in your code AS five members of the seven well if we if we go down to seven and we retain five and then it's going to take a unanimous vote every time you do something or rather for a super majority sorry a super majority so it's just rather than have a hard number there I just changed it to a majority of the council is required for official votes and so that's why the ballot language reads two pages later on the on the resolution and again it does have that 2023 there but it does say Charter amendment number two reducing the city council to five members from Seven members shout the city council amend the charter to provide for city council composed of five at large council members including the mayor as opposed to the existing language providing for city council composed of seven at large city council members including the mayor and adjust the corresponding voting requirements for the council to take action so it captures everything that's happening so the one thing before before you throw to council mayor I do want to explain how this is is working um of the seven members we presently have are 6.5 as we transition with members Abel's seat each of your positions are coming up for election in 2024 and 2025. so what this says is beginning in 2025 so you'll be a council of seven if if this were approved by the voters you'd be a council of seven for obviously the remainder of 2023 and the whole of 2024 right in 2025 you have three seats coming up including the mayors so what instead of doing it that way what it does is it says or it might be four I'm trying to remember the math on it but I charted this three instead of we would just have the mayor's seat come up and one of those other vacancies come up and then that drops off the other two I'm at that point and then from there on it would just be normal cycles for everybody you know I I do have a question about that um and I guess the council and then obviously the citizens would have to make the ultimate decision but um it sounds like every term for every time someone uh is elected they would serve with the council for three years what have the same people for three years because depending depending on how it works in terms of if they Grant the extent because one of the other ballot measures is a four-year change well I had originally I was hoping that there would be some way to work to where our elections happened every two years and it sounds to me like that's not going to be the case now we can certainly make it the case I rolled it out so that you were were going to be right now you're on a 2024-2025 interval the way this does read you're right that it would go to four-year terms and so it would be you know the next ones would be 2028 and 2029 if we were wanting to do a rolling basis I can do that and that's part of why I wanted to have this discussion for me it was cleanest that way because you guys have at large Council seats that are both on this current thing on this current schedule the challenge for me in phrasing that as I looked at that as like okay well that is a long time for you know that council is because you're at large seats I couldn't say seat one will come up then in C2 or district one or District Two And so finagling that without your input was a little disconcert on my end I wanted to set up well I can keep their current intervals and depending on what the voters accept and reject obviously will inform what happens here but if you want and that's again why we're work stopping this if you want some kind of roll out that's different than that then I need that feedback so I can certainly your benefit is proposed is the cleanest just is that what we is that how we want to do it right one yeah you guys are the policy makers it's under one of the elections would not fall on a general presidential election happens or the mid country or one or the other I'm not right you'd have an official election is but one year we would have an expansive election one year we would have a inexpensable um I was under the impression we were trying to get on a four-year recycle that's correct presidential election I know it's going to take a couple of Elections to get to that cycle but that was my impression what I've been trying to achieve that's right and the way that it's written right now well I think it would happen in part enough partially yes if you got it on the presidential interval and you did that it would be to have the whole Council change over would have everybody align everybody's terms that's not what I'm saying no I know that's not what you're saying the midterms right so you have presidential race that would be uh midterm elections 2020 if we're going right now it'd be 2024 2026 until we're 28. right now you do have an odd year which is off cycle the problem we brought into is how how do you you have to short cycle or long cycle correct City Council Members to Mayor correct and that was I I certainly didn't want to be the one to proposed that without explicit Direction in that regard well and that's why I'm you know bringing this up is so that we can consider everything not just making it I don't want it to be easy if it's wrong but at the same time if if everybody's good with counsel not changing at all for three years and then you have two elections you know the the to the extent there's any communities that go this way the countervailing narrative is you have the opportunity to get a stride with one another and and work you know that longer overlapping tenure to extend you're looking forward why would we ever do it this one way that's the one conventional wisdom in that regard I'm not saying that's reason enough I'm not trying to persuade I'm just trying to give you all the information Detroit see if this makes sense so we know that we're going to have an election in March of 2024. correct that's again if we said in the language that Randy would do much better than I would that whoever those um three individuals are that are elected they would come up for re-election that they were still available to to run in November of 2028. which would be the general election the B-26 well not 26 because that's really quick because that's going to be I think the other group's going to fit into that cycle so again so if it's going to be a four-year term if it gets voted on if we vote divorce so so here's here's part of the challenge and I think part of the reason why I made the document that starts the materials is as you conceptualize one it's naturally leading you to the discussion of the other but that's like right now we're talking about the seven to five and and how do we cycle those seven to five if we do a three year or four years like well if I if I predicate this on the fact that all of these are going to be approved it's one result but I'm trying to write them with an understanding that one one or all of them may not pass and if that is the case what result do you you don't want to write one that is holy or you could write one that is wholly contingent on the other if that's your intention and say this measure shall not take effect unless the other one's also improved but that also was not the the approach here and so they are presently interrelated in a way that makes it difficult to discuss them in a vacuum but the way they are drafted for purposes of clarity ease and avoiding issues on the back end as they are drafted in a vacuum in a way but as you see harmonize ultimately in that single document but that way if one were to fail for example if I change seven to five and assume that the voters are going to approve four-year terms and then they don't and I've made my whole schedule based on four-year terms then in the charter then it doesn't make any sense really after it's been adopted and now we're having a charter amendment to fix a boo-boo of some sort um and so I wanted to make sure to avoid that kind of confusion it's almost it's almost like a big manner you'll run two of them together I mean you can do single subject you can make one of them contingent on the effect this shall only take effect if battle measure seven shall only take effective ballot measure six passes right you can do that um the challenge the only challenge I see there is if you're going to do that understand that if six falls out it's like oh we really did want a five-member council but we made a contingent on four-year terms for example well then you get your five-member Council you lose your but then you end up with neither if you make them contingent on each other so I would just clarify that when you're using can in that sentence I'm saying you you have the capacity to we do you have the capacity to whether or not you should is a different question I think the goal is to get this to find member Council number one you hungry I would I would say so yes absolutely and then the other amendments are better ballot items are secondary oh maybe to you but I think that I mean they're important equally it's important but I don't I think the number one number one is and we can also look at when we get to the fourth item of of when your election cycle is that would probably be the best place to address that if we want if there is a way to address it it might be best there because that language is presently just a basically copy and paste from federal law on what your election schedule will be so we can we can tweak that a little bit but if you're really saying I want the seven to five to be clean and just its own thing then I think I have my if that is your consensus and I'm not saying it is if it is your consensus I think we can move to the third one and then maybe see if coming at this in the third or fourth might not make more sense once we see that language okay thank you so the next um one in your packet three of four is the um is for the terms four-year terms and so that comes up again in a few places it's the you know the mayor's elected for a three-year term has its own language of course the election terms language and then the schedule and notice of Elections language and so um you can see the language there highlighted in yellow I I won't read it to you and with all the strikethroughs and underlines the ballot language that corresponds to that says shall the city amend the charter to provide that each individual term of office for City Council Members including the mayor shall be for four years as opposed to the existing three-year term beginning with the officials elected in 2024. so how that would work on Election night if you're running you know we have our qualifying period in December for whoever qualifies for those March 2024 seats they would depending on the results of that election and referendum they'd either be serving a three year or four year term they won't know until we know the results of that referendum though but that would make that change go into effect sooner than leading um the other way to do it was to to put it off to the 2025 cycle but um again based on the tension and expedience this Council sort of communicated on this issue I didn't think you wanted rolling it out a full two you know 2025 term but if you do we can change that I want to be very clear if you're like 20 24 is too soon I don't like the unpredictability let me know I was I wrestled with a lot of this so I want to make sure that it captures what you want my uh my goal for this was to keep good council members anymore to give each council member the opportunity to do more within the city and also with the communities around and the county because the longer Iran the better relationship and establish which was various entities but also it wasn't just for that it was so we could line up with the presidential and midterm elections and you can't do it without without having for you so I know that during the generally we don't have great turnout in our we did last time but that's not always the case often it's very low turnout but I think that if our elections wind up on the same ballot of the presidential election and the donations we're going to have an astronomical turnout compared to what we've always had in the past so that's why that was my goal was to make sure that we had the most voters and we had big candidates that will stick it out an extra year and council members as you're looking at these things I do want to note and I think it was a function of a file saving over another right before transmission but the whereas Clauses for the ordinance on increasing from three to four years are the ones from the five to seven member who of course fixed that not important for you folks right now but just letting you know I I see that I've made that note and I would fix those whereas Clauses to make sure they're they all correlate to the actual ordinance foreign let me ask you this if we we have these four items well let's go ahead and talk about this one first would anyone like to comment on the other number three I'm just trying to run through my head our next election cycle and days yeah so let me um I mean our next election is March 19 2024 I which is when the these will hit the ballot correct these will be on the March 19 ballot everyone were you to approve these by ordinance presuming you did these would all be on that schedule um I'm looking for there's an email that I that I put together um in sending some of this material to City staff that I do want to reference real quick I think will help clarify some of this so am I mistaken in saying that this election this terms cannot take effect in 2024 of the election is in March right you'd be voting for somebody the way it's written you'd be voting for them that night so they could validly run for the vacancy the vacancy is there it's just how long would their term be would not be known when they when they qualified which is that if done this way um it's not cleanest but again it was you could wait till the 2025 cycle alternatively not if we tell people upfront yeah if you get elected in the March 29 [Music] you might have a three-year term or you might have a four-year term correct depending on whether this Charter Amendment classes and to be clear the seats that are coming up in 2024 are remembered Notaro member banker and member of Livingston's livingstones seats and then we would also have members able seat but they would be assuming a midterm see they wouldn't they would not be subject to that because the term for members able seat is not up until 2025. you're right I think what I see is that make sure I've got this right okay so unless someone before they just said they just sit for them okay you appointed and they said please strike what I said about day one sorry I've got a few communities in my head I don't want to mislead there but at least you have you would have three on the 2024 notaros bankers and livingstones are up on the 2024 election okay so if the three or four failed because uh until March of 2027. if it passed and we were trying to align with the next one with the if we align at all it'd all be even years on November so we got 24 26 28 13 32. it would be slightly more empty almost four and a half years for that time if we align them with the presidential correct if if those terms correct if that all if that other ballot measure passes on the realigning the schedule they would get a slightly longer term slightly longer term all right then the question is is what would we do on the next election if we line everything up how do we do the transition with the people that were elected whenever I think we have a couple options I think so I understand exactly what Dave is asking so that election would come up on March 25 normally now if we're changing this to try to get on the midterm and the general election which I think is huge I think and I really think that's going to pass I hope so then we could say those people that would normally have been elected on March of 25 now we're going to wait until 11 of 26 correct and then after that we would have everybody on the midterm in general from that point on Randy then that extends their original election term does yes can you do that yeah yes I believe we could do that we want to make clear what we're doing we could put that language in the best solution I can say if this passes this is what we're going to do so I want to make sure that I'm conceptualizing this now too that's that's described if you will so what you're proposing member Roberts is here's what the challenge is there and that I'm trying to harmonize you're sort of marrying the November election um referendum item with the terms of office correct one and I'm trying to write them in a way where they're not contingent on one another and so if we said any official elected in that seems to me like it would be better addressed in the presidential in the in the transition to the November language if I'm understanding it right I'm just trying to think through how to help us to do it mechanically um is say we're going to change I think if you're going to have an ordinance if you're going to have a budget measure I mean sorry a ballot measure that changes the election cycle then we could say after the language about moving in any official explain what happens there I think it would be better to explain it there than in this one right in the details of the resolution but as far as what appears on the ballot with that you wouldn't have to give details you can just say we're increasing from three to four right I I would say that I might depending on how much language I have how many words I have to work with I'm I might add more detail if I can but I don't know that it's absolutely critical um to say and you don't explain the whole process because you can't 75 words but you might say and marginally extending the time term or something like that if there's um but as it relates to the one we're on right now I have a question right and I'm just I don't know just thinking we have a primary election what year was that fall in 2024 I'm just trying to think this through not everything happens in November and that's why we that's why I think our city has these orange elections too because we do have the presidential primary right that's the primary that's not good of [Music] one election we have in March and another one we have is November so everything would be balanced I don't know why we didn't do this whenever we started this at the beginning right but this is what we're having to work on I knew it would be easy but I don't see any other way to do this and I would tell you that you know in as much as you're trying to conceptualize this the document that started the materials on these different referenda the three-page document that shows the chart that was as much for my benefit as it was for yours right if I do all this does it all actually make sense once you clean it up and you remove all the strikethroughs does this all work it presently works it can work another way and that's why I want to make sure that you know we're conceptualizing in in context now we I think we could go by by shortening that daily we talked about so normally the second group would come up March of 25. 0 he said that so we could actually have that election instead of waiting to November of 26th we could have it of November of 24. which was short needed by seven months um shortening that term normally we become a production of March of 25 we could put language in there that said well instead of adding seven months we're going to subtract seven months from the current term but well I don't think it's just about involving him I mean for sure but I think the other concern there is you know abridging those terms I don't think solves the problems that of what you guys have been well it hits us on the every two years it gets you much closer that much sooner for sure that is one way to get the rest I mean you can do it anytime I was just trying to get the most whatever right biggest turnout we get here and um and it's feasible to add right take it away from the city right that's why I just compose it both ways I agree we'll look at it this way also if you you're wanting to run and then you realize if you run you're going to have a short term for the first one then you got to do it all over again that's probably gonna convince you not to do it no I think what member Roberts is proposing is that in in its heart because again we've got to talk about them in in a vacuum in a vacuum in 2025 remember goddess remember Shirley member Roberts and members Able's ordinary terms and and so what remember Roberts was saying was well alternatively we can make budget language that states that those four terms would instead of end in March 2025 your turn all four of you would end in November 2024. and so and get you on cycle sooner shortening the term of people sitting at the table present that's what I think member Roberts was discussing about the other option would be November 26th well hold on though if you did that what where do you place the other half of the council where where is there because then you're all in the city yeah so therefore by definition November of 26th to make the most that first we know that going into it I think that first set of Elections is going to be unusual for Life yeah well yeah so I think we answered that question that we don't want everybody on the same exact cycle now so it would have to be November of 26th by adding seven months to the existing terms also have uh they're the ones that got elected Israel yes of 28. they would go to November of 28th yes exactly does that make sense Randy I think I think distill it for me one more time I'm sorry we can I apologize so so basically if the four year term passes and the aligned with the general and interim elections passes of existing sorry March 19th whoever is elected at that time they would their term would go March 24th now they would go four and president four and a half months to November of 2020. correct okay the next group of people that would be up for election currently they would be slated to uh to either Exit or run again in March of 2025. correct correct foreign because then they would be November and so for the seated the seated person may or Mayoral race would actually happen during the midterm elections and the and the the other council members would be on the presidential elections yes I follow that yeah now my question to you is if the four-year term fails but you move the elections to November I agree with you and that's my question is if if you do it the voters are going to be voting on each one of these things separately right now we can make one contingent on the other but right now none of them are contingent on one another so we can say that this ordinance shall only take effect if I would say that this is just my opinion the council please speak I would say that if the three or four does not pass then leave the election cycle alone yes yes is that the last one resolution correct okay you're going to have one election that's gangbusters yeah and a big turnout then you're going to have another one that has almost nothing I want to make sure I understand just so so should that be reciprocal or only the presidential what I would call the presidential election resolution should only or or should moving the election should only happen if we increase terms from three to four correct term years term years sorry term years from three to four if however the it's the other way around it doesn't matter I guess what would happen is that let's just say we're we're doing the three-year Cycles we've got one election then you've got another election two years off all right all right then we start with the cycle starts all over again well the way the presidential elections fall mid-term elections well you would have one election let's just pick all the mayor's race you're going to have a huge turnout one cycle and then the next time that comes around it's going to be an off cider and you're going to have no turnout and so in fact you never know what you're going to get okay um so I'll definitely need to work um as I'm as I'm understanding it we would keep all the language as it reads in the in the proposed Charter amendments but just change the contingency element and oh and Andy would have to change the the in the um in the four-year term one we would we would explain the realignment I will admit your romantic was way easier but it doesn't it it's it's not the direction but I I totally get that and that's why I said I was like I didn't want to make it more convoluted and say like it was a really easy way to do this um and so I unders I understand the competing ease versus desired outcome one thing I can say is this council is never just said let's take an easy route agreed I think I have my direction as far as all four of these um sufficient to bring you ordinances on first reading next month which would be in a couple weeks so first reading would be then we would only do the ordinances not the resolutions for the ballot language and then if those ordinances pass in this in the November meeting we would do the resolution you know contingent on the ordinance having passed and then and then it will still then be put to the voters in whatever form the ordinances and resolutions be so you none of this is being you know done by Fiat is will the you know we'll do the voters agree on you know because absolutely and just to go on forever I I am aware there's made some based information out there um the people should be able to decide what they want to do and that's exactly what we're trying to learn is what you would like to do or would you like to not change it all so that's that's as far as this Council goes the rest of it is our citizens all right before we move on to the next agenda item foreign [Music] understand anything foreign [Applause] thank you Mr Mayor um this item admittedly has lingered a little in the background but you'll remember in the spring the city was contacted by an advocacy group that expressed some concerns about your existing ordinances governing public Gatherings and permitting related there too we've had some back and forth I had a work session presented to you a fairly robust ordinance as an attempt to harmonize our code with their concerns they provided a different draft and then after that we exchanged wraps I've been working collaboratively with this advocacy group to arrive at something that meets both parties needs and so in large part the ordinance you have before you is very much their draft I've made some limited changes many of which are reflected in red text and they're in red text because I was sending it to them to say hey I've pretty much used what you gave but I made some changes on it by the way if you're seeing a blank page four of eight that's more just because there was a page break in there and when you add track changes all the pagination gets messed up so it's not skipping anything you'll see it goes right from D to e and that that is deliberate you're not missing a bunch of text um and that's in the handout right in front of you at your desk so what this does is it it establishes a policy with several hat tips if you will or acknowledgments to some of the Constitutional concerns that have been addressed before what the Reason by the way that you have this handout in front of you following the materials last week around Monday or Tuesday I had sent them here's my version with all your edits with all my edits and on on Thursday after the materials have gone out they followed up and said here's my comments addressing your comments and so that's what you have before use in exchange it's a public record but in exchange between myself and their Council and hey here are some thoughts for example in their draft it just said you know we won't require insurance if it violates the 14th Amendment I said well how does that help a city manager who's gonna have to call their attorney every time they need to know whether or not to do that so they proposed some edits to address some of my concerns looking at this from the city's operations generally speaking I am I am good with most of this commentary I want to I might Wordsmith a thing or two here or there but what you see before you I think is a draft that sufficiently addresses the concerns of the advocacy group while harmonizing it with constitutional law and the issue and you know the the ability to administer it I know Kyle's in the midst of this here and as much as I've shared it with him he's not vocalized yet any any concerns on how would I do this Randy I try to look at when I draft ordinances look at it with an eye towards the administrator who's going to be the poor sabot task with administering it and and so I wanted to make sure that Patty and the language especially clear in that regard but if you have any concerns I know in the past the ordinance I provided was much longer we've we've certainly Abridged it while still addressing almost all of the same topics and you sent them uh you you sent the last correspondence is that correct um no I'd send something Monday Tuesday which was the Stratford red and then on Thursday or Friday either Thursday afternoon or Friday morning I can't remember right now they sent this draft that you had in front of you the blue where it says anywhere where you say a t2r that's their personnel making comments the red where it says rm1 Randy Mora that's me making comments so you'll see the blue always follows the red or or adjoins it to address the concern I raised I apologize it's confusing I apologize about that just want to make sure you have the full complement of information as the council nation of Philadelphia I've found catering to Rogue people from Philly serves me well generally member Banker [Laughter] I I I don't think the Rogue um I I without endorsing your characterization I think that our ordinance as it existed was a problem but we never enforce it I believe we never asked for a permit are you you're absolutely right that we didn't have the the enforcement mechanism but all the same it identified an issue in our books and I would not want to set Kyle up for failure in the position of saying hey we've never administered it so just leave it on the books and ignore it because they were going to test it and if not then somebody else would inadvertently test it when they go to follow its its terms and so it needed to be updated candidly I've looked I in in updating it I looked at a survey of communities in larger communities where this has been done more recently and you're seeing a version of this in part to avoid whether it's Fire or the ACLU or just some general challenge the other you know in Florida we have the added benefit if you will in this landscape of there are criminal laws that address some of what had been raised in our language about blocking the streets and that so we could look to to state law if we really needed that but I think this is an opportunity would I have written this exactly this way no I agree with you I am collaborating I wouldn't say as much as catering it was an opportunity to reach a better product and quell any future challenge because and I said that to them there was some language they gave me I said so you're telling me written that way you'd be totally fine if we did this and said no it's okay that's your language so maybe we should have that discussion now instead of have a lawsuit later my job is equal parts risk manager and if I can find a way to mitigate your risk I'll do it I appreciate that it's just I know the organization up there I don't think we haven't watched you to do anything but I don't like I said Lynn never required anybody for the Department of my knowledge and that was our response to them you know when this first came up I will tell you I remember it because I was traveling with my son when I was like Hey we're going to be there Saturday with nine people and I was like nobody has said no um we have actually never never done this and so can we make this an opportunity to reach a better product rather than make a point and I to their credit as an organization they said yes let's have that dialogue because they could have been much more you know cantankerous and confrontational they chose not to be they said okay we'll work with you if you'll work with us I think that's uh reflective of how the city does business and I tried to carry that forward and how we've reached this product think that that's not what they were expecting I know that they were expecting us to say get out yeah they expected the standard you don't fight City Hall this is City Hall's code so you know get lost since that's not you know that it's not a fight with having because in its existing form it was already a problem had we been in a different posture you know with better language I would have said you know sure it's not perfect but we've never done it that way on its face it was going you could still get a vagueness challenge or some other thing and we would either have to see the litigation or fight it and lose I I don't work with him in a compromise the situation here yeah I I understand philosophically you might not be aligned with them and I respect that as well okay all right any comments anybody satisfied with what this is good thank you I'm good at the risk of putting you on the stockpile was there anything that I know we can still continue the discussion but before we bring up the first reading anything that was a challenge from the city side of things other than those things that we flagged okay how did this Australia comes up or anything right if anything I look at this is uh it's a good exercise between two seasons returns well you know the one thing I will tell you and you know I had the benefit of sitting through in Indian Rock speech last week they brought Scott Dudley from the Florida League of cities to do a presentation on local voices United which is the lobbying and advocacy and sort of the home rule hero side of FLC advocacy and it's worth noting here especially let me say this has never been an issue in our community but the face of our communities the faces of our communities are changing drastically in some in ways that we can't control or have less control like our short-term rentals home-based businesses and some of those other changes may have Downstream effects that we don't have the ability to anticipate now that the way people are using their homes might lead to more Gatherings might lead to more advocacy you know if I decide to make my home the you know Florida advocacy headquarters I can do that and if Florida advocacy whatever that means decides to host a local event maybe that ends up flowing into this and so you know as we look at our the landscape of our communities changing it's worth saying yeah this hasn't been an issue but do we have the ability to get ahead of an issue instead of always being reactive any other comments right well why don't we go back to item number one project plans okay thank you well since our last meeting we've gotten some survey again and some updates to the plans here 's something funny okay the on the planet we're called what circuits yeah tonight welcome and um so it works uh we did last time we had uh Navajo our survey was complete last we met and the plants since then we've gotten our survey it's treated and we have our plans updated based upon that survey so that's what you have from Carnegie tonight and plus taking into account the comments and questions from her last meeting so these Incorporated those comments to the clients and I think the changes uh on that is we are still waiting on some more videos and so that's in progress and what well also be looking at in some of the documents that we'll have the comments on the conditions of the time so you have a report from us of what what we've seen in the video and where we see the improvements which is what the plans reflect what we've seen came from the video the little update those I am space upon the community University what do you think those videos hoping to have them complete this week it was the first week that we got the tide cycle ride so um okay uh so uh the questions uh one of the questions was hey talk about that about the thing using possibly on the news on Gulf Boulevard and I've talked with the county and looking at what we can use on the back of that finances and what the pavement mix that reviews on both global war is a high SP 12.5 and that's uh that's a DOT mixture and uh our plans is that we have on today we're using that same mixture so we can use that the difference would be the thickness of the pigment instead of the of course the boulevard is much thicker we're proposing to use a uh one hand and also in the table the thing is you'll see the arterial that's developed Boulevard and then there's three other roadways that the counties great things when they build a project what what they live for in their wigs and roadway section and the for the county specs on a residential light the difference between what what we have out existing versus that but the county is today's standard is is they recommend an inch and a half of asphalt where we're replacing the one Edge so that's that's the biggest difference so you're going to go down an inch and a half where you just go down an inch we're keeping with the existing pavement Fitness which is one Edge okay but are you going to build it down to an inch and a half or we're gonna we're gonna melt down the inch which would be run on the top of the lineup yeah and then repave the one inch rack I I don't follow you it sounds like you said we were moving to an inch and a half but then you're saying you're putting inches I'm sorry and then what I wanted to illustrate was the county standard for a light residential roadway is an inch and a half okay what we have is one inch exists and and we're replacing the one Edge primarily because going to the inch and a half at one half inch difference it costs some extra work particularly on the pavement to raise it up a half inch so do you you can add and lower booty raise the base agent it just adds in a lot more difficult than getting all that much I see okay so did you say that the what you're going to expect for the contractors is in fact the same grade as the county used on Gulf Boulevard yes okay and just another quick question from Kyle when we did 12th and 13th we used we used a different grade which is fine I just wanted to if that's the case [Music] um let me ask you something if we had we not had this discussion which grade would you have I had that at 12.5 okay so you had that way all along it's probably the same because it's coming out of the same plan all right please continue okay the resurfacing [Music] we added uh more detail based upon the survey we got back in and the biggest change is going to be on the 22nd the thank you on sheep c14 . you got somebody at home you can't see the plants so foreign on your mouse yeah I think I'm gonna track pad s okay well like you said jumping ahead some of the big changes that we may never plan since last time we added in more detail on the 22nd Street which is at that intersection we're replacing the currents of each of the four corners The Venture that they're turning in all the disrespective on the 22nd and there's an existing pipe with the inlet that's clogged and which goes down to the uh Illustrated South and that'll be cleaned out so that that intersection will be able to drain much better than what it is now Council comments cancel any comments I I would like to just go back to the paving and not this is just a comment for residents I guess I understand that we can't change the thickness of this asphalt or the thickness of the Lime Rock due to the fact that we've got value firms and driveways employed so you can't phrase Elevate the existing and road to elevation while we have because of all the other improvements around me and I know that was a question I was brought up can we add to the thickness of this and no one clearly stated that earlier so we just want to make sure we're not on record that that's why you told us not to increase the thickness of the asphalt yeah and I think the really is the main question last time the fingers may have come up and it was actually like that's that's my understanding here you know when we did that and worked out and made sure that we were using that mix I do have a question with this intersection of facial in 22nd you say that that Inlet the water of travel South to then another Inlet in the curb there what is that where does that exit I don't know if there's a park or is that purse on the jar but it connects up to that Inland and those supplies and then once they shoot to the intercostal because on the proper line it's not an amusement personal job there's no reason okay really strong thanks really actually yeah yeah the the actual drain out to the intercoastal we don't have that on the plan okay uh just space wise just for my own knowledge where is it obviously it's is it just going straight through the yard it's an extension of the pipe yeah yes I think uh figure oh all right I uh I do have a figure that kind of shows that overall where it goes up just like I can go ahead and finish with the plans I don't think I don't think it's that important I just had to think about what I was looking at here I can get that to Kyle that graphic that shows that and then we can send that out to tuition accounts yes and it's a straight line to the right out to the water all right what's next okay the let me see the the biggest changes there we uh we did it in inventory of the Inland City edition of the inlet tops what she am I looking at uh my my hand must be here said yep there it is DM we also have a what I wanted to show you we did an inventory of the inlets in the Inland toxin condition and we took photos of them and we placed it on a GS mat but we're with I guess it's we're not hooked up to where the people were looking watching it could see that so I can get that document out to the city that I can get out of Depends all right thank you okay and I think uh as far as the plans go and making the comments and another thing to the survey uh the conditions of the cause we have from our estimate we got seven tops that were completely replacing the rest of them look in good condition and the the pipes where we had the video there's locations where we need to slip on which we noted on the planets and then once we get the new video of the magnet Empire would have an idea of where we need to replace or slip line or what other improvements Chelsea questions or comments so when do we expect the bid documents debate documents the bid documents I've got the uh uh the master from the state manager so we're filling in our information so we can have the bid confidence in a couple of weeks okay great all right well this on the page you got pulled up you said uh biggest changes so you discussed 22nd and you're looking at all 21st is that just where you land that's just where I landed okay the the biggest change is were on on 22nd adding that information and and I believe from what we discussed last time was 9th Street and the question came about a underground Vault or the possibility of using an underground well we're still looking at definitely kind of seeing how how we can do that and uh the biggest challenge that we have is that in ninth organelles are and that is underground utilities we've got Cemetery sewer line we've got the water line and uh and then of course those inlets what sort of uh underground retention bulk uh can you put in there and designing these things I've been doing these things for a long time I've captured the volume that needs to be separated from the water table water you don't have all the capacity that you would need and uh so how do you how do you feel that as a separate containment uh Underground under the pavement you've got to worry about wheel Logans and trucks coming down and the big trucks so whatever we put if we put it underneath pavement it's going to be able to have the look that she's called age 20. that is a DOT standard and we use that standard as well counting Municipal of low brains so we got to make sure it covers that now if it's all through and not in the roadway proper ly and it doesn't have that need to be that heavy duty but we're limited to what we can do between the edge of the road and the property and what can we put in there that's going to go into work and that makes it a very challenging option for us to look at one of the you know I'm looking at is like a what level of a police police legislation what if we had a reservoir or location say a pump inside one of the Netherlands and just like in a place to learn what what though we have a sensor so when it gets up high enough that it'll turn on and start pumping water out we could take it out to decree and none to uh yeah to connect Cinema that that fits it out and we do have a one of those check valves so it's not flowing back on us at least very easily that way and so I'm thinking that maybe in the times of high water instead of an underground bulk something that can pop the water out and get it out both of you know into the ditching out because we're looking at wanting to get the water out when it's high and how fast as long as it goes down and comes down in a reasonable time that would be more advantageous than that it's sitting there letting evaporation take care of so that's that's the next thought that came in so I'm going to explore that a bit more of what the possibility is and the challenge we have right now we can probably speak on this better than I can but basically the water is high enough to keep check valve closed water is already christed over the sea wall it's now in the water starts receding and there's nowhere for the water that's in to go so you're at the mercy of the check valve opening back up before anything leaves exactly the mercy of time yes yes so that that's why I was thinking of it upon that so the waters were already receding below the sea walls but all of those neighborhoods back in this area right here were underwater they they were flooded several hours longer than they should have been and that's the water that's trapped in correct and that's that's what I was thinking of this wet well yeah it's an Airy regular floating tile because I know all of my screen it was it wasn't flooded over um Harbor you know close um and it was flooded in about halfway into the grass down yeah because when the water came over the sea wall it just came down the street like ridiculous but um I talked to a company called TMI that supplies pumps okay but anyway they suggested like a six inch pump on about 1500 gallons per minute around an eight inch app yeah but now we're talking with a diesel backup I don't know where you would store it for Aesthetics although we we have a pump station for sure again at 7th Street yeah we don't we didn't have any use for memories that wouldn't have to break the pumps in you know they called now back trucks trucks yeah okay we didn't have any of that it was at Pump Station went down which it worked in that order to briefing in the street out here so it was going right into the sewer system put a pump a six inch pump and a diesel generator which would require me this is going to cost around 45 000. now we have a trigger space that you said would go on it certain right how much how much help would that get in after the war went down the Sea World when it's coming over the sea wall nothing's going to help you replace it well you could place it already had the pump it up with a sea wall but you could uh place it in a one of the drain bits could actually funnel equipment you can still have this outer Union that you have to sit up what flood stage I guess right as long as the the storm is pushing the water and Coastal of over sea level right and that only lasted about I didn't receive equipment about Good hours we had ordered but then yeah the National Guard came down the streets here at around five o'clock four o'clock it's the first time they could get a big truck down the street and FEMA just came out yesterday is there a way with those check valves to have some release or something some release mechanisms they're still closed right that's what I'm saying so yeah well it's already there right so I'm like at least as it starts to recede it's not going to have this constant pressure when this check valves close like he said it's keeping water from coming in but it's not letting the water go out either until it matches [Music] percentage how did how did the streets the intersection uh hibiscus and uh Ohio they were all underwater for a long time it was all about the back flow at the time it had nothing to do with a rainfall it was awesome no we didn't have much green it was just research and I think you told me it was only applied for the surge or something like that I got four and a half feet elevation of above sea level which is really important it was anywhere there was a check panel and the water was able to come in some from once that water was in it was trapped until it came out over again and these chick founds leaked too so they're not exactly 100 percent water time right yeah yeah they think slowly but at that point the whole water table is coming up yes so then I think that that's that's another discussion as far as pumping goes because that's not necessarily something that we would have to I don't believe it would be part of your project a pumping system so as you can hear anywhere around just Ninth Street it was the was it ninth it was the biggest issue Frank or is it um started to receive and and you actually have the sea walls about a foot higher than a regular the sea walls yeah they're up about four is that because of county code or if you just did that it's a minimum of one foot cap okay and the other was people were I know it's emerging people residents with the museum I mean that because you go in the front and you're existing an elevator a little bit police communication all right the on the uh like you say the underground Vault and the storage and uh some of the other uh issues we've got some examples of some of the curtains and curves particularly the ones that are particularly High as well is some companies that manufacture these kind of Steel curves that maybe we can insert here so and it kind of it will help any of the height or the problem of having a small animals and kids find themselves in it and in particularly some of those that we saw there's there's quite a bit of difference we in our input of eventually we took the nations of all of those and in the conditions along with the photos so you'll be able to see that so we'll get that document we're talking about the drains yeah drains okay and I think I think as far as that we updated our costs and I check in in ground numbers the the total budget based upon Motors adding to changing still around uh just over 4.1 million in front of me but we're pretty close to where we were just refine the numbers there uh any any more questions questions comments yes sir so I understand this correctly we're not going to replace it any pipes unless the power service without falling through our videos correct and mostly we're going to be doing is just making these words repainting the roads fixing some of the inlet talks replacing some inlets where where they need to be uh the uh as we get the video we'll see what repairs need to be made and we'll look at what what's necessary to the slip line it do we repair the magic there's a hole in the fight that we need to to fix it we'll specify that and uh as far as the new pipe there's a couple of places where we're replacing the pipe entirely but it's not very much probably two or three places [Music] I have a question did you um we probably covered this last time because I don't know if we had a resolution on it the steel pipe it was bent yes the solution on that we're going to replace them okay okay and you're going to put a sort of a box yes and and that I wanted discussions we've had in the problem that we have in a lot of places is right away you know we would have to access it from the water from the from the bark and in that section that were spent those who use the HTTP the plastic pipe so we can do it with manual whatever instead of equipment with concrete or Steel so we can do that we can do that in front of the water what's the lifespan of a pipe like that using the corrugated plastic pipe 20 30 years it's comparable to the to the CMP pipe and concrete is there anything with a longer life for 30 years 23 years well concrete's got the longest life so why would we use concrete because we don't want to have to put them out there or well the the hurricane that use a concrete weight right and getting the equipment to there and replacing it versus big stretches in a backyard so if we can use material that has a long life like that the court corrugated plastic I call it plastic laces it's a more dense material and it's been used even the dot is used in this material so this is easier to replace it may not have quite the lifespan of concrete but if it starts failing in 30 years it's not that hard makes it a classic neoprene plastic lure the it's a hard plastic and I'm not going to get you the special now but it's uh it's been used and the dot is aligned the use of that material for their ability projects just because as long as it's not compromised it should last forever I mean that's correct thank you okay any final comments or questions I just wanted to add that the plans are pretty detailed the details every pipe and what's being done to it so if you have any questions I would say to do every page I appreciate you coming out thank you for giving us this presentation I look forward to seeing those videos yes that that's correct okay all right well thank you for your time and I look forward to the next presentation okay thank you thank you Larry [Applause] all right now we are up to item number four discussion of action summary this is placed on the agenda by city managers thank you mayor so this is uh just a real quick workup of sort of what we've talked about who are reviewing the Strategic plan and we thought that if we put a quick kind of news release of what occurred during a meeting you know out pretty much the next day to get something out there and pull them till that they have the facts of you know how things turn out after reading and um this is kind of something that we came up with some other cities have done and you know it kind of just covers you know what what it was you know consider audience what the basic concept of that ordinance what it accomplished and then what you know if it passed and you know what the photo was oh I just wanted one this value and see if you had any additional information you think would be helpful to include but this is just kind of a mock-up of what we thought if I went on the website you would ideola you know you know what I'm saying like or Warriors 2305 take me away today a second right now we weren't planning on doing that we have to hyperlink everything that's what I'm saying yeah so it you would have the agenda so if you wanted to refer I mean we could always put a no um or link it back to the agenda um because we try to come up with something that we could do like the next day in the morning and be able to pop it up so now and then you know obviously if you wanted more detail on what happened in the meeting Municipal which are usually like a week if that so you would have the way that we have it now this will just be another item yeah action summary I like it because [Music] I looked at them I didn't know what it meant like I didn't I think we stole it from another city called everyone yeah I just looked at it I don't really know what that means so well these would be I mean yeah everything we took action on yeah that makes sense and then what would you do in a meeting like tonight where we're not voting on anything and we're we're having a general discussion are we taking action on anything or are we just [Music] do we need anything else I like that the Action Arms too because it's straightforward um sometimes if you try to interpret a discussion and you know it could be a misconstructor one way or something here in a different way so I'll tell you what would be helpful would be uh to have a link in here like Mr Baker said it would take you to where you intended to place the means whenever they are whenever no pressure you can do the next day okay I know it would be ideal to click on each one and that would be a lot of work no no no no I'm just saying I'm just saying this is the link to where the minutes will be oh yes yes or whatever at the bottom to say minutes now available like yeah whatever or maybe whenever you first post this you don't have anything but whenever the minutes are finally added then you I can come back and Amanda lean to the page uh probably not a bad idea that whenever this judgment it appears on my home page and not buried yes and I knew uh admin assistant Jennifer Walsh um she's pretty Savvy with some things and as she gets more in the swing of things she might be able to add you know some of her responses did I miss that congratulations you hired so much oh yeah yeah she started last week yeah we made an offer she accepted that's good this is great I didn't actually think somebody would follow through not a good one okay [Applause] all right any of the comments on this particular item all right so uh thanks to the discussion of proposed switch gears in easement at Crossman Park City Manager Reaper thank you this is uh part of phase two and on the very top end of phase one um throughout phase one they've been installing the pedestals which consist of switch switch gear equipment and um Transformers and things like that and transition boxes connections and throughout the process underground Consultants of Florida had to request events from different residents to produce a plan or layout and in that process you know we achieved it we got some easements and some things we have to relocate but we all got worked out over time so this is kind of like coming up to our property which is Crossman Park where Duke is requesting to put two switch gear and if you flip to the next page it gives you an idea of the dimensions of what it would look like um it you know it's kind of like it's part of the process and when you're underground the equipment still has to go somewhere and we've been asking a lot of the residents as we move down like city property I asked that they you know gave us a layout of what they're requesting because then they would give us an official instrument that we would approve okay and I didn't I was okay with this design we have like a communication I think it's a frontier on the in-ground box there these things unfortunately can't be in ground they have to be outside but the way it's laid out is kind of just tucked in right on the property line um it'll remove like one of the shrubs but I think it will sort of stay out of the way it's a sort of like a utility Corridor of that of that Park but I didn't see any major problem with it that's the best place forward if we can keep that our own problems and they you know they for the most part they if they have to get in there they'll get in there for whatever the equipment has to be worked on but we could we could put like some shrubs or whatever park bench it's good yeah [Applause] uh let's see here sitting website I'll tell you what uh it's five minutes till 7. break five minutes I guess everybody will see better tonight Quick Glance on there so that you reinforce time to be by of course it depends on who you're asking for 100 years my Identity On The Athlete pipe also practice your group why well first of all concrete board back then wait a minute solution take it away okay thank you so Civic plus I tracked down who worked with Metallica put it on the sort of a website that we agreed was a well put together website and I put in touch with um sales obviously with a Civics Civic plus and uh they looked at uh China Bel Air website it would be on like a web meeting and a bunch of other cities have similar websites and if you put in a couple five pages in and you start seeing like premium design ultimate designs that's their two main layouts now town of Bel Air um as you can kind of recognize has a similar design where it's got an image it's got like the main tabs and it has some different pop-ups depending on how they uh designed that the difference between the premium design and the ultimate design is they look the same when you first click on the page but with the ultimate design it allows you to add more as a scroll um below that main image and you know hot buttons so [Music] I'm not sure uh what we feel the greatest um the greatest value of the tunnel Belair website is because I feel unless there was something specific that we wanted to have to scroll down that home page that we really could design this like on the premium so it'd be like you just would see this front page you'd have their tatted out at the bottom UA has some likes and we just don't decide whether it's calendar meetings or whatever and um you know that would be it like there would you wouldn't have a Scrolls people feel differently about Scrolls sometimes people go to a page and they're not familiar with websites they don't even know the Scrolls um but the reason I bring that up is because between the premium design and the ultimate design um the pricing that you see on the front page of this kind of material that is the premium design so the ultimate design to have that ability to scroll on that home page would be roughly about a thousand dollars more and what you're looking at is your first investment that includes the um kind of like the design transition from your current web page to their system and then it's a reoccurring annual fee so the premium design you're looking at right now it's priced at about 3 500 an annual service which includes all the uh you know programming system it's just a web hosting and all that to put that in perspective the last time we did a website design with digital eel which is in St Pete Beach that costs us 6 200 for the design but their web hosting after that we only paid we paid 263 dollars a year so it's a much lower yearly cost um but again I think we sort of see what we're doing they set up a they set up the design on the WordPress and then from there it's just kind of we're changing things out we try to work with some different ideas widgets which they'll charge us an hour of the rate for them when they do that but um it just doesn't like I don't feel like we really get the support to keep a malfunctioning much that I um as much as it would with using Civic Plus okay because they just they have a lot more things just built into their program that you put the websites together with um that just kind of make it all fit together well um but I wanted to present this tonight because this current budget here we still have money where we could do we could start the process of paying our initial tournament um price of 4 200 and uh would be good moving forward and my suggestion would be um we would put together sort of a design team and um I think I would have like a couple staff members and maybe a counselor back again and be a part of it okay all right I'm gonna speak for vice mayor Shirley because she normally wants to see all the numbers you know old person's name so if you want a company that we currently currently have so what we currently pay is 260 63 annually and that was an afterwards looks like yeah way back when okay so we paid about six thousand for that that design and we're doing all of the uh basically we're just adding new pages whenever whenever something happens but we're paying 263 dollars a year for the whole effort yeah for the web relatively cheap now that we have it but which is new company uh the initial term is 42.65 yes and that includes the the initial design yes that includes and all the migration of all that because that's a lot of the work is moving on that that's true and don't mean that's late all right and then annual recurring services so for two years we get uh I'm sorry for roughly 3 600 if we get two years is that correct no that would be very used locked in for 20 years per year so thirty five hundred dollars thing Victoria Roberts Kyle when you when you talk to you know already the existing company did you get a feel that this annual recurring service for 3 500 is it equal to or greater than what we're currently receiving so company a head I would say it's gonna be it's greater than because Civic Plus they really when they do upgrades when they put together like the back end of what you use to design the page they put a lot of effort into like making it like user-friendly okay um so it sounds like the other company more was like they selected to use the program WordPress um and they will for a fee if you want to try to do something more they'll work with the programming side of it to try and add a look like a third party widget or something like that okay but it's not always successful in yeah it's kind of like they they're just there to sort of use that tool trying to use it but it seems often eliminated and um a lot of times when we try something new and whether we're putting that scrolling thing on the honk on page there was like look they run into Little like quirks of the system and you're going to figure them out it's just kind of okay it's kind of like maybe the difference of you know using like getting hypnosis or operating system or trying to use like a free shareware operating system where you it's cheaper but you expect to have the quarks to go along with it there's a there's an awful lot of research involved in using open source uh hosting solution Associates something like that um plus you never know where the plugins actually come from so the extensions that you want to add to it none of them are made by WordPress they're made by companies all over the world we have very well-being putting something on your website as China or Russia or something like that either way you have to kind of look around and guess is this going to work or not maybe physically installed on the website and see if it's useful and if it's not you can't get off and you try something else there's a lot and a lot of work involved in doing that it can be done if you have the Manpower and you've got somebody that's focused on doing that what I see the advantage of this company is that this is all they do they focus on on these municipal yes it looks like they've they've got something that seems to be working out it's not a one-size-fits all because they do some customization but for the most part they know what we would be looking for so there's a lot of value to that the question is is it worth the guessing we're probably because it's thirty five hundred dollars a year compared to 260. 63. I have no problem just wanting to do better for our community question is this is what our community would want do we have a some kind of Italian how many people look at our website every month until then notice I gotta look at what we currently have on there as far as counting yeah um they I know they spent a lot of focus on that already finding out what most people most traffic if interested in and then they design and have things like adjust accordingly so it was like a little bit of like AI built into it but I don't have the exact numbers I I do here all the time you know it's very hard for anyone to find WordPress will give you all that data okay that's that's not really uh the issue if it's lame and look at it a couple of times they may want to go and look at meeting minutes if they are building something it looks to me like this is trying to figure out a way to plus it looks like this also adds a sense of Pride to your community you can get a nice website another thing they told me is a lot of the photos that you find in these example communities they were taken by people's cell phones they had like football competitions and that's how they get the materials and then is this an actual app or is this just what it looks like whenever you pull it up on a cell phone um it looks families they're opening page you know has keep me informed emergency alerts if you're concerned the only stage you can do right on their homes right so easy you know and then if you want to get into the wings and looking at the content you can do that and you say it includes training also basis migration free virtual training sessions for me I think ever since I've gotten out of council there's always been this feedback that we're not communicating with residents and I and I think our website has a lot of good information on it I have to tell you my struggle finding that information May not um I am in total support of moving forward with [Music] um with this contract I've been doing web design on some companies I own and this is a very reasonable initial cost to set up doing the web hosting and supporting I don't think that's unreasonable if you look at it it's 300 a month it's not that bad um I know when I take GoDaddy for mine uh work I'm having done or not necessarily they're not doing the work but they host the website and there's a fee to that so whoever is hosting it takes there is a cost to it um you know we're paying 263 annually and it looks like we're paying 263 it looks like we're getting nothing for that service we're basically just keeping the website about it yeah that's it which is why I think we have so many complications finding things on the site even when you do a search or a word it doesn't generate what you're looking for the one thing we find too is things work like our calendar works one way and then they do an upgrade and affiliate changes how that calendar it works and then they can't really explain what games right can we go back to the old one we can yeah yeah that's kind of like why she has to have meetings running uh showing like six hours because otherwise it'll fall off because people never had a problem yes once they started I mean just little things that you're like you can't find a fix for that yeah I mean I think this is just you know as a cost of doing business and it's expectation that we communicate with our residents and this is the best way to communicate with our residents Okay so to make sure that I don't understand what I'm looking at here because I see the quote here and then I see project cost here just what they this is what they openly give out and then they're offering us a deal oh we're gonna I know we're getting a discount because we use a beauty code that's one of their programs so we have 10 that's what that's probably what the examine yeah I see that now so we're a Civic Plus customer yes well this is nice because there are added object where we can add you can do your bid feeds through here 18. behind it was like a big package [Applause] oh okay I'm sorry yeah [Applause] is dead all right let's go around the room instead of just Roberts what do you think I would definitely be in favor of him all right Leslie we have to know how many people visitors well part of that may be that they were trying to please what are you looking for well it depends on me you know is it easy to get from A to B or is it easy to find the information you're looking for that's what I'm saying yeah it just took a while sometimes well I think this would do too to understand um sounds like one of those in the palace you feel like you will be able to find information I feel like the site in its design and what they build it to do is going to is going to in a way find out what people care about and then make that easy that's what I'm saying if there's a couple hundred people that's about our question like uh in this video I asked how many people it was on the floor but WordPress if it's working properly there's got to be some politics did we have a time frame on making your commitment obviously the next meeting right I was just trying to get this paid on this year was it I was going to get paid out of this year's budget because we got out of the room but uh actually it's not anything that actually you know price point wise that needs um you know I got a special approval I just want well I'll tell you what I would be willing to do is pairing when we we've actually we would be committing to the first year and then there would be annual recurring services to get this price are we committing to three years or or are we committing to one year and then eventually we'll come up for renewal we're committing to two years it says annual reoccurring services to two then it says two years ago every three years because the first years included on the initial terms I think it's the initial term and then annual rate occurring service a year or two uh contract automatic one-year renewal term unless 60 days notice provided prior to renewal so that's at the end I think they're just showing us on this is the annual repairing Services which we began in year two this started by funding I would just like to know if there's an out after the first year okay so I would like to see the thing in action and get started with that content what happened to you in the morning it happened you still keep that page this is all the products everything they've got we're renting this house thank you and so what he would do is you would have to go back and what you had before and I'm sure you'll get back at your terminating our services yeah I think that I'll find out about that I think they have a responsibility to at least provide us with our content I suspect that once we move forward and we see what all but everybody's complained not enough information we've all admitted to behave better with the community and uh yeah I'm I'm in favor of moving forward so what yeah I'll get the information and I'll send it out okay guys are kind of like okay here's what we're looking for all right so it's from what I'm gathering everybody's pretty much in favor of local news yeah well if you've got no offense to anybody involved with our current website but if you've got a Chevette and then you've got a Cadillac so it's not fair comparison everyone's going to gravitate towards the headline and that's what I'm hoping everybody's going to want to actually use our website because a sense of Pride to our community to have a nice showing online instead of what we currently have which is kind of a novice approach and economies well it's cold right so it doesn't have um new technology applies correct correct yeah okay well I think the general insurance we would like to see once once you have all the details please email it to us okay [Applause] okay item six discuss the discussion of these sandbag billing attachment for tractor Mr Reaper okay thank you so this came up after the last event we were kind of thinking about it a hurricane as well but uh it was another uh let's see Monday during the event before uh Dahlia came uh it was an 11 hour day of sandbagging for the for the staff and that was um over that time you did a little over 2 000 sandbags and this you know kind of after that that the work is is tough um because it's just a whole day's worth of uh and not only being on the heat but you know doing the shoveling and all this day and and we just uh we couldn't have done as many bags without the volunteers to the community but at the same time it really does wear our Public Works staff out when they're doing that many cinematics over that period of time so this is an idea of yeah that job's still going to be hot and sweaty and you know people are going to be agitated just from the events happening but we felt that this sandbag attachment in using a machine that we already have and it can do 20 bags at a time is a good way to save um save the employees backs let's say you know to to continue storm preparation the next day because it's really it's not so much the first day but it's that next day we're gonna have to come back in early to keep going or whatever we had to lock down and everything the way the storms moving so fast but you can just see it and pop them around like you know so this this uh this uh invention is actually a sole source um kind of new invention that city of Oldsmar purchased five or six years ago and they're extremely happy with what they have and they're looking to purchase another one and uh they did a demo for our community services administrator last week and as you can see like the you know that in an eight hour period using this sn20 which is you know it's a skid steer attachment that's the attachment we have on our our tractor um their their average is 4 800 bags over an eight hour period so the idea would be just to enhance uh how fast you can make these sandbags and when we have an income um and also you know less wear and tear and everybody involved and I also feel like we could still have piles of Sam we still have other options to fill the bags if people want to fill their own but at the same time we can add a whole nother 20 yard pile of sand right now to think of this cul-de-sac where you're working with a tractor and you're you're dropping 20 bags at a time um coordinating you know people loading their cars at the time they go and I think uh you know for the price point of this as you can see it's uh with the bags you're getting 4 000 sandbags you get about twelve hundred dollars all right sorry twelve twelve thousand dollars but um just wanted it to be considered um maybe uh hear your input because we do have some some funds available in public works for every budget that would be this would be a Capital Equipment but it would be within our budget to to make a pleasure and get a sandbag loading in this year's budget yes this fits on our existing yes so I have a question we had a limit on sandbags and did they actually stopped any water I think it benefits where there were places around where they actually keeping liquid from building I'm not discounting sandbags no but I'm discounting is the amount of sandbags that we distribute and wasn't actually not you know not 20. you should have been looking forward well I think part of the problem is education about how you properly stack the sandbags not water and that's what I saw was people were just slopping sandbags around and I didn't think that they were doing anything anymore and so I I would say that I would be willing to do this but we definitely would need to raise our limit I would I mean if that thing did what we expected they should have been driving cars reloading reloading all day long getting ready and snacking the same things to stop the water and I unfortunately I think that's dead received water damage um it's not correctly it would have stopped it but I think that's something we do again back to the website I know the county actually has information on that how to properly use sandbags and of course you don't just use it yeah they have some type of the screen plastic behind it otherwise you just here's how you do this because you're exactly right if they don't do it properly it's a waste of time definitely important amen so uh I have a question are these poly bags they have folded on here are they proprietary to this this they are proprietary um but they are not much more yeah and you know we talked to the city of Oldsmar about that and they said we have the prices remain the same for these bags and you know no it's just a little confused you know what I'm saying so they yeah they they have a layup slipping around those little holes um and then this the ring is it's like a loop and it's inserted so that when they release the bags it drops in a pulse plate and then sit down you release some ties and then the idea would be you know that's something somebody who may not be as physically fake and can tie their bags but it does say here that it fills transports and securely closes and places the sandbanks so it so that was going to be one question I was going to have though I mean I noticed when people were filling them out here on their own some people weren't quite smart like me I would put that thing all the way up because I wanted more space to be covered that's pretty heavy for other people were filling in them like halfway that's that sort of I wonder when uh when when Aaron went over there they he actually see the van were they how much did he spent a field yeah I was going to say exactly exactly that's a pipeline bag that you see yeah if you see the guys in there okay so you're showing up higher than you that's for support and those guys are bigger yeah but what I'm saying that's for support that's not for stopping here it happens I don't know if everybody can see that yeah I mean we're going to continue to build bags I think this is a this is the right thing to do you want to hear us sure everything uh prisoners don't go home with you um it's one of those Acquisitions that you say we've paid this much money and we don't have a storm for seven years and people go why did you buy that but when you need it if you don't have it you're gonna need it right hold on thank God you don't have a so much okay it seems like there's always something that's under the Horizon right so you're paying your footage just make sure that we have plenty of inventory of the bags because I don't think four thousand is not no I'm picking up that I think I did six thousand for the same shipping I think that academic science club I would like some sort of uh how many per home what what are you gonna how many homes are you gonna uh protect with this and how many bags because I would like to see I would I would like anyone to have the option of having at least 45 yeah that makes sense I think that we still should fathom but probably you know because you don't want everybody coming up and getting all the sand right away but like maybe you give them 20 and then they come back around they get the other 20 exactly you know because I think in other everyone in this situations just depending how bad um you know that storm is it's kind of like we're going to be putting the sandbags until we can't do it anymore right and I think I said this before and again if you look on the County website they will tell you do not put sandbags it's a waste of time and it's not important to try and prevent water from getting in your house so forget about your garage doors because that takes a lot of bags put your sandbags on your Android access right whatever that door is that's inside your garage go in your kitchen that's this wine you put four or five bags there and snack them as hard as you want to but I've seen many homes around here that have many of their bags or in front of the garage no sense okay yeah see if it comes into your garage you only have a drywall barrier between inside and in your garage and inside so I would I would stand back in my garage too well you should have a minimum of like a four or five inch step in right yeah but mercies are only three inches two to three inches but it's still the garage door um you know the size is going to be getting in it's just it's more difficult it's like mine garages the experts say um but nothing's going to be perfect unless the guys see on the commercials all right are we all in agreement purchase this device extra bags extra bags last item College take it away this is his last revision that he provided us with and in address like some of the I think at one point he had that the it wasn't it was it was still like the longest boat one but then [Music] now you go back down to the bottom so it you select what what size um yeah what we call category of slip or a size is slip group wait unless you want to be on and then you're on you're committed to that one so that uh so then at that point you're you're on there by the date we got on versus you're not getting jumped by the guys at the longer boat and that in that group and I don't know if there's anything else that we saw jump out and I went back through it um you know this little things like um they'll fill out a marine away in this form I'm just going to have the form we currently use of a website very reality managed to have a paper form so we've got a fill out um it was it was one thing that uh one comment I would say from the community they felt that the 180 days versus 90 days that's basically made in Florida did the same for everyone I I realized that it's easier to buy a smaller motor but uh they so it should be the same across the board denied category so if we had to do one or the other we go 90. I don't think 90 is acceptable who these young kids are really slow okay um and then what they're paying how much are they paying for that slipper until well we're waiting for the not the bottom not the cheapest guys I think they were saying the maximum to hold it yeah until they hit it I mean that's good that I missed it started right I mean you're you're paying a premium price to hold the spots until you can actually go find a boat and uh there's so many places it won't allow them good attention we're offering service and then when it says um we'll specific applications so you look like a deposit so I think that should be the one month of the maximum and then um it says once the applicant is notified of the open slip and accepts the run will be again for the set program for that month um but I wanted to put something in there that they that each weightless applicant will get um 72 hours because you got to have some kind of like from from when we notify we call them like message email their email address and then from there it's like gotta set a time limit oh yeah it's only two hours yeah yeah to get back yeah I want this slipper I don't know that's what I've done in the past it seemed to work you know maybe it's 72 hours a month I mean I mean you're the next in line and I and I can't read you uh at what point do you say I've done everything I can I'm moving on to the next I would well I would say like if we could explain this maybe in the in the weightless application that we will call the number leave a message and we'll email it the email address and from there clock starts and if you don't respond in 72 hours so you require email info I think yeah try to think yes oh and then it says assignments are prioritized at no time will any household because of how many homes the Africa may have in dollar Beach I have two or more bones so does that mean because we do have one situation where there's a household that's two months of Marina are we gonna just is that a grandfather thing at this point is that even a household here technically yeah just because they have rental property here yes yeah I I'm not really sure how you obeyed that's a situation that they're probably going to say well I'm grandfather now but there should be a mechanism in place for aggressiveness do they renew their agreements at any time the agreement just runs it just it just runs I mean we have the option to cancel at any time but you know what I would say is that everybody gets down there needs to realign and their first on the list except the person who has two wheels and then they get one vote in the first pitch how long has that been going on I mean that's a tough one because how long now again those two those two they were like that when I got here 16 years ago right that's what I think it's always been known right I don't even know who it is concerned line family we have them install the list are they both yeah how big are these slips how much do they pay I still get back to we're not charging enough it's just like the beach party just don't charge it for as valuable as that property is we don't charge enough for those slots and I know that I will pick back where everyone is down there but I bet other citizens would agree with I mean I just I think that I know how hard it is to get your vote in a Marina and just live in a high and drawn even on a trailer in storage somewhere it's impossible and uh yeah coming out I've been down that road before and no one agreed with me so we have over 30s how many research through uh 18. actually um I don't know that's a tough one but it's well we need to make a decision because that's the standard was just was to keep somebody else I think it might be a really good job I think if we if we do allow the grandfather then we not allowed future apostles but if you're already in there paid for that for the flips my original idea whenever I took a stand is was to give them the time frame so yeah it's not that hard to find scripts they're all over the points still available you can you can go to Clearwater Marina and find it right now would be a city of Municipal on this side or that side yeah and you said both the boats are on those they don't have the baseball that's in water three sailboats at least so we don't mandate that they take responsibility I think that's fair okay somebody leaves do they take the lift out or this is they're told they have to take a look out yeah that's the last thing but that's tough the list has to technically come out or do it anyway and the problem is most people don't maintain their lips and because yeah so we don't want to take that responsibility as a city yeah yeah it's really it's a big deal maintaining we do yeah I think that's fair today one year notice and just you know with an explanation of we have such a long waiting listing um yeah so maybe I could clean up this um and then we could uh you know all the way up you know because this didn't include the different categories that we had before but kind of lay out the fee structure of the categories and then can we pass this policy by resolution and so I'll include the new because they're trying to weaning down to one boat per family within a year I mean we can definitely pass a resolution as far as the procedural elements of getting the the new rated policy codified or established as far as the you know phasing any single slip owner down from two to one I'd wanna I'd wanna look at that a little bit more than this moment especially given some of the history of that I just want to make sure that I'm guiding you right and I don't feel comfortable doing that on the fly at this moment all right I would like to see they talk about exhibit date and Marine waitlist form and exhibit would be the annual confirmation of interest when we get copies of those I'd like to change that around to something more electronic because for the last five years I'm going to read an email it's just a lot quicker and yeah like I said we've changed that form to the website but I mean I I want to reward that okay um section 2A is no more than one mode you know it's I think right now I should have two or more modes registered to the marina I just out of five seconds yeah you know just kind of focus on me no good uh I'm trying to get more of a review as well um and then I it was always the licensee for some reason you wanted to change it to a renter but I believe our our agreements this licensee so I was going to change that ever so whoever has the license yeah so yeah it's not it's a license agreement because well that is yeah right yeah when the way you've receive a cleanup coffee because [Laughter] and I want to kind of like I think a safe dealer I would say November maybe because I'd like to go over the uh the actual ingredients kind of again a recap of will ask versus wrapped progress being made any other questions or comments about this topic no General business um we have because of members available resigning we have to do signature cards for our accounts um the discussion with vice mayor I think instead of getting everybody's signature I don't think we really need to get every company signature um we're going to get like the mayor um council member of Colorado and very council member of Commerce is based on or consumer bank here it's based on who's local and they can be in the area almost like a design checks so I think theoretically we're all alone yeah but funny suggestions and I don't really need any additional liability you often sign Leslie's here often so I suggested those two and I'm like just randomly pick some other council member and please have three so if you can't get a hold of someone but there's no need to get signature cards anytime there's a change yeah have we had any applicants yet no no I think that was coming in today with the notice on the board out there is a bigger print than it was that's called desperation you know we may have to turn up the volume I saw there was a cut-off date like the 25th or something right we need to adjust that the 25th I mean you can extend it like yeah sometimes deadlines results in submissions for the procrastinating yes they may be waiting to see who else was we'll wait till it will fit her in and see what happens but for the charter then person gets a point in and then they that position gets to be elected the next so in Marshall regular [Music] I don't know there are Charter people no no they wouldn't have to run again they would finish the term yeah see no the next election is your turn against the disabled so your agreement yes Belinda [Music] terms is a place yes right nice there's nobody up until the volunteer correct so what is the answer can you move as the City attorney else I will I will look into this email it to the manager because I don't want to do it right this second because I want to make sure I'm reading the language should you technically move Belinda to Jingle no no because they were put into that you're put into the seat specific and for that purpose even though you guys don't know around that way that's what I read yeah it's the next election for their terms no that would not make sense because then you would be flip-flopping these cycles of the elections correct yeah which is which is fun here here's the language filling of vacancies a vacancy on the council shot this is section 2.06 Sub C a vacancy on the council shall be filled by a majority vote of the remaining members of the council any person appointed by Council to fill a vacancy shall hold office until the next annual election in the city wow theoretically you could you could make it to where everybody's I mean if enough people resign all of a sudden all everybody are assigned council members would run yeah you have one election every every three years and that would be the end of that no no I don't think it would work that way I think that they would run but then they would serve the remainder of that term still so you're still on the site that's not what you read now yeah I said the next election correct okay and they I know our terms are right now three years so let's so the way the way that I'm reading that and again this will require some follow-up so just in case there's any well you said this I'm doing it on the Fly the way that I would interpret that as I read this is let's say you I had this happen to me in another community so I use another Community somebody's elected in March for a three-year term right and then in may they realize all the stuff they wanted to do they can't do they say you know what I'm not sitting around for three years to do that and so the council says fine we'll appoint somebody and then you get to March that happens in March 2024. when March 2025 comes around that position that was filled in May of the year before is up for election and they serve the remaining two years of that term it doesn't start a new three-year cycle it's just an election to fill the remaining tenure of that term of that of that seat so you you okay so in this case if we appoint somebody to replace lightsaber then an election would happen but it would not be that person who was doing it was an election is going to happen between that term and in other words it's an election for the balance of the term an election is the balance of the ordinary term not going to impact the appointee no it sounds like the acquaintances the appointee has the opportunity to run let's say you appointed somebody tomorrow to zabel's position the way that I'm reading this that person would serve from September 19th tomorrow to March 19 2023. they have the option to run for that position in the March election and qualify in December and if they do they are one of the candidates eligible for that seat but that election is for the balance of Mr Abel's term which I believe runs in 2025. that makes sense so they would run to serve just one more year and so what we may need to do in our qualifying period as that approaches is Mark are you running for that particular vacancy or just or establish how that will be handled which is its own issue we know can I throw a wrench in there oh that's absolutely it's a gift so the way it is right now come March the three High boat damage 36 people run five people or whatever three nice rotators gay so would it be the two highest road Getters stay for three years and then the third highest or the third lowest or whatever finish up is April's term you know what I'm saying I do I do know I do know what you're saying and that's what I'm trying to wrestle with in my head is how do we address that in our and it may be that we we address it in our resolution the cost of election or amend that if we've already adopted it because I can't remember where we are in the process but we either established that if it's two vacancies plus I think it's actually three vacancies plus sales um so that would be four right um in which case it would be the top three we could do it either the top three get the ordinary seats and fourth place gets the bridge term or we could say enduring the qualifying period there are three seats that are up for at least three year terms and one seat that has one year left which one would you like to run for yeah but how about the voter trying to figure it out oh for sure for sure for sure that that is through research it have agreed to Patty about history yep and it might be a charter amendment that needs to be looked at because that's not how it's been handled in the past and we can we can have that discussion we can talk about all of them that's why I come with all the caveats this is a discussion on the flyer yeah and and I will also say that with the caveat of just because we did it one way doesn't mean that's how you're always supposed to do it um so I reserve the right to make my own independent conclusions talking with Patty and the manager and we will address them that sounds good to adjourn I'm not sure guys know that I don't know if you received the alert Pinellas thing today I look at it and say that they are making repairs starting in Sunset Beach Treasure Island but then I got a report that they are just dumping sand on existing things so I don't know what the heck they're doing yet but stay tuned I'm going to get to the bottom of it and I'll let you know I also the county decided to go ahead I I suspect this is what they're doing they're they're uh I've been invited to a some sort of a press release gathering at the race Stadium tomorrow at 10 30. I suspect the county is going to say we're we're doing it we're going to do this this grand these new baseball that are not featuring Big Race Stadium right yes well I know that they we all knew things away but um and what'd he do and we need it must say go to the beach or exactly well it will have the um at the TDC meeting they said I don't know if anyone was actually here whenever the Dixie you know we we hosted The Big C they they painted a picture of doing blue that if they funded it themselves we were all going to go broke the FEMA would turn their backs on us you see this Army Corps won't budge well that includes FEMA they're not doing anything for us anyway as far as replenishing the sand on our beaches but they they said there's no way we can do it and they Danced All Around well at The Joint TDC meeting it was the Florida County Commissioners in the TDC Janet long said we have the money to do everything so they've got the money to do the Rays stadium they've got the money to re-nourish our beaches they've got the money to do something for the Phillies and they've got the money to do um a project over on toy town for a sports complex well let's keep the Phillies anyway my point is is that um there suddenly they have this unlimited well have you seen how much to charge your taxes it's bad tax where all this all these projects come from it's not what we're being charged at home it's for if you if you are retail yeah they're hitting the residence school too but if he said anything everyone said you're not going to get a med tax if you don't have people go to the beach right you know so well right now what I'm getting from them is that they're only going to nourish the most damaged beaches and I say to them that they're all damaged and what happened so I spoke to Kathleen Peters and she walked up to me at the end of the meeting and she and she said I was able to do a flyover and I looked at all of the beaches in Bel Air Beach was by far the worst she said that Sunset Beach and Treasure Island was number two and then North Readington Beach was number three so why they decided to go and don't stand on an existing dude in Treasure Island I have no idea but I'm going to ask some tough questions but I said next couple of days and try to find out what's the point what's the real plan because so far I've not heard anything other than we're going to do the places to be safe here's here's Sixth Street at three o'clock today the tide go down yeah another another thing is that uh speaking with Kyle [Music] a certain representative assured me that she she should be able to give us some money to help with storm damage and so I asked Kyle what what what's damaged and he said 400 bucks come on man no I mean like I said most of the damage most of our loss was the beach but if you want to tie into they're going to try and extend the forward locks that's the damage there's no sand underneath and our beaches are inaccessible right now [Music] pretty quickly the better number and I pass that along and we'll see if that person is good but I'll also let you know that what what she's trying to do is piggyback on the damage that happened at Indian launched agent so we're you know because they lost a lot of access same deal so maybe maybe you're comfortable so that that's something that we talked about is you know extending those walkovers because I mean it's a good four foot drop no yeah it is doing stairs I was I want to see what concert would be for both again right now let me keep the same angle looks like it's gonna extend imagine extend 10 to 12 feet which will pretty much put it in the water most of the time um maybe we can and then and then at least have one that's like accessible like Indian Rocks just pulled each other walkway railings but you don't have no planks access is because there's no place to go and the reason the reason we have the angles we do is because the state requires to be like being two feet 18 inches two feet clearance over again but people wonder why we have such speed that they have anything no you can't it doesn't have to be yeah it doesn't have to be either it would have took a lot more RAM what it is you know to get out to the beach but um so so you're trying to figure out a plan but I would say make sure we're sweet budget get that in the budget we've been done you know start it sooner rather than later it's been a while right and it's gonna I mean I've gone out there and I'm like I'm not jumping off of that I don't I don't know how to get back up if I move down to the beach it's gonna be it's going to be time yeah that's another thing how far out are they going to let us cook stuff all right any other General business oh yeah I know when hired Kyle was for two year freeze but exceptional to your cities I think he deserves a raise to myself should really take consideration everything I'm sure other people are even going to look at it in other Series right now I hate the Lord for this Council to give them five percent raise I think it's well deserved any comments how does your situation work in your position is it based on your when you started a new position 12 months from that period yes the contracts started I think it's November 24th okay because we normally do reviews and February so I was planning on setting up a review paperwork next month annual term said sort of on the subject I brought this up with uh attorney Mora I currently have 44 hours of vacation leave on books for myself in November I get another 15 days on top of that technically my contract says I can only carry over 30 days um right now would be a struggle to use right to get to get it and use it it says I technically I'm violating it right now because I have 44 days and I think it doesn't matter because I can actually have it one times 40. but I don't know if there's any option um you would like to extend that I could do something because I don't even if I was to take a day a week that kind of vacation So when you say but but it's important that you take time off too so I'm just going to say I'm just going to say that but you know you know um I don't know what that looks like I don't know what the recipe you know now we're wrapping up budget I know it's you know still kind of some part of touching them type of time but it's not I think we move back through the worst of that so take a look at it and see how much of that time you can use I mean I'm not opposed to given looking at allow you to hear more but if you could take a vacation have a little extra cash to take that vacation that might be a little bit accommodate the problem okay as of right now planning on a vacation on the second week of the holidays so they would go into I think it's December 29th and then I would come back the seventh before the meeting myself that would use 30 is five days normally normally in my experience is what you carry over so you said it was 30 30 days was the magic it was right Max right so the 15 you're going to get the next fiscal year that doesn't count because it doesn't you can't have a maximum amount with the new personal policy changes secures therapy right he's presently at 44 right so if he acquires another 15 he's functionally seeding half of his approved leave time is his concern and if that's the benefit what is the word does it say he can't carry more than 30 over so to the next through over the calendar year so I take advantage of December oh okay okay the best solution is to do a payout and get you down to a reasonable amount of vacation instead of this and we can and we can do an amendment to his agreement that contemplates that because that's not contemplated by the Personnel policy and his needs generally governed by the Personnel policy um and so if we if you wanted to do that the cleanest way would probably be an amendment to his employment agreement that addresses this that we could you could all you could provide for payout and at what rate and also you know if you wish to say he can accrue more or shall not approve up to you know make that number something different you can do that too it's a contract we can do whatever we want at that point so we could just make it whatever this this kind of thing that's what I would like to see is vacation time uh at the same time put something in there that will incentivize him to pay correct and that was the other you know you guys in the city are my client here and so you know my other concern for you as a council is you wouldn't want you couldn't you wouldn't want to put yourself in a position where he had cruised so much time and then whether he leaves in you know two years or 20 years you're paying out 80 120 hours is just sitting in the bank and I've seen that happen in communities where it's like now they're time to go and wow that's a huge liability we want to manage that in a way that incentivizes and also caps you know at any given time we know that it's going to be afford it because anything that's not used by calendar date shall be paid out in some ends as for example as a way to automatically draw it down if you haven't used it then you know we'll cash it out at the end of the year some other way so we can put something together and present it to you for consideration as a contract so um oh yes can I say something um as far as incentivized because I'm exceeding mine too we have incentive we we don't need them if we we struggle to take time off because one week you're preparing an agenda the next week you're sending it out then the next week you're preparing the work session the next week they're sending it out so it's kind of like we struggle to find time you know unless you take two days before the agenda or three days after well that's I heard that like clearly moving back so you could actually take a vacation and not take five days and come rushing back to me for a week you know yeah so it's not intentional but see that the table is a good manager with a good Administrative Assistant that that person should be able to align some of the load where you can afford to take a day off or a few days off or whatever really how about the new Myers that help any eventually if she's trained like she's helped more than anyone so far before her so yeah she's she seems like I mean I have I'll have a lot of experience but she's already helping me but I believe that she's able to do a lot more pardon you're in the same position you have too many days yeah who else just her it's not yours isn't quite as bad like you're right so why don't you provide us the exactly the details and what it looks like and then any vacation either if you have a plan and do we need to move meetings between now and the end of the year come get your vacations when you need to say it that way but I think we need to be accommodation yeah of course absolutely no I don't I don't mean to complain right now I just try to explain why we have so much I want you to get some rest or whatever we're a small community and we will do everything we can to work around you and as far as Mr bankers comment about we're not paying people enough I tend to agree but I'll fit on the other hand um we have to do this in a way where we're not we're not straight from our agreements so like for us to at least get to the reviews and then that way once we have the reviews done we can sit down as a great and decide what it is so your lead structure if I remember correctly you don't have the separation of the sick I opted to keep because I had a lot of sick time okay yeah and Patty's I'm sure the same way he gets sick and annual right yes now you can't donate anything like if you want to give your leave to me I can give myself to a co-worker she gave you it takes much time as she lost to but you have to adhere to the regular pay um so I guess back to that just Dave and I had a little design conversation about whatever you Kyle since we're coming up on your right one year anniversary Sydney prior to if she's um if you're struggling with your vacation days allow this is coming it's going something that we can do at one time all right let's get them caught up where they have a reasonable amount of days they 've got some extra money in their pocket and hopefully we'll get this under control we're going to do that the managers could be as simple as an employment agreement it's my machine Patty doesn't have a separate employment agreement found by the Personnel policy in which case it may be a resolution further amending the Personnel policy and that can be narrowly tailored to address that any other General business or would everyone like to go on a second all in favor aye um"
