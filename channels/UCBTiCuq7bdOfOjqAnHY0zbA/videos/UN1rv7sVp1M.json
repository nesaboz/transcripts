    "transcript": "uh calling together city baylor city of bellaire beach distance advisory committee monday june 13th at 5 30. ask for approval of the agenda i make a motion we approve the agenda a second all in favor aye aye any opposed okay the agenda is passed now our objective is to review and accept the committee's city manager's candidate pre-screening scoring tabulations so we'll open it up for discussion i found one error in my sheet that i think i sent to you pat you have to check for um pilgrims number 25 i i had the total at 13. you recorded it as 19. not that i think it makes a big difference because his total numbers are low anyway what's his number 25 25 yeah pilgrim you said pilgrim yeah okay i got 22 for a pill but is that right no no no no ron oh this is uh rob this is rob i got that i'm looking at rob's but i got pilgrim is 20. oh i'm number 22. he's not number 22. he's numbered number 25. oh he's number 22. oh okay so is that still the same thing then yes and you said this this says 13 and it should be no it says 19. on the cover sheet no she's looking at yeah yeah my sheet said 13 but on your cover sheet you recorded 19. all right that's that was my point okay so this should be 13. so six less one eighty-six average one down yeah i'm not sure i'd have to go back and look at it i'm not sure why it says that it's just yeah you're right rob it's not gonna matter yeah [Music] so i can correct that before it goes any farther then okay but you're saying it wouldn't make a difference anyways no okay it's not going to be the top five for the accuracy of your record but i will do that sorry so are we empowered to um look at the totals and go all we're saying is we agree with these tabulations and then the paddy will then pass this on to city council and they will address even though you know we can flag the top five but city council address how they want to go look at things you know the updated timeline that patty sent out uh last week so we're uh we're just validating that our individual scores scores are represented right and not here to talk about why we gave somebody a 13 or a five or four okay well mine were right yeah well everything that i put is correct cause i checked it oh so mark it's not yours are all right versus the rust mine were transposed correctly and there were some remarkable similarities and there were there were a few oddball things that i just attributed to something i didn't understand or something somebody else well if you took if you looked at like grant applications and grant work you wouldn't know unless they put it in your resume so they may have very well be well versed in that but if they didn't put it in their resume they don't use it are they certified and it was buried some of it was in their cover letter yeah and they got two places some of it was yeah yeah there was that i know i was doing doing the back of two flip oh yeah to find these things i went down i probably spent about an average of an hour yeah i know except for after it took a while but i got pretty good i think the lesson to pass on to the council is that they have to be more specific when they put out the requirements or you know somehow be more specific we want you to address these things in your resume well i thought it was it was it was put there and so i think what it was but what i think would have been different is it would have spent some money for a recruiter to to throw out you know a lot of people that didn't have any experience and should never have applied yeah um and and to hey hey manager are you them certified you know so i think there was a lot of those things that a recruiter would out but you know then that's an expense and the other thing maybe a recruiter could have done is a little uh social media research for us as individuals to help us you know well i that's probably where i did take some time and i tried to do that for some of them yeah too yeah i tried to figure it out why were there why are people only one year in each place and try to see if you can find something out there and why but then there were some people that hit the headlights so i mean yeah you go there's no reason to interview this person in person all right so um review the tabulations feel that that group accurately reflects are scoring they get a motion to accept the um the candidate pre-screening scoring tabulations they move to accept the candidate priests screening scoring recommendations you have to be able to say it first i didn't say it all in favor all right any opposed okay let's move on the general of business well before we leave yeah yeah are we now we're complete this we have now completed our piece of this yes okay tell us in your words again what you're going to do next well we're still working on the schedule the mayor's working on a schedule uh so um let me go get it it's because it's not ready to be published because he's still working on but the next thing is it's gonna go to council because that's where i got confused here it says patty forward shortlist to council on the 15th so the shortlist to me would be the top four or five scores yes so um yeah that's right there like you said we've looked at this calendar the mayor and i like three times today but yeah the 15th i think still stays the same so everything will go to council and then they will review and there's going to be several several meetings a lot of meetings and then they're going to um pick their top number then when everybody looks at it if somebody wants to add someone else they can do it so it's kind of fluid until it narrows down finally to add some money to it to two it's possible yeah it narrows down to two well no add somebody to the five that patty rates as the highest is that a correct number five for the short list or you're not sure it's it's like four or five okay i thought in the original discussions it was four and then um yeah i don't know for you so just for conversations i got robert daniels was the highest scorer right and then uh was kyle then with peter cavalli and then this uh ryan abree and then shane crawford wow i ranked the top five yeah that's how the numbers go and somehow you know the numbers came up strong for daniels but you know it is what it is but he's probably not somebody after after doing my google you know well i mean that's the thing is you again we're stuck with whatever they submitted the council now has to apply what they what other things you know patty used to do all the background checks and do all the things yeah we're going to use sarma you know to do background checks because i mean you find out a guy was the city manager of your beach and you go wow that he's going to be very familiar with all the issues but if he got fired at that job or left under a cloud or something and yeah well i talked to lynn about this stuff and he says one of these that's in this top five and he wouldn't give me a name and i wasn't going to ask well probably not make the cut but that would be shane crawford because um well he was he has a felony conviction now at least all he said was lynn told me one of the candidates has a felony conviction but i'm a little confused in this timetable that we've taken all of this time to do what the city council wanted us to do screen 20 eight candidates i ranked the top five and then to hear that they gonna turn around and potentially add candidates with lower scores that may not have met the requirements that was in the worksheets that we scored on that's the implication i'm hearing not necessarily method requirements but like if we contact somebody and they say i'm no longer interested i'd move somewhere else or you know something like that okay i mean there's several different things that could happen yeah yeah like that yeah they're not going to just discard you the number one guy robert daniels he's applied to every interim city manager job in the state of florence right he just missed out on bel air and then the challenge at madeira beach with him is that he never moved from the east coast and like the one guy from south carolina i like him a lot better yeah from taipei my concern is is you know i've got professional recruiter buddies who are finding cfos jobs at 170 200 000 to move here and then they come here and go i can't find anything that i can afford and so they're turning down the job wow you can't afford to live by that so i think you know i think once that's going to be the hard work hey you've made the short list and i go uh remove me right but still thanks so that's there'll be some changes like that but that's part of the due diligence in the interview process is that you know if you get a commitment if if the city shows an interest in it they need to make sure that the person understands that this is a full-time position and you must live within the area so it sounds like dave mayor gaddis has got some maybe adjustments to the schedule but the way this was set up is that you know june 28 to july 8th this is as of last week council will do phone interviews then they'll narrow the list to final in-person interviews on the 8th and um and then the actual in-person interviews would be july 25th to 29th that the phone interviews didn't july were going to be like via zoom with all the council participating yeah that was the initial i mean that's what's up here that's what dave said when he was here so i don't know how they're going to do it yes he said yeah all the council members at the same time will be interviewing one person i mean for me that makes sense because what have you asked i might not have thought of no no unless unless the council wants to say okay we're going to just create you a three-person hiring committee but i don't know i think i think you'll all want to be involved but it's you know so you're going to have all those folks trying to ask questions they're going to have to have some rules of operation while they're doing this in other words each one gets five minutes or whatever it is to ask those questions and maybe you go back and everybody can have an additional minute for follow-up questions the last time they did it they tried to get all of their questions you know ahead of time together so that everybody wasn't asking the same because you know you're going to get duplicate questions right but then try to come back down and then like you said everyone will last their own yeah yeah that's fine but you know when you're interviewing somebody and you have a question in mind you want to ask him you asking that question more likely than not you're going to have a little rebuttal going so what you're saying to me is you blah blah blah and if you if it's just a here's the question here's my answer with no that's not really an interview that's a it's a question and answer session i like to be able to how did they respond to a question off the cuff that i asked them about something that that level that they made a comment about so you don't want to lose that one-on-one type of expectation also something that i think has become more important with all these virtual beings i think that doing lots of vtcs you know before they got to have the camera on oh absolutely because some people will just want to connect audio wise no no but getting their body language really that says a lot absolutely absolutely we even mandate we have large meetings at the company you've got to be on camera i don't care whether your hair is right or not you got to be on camera because you need to see exactly what you're saying right you know especially an interview process one-on-one you know that's just not no also hopefully they're already planning it then you see is that what they're planning yes yes right yeah sounds like dave spring david yes david's into it so he's thought it through he's put a lot of thought and effort into it yeah that's good well you still have a motion there chair hasn't been voted on yet i thought we did as far as accepted yet did we vote on it all in favor all right all right okay okay now we're good because i thought i moved to general business but okay but we will go back to general business okay yeah yes all right some of the things that i wrote down based on the council comments and my email and let's add some more if we need to was a review of the strategic plan for future storm system storm water system upgrade schedule camera the remaining old system before proceeding with future upgrades consider upgrading one streak per fiscal year vice 2 per year that we're doing now and to john's suggestion consider the bond issue to complete remainder of city to minimize the hit of potentially higher labor material costs we also mentioned the necessity to have the diameter of the outfall match the diameter of the pipe yeah let me see that makes sense it makes no sense to me so you form it up here they don't want to buy new valves that might be possible i think they've already bought well i don't even there's no valves on those streets that they're going to be doing this on yeah they all have these check valves they have the check valves i know there's a child down below that 12 13 had them already installed i don't know either they talked about it quite a bit in the community discussion yeah but i thought that was part of the maybe of the project to you know either clean the pipes or install new quiets or do something of that nature i didn't realize they were going installing vault valves in streets that had not been um no i don't think they've done that much to fix but down in the south end yeah yeah well because i know that in some instances or lynn would talk about how the city was able to actually do the work themselves and they bypassed um suppliers and went directly to the manufacturer to save money so those obviously did not have they didn't match the pipes it may not be true any other discussions again motion to adjourn the meeting i move to adjourn this meeting of the citizens advisory committee monday ah second june 13th 2020. all in favor thanks everybody"
