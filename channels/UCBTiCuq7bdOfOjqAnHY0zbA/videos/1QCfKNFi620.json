    "transcript": "all right what color uh city of Bellaire Beach citizens advisory committee uh today Tuesday November 22nd 2022 5 PM to order and can I request approval of the agenda I'll make the motion second Mark okay all a favor hi any opposed okay great So today we're going to talk about um so last time we got together Kyle had asked us to consider looking at the uh referendum requirement that required the city to keep a million dollar cash balance for Hurricane emergency funds and so we agreed that it would be something exploring it to work so Kyle and I went and had some phone calls um talked to South State Bank which who has done our last two Bond issues they did the Bellevue Estates underground and bond issue and they did our storm water bond issue and Chris Rowe our bond Council and as it turns out Municipal lines of credit are not desirable so to put it in perspective being a former commercial lender myself so a half a billion dollar line of credit was going to cost us one half percent upfront a one and a half percent annual unused fee prime rate is seven percent if we funded it and legal fees of twelve thousand five hundred to be repeated every five years yeah so they didn't want so they don't want that business so they did throw out that hey you know if you've got some projects maybe it makes sense to do a bond issue and then that interest rate came out to at the time they gave us a raise about four and a half percent no upfront fees on the borrowed money 10 year 15-year whatever the term is yeah so Kyle and I went back Kyle did some homework and I'll let Kyle walk through the homework so we looked at what if we roll forward um the next four or five years of stormwater projects and then um and then the payoff on this building was down down to two thousand dollars so it was significantly higher so the make whole provision since the 10-year treasury is uh has made our prepay negligible so we owe 480. so call it 482 plus accrued interest um so I think if we if we've got about a million to a cash so in my mind I'm like we'll take 480 out of a million to a cash pay the debt down apply the rest to the projects and then Finance the balance so Kyle do you want to walk through the projects sure so we started with the Gulf Boulevard underground project which we proposed uh taking care of phase one and phase two to City Council in September and um kind of laid out the total costs of that project per fiscal year and um the numbers came out with our with our penny for Pinellas reimbursement up to fiscal year 2025. we came out about 1.3 million um shy of the total project cost the idea wouldn't proposed the council was that our eight hundred and two thousand uh arpa money that we got from the federal government could be uh spent on Strongwater projects and in turn free up money to pay for the underground leaving us in the uh deficit about 400 400 500. the thousand dollars that that kind of got the conversation going of why we were looking at the uh you know the line of credit for the uh the million dollars for a hurricane or emergency funds so this is that those numbers laid out um and that was from the underground project there's some expectations that this penny for Pinellas will be expanded going into 26. there is um there's expectations that that's possible I have but some good news actually um there's been some adjustments the we are able to earn more credits and you guys are actually um the first to find out we were able to get more credits from duke on both faces so in total um a little bit of numbers so the original phase one for Duke underground it was supposed to be one 1.129 million and now we're down on to the actual invoice is going to be at 966. 966. yeah 100 sorry 966 691 so the phase two was at two about two million dollars a little over and now it's coming down to 1.75 so the total savings um from our original numbers and credits um they gave us 443 000 worth of credits wow that so that actually knocks down the money or deficit for the total project we're down to eight hundred and six thousand 100 it's 806 000 um which our arpa money was 802 it's by allocating what we're going to do for storm water yeah it pretty much put into the storm water so we take that 100 out of the budget and basically we're Break Even we're about break even now yeah so that's good news yeah that's real good just got that on the uh the Opera money is uh 802 thousand dollars four one and two almost eight or three but at 401 and then we'll get the right we came to two payments or to do right now we got it all okay yeah we just have to apply it I'm getting with Randy uh to do some form of a resolution to dedicate the night to a fund um but that that's a lot of requirements so it should be dedicating into a certain amount of project fund and that's a covered money right yeah yes okay so that's the underground and then the next page is the timeline that whichever revised I think in October for the stormwater projects it shows which ones we've completed we're currently working on 12th and 13th Street um which kind of spurred along this this idea of trying to knock out and doing a bond issue get these products done is that we during the bidding process of 12th and 13th we Cameo about 200 000 under budget so the estimated cost for that project was much lower with the increases in materials and transportation fees and labor in general so we're seeing these numbers go up we don't know if we're going to keep going up I did talk to some of the contractors that we we currently work with and they can't guarantee that the numbers are going to go up they're going to stay the same I know it's very hard to predict but in doing the analysis on the next page for the um announce the feature stormwater projects what I did here was I took the time the original project estimates they were all multiplied this budget year by 1.3 to try to deal with the cost of inflation uh I took those numbers that we now currently are budgeting for those projects I took I calculated out all the resurfacing that needs to be done in the area of those projects and added that to the project cost as well as the valley curve um for each area and you'll see like if you go to the resurfacing section after the BMP which is the Stormont projects if you go to the resurfacing you'll see the streets that are surrounding each of these projects and um if you go below that you're going to see the condition on 100 Port scale that's from our street index so it shows you know these we're getting up into the the yellows which were um you know above 50 so we're taking care of where where our streets are very deteriorated just surrounding these projects and then um you know you'll see like when we get to 9th Street um you're kind of taking care of the ones in that area Harbor The Cedars Spruce and palm but this will this will get us all kind of like in the yellow of our street index where I think we'll be to a point where we can kind of reevaluate the whole city in general so we're covering the resurfacing that needs to be done in these projects we're covering the curb work so anything that's getting resurfaced is getting the coat the new curves put in that's all been estimated um I total it up across the way across the board and got numbers for the total project costs that include the resurfacing and curbing in the area um and then laid it out with the money that we currently have saved in our capital budget and what money we need if we were going to do this say this year the next five years of the project and if you compare it back to the timeline you're going to see this gets us all the way up through 14 through 16th Street and it the next project after that is the marina which had a BMP in our um in our master plan but when you look at the marina that's it's not really something that I think is a high priority you know on the master plan so in draw all those numbers together we uh do we have right now currently this budget here we have 1.2 million dollars that is saved for these projects um the deficit for all the projects in the future that we're looking at five years is about 2.47 and that's where we're um getting that loan amount well at least on this report I wrote the loan amount being 3.7 but if you go to the last page you're going to find um the big picture of everything which is going to be and again this puts with our our underground credits so we did not know about at the time it kind of puts us about 3.8 million financing need um but you'll see where we we laid off paying off the building with the with the uh early payoff fees and then you'll see the the funding deficit needed for the stormwater off of the last report we looked at and that's how we we came up with the overall loan that we're going to need so are you seeing these these numbers represent the current um so credit from Duke yeah these numbers right here do not do not take um 275 minus 443 in credits yeah yeah two million for sure it was 806 000 right uh 73 dollars was that like three four or something like that yeah ask the question yes yeah Tom yeah out I see that as a cover every street and the decision was made which streets to cover and which side uh when you lay out all of the projects for the stormwater and the curbs and the paving um so does that mean these streets that aren't mentioned aren't aren't in Need for the next five years I would say yes not me for the next five years they're all still closer to I think we're at about like 65 rating on 100 point scale um I have I can send you the report of our current Street index I'm just if you want to look at where we're at in comparison a lot of what we've done a lot of streets that needed work through the previous stormwater projects and so the horse streets I would consider the yellow condition which is that that uh 51 to 70 points um mild wear after that you kind of get into the green area of a fairly new paved streets so it would get us in a good shape to definitely covered five years of resurfacing thank you um and then I read all these numbers by Heather our uh our finance officer and she just wanted to make clear um and this is something that we need to talk with the uh the uh Chris Rowe and um and solstate that because we're working out of two funds we're working on a capital projects fund and the stormwater fund we need to get the loan when we get that loan we need to be able to divide it output fund and then pay it back for fund so we just got to have that all kind of cut out but other than that she thought everything looked good what would be uh storm water and what would be so strong General stormwater is going to be your um your BMP your project cost and your Valley curve and then capital is going to be your undergrounding and you're resurfacing foreign assuming this goes through I'm looking at this legal fee what all this attorney City attorney have to do for that kind of money so um the 12th of 15 000 to 18 000 Chris row is with a law firm Brian Miller and Olive oh they're actually uh preparing a tax-exempt bond issue so there's okay there's works there's there's got to be hearings that are involved and there's a lot of different steps that go through in doing a bond issue and then the bank in essence buys the bond so they're the soul holder of the bond and that's what's next what's the difference between a loan and a bond issue and that's that's the difference that was so and they make a tax exempt so you know there's rules that can make what's called a bank qualified tax extended credit facility so what the bank gets the benefit is is they'll reduce the interest rate by what their tax is so your corporate tax rates today are like 25 26 percent they used to be 40 so you used to get a much bigger discount from whatever the current bond rate is so the current uh 10-year treasury today was running 475 I think right around there so this is basically getting it um at the current treasury is what the rate would be I think it pulled back a little bit today I mean I would be pushing Gary for back to his original comment at four and a half percent um you know I just did the math on the lower dollar amount it would bring the annual payment down to 482 138. um but with that 433 000 savings from 5 37 5 37. you know I think that's really comfortable with the range we've historically spent between five and seven budgeted between 500 and 700 000 a year for storm water and capital projects so it's within what we've historically done yeah then then some savings so then we would we would be saving um like this next year our debt service would be 160 in principal and 21 in interest so we'd be saving that 181 thousand we just reallocate that from the budget to this payment um and then in the uh Kyle and having conversations um believes that you know the mobile if we do these one-offs you know our mobilization expense would probably be in excess of the half a million dollars but he's got guidance that you could cut 250 of that out so we're all trying to back into how can we like cover what savings are we going to get to cover you know before I calculated interest it was a million one in interest over 10 years and then the beauty is is this it has uh it's a one percent pre-pay up to five over the first five years after five years the prepay goes away which the 20-year bond that we're in for this building the prepay never went away yeah yeah and you said earlier that this building the data on the on this building is how much now 480. 480. so it's it's 160 000 a year for three years yeah plus the interest and the way the interest rate is it it just works out it's twenty one thousand fourteen thousand and seven thousand in interest if you ran this out through the advertising terms so there's definitely an advantage to going the bond root then paying off the building and using it as collateral for the annual expenditure for them I mean for the hurricane to guarantee it yeah you know saying we always got to keep this in fund and um you get it um underwriting wise what they look for is you know our debt service coverage um to be one and a half times our non-adv valorem Revenue are not ad valorem revenues a million three is what Heather and Kyle came up with on a consistent basis so we're you know at the first payment I haven't done it with this one but at the first payment you know we're we're 2.4 times um so we're we're super strong and so it'll only get better with a uh fifty thousand dollar cheaper payment yeah so question sure sorry if is there anything the federal government has now that Ian you know demolished Fort Myers is there anything that they might be doing grants to help us all beach cities get rid of storm water faster so Anna what is it the flood insurance program at FIP or the federal just something to look into to help give us a little love to help that's a great that'd be something you know the 800 000 we got from the uh coven fund specifically for stored water so I don't know if FEMA is doing anything in addition post nothing's come out or recently yeah and then lastly I'll shut up if we get money a year from now 400 Grand we can just apply it to the loan and take it down right there there's a penalty but that's okay well I think you can you can still pay someone ahead like we've been with the bond issues uh uh with the Bellevue estate we can if anybody wants to pay those off every year you can pay down a little bit uh yeah okay I just want to take a look what's happening we're like Hey we're trying to help ourselves and get rid of the water yeah how about a little love so thinking there's something should come from all of the discovery work that everyone is doing about the vulnerabilities of the low-lying areas and say well if you as a city can do something to improve your vulnerability in case the storm was to hit here we'll we'll give you 50 of the cost to do it and you know to your point that makes sense now whether it fits into our time frame or not well I see go time frame I was just saying have we explored maybe we should still do it the beauty is the balance sheet I should have brought that tonight I didn't but um we've still got good cash reserves I think you know our existing cash today exist some projects already and we're sitting on six million dollars in liquidity so that's the million dollar hurricane then you've got you know the reserves we build every year for each of the different components and that helps us because typically what happens with the government is if the state or County or federal says a we'll pay for this project we have to pay for it first and then we get reimbursed so I think preserving some liquidity depth and so I guess the question is is what what else do we need to work on as the citizens advisor Council to decide that we want to present this if we want to present it on in a workshop City Council well I think it makes a lot of sense for sure and with the newer numbers it even makes more sense and I don't see where anyone is going to object that if this perpetuates getting all of the storm water projects done ahead of schedule which is a good selling point for this reorder financially so I mean is there any downside that we're not considering that we should consider when you accelerate the stormwater projects right so what time frame now are we compressing into what are you estimate for the blown if we were to go down that he told me specifically uh but you you already threw that number out there in two weeks for a term sheet three to five weeks to close us let's just call it six weeks from the time we tell them to say can we get the commitment we start working on the funding um with the loan um then we just have to we have to re-bid um or get proposals for the uh for the engineering involved and then we got that all worked up and we kind of did the projects so and you think reasonably there may be a discount because we're offering a bigger project but they're also maybe a point in time when costs start to go down if you wish to listen to what Washington is telling us today you know inflation is going to go away so yeah so much a chance there that sure I really don't see the labor issued being resolved in a time frame that we're talking about completing all the projects are we saying we could shrink it to less than five years yes because once we get rolling um once we have the project put together designed we've been it out it could be multiple streets at a time getting some portions of the world yeah this is not going to take much longer than any one of our Standalone projects yeah so not even 120 days per Street no um probably full projects oh from design yeah completion well no no no I'm saying once the project starts you know that would be what the contract so what's the design timeline engineer probably could get it done comfortably I'd say at least I would say three months the pride before that isn't each Street a little different as well well it doesn't mean we have a master plan we have a design recommendations but it doesn't mean that when we have the engineer design it we don't look at modifying things like kind of like we were talking with the last project um everything that was originally in the master plan may not be needed um we may you know save money here and there yeah conversely you're going to come up with problems like you just discussed right this extra pipe found on 12th Street yeah all that stuff yeah so that'll probably balance out yeah so I don't think that what I said earlier I don't think that the labor issue is going to get resolved in the time frame that you indicated you think we could wrap the hole underground rehab project get it done you know there's no Miracles going to happen in the next two years they're going to say oh yeah we've got oversupply of Labor so the only thing that could happen would be maybe some of the construction materials cost will start to level out a little bit and at least stay level but not continue to go up I think steel and concrete have come down from when we've been 12 and 13. I would hope and are we getting to take advantage of that because that's the challenge that I see is that you know everybody's really aggressive to raise the prices up when there's just something to stand behind like inflation but they don't want to give it back as quickly yeah so they try to hold on to it so we just need to make sure that I'm just going back to build a timeline so design three months then permits how long um you gotta put it out the bin um that usually can turn around two months we can have a better reading and decide on a contractor um at that point it's going to be with this last project it took three months to get things ordered to start that's going to be a supply permit in permanent should be able to get done easily within the time of ordering we didn't have any problem with with permitting 369 and then completion I'd say what I mean even though it's multiple projects they're gonna they're gonna have all their equipment out there and just go on the next I mean I think 120s a good timeline so you're talking about 13 14 months total is that yeah yeah yeah 90 plus three or so I got three three months for design two months for bid let's go three minutes for permitting and ordering supplies and then four months for completion the five and seven months so here aware of the complete but four years yeah for five years of projects it's five something and if you're looking at where we're at now we were funded for 17th 18th this year and we haven't even started design on it what's been the track record of things finishing earlier on Timely um as far as with the contract what's the sign that there's in any of these projects we haven't had a problem getting done in the time now we got like with hurricane Ian we gave him uh like a couple weeks you know basically had to take their equipment out and put it back later they're the current project right now if all goes well at this point they have until February 1 I think we calculated and they're they're hoping to be dunked in December so if it's I don't wanna tell everybody that like yeah that's what they've told me yesterday this isn't government project or a fiesta was 12 months it's really 24. that's what you're saying yeah he and I know that very well yeah yeah once they get going you know just try to stay out of their way and keep things moving yeah you know so I mean one potential downside that you'll have to be able to answer to Is if you have half the city under construction at one time right what does that cost for people well it's a different streets so it's really not I mean you need the payoff is that you get it all done quicker yeah and that's how you sell it but that might be something that you would then have to address yeah but if we're not impacting and they all everybody wants it to start sooner than anybody that doesn't want you to tell them but we're going to be able to start earlier so I think everybody understands the benefits far outweigh the inconvenience for sure yeah but you're not going to have all of those streets under construction at the same time now they have a good day they're going to go on stages somewhere like you've got on a plan so you're not really you'll have it but it's going to be just a little bit it'll start to finish yeah they might get the storm water um all the pipe in the ground you know the inlets do the curving and then kind of fill back in with millings on all these streets and then then build through and yeah and then do all the paving like that but once they've once there that's pretty quick yeah once they go let's say Doug and it's all open trenches and they can use the same equipment to go start digging in another Street and lay the pipe right and the the Assumption behind saving on the uh the mobilization is that typical mobilization you know they're charging in three to four days per project to get the equipment out there and it's going to cut it down to like a day to just move it if that and that's just the labor and equipment needed to move yeah are there any issues with you know if somebody was scheduled to build a house because I've noticed a couple lots have been cleared and now we accelerate work on that street and they can't construct the house because the work is going on in the street does that cause an issue I don't know when you're thinking through the problems we haven't ran into it yet I'm sure we could probably work around you know we have to work around day-to-day residents coming and going and we do pretty well yeah I'm gonna first see like I'm being a little bit more of a complication but I think it could make it work thank you go ahead Tom with the work around you certain will have a schedule that will be published for all the residents to see who they can make their plans ahead of our future instruction it's a good point sure yes and absolutely give them the time streams existence is not yours during this period of time so as you make your plans to build to make sure that your needs are can be met right when that time frame and you know the more notice you can give to somebody that more powerful that is great definitely give them a heads up guys yeah I'd see I'd say right now um we got some projects that could be wrapped up by then about 17th for some empty lots um I don't know if anything Construction on 19th 20th at this point where lots are getting cleared and so yeah so yeah there's a lot of projects that have now been put on hold to the slippers who are out there buying everything up and now sort of disappeared and the plans aren't as I want to wait when you're finished let me know okay I want to weigh in about Duke Energy in in past meetings when we've had talking about the undergrounding projects on golf it seems like we're at the mercy of Duke Energy and they're subcontractors or whatever um if this is all part of this bond issue and everything and we get this bond issue approved and we start going forward so on and so forth what's gonna um what guarantee are we going to have once we tell them it's a go they're going to get started and pardon the nautical term not drag their anchor and be out there for two days and go away for three and then come back for two and go away for four because it seems like that's happened in occurrences you know in late traveling Gulf Boulevard you see them out there for a day or two and then they're gone you know if you're going to commit and you're going to pay somebody something they need to commit and get get it done and I don't know where we stand on that leverage other than um you give them a time frame as far as in the contract I guess and it should be penalty clauses we're correct um it's when you're talking Duke Energy I can barge already looked over the agreement I know they have a lot of weight um and if there's any kind of emergency in the state that's typically what's going to well that would take precedence that I can understand yeah um how excited that I I'm talking to them I'm confident that they're not going to drag um for the purpose of just not wanting to do it um because they're the price is locked in now right right they drag then it's gonna it is okay yeah and show me prices to walk yeah yeah and I think I've heard too that in the past we've had a little bit of a problem with um Spectrum Spectrum has been far more of a problem yeah this last one they're still they still have something across they do they still got from 12 North yeah yes who's someone's got doesn't look like a special mom looks like a guy wire between two poles there's something around 19th or in that area yeah there's no cables attached to it they're looking to take care of okay all right based on what you said you know you know I would make the motion that we present this in a work session to counsel and let them see what they want to do I think prior to that um John Doe I think I probably need to do some homework and break it up into what's stormwater okay what's capital okay and then we can run the tests to make sure that they each qualify okay um so I'm not worried about Capital I'm worried more about storm water right okay because what is that what's that annual revenue 170. that sounds right 175. so that we're doing a lot of storm water here oh yeah so okay in your Breakaway time you're going to also come with a plan of action for each literally Circle back as far as payoff is concerned was that not something that that we discussed at this level we just propose yeah I think what we just propose here's the sources and uses okay and so the uses would be the payoff yeah the budget 175 for their assessments okay all right that makes sense and yes that worries me 175 because if stored water only is getting 175 000 a year we've already got a small little budget the bulk of this is storm water so I got to see if there's a way we can hold on a general obligation a little not as alarm working to the city guarantee store water with at velor that's basically I think where I need to see if we can go I mean how much it functions and yeah the general fund is when we need it is moved over into the stormwater fund for everything to cover everything that's not and uh yeah because again it's just the way it works we budgeted seven hundred thousand dollars this year especially more can be moved over yeah to get the bond issue done do we have to nail that number down I need to make sure that we can pledge and maybe you and Heather and I need to get on a call because she's going to be fine with you know not ad valorem being pledged to support water but if if the ability to do that is already on the books for us yeah that should be fine the practice is yeah I think the city I think city council would agree to do it because the historically budgeted out of right traditional capital budget Tim fund stormwater projects but it's only storm water we only created this separate fund what two three years ago so it's so it doesn't happen it's new and we did that small bond issue with it so okay so we'll probably have at least one more meeting amongst ourselves yes you see if over the next um 10 days or so we can get our information together and then have another meeting and I don't know um any kind of workshops for December we did it first in January in December that it could happen but it was called yeah yeah it was like us to be fully prepared to answer any of the questions that the city council and citizens may have thank you when we when we showed them so that um okay there's no we don't have to have another meat eater or something else obviously you'll have to vote on it at some point but at least we will have done everything we can to ensure that we brought them all the information but if you guys think of any questions or whatever pick them to Kyle they can afford them to me okay um any other General business the council wants to talk about um if any if any of you guys do come up with possible questions Council may have and there's more homework to be done just email them indirectly so I'm thinking you know at this point not that I think it's a a very good option right now um but I could lay out with um like Swift Mud Swift mode they're giving funding if you do some sort of water treatment inside of your system when you're doing it um I don't know with the filter qualify things would be able to CDs units but um given the added cost of the project for that and how much they're going to contribute to the total I still got to work those numbers out of it but if I start at least giving current options of what is available that is being looked at and again with any of these grants anytime you apply for them they're going to require that we show that these projects are designed and budgeted for so that you know you're gonna you can already start down that road and then apply to the ground right you know it actually makes it easier yeah with the resiliency grants you got the brick program they just opened up some ways to get closer to having the cost benefit ratio but again plays more into uh communities with certain at need Democrats where we struggle demographics um do you need to lay out when presenting this do you need to lay out what the alternative is if you if the council decides not to do this there's still a major shortfall right in all these projects so what is what then happens and what's the cost of this what's the cost of that in terms of time in terms of money that's a good point I don't think anybody is going to vote against shortening the length of time to get the city 100 well we still need it all depends on people's people who weigh the cost but I think if I was on the council I would want to hear okay I see your recommendation what happens if we don't do that what what are the other Alternatives my recommendation if we do not do a bond issue it would be we're at least to combine the next two projects together to to get that done just to try and move things along catch up sort of with our timeline because we're funny we're funded Beyond where we're at right now just to you know what I mean to try and save something and get more to come right but then it catches you up with you later on right because you're unfunded you have a shortfall well you know it just it puts us more of being on a timeline when as soon as money is available that we just yeah are using it I would at least want to get to that point yeah so we have to be able to speak to that intelligently right and you know I like that you know what all filters through if you make this decision as far as time and money and that is the only inflation cost that increases sure it's going to happen and as you only added the expense to this whole project would be the interest on the bond yes where they're getting material and labor savings yeah we can move the schedule up there's no more out of pocket money to get the job done is attractive sounding for sure okay hypothetical question two okay let's assume Council approves the bond issue we we're at the point now that we have a contractor is there enough space up there at um the marina to where the contractor can buy material in advance so there's no delay in the supply line he progresses you know what I'm saying I think the way they've done the projects and using the use of the right away they're not once they start and they start ordering they're going to be able to lay it out in the right way oh okay don't let me run out of the story yeah so you'll get extra handling it's true too yeah but I would always open that up as I'm sure okay if you're gonna need more space all right the other thing I wanted to point out about another meeting just if we have one here in the next next month early January I would not be available December 6th through the eighth and the second week of January both times I will be in Washington I'm the national you've heard probably heard councilman um I call him Captain Mike I am the national vice president of a veteran service organization now and I'm supposed to be in Washington for uh Pearl Harbor services and then there's other issues that I and our national president are going to be dealing with at our headquarters we're going to be up there all week in January so just those two windows just to give you a heads up per se your leadership with the group and we'll keep it more sure okay for sure zoom in that too that's fine you know I hope to have a laptop by then I don't have one yet back to homework uh we'll tighten up um bringing in between capital projects and storm water projects and probably have a conversation with the bank and then probably look at the budgets they'd be thinking out future years cash flow excess cash flow um see if there's any way I would Council might come back at like do we just fund this go ahead get it all pre-approved and we'll get it funded down the road but okay time any other comments questions participated by the council work session if they ask what other alternatives to the funding that are out there whether it's uh grass and so forth I take it you have a ready answer for that yeah so that's what I'm going to start putting together getting the grant programs that are out there in the timelines and what actually reasonable expectations we can have for those grants thanks great any other business anybody wants to talk about stop yeah okay thank you you're gonna motion to do a jerk so move a second all favorite all right all right"
