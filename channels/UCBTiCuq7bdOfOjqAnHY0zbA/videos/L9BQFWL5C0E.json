    "transcript": "foreign hey everyone today is July the 17th 2023 it is now 6 p.m and this is the City Council budget workshop for the city of Bellair Beach uh meetings call to order and now let's do the Pledge of Allegiance congratulations Betty would you please call the law council member Frank thank you council member of the Linda Livingstone yeah council member Wesley Notaro their councilmember Lloyd Roberts council member Mike Saban mayor Dave goddess city manager Kyle richler and vice mayor Jody Shirley was unable to attend thank you Patty I know we only have one item one agenda item on this Workshop which is discussion and review of fiscal year 2023-2024 budget I'm going to uh [Music] made it over to city manager reefler take it away thank you man so of course I don't want to just run through some of the changes from the last draft to this one that we talked about in the last budget Workshop um page nine I'm sorry baby start with PJ um the rental Revenue registration we upped that back up from uh I think it was at like 10 back up to 62 500. under [Music] their license and registration I'll have that on the page okay rental property registration um page [Music] um News Center rental income we uh of that a little bit more to the uh accurately what the actual was so I think it was at 25 and I got it up between the uh rental weddings and the rental parties up to 30. I was in Revenue we're on page 27 we stopped serving stop the savings plan for the um computer hardware and software now that I noticed that I'm not going to pleasure the 2500 for next budget either misunderstood and then I'm doing 55. room Insurance success uh increase this year um so the insurance we had at uh 3 000 and dumped it up to 4 000. um last year was a little over it shows two years ago but the last year's actual was about 3 350. so it came up a little bit this year so I raised that and um it's like what is that cover sport um like that covers the general liability you know with the catwalks and Docs pretty much 15. and then stories will be changed I said there were savings from the 7 500 each year to 10 000 to save a little bit more or whatever we need to repair so that didn't actually change whether I plan to have that changed well I have some items for your consideration um based on our last discussion uh the first item and I sent this uh to you via email it's uh it's on page 12 so it'll be under the City Council budget and race would be uh five eleven uh 490. oh sorry yes uh hello miscellaneous recording meetings right what do we say city council City Council budget on page 12 yeah and then uh under recording readings we currently have a budget of ten thousand dollars um the last two Council meetings you've seen Victor come in and set up something different we've been just testing and trying out uh uh to improve the live video function um for the people that want to watch the meeting from home and at the same time tackle the recording services that we already have provided um they took it together his proposal um with a explanation and it would require us to increase the budget from the 10 000 to the 13 000 in the cover our current meetings um to be honest I looked at the uh at the statistics from the live YouTube right now we average about four viewers but they typically watch every meeting um ideally it would be you know it's something that we'd want to attract more people to get involved and watch their meetings try to make it easier for them to do it from home rather than having to come in you know they can eat dinner or do something else at the same time um can you tell how many or you can tell you can tell everyone I survive and you can tell me a few of the video afterwards I understand it but you can tell how many sort of line they're watching it live yes yeah um right now what do you see on Zoom if they log in for Zoom you can see them if if since we offer the live feed on YouTube that doesn't require them to sign in or anything they just click on it it streams it I think most people prefer that but statistically um they put together numbers that tell you you know how many watched and what the peak the viewers were now let me ask you um obviously what we saw on YouTube we didn't get to see it live I saw some things change back there on that screen but I don't think that's what we were broadcasting to YouTube is that correct or live we weren't actually sending out what was on that screen live correct um if you saw it afterwards of clarification but if you saw the names popping up and the cameras changing it's edited that but he's doing it all in lifetime yeah I always comes out on the the monitors when we were talking okay all right yes yeah but did that go out to the public yeah that is what they're seeing and then what is what is becoming the recorded file is that actual live stream okay he's using different equipment he's got that microphone that's picking up things on the floor um and I've heard that there was some background noise like I mean I would ask him to see if we can dial that in better um but when it comes to it I mean I just want to be up front with you know right now or whatever viewership is um ideally we want more um but this just makes it a little bit more watchable if you are going to use the uh the option on staying home it also from my standpoint has somebody actually administering the meeting so he's sitting over there um you know troubleshooting if there's any issues if we have someone presenting on the screen and things need to be switched around he can do it as opposed to me getting up and you know going over I have no problem doing it but it does it does tackle that issue um and that's something we were looking for and I definitely didn't like the fact that you were having to do it um so I guess the question is is it worth the extra four thousand dollars to have a better quality recordings and live feeds uh as well as the labeling and then somebody actually moderating the zoom meeting that's that's the question I said that's the question um hey Deborah if you watch it if you compare it but I don't know if you watch the older ones where it's just that still cam it's it's kind of hard to see anything that's going on the other ones you it was hard to even tell it I mean obviously you could listen to the voice but if you weren't aware and didn't uh frequent our meetings you didn't even you couldn't tell who was even speaking so definitely an improvement uh again I'll ask the council is it worth four thousand dollars those have input so that is one of the big differences that previously you may or may not see who's actually speaking whereas with this new approach he's going to be able to move the camera on and like so he operates two at once um and yes he Zooms in he kind of has one on who's talking and then he's gonna he can back off that shot when you know to get to the next person talking so he's kind of editing while he's while he's recording um if you notice too and someone's at the podium he's got like an angle on them okay and he's turning it so we were not doing that previously for the ten thousand no we were not doing that so he was a with a two separate tripod cameras okay um and then you had to edit it afterwards and then it was like getting uploaded to YouTube but just as a video not as the live feed now that uh the person that was there that night that was his dad but was he actually assisting or was he just there um he comes and he have set up but I don't think there's much involvement with that I think he billed US based on the the labor intensity of what he's doing versus you know just operating the camera so I first saw this up I thought it was the additional cops was really just focused on that you know that it was called power on the naming at the bottom but if the key was well I guess Mr left on said was it enables you to sit there and do your job in that case I'd be in favor of it because it takes you out of the tech shooting role and you can concentrate on the city's business at that point right and I I see Victor as you know he's very tech savvy so if some issue does come up that's unexpected or wearing out he can address it without having to kind of interrupt all right uh council member Livingstone I think from a professional perspective it looks it's a higher quality and also from a historical data perspective I think it'll be easier for folks to go back and track things um and then of course there's a issue with Kyle having to get up so I'm in favor okay and uh Mike we uh we heard you you said you're in favor yes all right I'm saving right I think it might be um Oprah too once you're comfortable with the way everything looks maybe you put something on our website letting people know they've even proved this because it may be some people out there that made me tried to watch it previously and got through over there so maybe more people will start watching it yeah it's a good idea I'd like to blast it out to the email there you know Mr Banker so you're saying we're only getting about four average viewers yes um I feel like we've lost some I think we started a little bit better um when we started doing this all but I think part of it is because of the difficulty I'm watching not only that but I think the subject matter is of great importance when you have contentious city council you got viewers if you're doing your job viewership drops it was like a thousand dollars of you you know escalates into something I mean are we selling a contract or we just agreeing that okay this is the new rate and uh let's move forward well I mean I can work that out uh with Victor if we want to it's just one year right yeah okay okay and there's yeah okay I am too uh I say we move forward with that moves to 14. um said you went through changes there's one that we mentioned I'm not sure last working group about a a boat budget of some type yeah that's on the list [Music] okay the next discussion item is Page 16. and that's in the non-departmental budget this will be Professional Services other which is 519 through 10. top of the uh operating and this is going to be um budget increase for the land and development code update um the last I think it was one of the work sessions I brought up the need to update chapters of the code that have not been updated in a while um mainly considering the chapter 10 construction code um the chapters 7D so yeah 71st drug plan in chapter 90 for the zoning these are all Land Development codes and this wouldn't be solely based on those chapters only that we also incorporate any other code sections that we thought needed to be reviewed but it was brought up I think by the vice mayor that um if we were to do a code review it would be best that we had a consultant a planner who has experience in in the codes today and and uh we'll review it and then and then present it in a way that um the board can make the recommendation and fully understanding the code as opposed to maybe not not really knowing what they're reading so I found two um consultant groups or uh for professional planning and bathroom had contracts with other municipalities the better of the two prices I found in a proposal whereas um an increase of thirty thousand dollars so it is a pricing Endeavor to do this um but this would this would include meetings with the planning zone there which is Our Land Development board um open to the public of course for like a public Workshop of if there's anything else that the public sees we need to to advise um so locally at least two meetings with them making recommendations explaining those recommendations and and um having them approve something to go to the council and then it would be two two readings um ordinance drafted by the planner reviewed by our attorney but I did talk to them and they thought in their experience the attorney would just need to review the ordinances that they write um and they've never really had any major changes from an attorney so our Legal Services we wouldn't expect any major increases with that but that's the other um Range I got was closer to forty thousand dollars so if we were going to do this with a consultant we'd hadn't we need to increase our special services budget at least thirty thousand where does this stand with um with the impact study that's going to be required of us uh whenever we do ordinance changes um the planner is very aware of the requirements for the impact studies so that is built in the cost I have forgot to mentioned they're also going to do the updates to the code for the cop comprehensive plan they're saying that not only would they draft it but they would also do the impact study while they're doing the drafting so that we don't have to pay someone else whenever we um approve a new ordinance from that I understood that you understand what their requirements are okay oh yes if that's the case that's a deal that's a that's a good idea because having to do an impact study every time we change something excuse me in our in our code um can get very pricey and I don't think any of us have the expertise to do that so it would require Outsourcing um I'm uh I remember we were looking at the zoning is this only Zoning for right now or is this the entire code this is the entire curve but the sections that I'm focusing on are the um delivering code chapter 10. chapter 75 airplane management and then chapter 94 zoning okay and they're pretty much the most extensive chapters right okay well this also fix our our problem with swimming pools yes chapter chapter 10. okay yes um a quick list that I kind of but I gave them you know so some of this was the height of the swimming pool um then I also from recommendations of of residents and council members um so so looking at the set bot it's a setback requirements for docs especially when we have exception for pie shape rats for you know you know building setback but also considerations for docs because that's something that does come up in variance um chapter 94255 we have a uh threat color which is twenty thousand dollars anything over um you know we're required to to either get the uh certified appraisal of the structure um to compare to the flood code um twenty thousand dollars was in the early 90s was that that was the number set now you can there's a lot of things you can do to your home and get over the twenty thousand dollars and um that probably needs to come up um you have nothing on non-structural fill um and that's kind of presented issues from my experiences just in the building and where where property levels are ending up as opposed to I mean we have the grading so that they're journaling properly but you also you're ending up with people's lives are turning into retaining laws and they're not really retaining most so that's something to look into um I put some regulations for generators um it's kind of been lumped under equipment but there's maybe some considerations that we actually have some regulations on General generators um another thing I know is we don't have any we have no um not even our assigned code this will say where a flagpole can be um that's just something I think should be in there um one of the another thing I want to talk to is the whole front setback at hedge issue um I want to come up with something realistic that we can get everybody in Conformity throughout the city um without any specifies the actual clearance over the roadway we have eight feet um height over a sidewalk but we have nothing that actually talks about overhanging over roadways thank you I'm sorry just a quick question on page 16 there because it just caught my eye so that not going to be part of mental department so is that for the salaries is that for Laura and the new admin person are they considered yes so let's go through the full time right so that's the full time and the current salaries of Laura it's the salary of where the executive assistant and the salary of the admin assistant at a full-time perfect perfect on this on my list was um what we're seeing now is uh instead of just having rentals for the uh for houses and Condominiums so people are running out amenities on their property as it pools and such so we want to try and get ahead of that thank you um Randy's got a little background in that as well yeah I got a question I feel pursue it later on but uh it's no mystery that you can almost expect maybe six to seven council members gone um between elections next year any turnover prior to January 1st I just want to make sure we have enough budgeted for professional development for the hotels everything needed for the um foundational education we kept our Council budget the same for our travel will that handle seven members total for the year if we have sex thank you in 2022 budget um I think that was a four members maybe a three-member turnover the action was thirty four hundred dollars we budget in that account you know nine thousand okay so here yeah it sounds like your government we've always had an automatic account um but we don't really spend it but it could we may spend it if that's the case okay back to the uh approving uh what he's asking for the thirty thousand for Professional Services uh the modifier code everybody agree with that yes yes if it includes the impact studies is that what you're talking about yes I'm sorry impact study uh that's that's what we're hoping for eign okay so on the same page 16. Professional Services legal we talked about um doing a charter review I got some numbers back from Randy um and his in his assessment long story short um we need at least ten thousand dollars he predicts paralegal for doing the charter review um he presents a lot of elements that you know if there's you know residents that you know bring challenge um and and it involves more legal research and uh explanation than it could be a little bit more um I think a safe budget number would be 15 000 with their expectation may stay under it for sure you said 15 15 but I think just to be safe because you never know I mean if we were to I can make some changes what do we required every 10 years we do it to everyone I believe it at all I have to check that receiving Charter review on other issues such as uh extending the number of terms my question was how often do you have to do it I want to say five we just did what I thought we we had set was five and we just did one what three find out two years three years ago why respect it so we have to do another one two years anyway yeah but I think some I mean there's also consensual race for salaries for City Council Members removing term limits or at least exceeding from two to three and extending terms you know all kind of re-driven by that uh Forum six I think the salaries doesn't fall under the charter yes that's already in the charter to accommodate that now my question is though you're gonna have to do another one if you're only doing a Porsche or you don't have to do another one in two years so what I spent fifteen thousand on doing one now um I think uh he's raising the question because uh uh after next week's meeting we made decide that there is a need uh to modify the charter and uh and we'll see how that meeting pans out and again it's a budget uh just a number of budgets budget for it and if we don't spend it we don't spend it and this estimate is for the full Charter so it is he estimates the 70 pages and calculates his hours all right did you have any other items um we're gonna put this in the budget everybody okay with that yes okay and I'll find out the years okay page 20. is the handout the uh maintenance worker issue that would be our uh let us position in public works which uh you asked that if we were to consider adding an additional worker to the public works department what that cost would look like what I did is I just broke it out each personal service line item for that one worker which would be the maintenance worker too um and then I also showed as you know with the stonewater fund that's 15 is is set for the months you only see an 85 percent of the salary in the public works budget so I just laid out like this because you don't see that in our typical budget now that that amount is already included on page 20 then that is that it was put in the budget and I thought it was best to stick it in there and to break it out so you can see how it looks foreign so in the previous world I've lived in you know we would have line-eyed um flexibility so you could overspin and under spin within line items then it got to a different level like in our world here it would be like uh when a public Roads Department yes you know you could move light irons again to overspin understand but at the end of the day when the year ended you could not exceed I'm just taking this as an example the total budget for Public Works in in here for that particular Year yes so how do we do hearing this yes exactly how we do it okay um we you can as long as you stay within a departmental budget um you're good in the game as long as you meet that bottom line okay thanks I have no questions about that anyone else nope is the money okay with that I brought this up at the audit um committee meeting um we are it is getting tougher for all cities in this area to obtain and and retain employees especially because cost of living so my if this doesn't work really struggle actually finding a good quality third person um the next thing I would look into would be um providing Relief by Contracting out some Services um whether it be landscape here but I just wanted to I think this would be the best the best route to have before and this is basically in response to losing you is that correct you moving up to the city manager position and and we basically lost an employee is that right no that that was not um the reason why in this is that um that we constantly feel that we have we're getting by with our main is um we could provide better service um the idea is that um right now our employees when we have to struggle to take time off um right now if they do it's it's kind of like a Scrabble things get behind whenever we take on a special project things get behind um this is in my mind if we had another person there would be no problem um keeping them busy and we could provide better service but I also think that uh you were able to assist often where now you're really too busy to be doing that so it makes sense to me um I I don't really have a problem with it um comments well that's a great idea I just have a quick question on the timeline so this is approved and as the budget is being approved and going along when can you actually start advertising October 1st so we couldn't advertise before that so when the budget is available October 1st we could be ready yeah I mean as long as yeah there's no issues from the you know the first regular meeting first hearing very good yeah that'd be a recommendation that maybe we could you know whosoever hopefully we'll find a great candidate and at that point you can tell them what a starting date is ten one sorry because that's when the money is available 37 000 is awful low figure because what's this what's the same screen readers and cheap laborers at skilled um I don't know what you're gonna who you're gonna get for less than 800 a month a week don't we've got somebody now um like I said it's a struggle to find a lot of people it's very hard for someone to live on that wage really I can imagine I think you should go up I don't have a problem I think we need another main Instagram wholeheartedly I think you're underpaid we're doing well underpaid do we know when I've been just an estimate about what some of the other towns like anywhere on speech for example what do they pay for their in your rocks is lower yeah we're we're yeah okay wow yeah my recommendation would be to follow the city manager's recommendation if it doesn't work out he can come back for uh city manager meetings that all the municipalities are struggling to understand they're having they can't fill these positions okay that's that's good thanks for doing that guy all right and the last I have is about um and that's gonna be page 33. so I found a small Patrol boat um it's a 21 foot it's one of the inflatable Halls it's uh it was found on a GSA government contract um a lot of police departments yeah um I found it on a contract that is good until 2028 um I put on the budget for a hundred thousand um the actual credit price I got this month was uh 81 000 that's for the boat and trailer but we're also and I'll accept that obviously expenses and as any individual additional Insurance well uh fuel oil maintenance that type of and um I still get any other operations but there needs to be boating safety training for the staff um and I and the way I would see this um the primary user would be the community services administrator um but we were trying to stop so look if we approve this what do we get our money what how often would would the uh all of the sea walls and Dock and the the area be patrolled uh because uh you're probably more than maintenance you're probably wanting to know the condition of of the community obviously it's going to help with with certain items especially whenever it comes to the uh the drainage in doing inspections there but um I just don't want to buy it and then it just sits there no I would expect it at least minimum every two weeks to get to use but you know a weekly basis I think there's a place in Dunedin you can rent it's like 500 a month um you're guaranteed a boat um they don't want to Clearwater boat club yeah and um if you're right and um you get the keys and you turn the keys back in and throw it up and goodbye there's no maintenance I think it wasn't too much I thought I was like maybe five years because I've been out on this yeah yes sure you become a member you're guaranteed a vote you're not guaranteed it's a specific third class you're talking about Freedom Boat Club yeah something like that yes I have a feeling that they would shut Kyle down immediately if they found out it was for official business right I I just have a feeling that they will say no can we but it doesn't hurt to happen I think the the disadvantage to having a service like that and I'm not I'm not opposed to saving money at all or or leasing or or not leasing but renting boats uh it's the um certain services to get a deal you join the club and then you kind of have to do a reservation in advance well what good does that do you if you have an emergency and you need to go check something uh so can we use a sheriff if we have an emergency or the fire department I think they provide I don't know yeah I don't know I I believe that one with appearance like it'd be nice to have a boat out there to pull off that piling that's floating that's what we have Kyle for exactly yeah so this is yeah as well yes it's a motor in the trailer here's everything so explain to me how this uh how this works I see twenty thousand dollars for the next five years uh when would you get your vote so um so I figured out because with the last Workshop we said Savings Plan um when I was talking to the vice mayor today she's after meeting with the audit committee who's in support of the boat she is in support uh because she wants it to be considered um purchasing this budget year so you'd be basically haven't you're you're taking an internal one buy it now and then every month every year for the next five years you're gonna put twenty thousand dollars in the budget the only concern being is what happens if we cut the budget well really we just we would just purchased it we budgeted all this coming budget and we'd purchase it yeah true do we have that room I just yes we had money budgeted for the uh generator this looks like a good option no you're not getting one granddad's boat they're good bucks Reds or Williams pretty much both for the chair of the audit committee bronze organic heat something he does with his business he has experience with those books so he's looking into it in the pricing and they do not rare on those Halls not the GSA just had to you know ask Gabe versus coming from you know Department of Homeland Security and which point no I don't want it purchasing sometimes they sell them off the uh they used GSA site this is quoted from somewhere in Florida I think down south new off of that contract okay good I don't want to put you on the spot but the one that you pulled up on me on the dock we're not getting that one right okay I'm just saying can I get a place on that wouldn't happen something that would be better that one is only uh that's a I believe it's a 11 or 12 footer right and uh powered by a 20 horsepower engine yeah I like the other idea the mobile command post you can borrow his RV for that yeah uh anyway I think the total price tag on that one is in round fifteen thousand that's right with that suffice though I don't know is it a one-man or two-man operation and are you going to be carrying tools with you definitely want something we can carry the the tools with us and be able to move decent way I forgot what the capacity I think it was eight passengers on that but what it might say the weight capacity but it's fuel motor I wouldn't recommend what I have for anything except for place you're doing this is not a prime pickle boat thank you uh and it's not it's underpowered so you put something heavy in another person on there it's um I mean it'll get you there but I I wouldn't recommend it for being professional let's take care of the community vehicle herbs we abuse them you can really do a lot with those you know I'm saying we're about 15 20. I can also tell you if you're getting a 21 footer with what what kind of engine is on it it was a 100 horsepower [Music] the Inflatables are probably the most expensive out of all of them but they're also the most versatile the shallow water yeah shallow water and just for getting them in and out of the water it's they're much easier plus you bump up against something you're not damaging it you get built-in fenders um I don't know let's uh let's just go around the room uh Frank what do you think I think we should explore the rental option um I hate to say see a hundred thousand dollars if you could be that kind of money could be spent more wisely than other things Leslie I would be in favor of purchase all right Belinda I would be in favor with a timeline included for the responsible individual just like you have on your HVAC checks Etc okay you're going to go out in addition to your emergencies of course but you're going to go out twice a week and they check off and sign up whenever they've gone off I think that having an understood timeline for rounds is very important if we're gonna that would carry this expense Mike uh that'd be over here with you know go out checks if we can do this with a rental agreement or at least but I agree with the vote I would just ask if when you do do that we really need a need statement a lot of people may think this is a fun thing nice to have but just really need a strong justification going based on celebration yes we will be doing every two weeks this is exactly what we are doing when we go out you know who will be on there why don't you use where's the store yeah so how does it how does the timeline work so we approve this so 20 000 a year for five years when do you actually get the vote so at any point you can have a savings plan for something at any point you can say let's just purchase it now and you know put the extra end of the council if that's what their wishes um what the vice mayor want to considered is that we do it sooner or later I mean I can put it in the budget for 50 000 in the next two years you know it's kind of a meeting in the middle that's what I would be about wait wait five years that's just too far down the road so um if you think it's a good idea and it's Justified then um you know I'm in favor of that and they're getting it right away whatever funding sources we would need to have all right um out of the generator money how much did we have saved we had 250 and how much of that have we spent all right uh I I don't like spending that kind of money um but on the other hand I've I've been complaining about not having this service uh as far as uh Mr zabel's concerns uh uh and also living Stone's concerns about usage and being careful and things like that I believe that if we do this I want it striped up that it says Bellaire Beach all over it uh City Hall whatever even if it's your name all over it so that uh whenever that boat is seen everyone knows that we're actually doing our job and examining the city and making sure that uh we're healthy as a city uh and that we're we're keeping a close eye on things because for years um too much has been allowed to happen on our uh on our water and uh also I think it would give us the opportunity to go right over circle around these boats that are always in the water and uh and if we think that there's a problem then then we know what to do we can call a a higher authority and have them come check it out also and maybe that will uh that will stop some of some of that from happening so uh I I would agree uh with vice mayor Shirley yes I I will be more than happy to move forward on that I brought this up in the audit committee meeting um that island that party island out there that is actually ours yeah jurisdiction we could actually we could build in force the rules on there finally um those weird things out there I've been out there once trying to through their political sign somebody didn't like but I had to take down both Flags um because the attorney recommended that um let me get this straight there's a party going on on that island I'm gonna go check it out there on a desert island there's there's that one boat you know and beaten Bridge cleanup this past Saturday a resident that has a boat says that boat right here has been there for two years two years and I said does it move he says I think it moves every once in a while but it could be an anchor moving but he has never seen anybody on like how long do you and it's you can just see it's deteriorating from the bridge how long do you have to yeah uh somehow they get marked as dead and then eventually the county will come along and do something about it but um how do we get it more if you feel that it can't um function like it's not navigable they get the county will come and check it out and make them pass a test so if you really think that it it can't operate well you see it does it have a bulge pump or something on it or you know it's it's it just all depends upon weather inhabitants are on it and and you know there's always reasons why why you can um why you can report them but there's also more reasons why you can't I remember really saying that you know to remove it to another big hurdle right all right so uh let's go back uh uh everyone's somewhat approved your uh you're okay you're okay you're wanting to check out the mental Services would you please do that anyway and uh and if we can if if that service is out there and it's readily available then something to consider but going back to inconvenience if there's an emergency you're going to have to go get it you're going to have to rent it you're going to have to sign the paperwork you're going to have to drag it up the street if there's any if there's a we have like a life safety emergency you know we got the sheriff but if there's definitely an urgent issue on whether it has um debris in the water or something it needs to be checked out then yeah that would be difficult to get on it and you got the time involved but I'll look into it okay all right any other comments or questions on that particular topic all right I think for the most part we're uh we're leaning towards yes you can have your bow okay all right I'll get that answered that is all I had all right Council uh did anyone have any other changes that they are questions comments uh recommended changes about this budget on our insurance you were going to look at movies like a 75 increase sinking fair amount I mean um I think that's Friday afternoon the insurance representative from the Brown and Brown that I was getting the quotes from he came by and posting to tell me that he could not offer upload anywhere near what we're currently getting from before we wouldn't know or leave the city's fmit that's what we thought um our lawsuits we've had in the last five years they just they've seen the activity and and the cases we got going on and they just can't quote anything near it we did say you know if we can tell a different story um you know in the next couple of years come back around you know if things kind of clean up and and we'll offer us a quote you know also aren't we uh don't we get the luxury of a group rate because of all the cities are combined it's it's self-funded insurance by the Florida league is that right yeah that's the most well um I think other cities do get decent quotes with with brown and brown but given our situation they looked into us and you know I kind of give them a history of our claims okay yeah so that's what I got I answer your question Mr Banker any other comments or uh no all right well um everybody okay with this budget yes yes anybody feel good about it right well it sounds like the council agrees and uh letting the vote on it at the next meeting thank you all right good deal and a great job on that I mean um should I make a motion to adjourn or what's it I'm actually the before we do that I will ask for a motion to adjourn but not again what I'm going to do is ask for a motion to adjourn uh for 10 minutes and then uh in 10 minutes after we do adjourn we have the military meetings so now Mr zabel would you like to make a motion too oh you can make a motion to adjourn and congratulations for beating Mr Banker all in favor workshops don't count yeah thank you hello everyone it is Monday July the 17th 2023 it is now 7 P.M this is a special city council meeting for the city of Bellaire Beach Florida uh please arise and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance this Gentry would you please call the roads council member Frank thank you president council member of Belinda Livingstone here council member Leslie Notaro here council member Lloyd Roberts council member Mike zabel here vice mayor Jody Shirley here mayor Dave Gaddis here and city manager Kyle roofer here thank you Patty we have one agenda item from a special meeting if that is for consideration of setting the tentative millage rate for fiscal year 2023 and 2024. uh this agenda item was placed on uh tonight's program by city manager Ruther I will turn it over to the city manager thank you man so the gross taxable value came back at 809 623 I say 809 million 623 280 that's an increase uh from last year's gross tax taxable value of roughly 79 000 you know 80 percentage of 10.85 [Music] which will generally the revenue of 1 million 737 425 at the 96 collection rate and that's based on the early discount if everybody was to pay early and the important thing about setting the temperature of the military is whatever number you set the millage at it cannot be increased um unless you have a uh was each taxpayers may have a revised notice of proposed property tax that's something that is is a process we want to avoid um the current market rate is the 2.0394 Mills um that is what we had last year for a number of years um and currently if the Miles Road stays the same um for this year's gross taxable value um the net adverb Revenue will be one million five hundred and eighty five thousand on our dollars in the budget the second page you'll see the uh the two Republic hearings we're going to have to adopt the military the first one is a regular council meeting which is Wednesday September 6th um we'll also adopt with the first hearing for the budget and then the second uh public hearing for the budget in the final military will be September 18th that's a Monday um there's a determination another schedule that is laid out just to understand the dates uh it is my recommendation uh to keep the merge at the current 2.039 thermos um I believe that with our budget projections that we've made over the past year we spent a lot of time um you know in the process of our bond issue calculating our Stone level projects and then some of our new things that we're planning for the future that that is in the best interest of the city to stay at that military thank you Mr reefer um before we vote on this uh we're going to have to have a motion but I I can't take one right now because I'm going to have to go to the citizens for public comments would any citizens like to speak on this topic all right citizen comments are closed uh do I have a motion I have a motion that we take the 2.0394 motion is made by Frank Banker do I have a second second comments would anyone like to comment on this before we take a vote I hope at the end we can go back to the rollback but well since we can't increase let's go with the 2.0394 all right thank you other comments I think um I think our citizens from what I hear and of course I don't talk to everybody in the city but I think the gut feeling I get is that um they would love for us to do more and um to do more we need we need more money so that's that's why I would be against the rollback I think any additional funding we can get because the appraised values have gone up uh will help us to get things that the city wants done thank you for those comments others no all right well I say we take it to a vote we're going to have to uh do a Voice vote so uh is there something that I'm supposed to read Patty because I don't have anything special yeah no nothing that I have okay all right the motion the second and the roll call yes in a roll call vote uh anytime we deal with big money I like to have it on record all right uh please call the roller council member Banker yes council member Livingstone yes councilmember Notaro yes councilmember Roberts I'm council member Sabo aye Vice May Shirley I mayor Davis I am so it passes unanimously the tentative millage rate will be set at 2.0394 Mills those people who are drunk second all in favor foreign"
