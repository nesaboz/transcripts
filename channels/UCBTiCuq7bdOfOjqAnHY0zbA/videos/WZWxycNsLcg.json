get approval of the agenda from the september 1st 2020 meeting and i have a motion to make a motion to it was september 1st september 1st 2nd 2nd 2nd okay motion was made by george and seconded by dev to approve the agenda all in favor all right okay so it is okay um if we could just because we're all pretty much new to each other if we could just do a brief i know if you did like a couple sentences like your name and just maybe where you live that would be [Music] great straight and then enter for 10 years about 15 years ago i'm rick schack i live on 13th street 105 13th street i've lived in bellar beach for 10 years and have been on this my second year on the boxing record and i'm currently secretary it's just butler beach three years ago and i'm just happy to be here i wanted to volunteer since i moved here hi i'm kelly i'm tammy's neighbor um i've lived here four years small business owner and first time volunteer with the city and very happy to be here thank you i'm nicole sessman i live on harbor drive and i've been here a little bit over a year i'm kyle riepler i'm the community services administrator for the city of feller beach and i've been working for dollar beach about two and a half years i'm glenn reeves i'm the city manager 22 years okay so a couple things on our agenda that we need to go over today i'm going to try to end this by 5 30 so if you're somewhere to be then feel free to like we'll try to we'll try to wrap it up by then someone has to walk out early i she made copies of like my notes that i made for myself so a lot of it might be chicken scratch to you but it's just like my thoughts on our topics of discussion so obviously anything can be crossed out during an average kind of brainstorming since we're starting from scratch we're gonna like one of the things that's what rick you know discussed last night about doing the surveys so i'm just gonna give you any such thing at the top why are you passing those out and i i'm sorry i'd like to make a motion to approve today's agenda everyone in favor i'm sorry who made the motion did you debbie motion okay so approval of the agenda okay so the first thing um and my understanding is that this topic came up on monday at the meeting in regards to the um christmas tree lighting and holiday social so i'm not sure if that has already been decided if we even need to discuss anything or if it's still kind of an open well i brought it up that you were going to discuss it and some of the council members were fine with it there were a couple that weren't so you know at this point it's kind of a and they weren't at the meeting uh a couple of conferences voice concerns about that you heard this yeah i'm having a hard time hearing you literally i know i am too i'm sorry because couple of the council members voice of concern about having the event right at the monday meeting so and i part of it i guess is coleman the concern there so you know if we don't have it we're just going to light the tree and move on well first of all just a little bit of the background there are i think six events which we turned down from ten that were originally approved by the city council um six to one okay those were all put on hold with kovith so those are still out there so we probably need to address those if we want to scratch those and start over we would have to get permission really i guess permission approval and better work probably the city council to cancel those events because they're still scheduled and then of course moving forward if we want to do anything like a christmas tree lighting and that's going to have to be presented to city council and linda was saying there has been some concern about the trying to remember if the if the garage sale is on or off garage sale we're not advertising you can have one this saturday so that's i guess on the down low the same date same event but not officially sanctioned by the city are you at like the car show right yeah okay so that's the car show the fall festival the all of those events are passed so they're not you know it's past their day so you're really starting fresh well but i think that however we are starting first but i think that's something that needs to be addressed to the city council because they weren't cancelled they were postponed okay and i think that the city council needs to know that as a board we're recommending that those all of those events be cancelled and then if we're going to put forward a holiday social then that whatever we agree to or whatever we think we want to do for that you'd have to present to the city council for their approval right so as it came up last night and we're kind of like at the last minute or is it really even another meeting before like we're pretty much going to scrap that it sounds like and just the tree will go up it will be lit and there will be no event is that selling pretty much just because it is so like i mean it's not that it can't be done because it wouldn't be a big deal but it just sounds like there's a lot of use to jump through and with a little bit and with the numbers kind of switching i can kind of see it being like more attended just because it's outside if there's just a large group of people it might make people uncomfortable so um i guess do i i can make the motion to just kind of scratch it and like maybe obsess it for next year well i think if someone wants to make a motion i think it should be that the parks and rec board is recommending the city council cancel all postponed but previously approved events for the city of mallard beach through 2020. okay would you like to make it through uh yeah well okay all right i'll make the motion that um parks and rec board makes a motion that all previously approved but postponed city events previously approved for postponements to be cancelled yes do i have a second well he's talking about everything like christmas we're going to scratch he's talking about all the things that were on last week you guys worked on that got canceled the fashion show and the car show festival all those i thought no they were postponed somebody's making emotions promotion and we recommended the council that they can cancel because really we're on the hook to a certain extent to the city council the way i see it to do those because we agreed to do them yeah all right we didn't say that we're not doing them we just said they're going to be postponed right i mean if i might be some semantics there i don't know but i wouldn't want to keep it on the bit i think it's a little semantics because realistically those events were approved for 2020. 2020 is over so moving forward you create your own schedule for next year and you take it to the council but i you know in december it's kind of a new point it's after the fact well they're not asking us to postpone and reschedule before the end of december 31st so we're saying not this year so you know whatever you want to take i think we should have something in there i don't understand what you're saying but i think we should officially let the city council know that we we definitely need to oh yeah okay so [Music] address these other events okay and then as far as the holiday social the christmas tree lighting do i have a notion that we just kind of also scratch that due to shortness of time and coded and all of that yes i agree for a second i'm not sure the terminology so the motion is to cancel the holiday social and christmas tree lighting that we never even worked on i guess we're just like talking about not having one it was kind of like up for discussion but just based on the criteria i think we're kind of under the gun and it might get kicked anyway so this is we're just going to kind of exit off the agenda because that's okay you're going to make emotions we're going to you can make a motion to take the christmas tree social off the channel i make the motion data offshore second second second thank you all in favor okay okay so the next item on our agenda number four is discussion and assignments of the bellar beach 13 park surveys we touched upon this rig thought it would be a great idea and i agree with him that like a lot of us even if you've been here a long time didn't even know there were 13 parts so we talked about maybe doing surveys taking ones that you're not familiar with and just basically um you know general conditions of the park isn't good or bad what i passed out to you is just it literally took off the website and it was helpful to me because it's already got a list of the addresses and then it has like the amenities like what they offer so you kind of know what you're looking for like if it says it's got a bench but the bench isn't there when you go look then because i know lynn's like hey the the bench blew up into the water and we went on your dock and fished it out like yeah just stuff like that so this gives like a good little snapshot of like the address the amenities so so i guess you know there's i don't know if i counted 13 or 14 there's seven of us we can divvy them out it would be great if we could like i said take parts that you're not familiar with and you don't see all the time um but what we need to come up with is and it doesn't have to be a real big deal but just like the survey so we're all looking for the same things obviously you can have notes but like general conditions of the part getting bad the features and benefits are pretty much already listed on this on our website potential improvements um immediate concerns like potential danger like you know we were walking in the park on second street i called kyle because there was a hole that i would have fallen into up to my knee or it was a loose like you know utility lid or something whatever the case may be like if you're there and you notice something um and maybe pics pictures of it on your phone that's like we could share but i would love to have this survey just kind of done today and have everybody take their two parks or whatever the case may be so we can kind of do it in the next month if everybody's that gives everybody enough time it should take 10 minutes um and so we can discuss their next meet if everybody's good so just is there any like thoughts or discussion or did anything else pop into your mind about what would be maybe something else what to look for or something else that we should have on our server oh he just said that we should have a list like so i have survey questions like on page two but like we can like add to this we can take off of this and so we all have the same four or five things that we're looking for so a general condition of the part good bad ugly and different like great whatever um potential improvements that you think would be great like you know just one that will come to my mind like i would love like i know there's garbage cans i would love if there's a recycle um it's just that's you know whatever like first thing top of mind um immediate concerns or potential danger like the um the railings loose on the pier or you know just something that someone may see every day and just not fall because they don't think to fall so that's what i mean by that and then pictures if there is such an instance so that's george what we're um we're just if you i'm asking if anyone has like additional thoughts or suggestions or things like how often do you want these parts to survey well we're just going to do it the one time okay and then see what we come up with i mean if everybody comes back with oh my god all 14 of them are 13 of them look great then you know yeah yeah but if like you know there's three of them that need something then that that would be something that we would work on next and then we would survey them again to make sure that if that's that one thing because living next to one of the parks i think maintenance is yeah i go to my two and that's it like i go to the one right you know the south street one and i go to second stream because my i have an english bulldog and she can't walk far so like this as far as we get is eight to the side we're blaming it on the dog so we never really get to you know i never really get hurt any of the other parts where i'm kind of hanging out but um so yeah they i know they do do a good job but like does anybody have any like anything they want to add to this these little survey questions or is that good and we'll just think i think it would help all of you to take advantage of lynn and the fact that he knows what goes on annually where are we trimming you might see things that he already knows we do at the park and then very uh similar to what you had just said that the crews that take care of the park and they're awesome and i would encourage every one of you to stop by city hall or ask when when can i meet them or you see the truck going around show them your parks talk to them about it i'll guarantee you they know everything that you might have a question about so that would be that would be my addition to what you're trying to accomplish absolutely i'm not seeing them no it's a great idea i'm wrong okay so is everybody good with the survey questions the way they are so they're basically just four of them and i'll have um patty send those out um so is in regards to dipping up the parks like it doesn't have to be real formal if anybody just wants to say hey i'd like this one or that one if it doesn't matter to me or if you just want me to assign them i can do that too or however you guys will find me just go through so i'll okay um all right so deb do you want to take 25th street and 20th of course okay so deb keith is 20th and 25th norah do you want to take 16 and [Music] hibiscus park george do you want to take crosstalk apart um i'm not um how about crosstalk city hall grounds i'll take morgan park and 7th street rip do you want 2nd street in south park sure yep and then ladies looks like they loved you for the beaches so um kelly you want 6th street and 12th street nicole you can have 19th street so the way this kind of laid out like is is there bayside parking belt aisle forklift okay um nicole do you want bayside park sure i think i will do it and you'll take that off all right you have bill allen 16 correct six 12 in the park i'll take the marinade okay so this is the part that always trips me up so do we need to make a motion to pass all of this are we just good so we're good okay so everybody has their assignments and then um patty will send out the questions and then she just a reiteration of which ones you have okay perfect and then um so this is something the next item on our agenda number five isn't really something that like it's kind of like i'm just gonna throw it out there and we're just gonna think about it and bring it back up at the next meeting so it's kind of like um discussion of belarus 2021 programs and projects that's kind of a big statement but like um two kind of sections to this and like i would love all the feedback that like anyone would want to throw out like i said we can think about it and then just bring it back to the next meeting but like um like when you look around bellar beach like you see and i know linds talked about like a gazebo or you know we have artwork and we have benches that say welcome to bellar beach and stuff like that so i'm not sure like if those were donated if the city paid for them if they were some some were donated scholarships like all of these out here by the garden club yeah i think everything out here uh the one that like the one that's at the corner derek crossman the city did that okay the benches in all the parks for the most part are uh stuff the city's purchased okay uh and there there are some monuments in various parts you know recognizing something as an example maybe they donated the land at the time but for the most part okay so my thought for this and like it could be something that's smooshed in about two seconds but um like tax deductible gifts to the city or like people that may have lived here for 20 years or you know like their you know you know their husband was born and grew up here and he passed or something like that so um tax enough deductible gifts to the city by members of the community um with donated by so like say for example if my husband and i want to donate a recycle bin to the south street park and it might have like you know whatever their deb's husband like they want to donate and it says recycle been donated by um jeffrey and debkey you know bellar beach 2021 or something like that and then on our website it would literally have like you know here's members of the community and here's what they donated and like little blurb they've lived here for 16 years blah blah you know because people are always looking for you know places to [Music] you know tax deductible where you know it's i don't know you could want to do it it's a volunteer thing because no one has to do it if they don't want to but like um so some of the things that was just the stuff that we talked about park benches recycle bins flower gardens oh and then i see these um beach rentals that blend like you know the bike racks they can do anything it doesn't matter it can be something that they call and suggest but it would be easier if like we had a list that already had the price and you would say if you want to donate a recycle bin it costs x and then you know here's your thing for your account to write about hundred taxes um and then we do like the plaque and all of that stuff um so like i know some of our parts have dog poo bags or not milks yes some are roasted i feel like most or something okay yeah just stuff like that so or it could be something from like if you've had a boat there for 20 years it doesn't really matter what it is it was just a thought that i had as opposed to trying to like you know give money for the city that for things that are done maybe someone might want to lose and that's all it is my business would love to sponsor a few bags i'm a dog walker that's what this is yeah so anyway it's just a thought like you said i want everyone to just kind of to think about it and you know come back with like obviously there's nothing that's worse on anybody it's just like like a thing that they can do that they want and then the other part of the programs for next year like obviously we can revisit the ones that that fell through people really really really want to do it was a good idea all the guys that have like their old cars that wanted to be in the car show you know they come back and they go when are we doing that again like that can always be revisited but like um my thought on it is like you know i've heard over and over again that we have this beautiful community building and it doesn't really get used a ton and i know like before it covered there was yoga and stuff like that but like um like even if we try to do like try to get something on calendar for like once a month and some of the things that i like came to my mind was like last year there was stand-up paddleboard classes and my husband and i and our neighbor neighbors the couple we took up we saw the sign we signed up for it and it was right up here was great uh i know like there's been yoga for a while but like um coming back perfect yeah so just stuff like that if we get more of that like a paint and wine class like an outdoor movie night um like a book club i just joined the book club across because i didn't know where else to join so like i don't know just maybe something like that it could be anything but just to try to get stuff on the calendar that has to do with parks and recreation for the people in our community like you know like you have um my neighbor in indian rocks like uh she probably lives five minutes away she does every thursday or something like a from a couch to a 5k like a like a running club for beginners and she has like 15 people so it could be anything and it's like it could totally flop or it can take off but if we don't try it and that's truly like a parks and rec thing like it's something recreational that like we're bringing to the community if they want to do it great if they don't then you know we scratch up and try to find something else but like if we could get some things going and get more people kind of using this and a lot of it can be done like you know i know coconut is still kind of scary but it can be done outside or it can be done socially distance and obviously this is stuff that we would get on the calendar for next year but these are all just things i would love for just everybody to think about it and maybe come back to the next meeting and say i don't think this would work but i think this would be great for you know just all the suggestions that we can come up with maybe we can come up with a solid like maybe like i said let's start with one a month and see if it works and we should i don't know when is our new sign gonna be no we're doing design on it we've got some designs then it has to go out okay and i know the communications um team they're looking for a way for us to like get like either email blasts or text messages out to people who sometimes don't read the sign or if it doesn't get out of sign so people can't say oh well i heard about this after and i didn't know i never realized it or whatever just so it's like at least they could know and know they didn't want to do it as opposed to like i didn't know so that will help like if we can't get that going then it's kind of pointless to do this because no if they only know about it if they walk in the front door they won't know about it like it has to be something where we're able to get it out to people and not everybody clicks on the bell or each website probably as much as so i don't know can we have some discussion does anybody any thoughts on it like right now or just kind of yeah i mean our input there's some discussion about some people think it should be digital or electronic other people think it should be what i call arcades signed slide on letters because that's been the biggest complaint people can't read it where if you see a maybe the lettering is i'll just say it's in uh electronically it's in red you'll see it better than you would they have to control it the other way is you know the sign like we used to have where we had book letters on you know people constantly told us over the years we can't read that song so yeah so what we're looking at is doing a v-shape where it shoots out the communications committee recommended the digital sign and we we're going to go out uh after the concert decides what it's going to look like for a bid with the basic sign with the option to put digital on it well it's digital you could put lettering and some pictures i'm pretty sure didn't i see the stand-up paddleboard class on the sign yeah yeah so it just said stand up from paddleboard class see details inside or something and then and you know it's basically just yeah it's not that how do you say it's it's not visually pleasing you know that that uh letter sign type sign is 10 or 11 years old and things have changed over the last well there's other ways to advertise activities there's our facebook site and our website right and then the signage um what about those different ways of getting the message out yeah they're working on like the facebook page i guess like bella beach facebook do we have a bellar beach facebook page no we don't respond to it so i don't think they put anything on that like you could put it on like but that's what i said if you if you physically don't go in and click on it you don't see that there's a paint and wine class you literally have to go looking for it if you don't know about it so that's why it's like there if the communications group got like you know an email address for everyone they just class out like monthly events and then you just you know kind of skim through it but like the sign just said like stand up paddleboard class see or call for details or something and then you just i called here or i walked in so there are different ways um but people have to kind of seek them out at this point like it's not gonna like you know hit them in the faces they're trying that's why we could use this new sign well we're getting ready the city park that's our project we're from the communications committee we're going to set the survey out all the homes to try to get people to sign up either for sign up with an so we're in the process of sending that out and see what we get back unfortunately the experience we've gotten over the years and i'll just give you an example we had an underground project 120 people we did that to them we got 10 emails back that was all you know so the percentages are over the years i guess pretty low so we're going to try this one more time and then people can give us a choice okay i want to just look at the website i don't want you to send me an email i want i want to look at the sign i want a text alert it's called click send so that survey should be going out in the next month or so we're in the process of working with the printer to set up you know all the anchors and stuff like that so once that data's back then we hope we'll have a better communication segment which is the current list we have over 50 percent we do like we do is it okay like if we put it on next-door neighbor until the sign is up like say if we wanted to do something in january is that appropriate the city's not gonna do it but no no like you know you as a president wanted to say oh this is happening okay and there's always word of mouth i mean like so it's not like we need 400 people to do a paint and wine class we 15 or 20. you know what i mean so if we all brought three friends to get the first one going and then all those people told somebody else then they would maybe do it for the next time or like you know it's like if you know so-and-so likes to run or starting to run and they might be interested in like a running club or whatever like we could do it like that until because the sign is going to take a couple of months but i think yeah and then we can we're still using the constant contact list until we get this other system we hope the positivity that it works that we did a few more residents you know contacted what are the constraints on using yeah so we could use this so yeah like so we can we can table this for now i just wanted to you know have a discussion about it and kind of get everyone to maybe think about it and chat down a few notes like things that you might think would be interesting to you know just like with people ahead of time everything is mapped out for the entire year and it was just all there is put it on a refrigerator stay there all year and then the city would last about kind of on their facebook page just a little reminder you know a week before if there was gonna be a city any type of event and get together and please cook [Music] what's called the tampa newspaper now we still get it on thursdays i think it's called tampa perspective it's not just the bell everywhere it used to be for years and years i think social media is like the same when you sign up for your book classes whatever was it next door right next door someone and in my networking group right now we're talking about really pushing that social media aspect with the hashtags hashtag bellar beach hashtag activities and that gets a big group of people to kind of put their attention on it so there's definitely a technique to really promoting through social media that's a lot of people yeah so we're small and we don't like there's you know it's and it's fine and we want to stay community based but it's it's a great idea and then like it was cute too because like i saw an extra paper that someone lost their toys then i'm walking my dog in the park and there's a lady hammering a sign to a you know like a telephone call she's like i lost my tortoise and i'm like i knew that because i saw that next neighbor so so i agreed there's forums called me when it got out and we had it on different forms and we had people everywhere and within hours so if we did that for any function here so we could get it out oh my further signs done i guess it's the only point we're trying to oh that's going on today it's a notification in my phone okay perfect okay so like just as i mentioned if everyone doesn't want to kind of think about it and take something for next time and then we can try to start putting the calendar together for next year next year for 2021. um okay so the next item on our agenda i think is lynn he wanted to discuss the feller beach marina and then the beach class rentals we had the discussion about the reynolds last month shortly after that discussion uh someone mentioned to me well you know what what is the inflation rate been since the last time the uh marina prices were increased so i i went back to it so i'm kind of torn between which way to go with it but i wanted some feedback from you before i present to the city council from the last time the mariner rates were raised was 13 years ago okay well in 13 years the inflation rate is about 26.7 percent so that's seven dollars today is now 8.87 i know that seems like a major increase of two dollars a foot because that's how it's handled uh but what i would suggest that if we went to the inflationary then that would be a simple way to do it on an annual basis but my suggestion at this point is kind of okay we raised a dollar next year and then the following year catch it up to the inflation rate which would probably be another dollar and then at that point just use the inflation rate it goes up 13 cents then it goes up 13 and leave it in a way that you don't have to have all these that you want to say no one's paid any attention says well no i can't say that a couple of the common members of the question that the rates are prepared like the new rates that you performed went from seven to ten so it actually lowered what we passed last well you wouldn't you would if we just used the inflation rate it would probably solve itself in three or four years to the point where we wanted to get to because i think at that time 10 to 15 per foot based on if you're a property owner or not a product and but going forward this may solve that in a similar way and i know bill did a extensive study and presented that to me in the council and we never got any i don't want to say real concrete uh feedback from the concept uh to say how they wanted to proceed with this or if they even did it but you know the realization is i'm looking at it at this point after someone brought up the inflation and they said well you got a point there because it probably should have been raised incrementally over the last 13 years it was first brought up a couple years ago uh actually three years ago this first product there was a discussion on it and they opted not to do anything that was brought up last year again there was a discussion on it and the thoughts i'll open back into it so it was brought up again this year god so kind of wants to resolve this so going forward so i just want wanted to get some feedback from you that i can take it in and say hey do you think the inflation worker is a better way or do you think trying to immediately raise it to 10 and 15 for new people and uh raised as proposed bill's proposal was to raise the dollar and then reduce the minimum footage but uh i've personally been there 15 years i found a discussion interesting um yeah i'd be open to anyone asking questions about the marina i mean just this year i think we've been through a process where i didn't propose anything i wanted to help council though because i know that not everyone understands the marina what's been there what the city's paid for what the actual renter pays for themselves so today it's an interesting discussion for me today it's why i wanted to show up i saw it on the list and i'm not sure where to go with that then 15 years i've been down there anyone can ask me any questions so maybe there's a little bit more to it to understand in just three minutes of discussion if you're making decisions that impact 20 people 19 people i thought something was approved last week but her last meeting you didn't want to move forward with that right well someone someone came and talked to me right after that threw something at me and i thought well you know realistically the inflation thing then there wouldn't be a to me there wouldn't be five years from now it's always whatever the cpi is for that year it goes up then or if it's a negative it doesn't go anywhere it then we wouldn't have to readdress it re-address this like we have over the last few years here's the missing piece on this discussion and i don't want to take too much time on it but i'll offer as much time as anyone needs and i i almost feel like i should have a discussion with lynn off off the meeting because i don't want to steer it because direction he didn't want to go but inflation is good as a renter though you look at things competitive and that is what's important that i don't think people understand so that's what i brought to the table whether it's in any historical documentation you have it's on record with the city you can look at what's current and what is current as other marinas don't have minimums and we're not as far off competitively as you might think all those smaller boats have a disadvantage larger have a great advantage people that use a lift which is typically a smaller boat pay an asterisk a large amount of money on their own to buy a lift when they leave they take the lift with that that in itself can be a marina slip rental rate hello even though a lot of us just paid cash for it and then we meet and so we'll get a new one when we need to it's a very large expense it doesn't exist at other marinas so and please excuse me then you've got to help me with where you want to go with that but keep the minimum the same you just increase the rates i i'm i'm at the point where you know i'm not so sure about you know maybe the minimum drops to 25 but the replacement rate just goes out i don't want to i don't want us doing uh what i'm trying to do is alleviate this coming up every year and then nothing extended and that's what i'm thinking yeah yeah i'm in agreement with i think council needs something to approve period uh it goes and i've been down at 15 years and i have to go through this exercise what happened in the last round was they looked at a presentation but really didn't look at it didn't bite into it didn't want to grab it said hey push that off to the park have them come to us with a recommendation we'll vote it which is really what i thought you did last week we did we did so i mean but i mean again i don't want to disrespect i mean i see where he's going with that so is there a mechanism to say inflation is x does every other marina do that no lin could you like use what we passed last meeting and then just add at the end at the end of when everybody's caught up at the end of five years or whatever it is then do inflation have it already written in there so then you don't have to address it yeah but i would lower the minimum you know the council hasn't unfortunately and it's been brought up and i'm trying to give them a mechanism to say hey we don't need to talk about this every year we need to establish a system like uh i'm going to use safety hard they've got their marina feed spread out for five years okay uh they know what it's three five years from uh and i'm trying to hear it in a situation that we don't have to keep coming back to this and when the person brought the inflation thing to me i thought that's an interesting idea is that person a slip breaker it was just someone that heard no no they wanted to slip around they were a voter they were a voter and they they threw that at me and said well what was the last what they asked me was when was the last time it was raised and i wasn't really sure so we dug through the resolution and the last time it was rain or a resolution was december of 2006. okay you would think over that 14-year time you know the powers the city manager or somebody that came to him and said hey you know we need to do this and this unfortunately that didn't happen and that's old news so going forward i'm trying to give them something to bite on and say hey do you want to do this or do you want to do that what do you want to do and let's go forward and what i will probably you know if the parking record was okay with submitting both of them to them and they can make the decision you know either use the pleasure right or do what the recommendation that was presented in your proposal it was presented there were some conclusions again i feel bad that i'm kind of going back and forth a little that shouldn't be the case so what i try to do is bring information to educate everyone and i don't think everyone's educated that that's what i'm saying many people try to make a decision on what a person is saying and it keeps going around in circles and that's what happens over the years so lynn can you help the board with what does that mean so every year the rate goes up based on what inflation is well cpi index does that include our taxes in the city as well no no the inflation rate is cpi it's like okay right uh this year uh our military is increasing 1.3 percent you know recognize we know what that is we get 1.3 more in our retirement okay uh that's mainly how it's indexed the only thing if i was renting a slip down there which i'm not i know you are i wouldn't like the unknown i would want to know that this is what my rate is going to be and because it's like not that you would make numbers up but you know i'm suspicious i would think you know who knows what they're going to throw at me next year or what's going to happen so i would like to know like i would i would prefer a set number to say i know for the next five years this is i understand it hasn't been raised since 0-6 i understand that there's you know increases cost of just staying exactly the same so like that's why i kind of like the last one that we voted on because you knew looking at it exactly what you were going to be paying and it kind of leveled it out and i understand you don't want to do it every five years but but is it okay to go a whole dollar from seven to eight why not seven and seven like 25 cents this year 25 cents next year i mean we have 13 and then it was raising anybody that walked in today uh would go to ten dollars if you're a property owner and fifteen if you're not a property so what i where i'm going with this whole thing and looking at it long term it looks like okay this may be a lesser evil of all of it you know by just doing it as an index basically but what i'm wanting to do is propose both options to the console and you know if the board doesn't have any issues with that then that's what i'll do and let them make the choice why are we losing money if we don't no what happens bill's been at the meetings he knows every year he wants you to go to all the marines well you can go to 20 different marinas and everything's different okay the i guess the selling point for us is convenience if you look here it's hurting the people you go down the street if you don't you know you're not on a water block you can go to the marina and ride your bicycle there so you know some of the council members think that that convenience is more valuable than what the i guess i'm trying to put myself in the position of the photo motor's gonna say oh they're going up on rates again or going well it's both both plans give some revenue you know the the flat rate plan there's a little more revenue in it not a lot but a little bit because you're producing the uh uh minimum you know our minimum currently is 30 feet so the the real issue is the minimum is what i'm hearing someone propose keep the minimum at 30 feet no it would go do an inflationary increase which i don't think the group here knows and i'll just use some examples on convenience down in dunedin which is convenient for a dunington resident the smaller boats 25 29 27 22 are all paying less than what we do now what you're saying is a 13 year old rate so they're all paying less now it's the larger votes in dunedin which is convenient for a dummy resident that are paying less than or they're paying more than what our votes do down there they charge double for non-residents and don't mean so name a marina i've got the data and that's that's where i'm i'm struggling a little bit with this conversation because it sounds like someone came in and said keep the minimum the same raise the brain which doesn't matter i think you misunderstood what i'm suggesting is take the minimum to 25 and just start using the patient right and go on down the street forget about it but if if the board doesn't have any problem with either rate i don't really care you know if you want to go to the flat rate that we discussed last month we can submit that to the city council and move on with it now that means that anybody new coming in will immediately get an increase now i can't say that they don't the marina doesn't turn over you know we have a wait list the person that doesn't own property here is really going to take the big increase how long is the weightless huh how long is the waste well huh well oh that's over time um excuse me let's go ahead yeah we we used to have a couple that was uh i'll call it they were like the harbour masters i guess and they they took care of the marina so for the most part the city they got a free slip for doing so it was all dirt down there it was dirt we had a four foot fence we had some older lighting uh actually the docks were getting older as well so within 15 years what really started was you would get on your boat with dirty shoes and the gentleman he's talking about his wife who were down there a lot taking care of landscaping good people good community people uh they paved their own with like uh two by two stones and i was like wow that's awesome well for 250 bucks they do yours so there was like seven of us that went that makes sense we just paid on our own and now the city came in within the last three years and said well let's finish that out and it looks great and we got a six-foot fence and there's new docks in the last couple of years there's new lights based on penneco pinellas so as far as the slip renters you don't see any slip rectors coming to city hall complaining they're focused on getting on boat going out as a resident there's no doubt it's convenient versus driving to that need but the same thing applies to the dunedin resident going to dummy it's convenient for that and there's i hope that helps with the comment on the papers yeah the changes and the current is what i think we're at 12 i think it's not four non-probably [Music] it fluctuates because people will come and put their name on the list and when you call them well i don't have a vote so okay you go down the list go down the list no no no no and then a non-property owner comes in and it's there at the top of the list the other 20 the property owners go first to their buyer yeah which is cool i think the one with me and just switch and it's a non-property owner which means out of 19. i think that that would make am i correct and five out of the 19 now would be non-resident 18 we rent now with the the one open slip and i think there's four non-property owners yeah so number five just switched and that's a non-profit number number five is not settled yet yeah oh it's not settled you're putting the left here wait is that five now which ones mr parma no wait number five that is well that's that's the uh well anyways that fluctuates and then that's makes it hard to project revenue is but there isn't that much turnover part of that is that investment that that resident or non and i don't think people see it they drive by and they see 12 out of 19 votes on the left they don't realize that that lift owner owns the left that's 15 20 grand in this this day and age month you've got more level maintenance so it's a big investment it's probably why there's a little less turnover can we get a little like i guess um just some information on like why this is brought up to increase like is it because like other cities like we're trying to be competitive like i'm just trying to get some like insight because where i'm trying to make a decision on something i'm not a bone owner like and i'm trying to understand what is going on here as i as i mentioned we have a couple council members that revenue or the rental rates are low and i'm not saying they're low what i'm saying is realistically over time they should have been raised a little bit since it's been 14 years i mean you know that the boat costs for 14 years ago so i i think at some point we've gotta increase it a little bit i'm not saying increase of 20 or whatever it is i'm just saying that it needs to be done incrementally and is there can i address that just real quick because it's a it's a great point i feel for the city at times because we change people on boards and council more than we do people in the marines and unfortunately because people don't have that's the right way to put it they don't have anything to do with the marina it really makes it an open target to say hey that's one of our revenue streams like the parking meters of oregon park like our taxes that we pay we're very limited on where those streams come from but the marina comes up because it's an easy target it's not a big money maker but if people looked at the numbers they would see that it is a cash cow but a city even though it's small enough yet they would also see that there really isn't this long-term strategic plan that someone's answering for you that you can go what is our goal there what are we trying to do what are we trying to be more competitive what would make it better for x stop it's never answered it's always about raising rate there's only 14 people in the city in that and that's where i come from i got the bread the marina you know i am in complete agreement with what he's saying about things do need to change if it's not just for showing counsel yes nice job this makes sense rate go up lower minimum do whatever you think something needs to be presented to so i'm not in disagreement with that how do i help with their help to give you the information you need i've kind of tried before and that's not in front of you unfortunately well we voted on the last time in the past so that's why you know like he said he wanted to talk about it but i wasn't really sure what we were talking about so i didn't make a copy of your great package but let's say from the interest of time and procedurally we passed a motion pass the board do we want to make the emotion as a board to withdraw that from further consideration and presentations what i'm asking you is how do you feel about giving them both options and letting them make the choice that's what i'm asking that's that's all i'm asking so kind of what i'm hearing from you though is what you're losing today is going to be less of an increase than what we voted on last time well it wouldn't be an immediate increase on any new person it would just increase the minimum would go down okay from the 30 to 25 and then the the option to use the the indexing then long term it's it's not brought up anymore so that's their option the other option is what was given to them at a presentation and mr plus did give the presentation to them and what basically happened was they said give it to you uh and and you're okay with that and i'm okay with this situation i just want to move forward with something so somebody makes a mistake that's all i know i wrote down something you tell me if you think this is necessary i i think it is procedurally moving on after further consideration of the proposal and board approved motion to increase the marina fees a motion was made to withdraw that recommendation from city council consideration but wrong if we're not moving forward with this as it stood it was passed by the board and we're going to make another motion potentially and adjustments to it yeah that's right that's what you will do yeah so like i said all i'm asking you to do is kind of get some feedback because because i will share with the city council you know because somebody's going to come and say to me well what's what's been the rate of deflation over the last 14 years well if they do then i'll be able to tell them and i'm just wanting to move it on because when i spoke to them about it the second time it just it's it's just looking well they got they got what you approved last month that was the president what was that presented to them when was that presented you presented it oh thank you yeah i see so i presented something that said okay today's presenter committed to assist counsel with marina fax yeah the presenter did not bring forth a request to alter marina slip rates or add monthly fee charges the goal regarding information shared today is simply needed to simplify needed research for council to make the sound go or no go next step decision uh taking into consideration your city's current marine slip runners your future slip runners and the city of delaware beach coupled with the additional marina information provide a competitive landscape document provided the below options and projections are available so i did not make a recommendation at the end it was kind of concluded well let's let's do a three-tiered thing to go out five years which isn't my recommendation my recommendation was learn about it know what's out there i mean we've got one person that shows up at city hall says something we got a council member that says something and no one wants to learn about it so that's what i brought information for the four but i'm not in disagreement that something should be done how you go about it i think is the question without information i don't know what i brought to you last month well that's what we approved as presented by you we approve that was that ever presented to city council yes yeah so all i'm asking is that recommendation is still good that we don't got to do it so you just wanted to add another possibility right that's all i was asking do you want to you know there is this another possibility instead of saying to the next guy that walks in the door your rate is now ten dollars that's what that proposal said and or do you want to say it's eight dollars okay well that's not what it says you don't have anything in writing there that you're asking them to approve on you're saying using the computer price index right cpi yeah well if someone walks in the door that might change in 30 days based on january 1st and what comes up well i'm just facing you know the numbers because i was looking their way to not make this solid we're going to charge you ten dollars but don't we just have one what slip that that would possibly happen oh it could happen tomorrow okay and under the proposal that you recruited every person is a marine i'm just going to get a dollar increase right okay but the minimum is going to drop from 30 to 25. so there are some boats in the marina that are going to go down okay but then there's votes that are going to go up and anyone that walks in the door today if you're a property owner you're going to pay 10 okay if you're a non-property owner you're going to pay 15 per foot based on a minimum of 25. that's that's how it's exactly and that's what we voted on and if you're fine with that i'm fine with it just leave it as it is i'm good to go well can i ask bill since he did a lot of that research you know i'm really struggling with this and i'll tell you why guys i i i'm struggling probably more for you guys you're in a position right now you're trying to make a decision on something and i this will always my first interview out of college i remember the manager saying how can you ask for something if you don't know why you're asking for it well do you know why you're approving it that's my question and i feel for you right now you're being asked without information other than hey inflation as it went up do it this way how does that impact and i think it's an important question i really do i'm not sure why the rust in it if you guys it seems like council needs to get something to vote on and there's someone steering it and i don't know who that is yeah that's talking you know we gotta go with the inflation well on the other side i will tell you what was approved and that's where you go back to the all these spreadsheets i did yeah i did spreadsheets that showed every possible combination of an increase based on the current configuration of the length of boat and resident or now and it's all over the board there are some people that will get hit harder than others that's a fact i struggle with that you have i have some good people down there that i know that have a 40 foot boat wow they'll get them they'll get a big jump based on a change i struggle with that i really do so i don't think when these guys have the information well the group commented on them they got the packet that you know they got that packet last night that was just george and me and ken here at that time yeah yeah but but they got this was given to the council right is there any questions that anyone would like to ask but i feel like i've talked to this talk what questions are going through your head right now that was the so this is the thing so the both lifts have like been there and it says that the last meetings was like within like 15 years so like everything that the money that's collected from that the boats rentals like all that money is like in a pool to use to like fix the slips right or as this flight just goes into the city well it comes to the city we put a lot of money aside every year in case we have to replace a boardwalk or like a couple years ago we had some issues after the hurricane three years ago we had some issues after the hurricane we had to do some work there that's that's what we do city live safe stuff like we're generating a tennis court to save that money over a couple weeks so about after the savings i'd say about 35 000 dollars roughly goes back to the city because we set aside about council members every year as i said they got the presentation from phil they said to take it give it to the part board and see what they thought about and last month you approved so i'm just asking [Music] what are we looking to increase it too they will pull up a dollar to the current records uh and then two years later they'll go up another dollar and that's a foot a point so like that's what he's talking about it's a 25-foot vote your rates are going to go down if you have a 45-foot low here so it's not just like it's literally a little bit dollars so so what would happen as an example and i'm going to use bill's both right now he pays 210 in the proposal that was approved uh this this slip rental next year was dropped to 200. yeah there's truth to that uh the name i'm not comfortable with i mean as a slip renter i'll be honest with you that's why i've always looked at it as the problem down there is the minimum the reality is if you look on this piece of paper you received at seven dollars i've been paying 15 per foot for 15 years and people don't know so that's the math behind being a renter down there and that's why i'm feeling for this situation what was suggested to put in front of council it lowers the smaller boat's rates as a slip render i'm not a selfish person that i don't need that so i struggle with that but competitively that makes sense that makes sense raise the rate lower the middle no one else has a minimum one no one we do so and look at the number of votes of that length and below there's a lot of adjustments the disadvantage and there are people that are getting a great deal that never had to buy a lift because they're both bigger or they're using electricity and water different than those that don't and they pay a lot less that's the real struggle with you guys not having information on this discussion is not inflation and i'll tell you when inflation i don't have one vendor tied to my home that i just have a blank agreement going whatever the cpi is mr lawnmower guy terminx whatever you raise it accordingly i i don't i don't does anyone have vendors did you do business with them no i i just threw that out as a suggestion to get to a point but it sounds like you're okay with what you approve that's what it sounds like to me yes because as i understood the presentation just the three of us were here the last time that was involved in you were involved in my understanding was that represented a fair increase market value by all the work that predominantly he did looking around right okay and we're fine go forward with that yeah okay would like to get up to speed i mean what you're proposing might make sense to them and i would be happy to do a zoom call or something to help if you don't want if you want to i can cut it off we can get them up-to-date you know the presentation you know so you you understand a little better maybe that's what's going on but it sounds like we're not revoking no they're not voting not knowing it sounds like we're going to just discuss into the informed world yes and absolutely it's um you know it's let me ask you in a perfect world based on all the research that you've done what do you think it should look like yeah it's a really tough one i'll tell you if it was a perfect world it would be so cool if bella beach started completely from scratch and no one had a rental down there right now and therefore look at that property and we can go let's reconfig the slips let's optimize the space let's let's start with space management and let's look at width size so when you look at a competitive search there are it's 50 50 by foot or by size of slip so i really think if we in a perfect world i would just scratch it all out but you can't do that right so the next best thing is to get closer to what is fair which it's unfortunate just smaller boats have been paying more now if you go to a strategic plan and you look at what is our long-term vision which no one ever does maybe it is a vision of the city of bel air beach that we don't want smaller boats anymore maybe that's it now i will tell you the number one selling boat on the west coast of florida is between a 22 and a 26 center council so that you're going to see a lot of people that live in the area that want to vote or have a boat have that type of center out soldier um so it's a really tough one so you don't really like i i struggle with it because i'm fine with the rate i pay but at some point if they're going to change things i've got to look back on 15 years i can tell you i've spent close to 50 thousand dollars on the marine in 15 years between my my polls the electorate the monthly so and to me it is an investment but it's not about seven dollars here it's not about 10 there but if we're making change let's do it the right way and that was the purpose of all the research competitively do you think you're doing well keeping your vote here then dunedin you know it's a great question yeah i mean competitively uh what well that i would pay double so their rates are double for an address so the convenience thing applies to every marine so if you went to dunedin and said the same thing to a grameen in resident i guarantee you they would say well i live in dunedin why would i want to go over there right proximity yeah and the beaches could be in two shouldn't we set up maybe a toll to go out there no no oh okay okay so um the mayor is already like that oh so if we decide to keep what we voted on in past last you don't have to you just leave it yeah okay right now with that stuff we'll give it back to the console every day okay and then when you wanted to talk about this yeah i had a vendor and come to me and give us a proposal that they wanted to do what i call beach rentals important part you know i just wanted to get some feedback and see what your thoughts are you know i don't have any thoughts of doing it or not doing it i think it's just somebody came so you know i felt like i think hey could irritate people right now yeah i'm just laughing because i know next door just like banned umbrellas well this has nothing to do with check this out personally you know they came to us if you even considered it i don't think that they would be paying enough money to us uh 15 is not a lot not it's not enough at my not to be using the parking like the area the space what are your thoughts do you need an answer today yeah all i told them was i would take it to the park board and the park board had any interest in it i would tell it if the parkour doesn't have any interest in it then it's the end of the subject because i'm not going to take taking any further this is something to consider if we have events right we're not well though this isn't for everyone this is [Music] right across from guppies like i told them yeah i'll give them to the park discussion i know you keep saying no does anybody else have the thoughts i like the ideas of the kayaks paddle boards things of that sort possibly here as well i think your company i don't think there's enough experience under their belt for us can we [Music] are you interested in my initial inclination is to say no but i don't know maybe i'd like to look at a little bit more okay i'm not just like but if you want to take a vote i'm interested in the other things that they're offering and i it's all or nothing right i don't think well if they set up a contract it would you would it would be you know they'd have to provide it it's like the umbrella concession in rocks or clearwater beach if if the sun's out you know if it isn't raining or storming they you know in the contract you would require them to do it every day but if they make no money we make no money like if they don't have anybody renting anything they don't have to give us a dollar yeah but i think i said yeah they they sent the proposal and i said well i'll i'll listen to you and i'll take it from parker nothing isn't cute i mean it's you know something is i think i think i'm sorry i just i think it'd go over like a lead balloon in this in this city we can't people don't want anybody i can't imagine this doing any rentals on the beach i think there'd be something in the working situation well isn't this is like the peda park lot yeah so this is i would think would be more like people parking at the marina and oh that's too far to walk but um yeah but they wouldn't walk down yeah yeah i don't think there's enough there's not enough people that would go down there i think you should tell them yeah and that's what i'll give you yeah i don't think you need a motion to say i just wanted to because they came and i said i would present it yep okay um well is there anything else i just i have one thing and this came up a little bit this week actually but i just i need to express to this board first of all i'm appalled at what happened to the sea oats and the sand dunes down in our beach access on a barrier island to rip out sea oats for any anything i mean if there's some garbage down there we go down there we cut down all the vegetation to look for the garbage i mean i'm just appalled you could stop a school bus out here of eight-year-olds and ask him hey can you go pull me a co and they'd go oh no you can't pull cos i mean i i mean i just appalled that we destroyed that area down there that's unsightly and it doesn't help us living on a barrier items the ceo is providing very useful functions that the good lord gave us and i'm just i'm embarrassed the city that we would do something what area is that that you're talking about all the beach access and you'll see them when you go and study you know the growth we've been trimming those excesses even before i was here what holds the dune together is not the stick that's sticking up it's the root system the root systems nothing was done to them they have come back every year uh so you just like trim them like an end of the year like how you do all of your bushes we cut them off cut them down and then they come back in the spring just like they have for years statute says that if you have control of that public or private property you can trim that that's what the statute says um 6th and 12th street were within that statute you know and i'm not going to deny that this staff didn't get a little overzealous in 19th street we are in contact with the fdep about it the root system is still there and that's what holds the feature over and actually there's some little those green things already pop back up so we will have that discussion with fdep and if they tell us not to cut them anymore then we won't cut them anymore if you don't cut them at all oh they can get six seven feet tall and they've never been that tall and what will happen is you'd be wasting your time with the business at the beach if they all built all the way across which they could do if we never touched them all i know is i've lived in florida my whole life and i don't even remember anybody going down from trimming sea oaks for any reason but they have been turned here they were turned here on the small [Music] in there and the the root gets bigger and bigger and you know i'm talking about the stems yeah roots are underground no no you're missing when i say rude and i'm talking about root ball it's above we [Music] yeah they got a little overzealous there i will say that but we'll get that resolved going forward yeah this won't be repeated hey it doesn't matter you know i'm just we're the staff is just doing what they've been done previously you know they were cut uh when i came here they were cut the winner i was here they were cut by the staff that was here and they said from indian rocks and one below that and then i walk up um but i'm in the sixth street access and sometimes a nine to three every day twice a day my sport um and it's been done every year because i'm i'm an anal about people going on gymnastics and things like that but it's still hurricane season isn't it yeah shouldn't we wait till shouldn't we wait to trim those until hurricane season has finished well the public works department has a schedule yeah i'm just thinking i don't tell you sweet i just say hey um well no that's a good point so like that can be remedied that obviously they know not to ever cut them that short again and then that they need to change the timing maybe yeah or you know if you you says don't cut him anymore then we won't touch him and over a period of time unfortunately i'm going to get the complaint from the resident that says i can't sit on the bench and look at the water which i do i'm sure you do everyone does i'm not the city manager i say well then they'll walk down on the beach because the sea oats are there to protect the barrier island but i don't have to deal with their their garbage but yeah so i can see both sides i i mean there's condos well they're going to tell you exactly what you're about to do moving forward and what's best for the environment and that's that's that's what we need all right so we'll be back they'll be back is oh my god well then you know what they're going to tell them to do moving forward well there's a state code that shows all the protected they cut everything not just you know because what the statute says is one thing and some people say statute isn't correct so we need to make sure we're maintenance people our educators are educated and we'll do whatever okay i don't think that's your job um yes"
