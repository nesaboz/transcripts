call the roll board member Mark beam board member Carol Connery here board member David Gardella here board member Tony gatliff Vice chair Jane Mason Goldman chair Mike Kelly here board member Gerald wasawati and board member Fred Elio was unable to attend any folks of the audience that would like to turn one in first so anyone please stand up about our club do so [Music] do you solemnly declare affirm that the testimony are about to begin with these proceedings is a truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth thank you Ben very quickly I'll explain the rules and procedures that we'll go through tonight I will read the actual appeal first and we'll have a staff report made by Ford Pinellas and any staff here at Bel Air Base we ask and the applicant is allowed to make a statement after that we'll have open discussion between the applicant the any other Witnesses and the board and then we'll have a vote we'll have a motion in a second and then we'll have a roll call vote for 8 pm so at this time what we are considering here tonight is appeal number 22-01 at the address of 204 22nd Street is it Mr carolo yes parole Santo parole it's by isato Corolla is Gatsby is appealing an administrative decision made by the interim city manager consistent with section 94-62 of the city code of ordinances decision pertains to section 94-209 Heights within the RL District all Resident residences shall comply with base flood elevation requirement and set forth in chapter 74 this code two habitable stories may be constructed alongside a garage or storage area or over a garage or storage area the garage floor must be a minimum of 24 inches above the crown of the road all residents all residences shall not exceed a height of 35 feet as measured from the base blood elevation to the highest point of the road permitted exceptions to the high regulations set forth in the sections are chimneys cupolas and similar decorations providing no height extensions I.E cupola shall be used as a habitable space and providing no Plumbing or electrical service shall be allowed with up to the 35 foot height restriction variances to the provisions of this section shall not be requested or granted this request is to build a single family home with three habitable floors for number 22 appeal number 22-01 at this point is there a representative here for forward Pinellas thank you Mr chair if I make Randy Moore sir Randy Morris City attorney just a few procedural things I wish to address before we get into testimony this is as you've heard read before you an appellate hearing this is distinct I only emphasize that to make clear when you traditionally convene your traditionally considering variances which have their own criteria this is not a variance application this is an appeal where somebody is saying I think your city officials have interpreted this code provisioning correctly and your code provides that if that happens as it relates to chapter 94 that they can seek your review of that decision and so that's what you're being asked to do tonight is to review the interpretation of the code you are not being asked to Grant or weigh in eye variance and this is a quasi-judicial proceeding where you are acting as judges in that capacity collectively ultimately a motion and a second will be made at the conclusion of the and evidence presented to you this evening before we proceed beyond that have any has any member of this body had any ex parte Communications with the applicant or their agent meeting have you spoken to them about this appeal before today no no no for the member on the zoom yes no I have not thank you let the record reflect all responded in the negative has any member done a site visit that is go to the property for The Limited purpose of evaluating this application today I'm not asking if you live in this community and drive by it and have a tangential awareness of it I mean you went for the purpose of informing your decision making this evening no no for the member on Zoom no I'm familiar with the property thank you the record reflect all members responded in the negative with that staff will be making its presentation and I will now turn into the city the town or the city and it's presenting officials my one other ask is as you see there's an individual here operating as a sonographer writing down everything you say there's always an audio recording of the proceedings but should there be a subsequent appeal of this one version of either the audio recording or that transcription may be used in that regard and so for that reason just please enunciate especially and try to refrain from speaking over one another not that this body typically does that and also it would be most helpful since we don't convene regularly and some of the members are newer just say your name before you speak like when I said City attorney Moore and then proceed so um you know chair Kelly or whatever it just helps make the transcript a little easier to understand excellent thank you Mr Moore appreciate the quote for the clarification um Kyle if you'd like to make a statement on behalf of the city or would you like to yield forward to know us I'd like to yield the foreign give us your name and read your staff report good evening everyone my name is so I'm not a total stranger before I start this presentation for Pinellas the agency for the county oversees both the transportation and the land use planning and a bigger picture for the county and oftentimes when some of our smaller local governments such as yourselves requires assistance in some of its planning efforts we kind of come in to help and that's sort of how I'm here in prior to you today um so as you mentioned today we are here for appeal 22-01 and this is the same information that you've gone over in the official statement for this hearing but it is located at 204 22nd Street um as you know this is a um this request type is an appeal and the request specifically is to build a single family home in the applicable zoning district is residential low District too so for context for the board and as you're aware the applicant is requesting an appeal of an administrator decision made by the interim city manager and in this case the single family home specifically that the applicant is requesting to build with consists of three habitable stories and therefore the applicant was denied the request and submits this appeal today and there are a lot of factors that went into the appeal letter but I'd like to focus on the exact um second code section that is relevant here today which is 94-209 pertaining to Heights and you already you know read the code section in verbignon so I'm not going to repeat that but the section that I'd like to focus on in that is that the session states that all residences can construct two habitable stories alongside a garage or storage area or over garage or storage area and as you say it as well the coast the third code section states that the variances the variances to the provisions of the section shall not be granted as attorney Mora has verified this is not a variance but rather an appeal that we are discussing here today but essentially Heights and Baseline elevation aside what we're discussing here today is the configuration of the proposed single-family home and this proposed home would consist of two unbeatable stories alongside a garage or storage area and took over a garage or storage area which is contrary to what the code States clearly which is or not and or but or and so I'll sort of go through the submitted site plan with you today I'm a visual person and it would help me to explain to you um you know the decision behind this by going through these diagrams this was submitted by the applicant and shows the ground floor of the single family home of outlined the garage and read for you for clarity now this is the ground floor and it is clearly outlined here that there is a non-vitable space because as you know the city all houses in the city must raise its first floor above the base flood elevation so I'll move on to the first floor highlighting that same garage or outlining that same barrage in red as a frame of reference and this first floor has the kitchen and the living room but moving on to the second floor you can see outlined in yellow and blue are bedroom number two in the owner bedroom respectively so using that first floor as a frame of reference which had the garage outlined in red the bedroom number two outlined a new would be above the garage and then next to that owner bedroom would outline in blue would be alongside the garage so there you have your first configuration of a habitable story above and alongside the garage moving on to the third floor using that same you know frame of reference and building upon that house in our head the bedroom number three outlined in yellow would be above bedroom number two and then above the garage so that second habitable story and then that covered deck to the right outlines in blue would be alongside the garage so here we're looking at two available stories existing in configuration both above the garage and alongside the garage and in addition to this as you write out loud from the code the houses in the city are allowed two stories and this proposed single family home is building a third story which unfortunately brings up another issue of non-compliance so per our professional um Council as well as legal counsel that the city has received previously um and the decision that has been given by the interim city manager the city's code has been interpreted as only allowing the construction of one of the two following configurations those those two stories above the garage or alongside the garage not both at the same time and because the applicant is repressing the construction of both configurations simultaneously as staff we recommend in Iowa there's requested appeal and uphold the administrative decision of the city manager this concludes my presentation and I can take questions for as procedure allows whatever the next step may be does anybody on the board have a question for the young lady regarding the recommendation the recommendation and conclusion of forward denounce yes I saw this same building was built without that first floor being habitable that building would be able to be built I think that would depend on the site plan that was submitted I hesitate to answer a question based on those hypotheticals as it really is a matter of procedure for us to focus on the site plan that's in front of us so I don't want to directly answer that question but hypothetically if in any way if you have been submitted a site plan that involved two available stories above or alongside there would not be an issue thank you I have a question uh David Gardella go ahead David in my understanding so thank you to to plans submitted by the applicant we're going to have two habitable floors not three the cycling submitted shows a ground floor the first floor a second floor and a third floor so there are three stories in this in the single family home the ground floor does not have habitable space because that is in the side plane that is what accounts for that base flood elevation which is essentially the house being lifted but there's going to be three levels of habitable floors in this home the way it's designed correct okay thanks for clarifying that thank you thanks David any other questions we may ask you to come back no problem here at this time Mr carollo you or your representatives are more than welcome to come up and present the applicants um information to the board yes my name is Jeffrey Mark Sherman I'm an attorney I'm representing Mr grollo in this appeal good evening Mr Sherman thank you all for coming and listening to us tonight I do have a difference of opinion on the interpretation of the ordinance and I think if we read it together we'll understand what our point of view is and maybe together we can think of the best way to resolving this if you read the Bible notes it deals specifically with type very simplistic and then there are certainly mandatory aspects of the orders so for example it says all residences shall comply with base flood elevation the word shall is typically included in in statutes and ordinances as a mandatory requirement so we know that we have to meet the base flood elevation and then if we continue along looking for the next Shell the garage shall be a minimum of 24 inches above the crown of the road and then going further on down we see that um all residents shall not exceed 35 feet if measured they'll each there shall be no variances granted as to this property there's a bunch of shells in this organism and then we get to the habitable space it says two have little stories may may not shall here because I'm mandatory may be constructed alongside a garage or a storage area now the city is highlighting the word or here saying there's a separation between the aura of garage storage area or over a garage and storage area but there are three oars in that sentence I don't know how they focus them so when you take a look at the statute here the orders if you're going with the interpretation of the city you can only build two stories over a garage I don't think that's what this ordinance is meant to to really say that my choice is building alongside without having a floor over the garage doesn't make sense either there are lots of homes in the community that have a first floor next to the garage and a top floor over the garage as well as next to it and similarly there are no houses in the community that are built two stories just above the garage it makes no sense if they have to expand beyond the size of the garage or garage is too small so now the question is is that you're right there yes sir I built one of those I built a house brand new house on Arbor Drive over the grunt to two stories before the garage so they they contradict your statement and moving forward I'm sorry but it was just at the right time that's fine um and I appreciate that because we can't have differences here but I'm sure the real question here is what is the distinction between the word May and the word chap May gives us some latitude and and if you look along to the community there is a Latitude now under the interpretation of this ordinance nobody could build a single-story house I don't know if that's the case if that's the rule here in in Bel Air but it seems that there might be some older people who don't want to go upstairs and have one level and I while it's not provided for it here it certainly with me all the flood elevations would be the height requirements we can hold the garage issues but then again it would meet this ordinance the way it's being interpreted and I don't think it's a fair interpretation now what's important here is all of the mandatory requirements of Pinellas County are being compliant and that's why we have our architect with us tonight we'll explain and he also has some visual aids that can perhaps a system board and review it thank you sir does anyone have any questions I guess it would save questions for later we'll we'll go back and forth we may ask you to go back and forth to the podium or your architect come up or the homeowner if you search users so anyone else that would would like to talk on your rehab as well the woman will have Mr Gennady will come and talk next thank you sir foreign I'm going to start by showing you a picture of a house with two stories above the garage sir would you mind pulling that up just a little higher just for purposes of the camera in front of you there is another guard demo can you see that I can't see that thank you trying to help make sure it is two stories above a garage and three stories although the third story's a hundred square foot habitable hoopla on the roof so I think we need to be open-minded when we take a look at this um this is a unique site and are you saying the cupola is what you're considering the third floor no I'm saying that the cupola on this this example building uh where is this located foreign it has a third floor occupiable here three floors on this side two floors above the garage over here so there's a precedent and you're saying the cupola is above that the cupola is the third level yeah stop right there because when you read our ordinance it mentions the word but it's not happening electricity no Plumbing sure it's a cupola and Max um let's say that because it's listed on the property appraisers website as living area so it's not the Google app stand correct okay go ahead okay so as Mr Sherman mentioned these are the options for um in that shown in the height section it's not a configuration idea it's to determine the height in fact the code is listed as the height so you have a garage and two floors above the garage that's one option you can have or the other option you can have is a garage or storage and two habitable stories adjacent to it so the code almost gives you the the idea that you have to select one to determine height so we selected this one now the building that we've designed complies with the city site requirements it complies with the FEMA requirements it complies with all setback requirements it's a hurricane-proof structure in accordance with current code um it just simply uses the two habitable stories above a garage to determine its height now I think the fact that we can squeeze another living area within that surrounding that garage I don't think that really is addressed in the code and that's where our difference is um going back to your earlier point and here's here's an example of of what the building would look like again Heights permitted setbacks are permitted all the flood zone requirements are met and the city in fact doesn't have an issue with that we have had the plans reviewed by an independent plan reviewer and complies with all current building codes this is a look at the rear of the building and if you took Mr Gardella can you see that and I can't thank you again Mike thank you if we listen to the progress Pinellas interpretation of the code we could make this entire first floor of storage and build the exact same building so there's a problem with the language of the code you know it's not to us to fix it but I think we need to make a point the fact that you don't normally see windows in a first floor storage of a flood zone home is because they're not permitted in the FEMA flood zone however this entire first floor is above the flood elevation so we would be permitted to build all these windows uh just as the project was designed we would just have to dedicate that entire first floor to uninhabitable storage space which seems to be a shame and that's really the gist of our argument we believe that that height section where you can pick two stories above parking as the determinant of your height is what we use to determine the height of the building I think we got very clever with the design to make it work we have a very thin concrete or concrete structural slab which allowed us to get reasonable Heights to get that extra space and certainly the tax value of this three-story development far exceeded two-star story development with a big storage room so I I hope I made myself clear and nobody can answer any questions last question mark you don't deny that you are planning three habitable store um stories except right nothing in the code that's a yes or no answer nothing in the code mentions three stories are not permitted and yes we are that's all I wanted to know yes you plan on three stories yes sir thank you any other questions for the board board member of Gatlin did um did anyone approach the city with these plans prior to Jumping right into it that's a good question yes we did yeah I'm going to show you the results uh in April of 2001 I sent the former city manager these plans 2001 2001 2001. I'm sorry 2021 yeah okay um which this is very close to the actual site plan that we ended up with and I sent this drawing here and I have the emails here and have we included them those emails that are okay I have the emails here if you'd like to see and with an elevation of the building and with graphic that's on the construction drawings that show the garage the two stories and the three stories here the response I got from the city was these documents this shows some markups of the setbacks confirming our setback requirements and are building section that was marked up to clearly show the height limits Heights in the pool deck the heights of the garage above the crown of the road Etc there was no mention at that time of the of the uh of the three stories our drawings clearly showed threes and third and fourth aren't being a board member going back a little bit of a conversation you brought up the house on the North Bayshore that Coppola should not have any electrical in it even though it may be a third floor so there's no Plumbing no electrical in that level so everybody is clear on their tickets yeah and that may be useless that on the Property Appraiser's website is livable area well lovable yes but requirements of the city were no electrical no Plumbing Mark for the record to say I want that to be clear for the record backup when Mark has said that home never came before this board of adjustment or appearance so however it was built must have complied to what the city ordinances were because Ardmore never heard that case well this code this code this height code is a 1997 and that house was built much more recently any other questions for Mr Gennady David any questions not from me thank you thank you you're fine thank you Michael okay thank you thank you Mark thank you Mark is there anyone else who intends to appear on behalf of the applicant as you may for their agent as you make your case in Chief the surfer give me were you sworn earlier yes okay you just say your name and address for the record address as well yes please uh Lawrence migliara 2413. West Bay Street Tampa Florida 33629 uh my name is Lawrence I'm the general contractor and I've reviewed the plans personally prior to submittal and found them to be in compliance with the Florida building code as Mr Gennady said we met all the FEMA requirements type requirements setbacks and such we also had a private provider professionally review the plans and they have given us something in writing just stating as such that the structure meets all the Florida building codes so I just want to enter that into the record [Music] any other questions for our general contractor welcome sir good evening I'm Santo Carolla owner of property and I thank you for all for being here and helping through this process I'm going to approach this from a non-architect non-engineer non-lawyer trying to understand what you can or can't build and what you can design or not to sign in this community so in looking at the code and specifically lists this section that everyone's referring to as the height section and it's to be used in turn the height limit of the building and as you read it it says you can have two habitable stories may be constructed alongside a garage or storage area or over a garage or storage area so as Mr gennady's up drawing show two stories above a garage or two stories alongside a garage or storage area that if that's the only thing you can build in this community all right proved them to be different at 22-35 denado there is a home under construction that is two stories adjacent to the storage or garage and one story above well if you're limiting all construction to this height section it does not qualify for them because it has two adjacent and one above the garage so that to me indicates that this is the height section no this is not the living section there have been a living section in this car turn back to section 94-220 minimum living areas and setbacks notice it doesn't say maximum you look at this section nowhere in this section doesn't say no third story in fact the only thing that shows for this particular log number 65. it says minimum square footage of the first floor fifteen hundred square feet minimum square footage of the second floor 200 square feet nowhere in there does it say no third floor or a minimum on the third floor or a maximum on any floor so there are numerous homes in this community that are and I got pages of them that are two stories adjacent one story on top of storage which does not meet the section that everyone is referring to here the height section because the height section specifically says two stories above and two stories adjacent when we determine the height of this home my architect and Engineers chose the two stories above the garage to determine how high this home can be built we then proceeded once we got feedback from the city back in 21 to spend quite a bit of money designing a home to meet the code once we didn't get any Kickback on what how we interpreted the code in 21. we spent well into six figures just doing this I went through this with everyone Engineers architects and in looking at homes in this community this home meets the code it's got a base flood where it's got a base floor elevation above the flood on the first floor so it's qualified they can have Windows in it it's more than storage once it's about based flooded it's more than storage the design of the structure is not a normal design meaning if they Engineers with their Great Lengths and it's not going to be an inexpensive home to build it's going to be a very well built hurricane-proof home the strangest part of it is I could build the structure I could build this structure but I can't have it have the bottom floor habitable that doesn't make sense so either way this structure is going to get known the the bottom floor is going to be storage with Windows I think that's what we're in layman's terms that that is just a weird argument it's like the base flow to the base floor of the house is above base flood so it qualifies for living area we meet the height requirement we then choose the two floors above the garage to determine the height requirement and just like the houses in this community there are two stories that Jason took a garage and one story above a garage that was that's qualified those homes would not qualify if you are booked if you're holding them to the height section because they shouldn't have that one floor above and two floors adjacent and there's numerous and numerous homes like that that's our position I appreciate everybody's time in this manner and I'm trying to make this community my home for my family we're in ozma right now we're trying to move here permanently so thank you thank you sir thank you is there anybody else in the audience that would like to speak tonight um if so you're welcome to be sworn in if not can I ask the representative from um forward than else to come up to the podium one more time because the last part of your conclusion and the analysis and the findings I'd like to read I'd like to reiterate that your findings had to do with both configurations is that correct correct the board members understand that is it in poor situation it's a hand situation I believe the current statement would be that it's a matter of whether one or the other can exist and if the code were to allow both it would technically State and slash or okay see I think you've got on your final page Advocate request construction of both in red configurations simultaneously and that's that's what we're dealing with here correct any other questions thank you very much okay Jerry anything David any other questions no that's fine Mike okay again anybody else in the audience wants to speak welcome to okay we're going to move forward at this point um we've hit the section where we asked for a motion if someone wants to make a motion in a second so at this point I would ask any board members if you'd like to make such a motion um Mr Mora you might want to explain to us how this motion should be um handle thank you the the agenda materials say motion always in the affirmative that's a parliamentary preference that when you make a motion you do so in the affirmative move to approve rather than move to deny the rationale for that typically is to avoid confusion in the vote a motion and a second does not bind you to that result meaning your vote because just because you move to place something on the table to be approved does not mean you have to vote to approve you're just approving the body voting on the matter at all if the body is so inclined to move in the in the negative move to deny for example the relief requested and here in this case the appeal if it were that of your case and you and you did proceed that way I would pause to make it exceedingly clear what result your vote is it's the reason you don't typically do that because if you say move to deny and I vote is to deny and sometimes be so the materials say move in the affirmative you're free to move however you wish that is a parliamentary preference for ease in the record thank you Mr Warren to the local board members understand what we're about to do when any board member like to make a motion I move that we deny the field there's a motion to deny on the floor Mr chair is there a second for the motion are you are you seconding the motion man okay so member what's your last name I'm sorry I agree number can we read seconds so there's a motion on the floor chair to deny the relief requested the motion on the floor is to deny the relief requested for the benefit of all members present including those appearing digitally the motion is to deny if you vote Yes or I you are voting to deny the relief requested and uphold the interpretation provided by the city official below that is the motion on the floor at this point it would be my advice that this body before voting discuss deliberate or otherwise articulate its rationale with that I turn it back to the body is there any further comment for many of the members for reasons of of Interest or further understanding before we vote Mike if I can I'd like to just make a comment to Mr Crowley the applicant I agree it's a way to board or the way to Total reads I mean he can build that same exact home and have storage there which it's not uncommon for people in the beach communities over over the years to build homes similar to this that are below the flood elevation base flood elevation and then after they move in we all know it occurs sometimes where they go in and finish a room all for for a game room office what have you um he's being diligent and building the home above the place flood elevation and I understand what he's trying to accomplish it's just unfortunate to wear our code is great I agree if this goes forward I think we're going to open a can of worms in the future unless something's changed coat wise to allow you know multiple three three habitable stories I understand what he's trying to do but I just can't can't see a proven as based on the way that our codes are written unfortunately it's just my thoughts thank you Mr Gardella one last time any other comments from any board members before we vote there's motion on the table to deny there is a second Patty would you please call the rule Mr Bean Miss Connery Mr Gardella I'm Mr gatliff hi Mr wisowati aye Ms Goldman Mr Kelly hi buy your vote you have unanimously voted to uphold the administration's decision below with that that concludes this hearing you and your representatives thank you very much for coming here we appreciate your time we understand your situation at this point um I would ask a motion to our journey if there's no other further business before this board I want you to adjourn okay Mr parole we wish we welcome you to our community to whatever matter you probably put your home and wish you well while you're here"
