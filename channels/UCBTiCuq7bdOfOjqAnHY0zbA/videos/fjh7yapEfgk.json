    "transcript": "[Music] good evening everyone and welcome to the February 27th city of Belair Beach city council work session please rise and join me to the flag the United States of America to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible liberty and justice for all R would you please call council member Frank bankard pres council member Lloyd Roberts here council member Kim Shaw Elliot president mayor Dave Gattis here city manager Kyle reefer here and City attorney Randy MOA pres thank you Renee all right we'll get right to it this is the city of Belair Beach Municipal Code review and uh I'm going to I'm going to uh pass the the agenda over to city manager rep thank you mayor uh we have our consultant here tonight uh Lou CA and he's going to get us started we have four chapters to review tonight and we're starting our chapter good evening everyone glad to see you again we'll try to keep this live as possible given the subject matter but um hope you'll enjoy and have some comments um so these are the four chapters we'll be looking at uh tonight um chapter 10 22 30 and 50 I've been working with the manager on uh dividing up the other sections of the code uh tonight um given our experience um in writing and implementing code uh and also with uh issuing permit we're probably not Asar with these S as uh as others U but we're going to U rely on a lot of your comments for these sections uh we did go through we did check and make sure crop references were correct uh made sure State references were correct uh we did read it to also make sure that uh it made sense that we were able to understand it so what I'd like to do is really just walk through the sections we're not going to go line by line um because that would take all night but go by article by article and sections and find out if anybody's had any comments and uh I can give you the comments uh that that we have um the first section first article that we're looking at is uh this is uh chapter 10 uh bu building and building regulations uh it includes the sections on your on the screen in front of you uh we noted section 10.3 the Coastal Construction Control line uh might that might be a section to move into uh what's called the land development code or at least cross reference it because that's something that is commonly uh referenced or commonly looked at when you're developing uh are there any comments on these sections or anything You' like to discuss just one question what what you what you provided us is the exact same thing in the imunity code right now right there is no changes there's because I was looking for red lines I'm thinking and I didn't want to dissect it but I'm thinking what are we doing just visioning the code right thank you I had the same comment so so this is existing code this is existing code yes yeah we will provide strike there and underline really what we want to do is find out if you had any comments that we could address uh and based on your experiences and you'll see as we go through but we have not provided any any uh red lines or anything I'm just going to read to you you know like I said with chap with Section 10.3 our recommendation is to to move that or cross reference the Land Development Cod Mr Rober yeah I was just going to say I think it might be helpful to all of us I I went through it uh but if during the meetings that you had with Kyle if you guys identified some things that you thought need to be looked at more closely and Randy as well with his experience from a legal perspective if we can discuss those specific things for sure and then anything else that we may have as a group found and had a question about add that to it but I think a good start would be the items and areas that you guys identified and Kyle's experience with hey I've had some issues with this particular area with citizens or whatever the case may be and possibly we need to address that change the language and to subract and we did and that's sort of what we were planning I I did identify those sections that Kyle and I discussed and and things that we discussed I wasn't sure if uh you all have had anything in addition based on comments with the public or or experience so uh yeah what I'll do is I'll just walk through these sections quickly and I'll point out the sections uh that we that we found things on uh and Kyle if I missed anything uh through these sections uh let me know um and like I said I think we're going to give more that when we get into the other sections of the code the Land Development code especially zoning and things like that and signs and things like that but these sections probably not as much as the others before you get started with that um council member did you add something oh a similar similar feedback I was wondering what what might I be able to research as I'm new to the council so what might I be able to research to identify where there have been issues that were points of discussion from the citizens but where how can I find where the rub points were um we provided the uh the list of variances we've had in the past couple years um since we're on chapter 10 one of the biggest ones that we kept having over and over again is the highe the swimming pool so um that's a that that one I'd like to add um and I'm sure we could get comments too from the board adjustment members okay good all right as of yet we do not have a compiled list that has been brought your attention through either planning and zeling or the board of adjustments anything like that no okay so the council is starting with a blank slate yes okay yeah it helps we're going to we're going to prepare an analysis of the code and and issues that we've identified based on our experience but uh at this point we're just trying to find out issues that we're not familiar with uh based on your experience okay so yeah I'll go quickly through these and stop unless you have anything or I can identify where we found comments but uh really these are just the sections that we've identified and and nothing in these sections here under under Article 2 building code so far so I did have a question about building code um it's been actually had two people uh they're both developers I question the U twostory rule in a 35t building um I thought it was best to bring it up because uh I'm going to lay out a scenario that's happening you are allowed to build two stories um either one story is next to your garage and the other stor is above your garage the other scenario is you build a garage and then you could build two stories above your garage well I think what seems to be happening is people are building a garage or two garages and then there's non-liable space down below and then they build their allow two stories um eventually they fill in that non-liable space and um I I don't I'm not really sure why the rule is the way that it is but U I'm coming to the council to find out if this is something we should even consider looking at or if there was a reason for this why why this rule is in place I understand if you're below base flood elevation uh that that would be a problem but if you're first story that Subs up to the garages above Bas flood elevation and you could successfully build three stories in the same 35t box um what would what's the purpose of doing that and why would we not want to have taxable living space well under the N if you try to convert B FL don't don't drop your poliy if you could infring penalties on the whole Township I understand that but build in yeah I understand but I mean if you ask anybody about know what I'm saying beot well that's my question we know that that the majority of of homeowners are eventually going to do something with that property and so my question is is if they can successfully build a first floor next to their garage below the second and third story what what would us from stopping them from doing that well if you don't have a warer I'm just talking about the new bills anyone on the uh the board out there any comments on that we're just seeing it violated all over the city as far as they're all throwing in practice like you said you're doing it yeah but the thing is you don't have a mortgage and you still you still have to follow our building codes absolutely but like like the mayor says they do that migrate downstairs and they get a total living space now you get washed out get washed out I don't think that's your concern your concern is you want to be over tax I I would say that if they're able to build anything above base one elevation yet not go higher 35 ft that our Co districts uh Builders to uh why would we not want to have more living space in that home uh that's not taking up any more space for setbacks or height or anything else and then you've got more taxable Revenue coming in on that home what's what's the low what's the highest uh base elevation here elevation on the maps Curr yeah is it that yeah to be right on so that would yeah that's that's why I'm asking a question yes you got back back in the past the conversation was so many square feet and I don't remember the exact thing requires a three car garage 2500 2500 all right if you go over that car if you had 25 I mean if you got over so many square it's not in the code now I will say that that um that changing a rule like this would would make possible for a house that was recently um Turned Down by the board of adjustments because it's absolutely you're not allowed to get a variance on that particular type of build so there are certain homes that may be waiting in the wings to have this done and that may be why a developer has approached me on this but um I still don't understand why why the there yes sir the resents are building on this are they P tell you what can you stand up I can't hear you very well I said the residents are building on to the first floor are they pulling proper permits to do that construction or is the city approving these permits I I don't really know I don't I don't have the answer so what is the right now so I I have a vacant lot lot I want to build and I've got plans and specs to that do I have to get the city's approval first before it goes to the county yes so they give it to you guys and somebody within our organization or somebody who we Outsource to so it's a new build um our city engineer will review it okay and then so he reviews it based on our codes yes so he would know all of that the 35t height and all that kind of stuff okay and the 10t elevation minimal well it depends on where you're at well yeah 5T you have to go 5T up yes you got the base elevation whatever the map says currently and then you have aot board um adopted from the state and do we contact the County or does the owner take all that information once we check Pro say and said we're good then or she takes that we review it we stamp it and then they take it to the county put does anyone see any um drawbacks downfalls of of changing this rule uh does anyone see any advantages to it I'd like to know what everyone thinks well are we restricting people from building and using their land get hit with anation Su you know property good question well I'm going to it right now I'm saying uh property owners have a lot of Rights I know that's why you have excellent question member Banker the question posed was do we run the risk of facing some kind of inverse condemnation claim is as we restrict the Land Development code I will tell you first that as we Endeavor on this process it's an important it's worth noting right now before we begin that this is a process first and foremost and one of those one of the limitations on this process that you may recall was during the 2023 legislative or 2022 legislative session I'm trying to remember the date sorry 2023 legislative session a bill was adopted that um restricted development and or sorry restricted local governments from regulating Land Development in a way that was more burdensome or restrictive within a 100 miles of landfall from where hurricane Ian and another hurricane that hit the East Coast hit we cannot presently adopt any restrict any Land Development regulation that is more burdensome or restrictive that has a sunset provision in October of this year so part of this is working up work product that may not be adopted until after October so I first want to say that as a good uh entree to what to expect as we Endeavor on this process I will be working with that's one thing we will have to be mindful of um we will have to consider whether particular restriction depending on what you um what you adopt if they are consistent with your comprehensive plan if they are already memorialized in your comprehensive plan for example and we we Face less legal liability as a claim that somebody could not have reasonably expected that to be Reg regulated as it is already regulated for example um an inverse condemnation claim is interesting because it's it's the claim is that you fully devalued my use the the which is a harder showing to make the I think the more challenging um statutory scheme that we will have to be mindful of is found in Florida statute section 70. 001 which is the bird haris act we've talked about around it in the past the birt Harris Act is a unique uh creature of Florida stat statutory law different from inverse condemnation where you say you have not done a complete taking but by your government regulation by your action you have diminished my reasonable investment backed expectation for the use of my property that is a very fact and legal intensive analysis that will have to be taken on a case-by Case basis anytime we adopt anything that's more restrictive or burdensome you face the possibility of legal claims that somebody says wait a second part part of that's going to come into where were they in that process if you had Pie in the Sky ideas of building a castle at your property but you've never hired an architect you've never submitted a plan you've never manifested any real intention it's a lot harder for you to claim that than hey I was halfway through the development process you the the most successful um ber Harris act case for example involved a concrete batch plant where they were planning to get a concrete batch plant they were halfway through the process and then the commission said you know what no concrete batch plants um so so that sort of thing is obviously easier to perfect but I will tell you I'm as we I want to get ahead of this question because I think it's a Salient question that's going to be a through line through a lot of this discourse I'm never going to be in a position to tell you we can adopt this without an inverse condemnation claim or a bird Harris claim because nothing's an issue until somebody makes it an issue um and then we'll have to take it up on the on the merits of that but anytime you restrict people's land use rights you face the possibility of a legal claim and then it just gets down to what are the merits of those claims no and I'm glad the May brought this up about living spaces and all like that because I think you could get jackpotted you said would the city then the city could get sued personally right if we restricted their well yeah the suit would not lie against the Commissioners the suit any any suit for regulation would lie against the commission it would lie against the City generally but again we would have to look at what expectation did they have that this would not be regulated and if you're regulating in a way that is consistent for example you change your code in a manner that is consistent with the way it's always been administered but you we never really changed the code we clarified it and this is consistent with a demonstrable history of enforcing an administering it in this way then maybe you have a better argument than you used to be able to build two floors and now we say you can't build higher than 15 ft for example that's a lot more explicit and I didn't know we had a b flood elevation certain parts of this area of 10 ft I I just didn't and and I the the one other part that we're seeing in a lot of coastal communities and you're seeing this through short-term rental and other and other legal concerns when we talk about Bas flood elevation regulations and femo restrictions those are federal restrictions we don't have the ability to just ignore those uh the challenge becomes for local government what is your point of entry to learn about investigate and prove that there is in fact a violation one of the reasons you hear that discourse a lot more in short-term rental restrictions and and systems is because those regimes give in local governments an opportunity to inspect properties get in people's garages and the like but if somebody keeps their garage clothes all the time and we we suspect maybe there's bunk beds or something there but we never really know and all the neighbors say well everybody knows it but the city doesn't really have a point of entry to to to establish it and that's where some of that disconnect comes between the community awareness versus the local government's regulation or enforcement of it um so it is important to note that disconnect between the alleged Collective Consciousness versus what do we have actual records to prove Because unless somebody for example submits to permitting Kyle staff doesn't know you know what I did in my house unless I invite them in somehow so how is Kyle staff to enforce if I never let anybody in and turn one bedroom into three uh so those are the sort of challenges we we face on the administration of that enforcement okay all right I know it's a tangent but I think those are those are important legal Concepts that we need to address now before we do a whole LDC over overview thank you Randy and I think Dave what you were suggesting doesn't sound like anything stre even the height 35 ft right and and effectively if I understand correctly would just say we would have three stories it doesn't matter if the first story is a garage or a bedroom just a fold of 35 ft three stories and more Revenue right right because the square footage of living space would be more and from the outside uh I've seen two identical homes one is living space one is not living space but if you look at the pictures on the outside it's exactly the same building uh the only difference is is that they finished the inside by permit the way that they're supposed to and now they're being taxed for that that extra square footage where they weren't uh with the I did it myself while no one was looking so anyway that's I don't I'm not sure exactly where that is uh I I was looking it up earlier and I haven't found it yet but I wanted to bring that up so our current code if somebody had a garage and then two stores above it and then they came three years later and said hey we want to finish that garage and they applied for a permit interview by the city would we okay that as as our current we couldn't we couldn't yeah you said they pered the no no no no what I'm saying is in the future we we decide as as a group that we're going to move forward with this and and allow the third story to be Story number one correct uh then they could effectively apply for a permit and finish their Insight because I think current code requires them to have breakway walls and and all this good stuff for flooding that doesn't even exist because it's about B flood elevation is that correct it really depends house to house if you're we'd have to check if they're proposing that they have a third Lial floor we'd have to check that that is above the design for elevation right so it was um and the only thing restricting right now is that height code in section 94 or chapter 94 um that says either two days there or two above so it's been interpreted as one of the other if you were to change it it would be less restrictive but it still have to be all the flood Cod regulations and that was uh that was really the only only item that I had I thought was just okay maybe we should look into [Applause] this anyone else are we talking about the entire uh section here the entire article excuse me chapter 10 I have a CP [Applause] um here's a little nit on Section 1040 second line at the end uh it says uh to issue permits to reply on inspections is that is that intended to do that to reply on inspections 40 oh never mind I'm reading it better now makes sense now [Applause] uh one issue that we probably want to be aware of and you may have some ideas about this later uh but section 1077 uh deals with the materials that are appropriate for off Street parking spaces I know there's a lot of discussion as to whether shell is appropriate is it not you know kind of I know it's not um should it be their um Turf block what is that I mean there there might be some questions there that we want to be aware of as we look at this some of those questions U probably some of the reasons why we don't allow those of of C WS is because whenever the water rises things tend to float and move around and go everywhere CL the drain we just said about Park after yes is there something that's going to be put in there this yes that was something else we wanted to bring up I know that a lot of this is we can't enable until is it October Randy is that what you said uh yes presently unless the legislature somehow extends that process during the current session the sunset period for that um moratorium if you will is through October 2024 two years from the September 28th uh 20 2022 land fall of in that be surprised if they I and and they may not do it in the way that you expect they'll find they may find some other language so um we're having a session concludes on March 8th uh so we're having to closely Monitor and see what comes out and there's a possibility especially in the last 3 days where rules get suspended that um something may pivot so um absence some kind of legislative extension the the the prohibition against Land Development regulations that are more restrictive or burdensome extends through October 2024 okay and I think that that falls under law maintenance so when we get to that section we'll definitely Up's looking through that just noticed a few times or more than a few times the terminology that was used was talking about um occupied residential and nonresidential buildings so help me understand so what nonresidential buildings by definition do we currently deal with I guess just the institutional Public Works anything that's on anything else even though they're quote condos obviously they residential multi family yeah Okay and like the building across from me that says Motel on it by our definition is not a motel right it is a it is a residential condo me in district one residential okay good so it is appropriate for us to have the terminology in non-residential buildings because we do have City Hall we qualify for that I would think so makes sense the only thing I got in this whole section is I brought this up before it's 102 the start time at 700 a.m. um you don't see too many landscapers at that time but like driving pile uh got a lot of you got a lot of uh retirees you know boom you don't have a Vulcan Hammer here a lot of times but just the the monkey in in the wedge hit it shakes up the neighborhood a little bit I don't know if that would be better to move to 8:00 or 7:30 I don't know why but I know I don't have a la service now but when I um receed the one person purchased a house from he had one already set up so we kept it and they would come out and park in front of the house at 7:30 but they would never start mowing until you see they knew I'm sure all of us seen a lot of them well past 6:00 inmer supposed to shut down I think people would like the move you know what I'm saying I don't you're getting complaints or I just get you get complaints every time D piles but that could be in the middle of the day yeah yeah true um I don't know I the guys that I've dealt with since I've moved here they they will start wait till just because they don't want to be obnoxious and there's a big sign on their truck it says who they are and you make your neighbor every I don't I don't know how much of a problem starting at 7 a.m. is for the community as a whole I don't really have a problem just seems like we got to give people some leeway and how they um manage their Crews and it's not that much of a problem and people seem to be F anyway want to change Mr kayy yes sir um what time do you start 7 you make noise at 7 we usually wait till 7:30 if we're going to pump concrete is it's noisy as hell it's obnoxious as hell so we wait till at least 7:30 7:30 we set up just like Frank said we set up we don't start see the the problem is you're from the construction world like I you got a crew and this is what L my my old neighbor when they were doing our street that the crew would show up at 6:30 and start drinking coffee screaming and yelling it's worst in the evening at 6:00 you know new house just behind me H went dark all the time it's all related to noise all this is related yes yes a painting inside I'm I'm get I want to correct my my complaint here was all outside yes so is that something you want to that we want to consider changing the 6:00 p.m. to 7 a.m. quiet time want to adjust it we can take formal vote on it who wants to change it who wants to let's say who wants to leave it I think I'm fine with leing it doesn't I'm just if you're fine with the just people I think no matter what ask he says 11 you know people managing the cruise I mean it could be like it's excessively hot let's get out there early absolutely for the safety of the workers put the roof on yeah or you know we're running a little bit of time let's get this going I think they should have that kind of possibility I have two little knits uh page 29 of 30 in sub paragraph three the last line swimming pool decking and tning wall shall not be missing a b there included in the completion of setbacks we're just missing a word9 29 of 30 about for a wall sub paragraph three swimming pools okay the last line shall not be included oh yeah a typo and little knit is um the discussion about swim out seats so as I understand and I don't know what a swim out seat is but it seems like it's I guess it's a projection from the pool walls to accommodate of getting in and out of the pool soon and my question is uh does that mean that the area around the swim out meets the same criteria as the rest of the pool otherwise it seems like that would be a weakness if the swim out is in exceptions does that make any sense it's not so the talk about 5 ft from the any structural component yeah yes yeah so it has to be 5 ft away so that's part of the pool okay good thank you we have anything else and chapter 10 um I have time limits um it's a 10:33 [Applause] and currently we have every permit on an 18mon time limit the of issue um with a possible six Monon extension granted by the city manager um I feel that certain remodels or things like swimming pools smaller projects don't need that so what you would do is you would have for these types of projects you have say six months for these types of projects you have 12 right something that well I guess um maybe put your thoughts in writing and set Council and we'll discuss who the next meeting unless you already have something in mind I'll work with mie on some times based on what he's seen yeah I I could see that happening um when we bought our house on 20th Street the owner said that his pool was being constructed at the same time same um construction company as the $16 million house which is basically a water park you know on on on Boulevard so the Cru would come and work on his for a day or two and then be gone for two weeks working on the big projects and coming back and working on this so they probably use that full time because they would doing it that way but I don't think it should take that long I don't think they should be doing that that you know they should be held to a shorter acceptable time frame but as R is saying that may fall into the definition of that's more restrictive and we may have to weight the weight it's reasonable the design of the pool is like architectural where you got some slopes and all like that you need that a week to set up you know what I'm saying he could probably answer sir he's saying that one neighbor had a pool it would do work and leave for a week and I was saying depending on the design of the pool they may need that time for the concrete to set or whatever cure yeah who companies buy the 28 day Cur an excuse M just like Lloyd said they leave put in a pool shell disappear don't go back for two to 3 weeks L we're waiting for the concrete to cure it cures in seven days and 90% of what it is boy knows that for a fact too so yeah Kyle's right po should be done finished 6 months Max Jody's got one next door to her has been going on for over a year a a restrictive code like that would actually protect the the homeowner true definitely I think it would be a huge benefit but it also may have an adverse effect we already there's certain markets that people don't want to come and do business in b beach because we're a pain in the butt sometimes so um just be mindful of that also we don't we don't want to make it where we can't get anyone to do anything okay yes it goes hand in hands with the police it's all about enforcement you know as far as our time limits go what time we started when I build on St Pete Beach we we can't do anything at till 7:30 we set up and we wait because the cops are there to write us up we start before 730 if the cops enforce it you're going to have the contractors be more polite period thank you for that comment any other comments in chapter 10 chapter 10 once twice if I can come back to um I think it's 10- 174 was the uh the height issue height of swimming and my understanding this was an issue that was addressed through uh has been addressed through experiences so I thought this might be uh something the uh Council would like to discuss I'm not sure what the issues were exactly um but I did Circle 10- 174 paragraph G Mr would you like to address that um yes um I would actually refer to Mike Kelly on this one because he builds po he has a lot of ideas he was here when they actually were working on this code the begin with this this code came before Council it's either 2014 or or finally passed in 2016 um it it was it was a dispute of How High the pools could be built relative to the grade of the yard and the definition of grade is what started this whole scenario Council finally passed it can't that the pool can't be any higher than 18 in above the ground of the road and there are so many houses not just new construction so many existing house especially on the North End of fer Beach where that it just doesn't work so every one of them has had to come before the variance board for or either a 5 in 10 in or sometimes of twoot variance based on what the floor elevation is in the house it was it was very contentious when it was passed our current engineer was the engineer with another firm when he and I both argued that 18 in above the crowy road is too restriced we've got to be higher either 24 or 30 or 36 in higher because people aren't going to be able to to to build pools um so we look at it as as a board saying it needs a rewrite this needs to be a complete rewrite maybe the the crown of the road really shouldn't even come into play that's for this board to consider your your Council to consider maybe that shouldn't even be effective the Crown Road does play a factor in garages right Kyle yes minimum 24 in to a garage floor above crown of the road what relevance it is is it to pools um you know every new pool in the last two years has had to come before our board um to to be built and it just it needs to be re we go much higher than the 18 in above the CR of the road or we eliminate the code complet council member what what is the risk of having a higher pool uh I'm going to U if it's okay with a councel uh I'm going to call on um used to be vice mayor Shirley I believe that there was something to do with elevation that kept coming up with you and it may be a different opinion Mr Kelly has can you refresh my memory well it's two parts so you've got to and I'll just say the reference was just made of garage is at 24 in above the of the road 18 in already you have a problem everything's going to SL into the pool it's going to become a engineering issue um there were several I know mind hes personally we didn't we out to not to build have gares under we have it slightly above grade and but it's but we're add of the flood zone and our pool steps down a couple of it's not a six foot fall but I think that was part of why this became an issue we've got a couple of houses on our corners they have a six foot wall and the existing council at that time were opposed to that they did not like that the driveway sloped up and the wall was six foot but they could see in the two houses that are right on and they they didn't like it so that's why this that's how this came about I'm uh there's got to be an in between right I don't completely disagree with them I don't to 6 foot wall you know someone pool looking onto a single story home I I don't disagree with that but there's got to be a happy medium sitting below the rest of the house doesn't make sense either and below the entire y doesn't make S because I think we have a problem with our code in general with our site forie I just don't think our code um provides on site planning when it comes to drainage and pools and hardscaping versus Landscaping there's just not enough information in our code which is kind of why I suggest that we use a professional of what that should like but a professional know what other neighborhoods how that should be the thank you Mr the thing that uh come up a few times in my neighborhood you've got a pool that's 8 foot above grade and they look down at the Neighbors on either side and that that privacy issue has come out and again like uh Joy said the walls between the homes uh again you're going to have to look at other safety issues either either glass railing some type of railing to keep people from falling off these high walls of thank you are we talking adjacent grade crown on the road or adjacent grade to the property because there's big differences here when you measure the crown of the road of the of the residence that in front of the house so you're taking the crown is that in the code that the it's not the adjacent the road G the height of a swimming pool should not be higher than 18 in above the crown of the road it's on your property and if you're building up you're fortifying your property U then your pool is actually below grade I see I see where you're going with this yeah Jody's right it's all related to water drainage off your lot can't go into your neighbor's neighbor's property right so you build a house too high the pool too high how are we going to keep the water from going off neighbor's property unless you put our walls yeah and some of these are built up so so high that there's a big ditch between them a giant Ravine our code says you can't dump water on your neighbor's prop right that's in there Frank yeah we look at that for every variance to say what what is the elevation of this proposed going to do to the neighbor's prop yeah I I this is something that I'm really not all famili with I know my one neighbor not really neighbor but on my street she took like 8 Ines of water in the D and I helped her sandbag her house young girl but her pool is actually about 2 feet above her sliding doors which is 10 ft from the pool so the water comes in off the pool goes right into the sliding doors now there's a drain there and I'm thinking like who the hell architect this or engineer this you know I told her to pump that pool way out she only took like six Ines out so she got the rest of it in the house but well yes sir the other problem that comes in is after a home is built then the landscapers come around and they start putting in walls and trees and they'll build up that property between homes just to make things look nice and I have that situation my house there's 6 Ines higher than me so every time we have a deluge that water is kind to right in L so I guess the question is if we alter the pool code are we creating more problems somewhere else or should we consider actually hiring an architectural engine that can look at our code and make the best suggestion and I'm sure it's going to be different for each neighborhood it wouldn't be he's a yeah we've been taking notes and U there is a separate drainage section and you're right it's all interrelated and uh I'm not I'm not a an engineer or an architect but I can uh I have access to those resources that we can look at did you feel all the fingers pointing at you just yeah absolutely we've been uh we've been taking notes and and yeah it is it is a complicated issue and it is related to the drainage section as well which we will be going over separately but um yeah I'd like to have somebody who's uh knowledgeable in these issues to to look at it on my behalf uh I'd like information on variances as well if someone could send me those and yeah we we'd be glad to provide some recommendations do you have engineering resources we do we do we're an engineering firm with planners all right would it be uh too much to ask Mr Kelly to maybe Redline this and reward Smith it a little bit I mean this is his livelihood I mean I don't mean to throw it on your lap but I mean you probably come up with a better answer to all this than all of us that's what I'm personally saying and and know it's not going to him it's going to you and just ra if we're going to still use the crown of the road I'm saying we've got to take that above 18 in well that's what I'm asking you maybe you could Red Line this thing and SMI it in there what's what's your average right now whenever you're doing the variance what are we talking about they're minor they're 5 in 6 in Tony's was 14 in and that's the most Kyle I think we had in two years well we had the one that was a remodel that was well over but 64 in you could see that there was no effect on the neighboring property they had a lot of land in their correct and their pool was already at that level yeah it the minimum you've got to take this up if we're going to still use the crown of the road is higher than 24 preferably 30 or 36 and Ry if you want me to put that down I will um we think if you go to that 36 Plateau you shouldn't see many if any variances the one that just talked about is a remodel of the pool where the the house is built up so high and the pool's built up so high there's no relevance or problem with drainage adjacent to it that the board didn't pass it I think it was what you're suggesting 36 in yes sir I think we should take him up on offer before he changes his I just one thing that I don't want to do is accidentally create more problems and I think that there needs to be some sort of a check valve on more of a sanity check maybe anything above 18 maybe you should have some kind of a survey done that's that somebody certifies that this is not going to impact your neighbors uh that's that's a suggestion wait J I think that what you're saying is Well one it can't get any lower that's the that's the girl right so that's got to be our you can't go lower than that but I think that U as part of the permit you should have a drainage PL that's where we're dropping the ball here and the same if you're doing any construction you should be required to put gutters and down spells and those should be required to be piped off your property into the you know into the the ocean at your water pot otherwise into the you know front of the home into the street so you're not you're certain that it's not draining on your neighborhood we have so many drainage problems and none of that is being addressed in our C it's a problem I mean and I can tell you we are allowing too much impervious area there's I have a neighbor who's filled in every foot of his yard with concrete or Rock And so there's he's not absorbing any of the and that's thank you don't don't we need to do that something I agree with what you just said something with FL plan management then I mean uh well we you've heard of Plenty tonight and uh maybe what you should do is take everything that you've heard and come back with something that uh that can be presented to us and uh maybe every every piece of that's impacted by these changes we just get maybe we have another a second look obviously you're going to have talented individuals looking at it with you but uh they may actually want to come down and ride the ride our neighborhoods and see if this code was applied here on this construction how would it impact the neighbors we'll take a look and I know there are drainage regulations in the city and um maybe they're not being enforced through the process so uh that that might be another issue but we we'll look at these okay definitely been scribbling notes I know we we've talked about it's very important but don't forget the dog on landscapers they come in after everything's done and everything changes the drainage on the side of home it's amazing what happen that's that's true um and maybe there needs to be more restrictive but there probably needs to be Cod that that once it's built you you can't just elevate your property on a wh maybe it requires perit well that's the problem they have no land Open Season when it comes to anything with landscap you're talking about landscapers after the pro project is done you're not talking about the the finished grade of the land with Landscaping because that has a site plan on existing home you have landscapers come in and they're adding okay even with a new home I'm thinking that you're when if the pool's being built you have a site plan where it says this this is the elevation and that's it okay that's followed and once once the house is got occupancy that's when they come and as a function of just in part Administration but also the legal side of this understand that the lawyers r is in the common parlament to be the naysayer I want an issue spot for you and identify you are a small municipality um you you do have very capable people and I mean that truly at knowing your team here you also have limited resources your budget being a statement of your priorities and where you put your resources that that's one thing but as you talk about additional permitting requirements additional inspection requirements you're creating bureaucracy that's going to require resources that you may not presently have that doesn't mean you can't establish them or put funding behind additional permitting tax additional and understanding that a lot of that's been outsourced to the county and what how much support are you getting in that Administration but I just the sometimes the disconnect that can happen between what our regulations say and then how they get administered and and you know you've got your your your law enforcement is contracted out your Building Services are contracted out you do have people in the here and now but just understanding that limitation I think it's worthwhile as you consider how robust you wish to make your regulatory fr work thank you Mr Mo anything else on chapter 10 all right so let's move on to chapter 22 um it's probably not going to take as long but after 22 we'll take a bathroom break and then uh and then we'll get back on the the 30 all right chapter 22 is environment it's not environment in the in the sense of the natural environment U this article deals with nuisances I think one of the issues that we discuss uh pal and I discussed was um section 2233 prohibited conditions declare Declaration of a nuisance um number 24 under that section is children's toys uh adding to that section uh exempting basketball hoops so those are not uh considered a nuisance when you set up a basketball ho in your yard well they are at 4 in the morning yeah yeah this deals with things like children's toys bicycle skateboards garbage cans tools or any other portable items that are not part of the natural landscape shall not be left on the owner's property and visible from the street uh longer than longer than for 24 hours so you know bicycle skateboards uh do you the question is I guess these movable basketball hoops do you want to exempt those uh is that an issue if I if I'm understanding this correctly counil yes you're talking about the type of basketball Boop that the base basically is full of sand and water not something that's concreted into the ground yes cuz this this would fall under the uh other portable items uh so yeah I know personally I've had a couple of those for my grandchildren but that's not something you want to move yeah it's very heavy even though it's Pro portable so I I would agree with exempting that all right it's not typically left randomly it would be like if you got a two-car garage and typically be right between the two garages something like that so it looks symmetrical and it's not unattractive I council member Elliot a comment now I have mixed feelings about this because when I heard this and saying portable items basketball I'm thinking Fisher Price yeah and and people leave them sitting out for a long time and I don't want to see that put those toys away so um and then the portable Hoops they deteriorate more I mean I guess people have a choice as to whether they want to fix one permanently or whether they want to have and if it's portable move it perhaps I think the only problem with the portable ones that I have is the fact that whenever we have storms they are a hazard yeah we may have to define the term Port I need to Define it with regards to the height of the basketball Loot and and the weight um cuz the on that i' I've seen and use the bottom it's plastic of some Ty and in the actual pole is a normal metal basketball pole two wheels in the back sand and water combos theoretically supposed to be the heaviest but if you put one together it's going to stay there until you're tired of it that's just no one's going to move those things around I'd like to see how you're get sand water out that buting it up so uh the basketball hoops everybody good with that yes no I'm good with it we would need to Define it because as Kim said so if it's something that's 3T tall and weighs 15 lb and it's just laying in the yard that should be moved okay so we can give it some definition regarding the height and the weight and the reason I brought it up is it's just a decision point I drive around I see basketball to me toce you said you can't have toys but then you see the ones that the guy put 10 Center blocks on top of it yeah not around here I see it but if you drive around look around you know just on top of the St of the Bas or the old couch I have notice in that same area section 22 V 33 um subsection 4 any condition that provides harbage for rats mice snakes other bur andest Etc I've had a couple of neighbors complain about other neighbors where they had fruit trees and we have along with the fruit trees the fruit rats so some of those homes are only occupied 6 months a year and 4,000 mangos fall off on the ground and then all the rats gone as a result of that so that's when I read that that's what I thought of I talked to my neighbor now he's there all the time and he loves fruit trees which is wonderful he gives me fruit all the time from his fruit trees but several months ago he was overtaken by fruit rat first time I saw one going across my fist I thought it was a swirl um next I found one inside my grill when I opened the cover of the grill and he just was right there so that was exciting but um he put traps out didn't want to poison them so he put the old fashioned traps and he killed 18 in two days oh in his garage they can reproduce quickly and if they get up in your attic it certainly is a problem could I bring the black Snak down your neighborhood and and and and council member I don't think you were suggesting to do so I just want to be uh cautious about legislating around our natural habitat um I I have seen attempts at doing so in other communities it's it's perilous and frankly impossible in some respects certainly new since properties overgrowth um un you know those sorts of things are dealt with um one thing we'll have to be mindful of in a general sense again another legal concern um as we talk about these different restrictions um or or regulations better stated um is our equal protection Notions of of making sure we're we're evenly treating Property Owners um it's very hard when you start trying and and I'm not suggesting you were saying this but there's a Temptation when you do things like this of making a distinction between well a year- round resident can do this but a resident who year six months has to do that and that becomes very difficult to if not impossible to administer and may present other legal challenges so just being mindful of those sorts of concerns thank you I mean it does seem that we have uh nuisance rules on not maintaining the property and I would think that if you have you know two feet of rotting fruit sitting on it that might be considered a nuisance potentially um yeah you know just like leaves or anything else that you're not maintaining it and I do like the idea of promoting an environment that supports animals animals come and eat all that fruit is nice I had a question about noise and there was a definition that had yelling but it seemed to be limited to see where was it I'm sorry I don't mean to hold [Applause] you how close are you to G Boulevard from G bouevard one house between my house and G bouard now you he um cars going down with the windows you know especially from Clear Water back and forth with the radio blaring um there I call them trikes three wheel vehicles and they got radio volume because there were there wasn't there was a inv passive believe two years ago limiting noise from your vehicle I think you could hear more 20t or 15 ft I don't know R uh I'm generally familiar with that what I would tell you is I I've very recently deeply litigated the issue of noise ordinances um it's something that I can definitely look at in terms of where your code is relative to current statutes and also o current legal Norms relative to like plainly audible standards versus objective measurements there is not a requirement that you have a specific decibel um reading for example as long as you have um either temporal or um proximity limitations that might be relevant like if it can be heard more than 150 ft from the front property line from where the sound is emanating uh restrictions like that um so I can look at your noise code in in addition to what whatever your planner may add as um planning Norms I'm obviously not equipped to say that as we sit here now but I'm very familiar with this and if that's some if your noise ordinance is something you'd like more carefully reviewed as part of this process I'm happy to do so well what I'm referencing oh you're referencing the the state statute relative to sound emanating from Vehicles yeah because especially around the causeway okay this time of year you get people stop there for a long period of time because the wait for the people in the side streets people in the causeway people right around there some of these people just have the volume up to 10 you can hear you could hear you could hear it almost at the city hall and that is a violation is it it may be of the statute I I I'd have to look at the statutory language I will tell you one of the challenges with that statute is let's say you're sitting here and the meeting with Dave somebody Drives By sorry with the mayor and somebody drives by making that noise you call your Deputy by the time that figure out which vehicle it is they're either over the or in their garage true yeah but I'm saying it's it can be annoying sympath yeah I to answer your question if I'm in my house and windows and Clos and the door shut um I don't hear anything as having go if I walk out my kitchen door into the garage and those same noises are being produced they sound pretty loud you probably 1 windows um I have double pain I don't know what they're rated for because I put in a while ago but knock on W whoever built that house get a lot of nice work for sound insulation because I really don't hear anything it's amazing made that comment yes my thanks to Mr Roberts for pointing out the section I was looking for um but it is 22- 61 on page 10 and it's item four yelling shouting Etc it's creating similar noises on the public streets and I wonder why we have the limitation of on the public streets might we delete that because if you're screaming in the house if you're screaming in the pool you're having a party in the backyard you're not on the public Street that's certainly language we can review I will tell you the other concern I have just hearing that language is your streets and sidewalks are are the most traditional public fla as it relates to First Amendment speech and so if somebody is out on your not not obstructing traffic which is its own statutory violation most especially following the 2023 legislative session um but the or 2022 legislative session but the um concern of if somebody's out there saying you know God a savior repent now and somebody says well they're yelling on our city sidewalk or or Street as long as they're not impeding traffic flow or anything else that should I I would have concerns about enforcing something like that and so that's language that we should definitely look at and make sure we're harmonizing it with those constitutional Norms makes sense getting back to nuisances I'm I'm not seeing I see that there's um there's a lot a lot of lines through at one time but I know that we're very protective of uh trying to prevent uh trees and shrubs and everything from getting out of hand but I really don't see where it's where it's violating your next door neighbor where you've got this P tree and now it's growing way over and over the fence and into the neighbor's yard and you fet of overgrowth and shade that you didn't ask for and don't care about do we have something like that in our Cod now yes you tell me where it is not this section it's 94 so it's not considered a new it's in a different section yeah I mean there's a couple sections that kind of cross over um so we'll be covering that at the next next yeah we do we do have more comments on the uh the Landscaping section okay and maintenance of landscaping clear and things like that can we get back to what Kim was saying about number four you are you suggesting to eliminate word public streets yes I I agree it's uh section 9469 gra yard landscaping requirements for yards of bik Landscaping is covered in multiple chapters like a little bits here and there yeah I was just wondering if we needed a to declare certain things to be adions because they are there's other cities that um establish protected trees so someone has an own tree and it's com over actually let it get cut to get so we're not a tree City you know we have very little laws against trees yeah other concerns in chapter 22 just what I brought up about clarifying Tims 12614 I I think we should eliminate the word publ stre is that I know you were talking about this Randy would that be a eliminating it would be the direction I would probably go I just want to make sure that because I'm not intimately familiar with the language I'd want to make sure that I'm looking at the ill it's attempting to address and see because if it's otherwise addressed by for example the statute that was adopted um in uh 2022 that specifically prevents stopping impeding retarding slowing all the other verbs and synonyms the flow of traffic and pedestrian well then we don't have a need for any kind of Corollary code provision because there's a Florida statute on it whether it's constitutional or not and so I think we're moving we probably move in the direction of eliminating that language I'm just reluctant to commit to doing it until I've looked at it in context yeah u k uh how about the 10 p.m. 7 I think that's fine but I have I have experience like loud loud partying going on yeah I've had neighbors complain kids in the pool especially you know yeah and if it finishes by 10 fine but if it goes into 1:00 a.m. which I have experienced or short term um and another one was just I this sounds crazy but there was not say it never mind but anyway loud noises are you know fine people can have fun but let's be quiet t i Wherever You Are I would actually recommend to remove the word particularly to say between the hours of 10 and 7: otherwise I don't know how we're going to enforce that but somebody said well it says particularly between 10 and 7 and it's now 4 in the afternoon and I'm Raising Cane on the back of my pickup truck going down go Boulevard you know they're going to point to that and say I don't really think that applies don't we wouldn't it be better to destroy that c public streets to period 7 a. right just remove that whole you know what I'm saying pH particularly between the hours of 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. yeah and such matter I think this is uh Randy will take a look at it okay it's [Music] harmonizing my last question is a general one um there were several sections where it um penalty is imposed based on um an interest rate and I'm just wondering what the current trend is like 12% is listed in this ordinance is there a current Trend to instead posted to 2% over a benchmark of some sort or just how are people generally handling that I'm I'm really surprised that we have this as a coord at all because it seems to me that it should be more of a discuss and um set my resolution um instead of just having it memorialized forever until you have to do an ordinance change so instead of setting 12% uh you have set by the council uh by resolution and then that way as interest goes up you can raise it up as interest drops down you can lower it down but um we should have the flexibility to be able to change that well that's why using a benchmark might work so whatever that is you know it's it's the government rate if it's the CPI whatever that Benchmark is but then you say 4% over that or yeah I I'm just wondering what the current trend is um because I'm not intimately familiar with the language I want to make sure I understand is that language saying that code enforcement fines shall be subject to interest AC cruel or is it use of interest in another way as unpaid unpaid fines and leans on property right our subject to I I believe that there's a statutory figure set for that I want to say it's six something perc I could be wrong about that just conflating it perhaps with post-judgment interest in civil context um but I there is I know it's not explicit in chapter 62 I think it may be elsewhere Which chapter 162 is the Florida statute governing code enforcement fines fees and leans um so I I'd want to make I'd look at the legal Authority on it I think we usually do it um as you know judgment interest that would occre with a judgment uh but I want to look at I'd look at that I would not have it set I agree with the mayor that I would not have it set in your code one so that if it does change by Statute you don't have to be concerned about that and two if it is something that we can set unilaterally and I'm not sure that we can but if it is then have it set by resolution and adjust it as appropriate without the need for two readings and now a a a business impact statement and all those sorts of trappings that come with ordinances well and again if it's a benchmark it's eliminates the need to take annual action I think it all begins with the Florida statute and then we go from there and if we're able to I mean we may may not even be legally allowed to charge 12% correct it Ser look into that and that's a general comment we made U we feaser listed as well just to reference a resolution what else any comments out there that case you want to take a 5 minute break yes sir okay and then we'll get right back on yeah 7:30 to 7:30 we're back at it and now we are at Chapter 30 yeah this this chapter deals with seaw walls um and then uh restrictions on boats and marinas or the marina rules of the marina um we have some minor comments on this uh I think one of the things we're recommending is you add a definition of catwalk uh because there are regulations uh dealing with cat walks and no definition uh but other than that just open it up for your discussion and what was the um what was the gestion uh that we to fix for the catwalk problem just um defining it uh that it's um ass sub it's a small dock not more than um 3 ft wide I think is is what we found we have a definition under section 30- 53 under uh subsection J yeah I thought it was pretty precise uh whenever yeah oh 4 okay y um yeah I think I saw that oh it still doesn't Define what a catwalk is it has the part A do structure but no wi four yeah it does have the 4 foot restriction yeah I think I'd recommend just adding adding a little bit more particular what that is um but it that does have the restriction on the four 4T wide and no longer than 45 ft from sea wall but um I think um there's also regulations of how far they can be out from a dock but that that was really our only comment other than U you know correcting some terminology um and references to other statutes all right any comments on this section Council I have one on page 11 sub paragraph n aircraft operation I just wanted to confirm whether that includes drones it doesn't specify drones page 11 you say yes it talks about unmanned aircraft so I think that includes drones but would it be helpful to add that just to be clear it states model or remote operated aircraft I believe that would cover drones okay good and we just have to look as well there is some degree of preemption relative to the regulation of drones we want to make sure that we're in line with whatever those state and federal preemptions are I'm I'm going to tell you this is probably code that will eventually have to go away because Amazon is probably one of the largest lobers in the whole world oh yeah and I think the future is they're going to be delivering stuff by drone uh and it's something we'll see very soon uh and so that would shoot this down so speak and and similarly in that regard while you're talking about aerial approaches there's already preemptions that prevent cities from regulating or preventing autonomous vehicles from operating on their roadways um so as we talk about Transportation regulations we'll have to make sure we're we're consistent with statutory sches that has interstate commerce issues yes thank you sir and call number 10 in that same area that's referencing fireworks where it says at the end if somebody wants to do fireworks on the beach they have to come and get R the city manager has anybody ever done that of course any Fourth of July or New Year's uh you know right across the street from where I live on the beach we go out there to enjoy it there's plenty of people out there that put off a fair amount of fireworks right from the beach so they never do pardon they don't they don't oh they never come to you and per right correct so this open for if we wanted us to to do fireworks or something not sure why that maybe they're asking just even a family if they if they wanted to give permission I don't know so what would you do 7K said he want to do fireworks I would okay do just kidding what else um uh seaw walls um there's been a lot of mention of just uh maintenance of seaw walls I don't know if there's something we can add just to give more language to maintain your seall cuz we talk about the requirement for building one um I know a lot of this our code you know gets into some of the constructural [Music] requirements and specifications but they're not all up to date but that doesn't really matter in our case because the county covers that may be the inspection um but we we do it might be helpful to uh mention things about um draining correctly out the seaw wall as well in our code that's a good catch because it does relate to construction and um criteria for how to build one but it doesn't address maintenance well there was there was a big problem with one uh what was it two years ago three years ago that completely collapsed into the water oh and uh they almost lost their pool because of it um it was could see a clear crack going in to end on their sea wall um I don't know if there was any fine or if there was I don't I don't know what the outcome of that was other than well they got it fixed they got to new sea W but um I think we were aware of it and they applied for permit but by the time they did it it was too late um the argument well how do you how do you even check on that how do you how do you know if someone SE W is in disarray yes sir a number of years ago I picked up a manual from Mar the counil and the city took and the stuff that was not took it out and added the language in there it's very simple I think Kyle's got a copy of it and there's basic things you can see that should warrant an owner or even an inspector if you have a crack cap if you don't have any we Pooles which are now required in the seaw W if you have any horizontal cracks going across if you have any sinking ground behind the seaw wall and then at low tide between December and February if you can take a boat around ins it or once a year and see how much spaces between the lower portions of the original SE and that's just what a flag up there a warrant and inspection by a qualified sea wall engineer and I think that the problem we had with it was that um if they don't want you on their on their property you don't have to allow them on if you do it from the water side you're not on your would you like a com on on this conversation so uh we do have this manual and it does get a lot of informational like material that I think is beneficial for the res if we circulate it just so that they are are knowledgeable of what they may not know is happening to I remember it's it's education yeah when it comes to enforcement I defer to Randy on that because um it becomes like unless we're going to hire somebody who's qualified to make that all based on what they can expect I mean I think it could be done if we brought an engineer out on a boat and can get close to the seaw wall it wouldn't be on a person's property see that's that's the problem is that we don't have the staff that's qualified to say this has to be fixed and so then you don't have to have the staff to say if there's just to basic five basic problems that even a seaw wall engineer could p and say if you've got one of those five conditions you should have all of yeah I I would say I think I think the discourse is just in in the interest of facilitating some some motion forward on this I think the discourse is sort of going past each other that the gentleman from the public is talking about more of Public Service Announcement um guidance providing resources to the public so that um property owners who let's say you have property owners who have relocated from the Midwest have their seaw wall for the first time aren't familiar with that and saying here are resources the City offers as you continue to maintain your own property that's one thing what you folks are concerned with as the legislative body is is regulations and then by extension how that police power is wielded and and I think the mayor's concerns are valid in terms of do we have the means and resources if we're going to regulate this in some way Beyond saying you can't have unsafe structures generally on the property any any restrictions in the Florida building code or otherwise on unsafe structures if you're going to say it's a violation to have X how are you going to police X regardless of what x is if it's parking 8 in from a curb or the condition of your seaw wall as you consider regulations um and and amending Your Land Development code and and I don't think this falls into that category but I would just caution in relative to like virtue signaling type regulations we like we just we're doing this to enhance awareness because that that works fine as a as a philosophical notion until Lloyd's sitting on his back porch and calls Kyle and says hey I see that our code in section 66.7 says this and Kyle says well that's we don't really have the means to enforce it it's just there so people know not to do it it's kind of like a thank you for not smoking sign you don't want that in your code because if you can't administer it then you shouldn't have it um because it creates unreasonable Expectations by the public of their government and and you know an unreasonable burden for for government you don't want to put your public work staff your deputies or anybody else in that sort of predicament and so I'm not suggesting you shouldn't regulate this particular issue just again a word of advice as we Endeavor on this process and it's subject to yes sir that seaw wall that went in over on bore that pool wasn't really safe if you look at how long it takes to come back to comp compact the soil went into the water that seaw wall or that pool eventually is going to start along with all the piping not to say what kind of damage is happening to the neighbor seaw wall when that one fell in that's the problem all right somebody doesn't take care of theirs but what ramifications are for the people on either side right that's the issue that starts to come in so how do we protect the people that care with somebody that doesn't and when you buy a home and I bought mine 20 30 years ago there were no requirements to even have it looked at because I saw a problem I asked oh yeah you can have an inspector and I found I needed a new one but did you have any realator tell you about your seaw wall or you should have an inspector no and that's the problem well and you can't you can't enforce what real does not say true you can't control it and if I'm trying to sell a million dollar piece of property last thing I'm going to do is tell them they're going to have to spend $100,000 $100,000 for a new seaw wall as soon as they move in um I I don't really know if there's a good solution unless we hired somebody and they were they were qualifi certified in some way and then still would have to have access to the property what if what if you just came up with an idea and saying keep just put it out there on a code that it behooves you to have your seaw wall inspected every so many years to make sure that it's intact and safe and whatever I don't know at least something protect that's he helped with that but the the manual is only suggest it's only this is our recommended process but or this is your recommended process but it's not anything that we currently have a method of enforcing well we do have the manual like you're now a painy wall you know it has to be in Natural State natural form because High cracks and everything else I I will point out section 1074 which we around previously does require uh the sea walls be maintained in accordance with the seaw wall manual adopted by the council oh really it says no person shall occupy or let another or left to another for occupancy any residence any residential or non-residential property that does not comply with the following requirements and last on the list is the seaw manual adopted by city um it is reference at least I'm wondering can failure to maintain a seaw wall be a nuisance it is if it falls in well that's why we're I'm looking at page two of 12 which was the definition of nuisance it includes anything which is the suffering or permitting any condition to be to exist and it either in any way renders any person's insecure in Life or the use of property or essentially interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of life and property or depreciates the value of the property of others so if you don't maintain your seaw wall and you're your neighbor the neighbor property value is going to go down you're not going to enjoy your home with the risk of that again but how is this enforceable I I don't see it right now um even requiring let's just say that that every seaw wall in bayir Beach uh it was required by an ordinance that you had to have your seaw wall inspected every say 20 years or 10 years or something like that I mean is that is that even enforceable is that is that something that that we can do that reference to the seaw wall manual is under the building maintenance section so it's it's similar to any other unsafe building condition um yeah but but how do you prove how do you prove that that's the problem well yeah I don't know it's similar to the other building issues I don't think but yeah it's a good question I mean if if having weeds in your yard seems like we ought to be able to say oh I see cracks in the seaw wall That's that's here questioner [Music] SE your property is in the water so you go the question you raised earlier I can't go on property the seaw W so how close get to the seaw wall well that's a different story at completely different rules you can take your vot right to their SE it's uh rude as hell but yeah you can do okay yeah there's people that fish they'll pull right up to your dock they'll get right under your boat and they'll be fishing and there's really nothing you can do well know okay um other comments on uh Chapter 30 I would just ask if uh our attorney could weigh in on that and look at is there a way to enforce the condition of a seawall absolutely you can enforce the idea that any structure on your property on a property must be maintained in a safe manner consistent with um whether it's the Florida building code if there's some other statutory National Standard uh pointing to that my concern comes when you talk about for example sub4 that's been raised relative to to your manual is the language in there actually prohibitive or is it aspirational if it says you should do this and you don't do it that's not necessarily a violation and again what is the probative ele like for example if we have in there that you should as the mayor was sort of alluding to that you must have your seaw wall maintain uh inspected every 20 years what kind of database and record are we maintaining how often are we soliciting are our records consistent such that we can actually prove that that's wall has not been inspect because we're going to have the burden of proof when we if were we to take them to a magistrate or local ordinance violation court but yes you can certainly say just in the same way we can a shed a house or any other structure if a structure is not sound and is is presents a a danger by virtue of of um what's the word I'm thinking of uh decomposition isn't the right word but you get what I'm getting at if it's fallen into disrepair just like if we had a house without a roof on it the windows open if we have adopted for example subac the um safe and I forget the language there's two Co two different codes um subac and another one that are adopted usually as building maintenance standards for nuisance properties and the like if we have something like that we can enforce that whether the dock is the square peg that fits or the seaw wall is the square peg that fits in that round hole I'd have to look at what those Provisions are to see if there's language in those specific to those kinds of structures and what standards are in place yeah I'm looking at thinking about that not not a whole bureaucratic system in terms of inspections and all of that but just okay you didn't maintain your property right what can we do about it Mr be yes sir the city replaced um The Causeway between Harrison and and the island and because it was falling apart so the city had to inspect the sea WS the 22nd Street Bridge seaw wall that holds the structure of that brid was inspected and repaired and the cracks fill uh and how many other seaw walls have been replaced that are on by the city of Gile 16th Street has been proactive to do it's because the original seaw walls were over 70 years old and so many many many of the SE here have not been touched and you can see just walking around the boat as you have and I have the condition of them I have an original sea but you you got an advantage well I'm I'm also having it be at the tune of about 4 day one4 actually back in 58 is when they were still building in our yeah other comments on this section only one I spoke of earlier and that's doc When anybody permits a dock there's dimensions on there what and they're supposed to follow many of those dos and typol are not in the place that they should be so after a project like that finished they should come back and that would be the County's responsibility there's the inspectors to verify and all it would have to say in the code is the inspector has to verify the measurements on the dock before they sign off on I I would say that that um that that would be um a big problem I think instead of waiting until the dock is finished maybe there should be a sign off on the poles soon as they're plac the the the outline holds that that determine the the shape and size of your dock structure um even then who's the who's who's the guy who's doing that well you surve you take you take a pole down out in the water and you string line along the fence again who's who's going to do that they have to do it to set the pools that's the only way they can set them they do they do seaw wall company yes and if an inspector is doing his job he's and he's going to sign off on a on a job he should know what's going on if he doesn't then he's not doing the job and Kyle you said that they have no way of I would say that's determined by the county and if we put these requirements on them they may to have us find another inspector something independent of them I don't think we can make them inspect make sure that maybe that's part of the the contract with the seaw wall company need to verify and if they sign on the dot line they verify the measurements then they have to adhere to it if there's a well I think in any plans they're they're swearing to those measurements so if we ever find differently they're help responsible and I can tell you that I've had multiples whenever I was first looking at this I U I paid an engineering firm uh to come out survey my property come up with a design plan they drew it all up it was beautiful and they were wrong then another company came in and they surveyed it and I got something else and they were wrong and whenever I did it myself I was I was right but my point is is it's subjective it's everyone's opinion as to actually how it really does work um I think I think really um it's it's more of a self-regulation with the neighbors actually calling it out sort of like what we did with the uh the couple that were building there it wasn't it wasn't them it was it was the dock Builder was actually putting it in the channel going under the bridge and they were they were creating huge Hazard they were following their plan and their plan was wrong or something maybe they weren't following their plan but um enough citizens were concerned that they called city manager he called the dog company and they checked again and they admitted oh yeah we've made a big mistake and they had to move everything so there there's partial responsibility of of the neighbors to be watching what's going in try to try to prevent a neighbor issue you know by making sure that the company is held accountable by the people that are watching the uh my next door neighbor he's a great guy he had a doc design put it in he said I made it just like yours and he did um whenever they were ready to start installing the uh the boat lift he has a large straight lot whenever they they were getting ready to install the boat lift and um he asked me what I thought about it and I did some measuring and if they had actually moved forward and installed the boat lift it would have been about one and 1/2 ft from the property line and no one caught it no one caught it so they didn't they didn't install it and now they're stuck with this dock with a cutout for a boat left that's they're just with it thaten yeah I know all of this is history but my point is is that uh there's some personal responsibility to make sure that it's done right because you may encounter an issue with your neighbor and um and that's real problem happens docs are also addressed in chapter 94 which we we'll talk about some more so this is more of the construction part of it um but the reg the location of them and Fe regulations uh we'll have another shot all right anything else in this section not we move on to chapter 50 yes chapter 50 is streets sidewalks and other public ways and uh clarify this is not the design of streets and sidewalks and when you have to build them that's covered uh under subdivision and development but um this is more of what can go on in streets and sidewalks and other public ways uh the only comment we had on this was in 50-1 roadway intersection section visibility uh we're just recommending that the site visibility triangle be clarified a little more I think this is something the K mentioned and yeah we noed as well you could probably tighten that up where uh you are specifying what can be done within certain elevations within that uh site uh triangle which is 50-1 B uh typically uh codes will clarify that you have to keep a clear Zone uh between 2 and 1/2 ft above grade to 10 ft above grade for visibility purposes that's ourly comment just just adding that we've had some minor comments uh throughout but that's probably the only one I think we're discussing in your travels car around the city do you see that very often or whether it's bushes or fence when you come up to a stop sign you're going to make a turn your view is obstructed to where it's difficult to see we we've enforced it on certain Corners yeah the S triangle is defined but um if yeah if we could have a clear more concise language to it doesn't have to be on a street corner either it can actually be on a straight a straight drive we've seen where it was just way out in the street blocking someone view where they can't exit safely from their their own driveway next door and that's going to come up in chapter 94 um where we have Landscaping in the right way thanks keeping the frun set back and that's an area that really like tighten up or Define and figure out what we want done because we have a lot of variation throughout the city and what most properties are not in line with what the code actually says yeah correct there's going to be a lot more 94 on this issue and a lot of other issues I guess as well do you can uh consider 94 to be the biggest I think so yes challeng it will well lot lot yeah lot that's where the most issues will be sure um is this the correct chapter for uh the vertical clearance of the road way oh for Limbs and things like that I think uh I've noted that in '94 we did we find some regulations uh worth uh considering but we could cross reference probably a good idea to to do cross referencing uh if we're going to add things like that um one second any comments on Mr re Mr if you remember um probably in 19 we talked about the same issue and then some of the neighbors that I knew on the end of 22nd and the end of Lisa there privac privacy would be effective p and that's primarily the three Homes at the end of The Proposal now they have a good view when they pull out because there's no intersection and their privacy should be really nailed because if you most of them the only thing you see on those three homes is a driveway going to a garage because of the narrow front yes they have a wide back expanse to the water but the fronts are limited so that's something that we ought to look at before we make sure change bring all those trees or Shrubbery down to a height so if you're in a c is what you're saying if you're in a special unique circumstance where your you and your neighbor would be staring at each other then it should have a different different a different code for those three Homes at the end of the we won't call out any particular address we call out C yes because we have that kind of exception for buding up to public property or extion all right what else that's all we have on this chapter if the council has anything they'd like to discuss anyone no right um well that takes care of those four chapters now we're up to General business uh and I wanted to bring something up to see what the council thought about it um I've been discussing with Mr reer um what is the benefit of the fiveyear look back period um and so far I really haven't got any benefit and I'm going to let Mr reer speak on that uh I'm not recommending that we do away with a look back period but I see that uh Trader island has no look back period it basically resets every time they they complete a project if you go to Indian Rocks Beach they have a oneyear look back period but if you go to b beach we have a fiveyear look back period this all started whenever a student surveyed us all I don't know if everyone was surveyed but I was and I think I think Kyle is actually meeting with with a young man about this particular Rule and why it exist and and what's the benefit what's the drawbacks of of having it is it too long is it should it be shortened should be done away with what's the benefits with FEMA uh so after you brought it up I looked into our CRS credit and the points that we earn um and our verification which is every five years and the the verification when they do that is when they audit you for everything you're supposed to be doing excuse me what is a CRS a community rating system okay it's through the national flood insurance program it's a it's an incentive um beyond the uh being part of the national flood insurance program um so there's Baseline rules that everyone has to follow that's kind of the guidelines that uh Mr Mor was bringing up that our federal restrictions to be uh to to participate to be a community that uh residents could get National FL insurance on the subsidized program so the community rating system is kind of like it's a discount system built on top of it um to tighten up um create inste up to have more restriction to benefit the overall program so we are a class six which um it's each tier it goes all the way down to a class one um if you were say class nine you get 5% discount on flood insurance since for class six each class gives you 5% more so we get a 20% discount um so so when they do that verification process just like a 5-year audit if you're in class six um they come through and they just check what you're doing they give you the credit the points to verify it that um that you earn that class so we did that in 2020 um I went back and talked to our ISO which is like a um independent uh person that works for the state and you know he pulled up our scoring and you know I talked about this look back period which is also uh known as the cumulative substantial Improvement um so so substantial Improvement goes all the way back to um it it's a main rule of being part of the national flood insurance program it's what people a lot of times called FEMA 50% rule um that is by FEMA guidance it should be per year standard so I don't know with the community is doing it per project that's actually in what they're supposed to be doing but it's per year um or per event if you're talking substantial damage and um so if you if you're part of the national flood insurance program if uh you have a property um regardless of how much the overall property is worth um taking into account the location and all that what they do is they they want to appraise the value of the actual structure which is what you're insuring for flood insurance um that is done at a cost value appreciation added in so you have a house that's built this like 1960 um you know a lot of times they'll depreciate by years of of usable life um and you're doing an appraisal on what that actual structure is worth um but not if if you were to rebuild it like what actually worth the materials and how much they degraded and everything so they get that number um and that's the value of your structure and then what the rule is is that if you're going to do any improvements to that structure you can't go the value of that Improvement can't be over 50% of what the value of structure is so the fiveyear look back is instead of it being in one year's time it we have a fiveyear look back saying within five years of that first Improvement that you had it up praised you can't go over 50% in 5 years as opposed to just one year which really restricts you so the the value of your home they look at the value of your home from five years ago that's yeah that starts the math um I'm I'm still I I don't hear any benefit to having this rule one versus five I I don't I don't understand it and is there anything going to change that what is the benefit because I'm going to I'm going to explain why I'm asking all these questions um there are a lot of old homes with good bones in this community um obviously uh there are some that that live in lower Ling areas like I always lose my bearings here but um if you head south they're in flood zone and I'm sure that they would love to build up if they could so leave the garage in a danger zone declare your your downstairs nonh habitable and build up and now you've got a better home but instead the solution for most people is turning into either sellout so you lose a good neighbor you lose a still a nice home it gets knocked down and you get a mansion back in its place and then also with with a mansion um I'm not going to say it's everyone but we get a lot of part- timers that that aren really um it's the old charm that that this community was um was built around and so what I'm looking at now is is I'm thinking well why not give these homeowners a chance to actually stay in Belair Beach instead of forcing them to leave because they uh there's no path to fix their home even if you look at the front of a lot of these older homes uh I'm sure there's many homeowners who would love to just be able to put a new face on the front of their home bring it up to a Modern Standard so that they look like a newer style home but it's cost prohibitive because you have this fiveyear look up so a great example is you buy a house you move into b beach and you buy a house the prior owner or The Flipper dumped thousands of dollars into this home in a very short period of time you move in thinking that you're going to do some things and you can't do squat to your home so you're stuck with something that really you had a completely different vision for than what you got and so um you either sell it or you live with it and and then you're probably not very happy with it and so now you've got to wait five years years for the clock to reset and that's hoping that nothing breaks because if something breaks and it requires permitting then you the clock it doesn't really reset but you extend that time period out the clock moves forward a little bit but you're still looking at five years and normal wear and tear and maintenance on a home uh for some of these homes they're they're not able to get it done and um I if I if unless there's a benefit I'm not really sure why we're doing this to ourselves um yes I agree with you completely and I thank you for bringing that up because I've encountered the 50% rule on many occasions and I think it really is a detriment to our community in the sense that people that do want to commit and live here can't make even some basic impr I mean to refit uh to hurricane windows is a major expense uh if you add in a new water heater and oh I got to do a roof repair in the meantime we end up with more der properties that are just decaying as opposed to people having the ability to maintain their home there is there is an exception for like if say your windows put out um you are allowed to be exempt from that 50% if you're bringing it up to code so you're if so say your window broke and then you bu requirement have to put in a hcan window you can't do your whole house but you can do you can fix what broken you can do 25% a year you're going to replace all the windows I mean without even getting a permit I think the county says 25% 25% o you can do per year but it still has to follow yeah because I did mine yeah yeah but you weren't over you weren't on the edge what the example is say someone did a whole bunch of remodeling sold the house and then you bought it and all a sudden something breaks you can you can repair it like but you can't do your whole roof if you get a weak in the roof which people want to do they want to put a whole roof on but see that's where you some issues would the one year would the five year removal of the you're fixed what you just say uh it would certainly help because most people aren't doing half the value of their home in a single year right um that I'm sure there's projects that are going to happen there's there there is some disadvantage there it's going to bring more traffic in uh to Kyle's office uh into Aon handles is Aaron handles permitting right now or no no I do oh you do it all okay so it's definitely going to increase the number of permits that would be coming in um I realize that but also we charge for permits so there would be possibly increased Revenue that that could um maybe make make it to where we could afford additional help just for permit about tax value well tax value would goes up every time you do a project and then if you really wanted to go up sell your house and then just Skyrocket I just talked to work SCS office last week about that discounts and everything like that it's still in litigation there hasn't been any it's it's it's a total mess I mean you look at 2.0 you all these discount to get then you say you're where are they and I don't know if you heard my complaints about this to Council meetings no one can give you an answer and that's why like 14 states are suing it's a total like when they Chang the rating system it really kind through out the window because it took the grandfather took the grandfathering out so like you said what's the benefit anymore because regardless you're going to re model your house is below the flood plane you know you're going to pay a lot for insurance if you want to insure it regardless of what you put into it so you're going to be paying for it anyways right you're not getting any benefit before the benefit sort of was like being a good Steward of the system so that you weren't allowing people for so much money below the flot plane and then screwing the whole system over out but like yeah with the 2.0 and it changed you know everybody's coming up full rating and the real people that are saving now are the people who are built up because they're no longer paying for people that H right well and um there's a possibility that a lot of these um I believe that this rule changing this rule would actually bring some relief to the southern side of the bridge that for people that that really wanted to fix their home and solve the problem that it's not it's not really a huge deal when it enters your garage but it's a giant deal whenever it enters your home in your living space just coming over here today walking up the street my neighbor saying are we going to do anything about this flooding you know I'm about ready to sell I can't take it anymore you know so everything's been on the table we aggressively looking at it thankfully and uh well it's it's a real real bur well I see that the um the image of Beller Beach I can see it changing rapidly as people choose to sell out and move away because they see no path to fixing their home they can't afford the mansion and they can't afford to fix there or they there's I'm sorry it's not that they can't afford to upgrade their home but there's no pathway for them to do that um I think would help dramatically and I I believe that um overall we would have more tax revenue we would have happier residents I believe that they would stick around longer uh instead of just cashing out of leing and and I think overall we'd have more beautiful SE absolutely um what I I would ask all of you to do is put some serious thought into it this come up in 94 right yeah and and it's in if you're looking for it it's it's not even an ordinance it's in definitions at the very beginning of the chapter so read up on it and uh all it is is a word change or two words instead of five years it's one year would be the change and and that's it it's fixed and if it becomes problematic well um we can cross that bridge when the time comes but right now I see no benefit whatsoever to what we're doing great point I'd like to go back and kind of listen to the look at the minutes surrounding when they actually adopted it because I I to my knowledge they never got credit or the city's never got credit for that so I don't know what the mindset was with me I I asked show the city's credit to the and they S three different agencies the last agency was uh some little Island no one could speak English and that was the national flood review or something it was it was a total joke it is tough to get a full understand on um the one thing when I was at conference that they assured because it comes up you know our communities Representatives communities are asking why are we even doing RS program because you're looking at how you know all the scales and like how and they're like are you know are we even getting the discount but they that's I mean they assure us that we'll be we'll be PID more without that discount I don't know exactly how well but that's what I'm saying guarantee it just show to me in writing like if I'm if you're underwriting a policy it should say here's their discount it doesn't I'm 4T above flood level well I'm should I should another 20% there where's that at oh it's in there no it's not in there right all right do we have any other comments in general business yes sir um Randy I'm going to try to get you a pay raise if you P gra it was I was it's under 94 but it's a tent I think we going to talk about that tonight we can do a a quick conversation on it but I don't want to I don't want to stay here all night over because we're going to be discussing it anyway but uh I think there's nothing that can be done about the one that happened however I believe that language in our code would at least cause um for for anyone else that wants to do this it would prevent them from putting it in the set back and that's what happened because considered to be a utility is that right it's it's actually not in set back at all but what we determined is our definition of mechanical equipment it would meet that definition if they encroach the set back up to 4T what is it it's a the amateur and radio I miss so it actually is not he's out of his out of and everything that's what the count everything that was required I mean it does look like they put them through um you know separate engineering for that um I was I was just visualizing like every other house having one every so it's it's not the same set back that we designated for things like generators it's actually outside outside okay so um I don't think we have anything I just don't I don't see it everyone's looked at it I I appreciate the inquiry and the question you know for in the event it wasn't clear the question relative to the existing antenna on the um property that's been the subject of discussion since I was hired in the summer of 2022 I would agree with the mayor's conclusion that what's done is done in as much as that what I told told you or this Council it's composition varying over time what I told this Council was the the violation that we prosecuted most directly was the absence of a permit at the time the property owner was representing himself if you will and saying I don't need a permit and if I applied they deny me and so well you you can't presume that you have to give us the opportunity to review it give us a fair shake and we'll give you one and the gentleman subsequently secured legal counsel um I was I learned admitted knew things about that area of the law that I was not specifically familiar with and we said and my advice to the city was that that attenna had to go through permitting review we could not just say they're banned um we had to Pro determine if it could be accommodated and if anything in our code specifically prevented it during the city's portion of the permitting review manager reer and I conducted a detailed review of our code it did not fall within the setback it did not meet definitions for other elements that may have imposed restrictions and then ultimately it was submitted for permitting review and our request to in turning it over to the county we said we do not wish to Prejudice your analysis however common our specific concerns relative to this structure are its height its wind sustainability and similar safety concerns that we would impose on any other structure in our community so as you perform your independent autonomous duties as our building official please ensure that you review these elements they were reviewed as manager reers indicated it was subject to specific additional engineering supplementation that may not ordinarily be required the property owner complied by providing it and in conducting that review whether it be with guidewires or anything else and I'm not suggesting there are any I don't know the particulars because as your City attorney I don't get involved in permitting U but I will tell you that it passed permitting and the structure is being erected or um raised and lowered as the permitting allows if it is not consistent with permitting then that is a that is an entry point for the city now that said as it relates to that what I would call settled matter um and again remember there's federal preemptions and state preemptions on what we can do relative to these structures and just even as we talk about going forward imposing setback limitations I would suggest to you that there's some case law saying just saying it's in our setback is not enough can you accommodate it can you give it a variance to say okay they're proposing to go you have a restriction of 10 ft they're proposing to go 2T into that is that so such an imposition on the community that it cannot be um tolerated or is it hey I'm trying to put it in normally you say they can only be in the rear of my property I'm trying to go in the side rear because there's a giant oak tree that I'm not allowed to remove you we'll have to go through a case by casee analysis regardless right so the point is absolutely right that I think I personally as your City attorney would advise you as to that property that's a settled me matter I do agree with you as well that we should review our code with the assistance of the planner and my legal review to see are there things we can do better making sure that it is Falls within the definition of whether it's electrical engineering or some other definition that we provide for an antenna shall not be within X feet you know but but may secure a variance subject to ABC criteria those are all options we may have so bottom line is you're saying nothing this is grandfather and over I'm not saying it's grandfathered because a what a grandfather provision suggests is something that is a non-conformity prior to the adoption of the code I'm saying that what has been erected is consistent with your code to the extent it is inconsistent with your code it is inconsistent with Provisions we are unable to enforce owing to preemptions and otherwise so I'm not suggesting it's grandfathered I'm actually saying it's in compliance it's gone through permitting and there's nothing for us to do relative to that structure however comma we have the ability to amend our code to be proactive about future situation see where what lessons learned through this process and what legal issues did we identify or planning issues because that's kind of a vend diagram of its own did we identify that we may be able to resolve in the Here and Now such as maybe you you must you must hire a professional company you must have an engineer who is uh who will is willing right and and specifying what those engineer design guidelines must include must they include wind rating specifications must they include a whatever those criteria a through z or 1 through 100 R and I'm not suggesting we get into 100 criteria uh but specifying what it is we're looking for there was a lot of having to retroactively figure out what both for the property owner and for the city you know what is it exactly you know when he asked when his counsel when his legal counsel came to us and said I'm prepared to work with you and work with your code show me what applies it's a question that had not been asked yet and so that's something that we can make sure there's a a clear road map where this to come up in the future and uh just uh giving a different point of view than what we've all heard and we've thought about uh during this uh this event uh very surprisingly uh the gentleman actually did go to Great Links to have a uh a safe Tower as as much as it looks awful to the neighbors and it looks scary uh I think that he went through every possible scenario to make sure that uh he was it was as safe as could possibly be erected and and and I wish to say as again the you know issu spotter they say or bad guy often that my legal analysis is given with all sympathy to neighboring Property Owners I'm not suggesting that it is now must be desirable to them just as much as they have private property rights so too does the individual who erected this they are compliant with our code and and at every Point I've always said if a neighbor has property rights concerns they may wish to Avail themselves of their own rights there's also that's a broader discussion we need to have as we talk about some of these Land Development regulations on what is the role of government versus what is my role if I want to whether it's Sue my neighbor or work with my neighbor or find a solution with my neighbor that's that doesn't necessarily mean the local government needs to be a part of of that process you know some of the concerns raised in in the discourse recently concern for example the insurance rating for that property owner and the neighboring property owner the city has no role in Insurance relative to private property owners insurance so I don't know what that is but even if it was a problem it's not the city's problem to resolve so you know I I say that with sympathy to all parties involved unfortunately my job as advising this city is one to help you manage your risk but two to often find an imperfect Solution by definition it's still a solution but it's going to leave people unsatisfied and there was no perfect solution that perfectly reconciled that gentleman's private property rights with this with the desire to say I don't wish to see this have this near me or otherwise I I wish I could offer a solution that resolved all those if I did I would probably not be in meetings at 9:00 at night so no and I and I jumped all over and I apologize for the past um doing that because this is a learning job and um I apologize like I said to you but I think this is an FCC right and like you just said a private property right and the pr probably the private property rate is even more yeah it's it's it's a sacran value in our American system and our state the thing is I'm not going to do this am I can I go wct that can I go and wct the tower War just like he did in my Y and presently yes and it would look like hell this city would look like hell my and I think the terminology that Frank used earlier regarding the grandfather term once if we go in and change the code and so now we have a more strict defined Code system you know ordinance and Bill Smith goes and and build something U and they say well gosh that other Tower didn't mean anything because they are grandfathered inre based on the previous correct that would be the dis I have to tell you that if he goes no matter what we do to our code if the new antenna goes through the same the same uh process it passes it passes B will sign off on it that's right because they deem it as safe it is it's not a threat and and we can't create an ordinance and I don't is that something can't be more stct right you know what I'm saying well that see the Lop pole that they see a tower and really the antenna the thing that's at the top of the tower is useless without the tower so it's effectively the antenna right the whole structure the case law treats them as a single structure but what I'm saying but can we make it a we cannot have a what I can tell you is we can set general height limitations but they cannot be absolute given the preemptions we would still have to consider question accommodations and say like if somebody came to us and said for instance and I'm going to use all this terminology wrong I have a UHF signal and in order to get my UHF signal around the surrounding bridge and trees I need to be at 42 ft you have 27 ft as your restriction arbitrary numbers we may have to well considerer that 42t request provided it can be done in a manner that otherwise satisfies life health safety requirements if they can do that we may have to pursuant to federal and state preemption say yes no no other structure in this town could be in the city could be that high however because of federal preemptions we have to at least give it consideration and if we can find good reason to not give that variance or say or establish they're asking for 42 but we have our own study that says they could do it at 36 but then we're still having a fight about going over that absolute the Saving Grace of of going much higher than what we are right now is the fact that you get so high and now requires wires going to the ground to keep it upright and it's permanent you can't take it down during the storm so I'd say that what he did was the best case scenario uh where their safety concerns are taken into consideration and still he's able to successfully operate his ham radio um and really that's it's the very best scenario that legally we have is what he did yes I just have one question and then one your topic if I may um and that is U question is has anybody shared with the complaining Neighbors information that we now yes yes M right away good I figured that was the case wasn't well rece I need well rece okay yeah I figured that was the case but I just wanted to be sure because they they want to have that mayor reached out to them and everything you know very nice thank you new topic if I may sure um I understand and was very pleased to hear that we have a new application for board council members so I was going to bring that up mind if I take this uh Mr reer we currently have three applicants we have two so one of them did not I thought we had he was going to and he did not changed his mind okay so um I asked Renee to accept applications until the election because I wanted to know what's your number how many we were actually going to need to fill the spots and so we needed three well then we take whatever we've got but if we only need one the last thing that I wanted to do was bring three people in and then have to go through this process again after the election uh so um uh what I would like this Council to do is is after the election is over now we know what the criteria is I would like to bring uh I would like to bring all the candidates in you know a small work session like this where we just interview them but we don't vote okay we meet with them all we ask them all the questions that we want to and then we go home and then we come back at the following council meeting and we elect our new council member or members depending on how the election goes um if council is good with that coun uh yes yes if the council is good with that well it it would have to be very quick because the election is the 19th so you would have to you have to bring them in within a week and vote them in I don't know what day be April that's that's a quick we could do a special you're going to have a special meeting anyway s we swear her and right you're you're in there's no election for you yeah I understand it but you swear swear oh swear you should it doesn't require a special meeting we've done this in uh regular meeting is April sorry the April meeting will be April 1st yeah April 1il that's not a lot of time to um look at the candidate I mean that's a that's a very short period to jam in okay the election's over let's have a special meeting now let's uh let's elect a member I think we're okay uh why don't we why don't we have a special meeting after the April meeting why would we we have a special meeting so we have the election and let assuming it says okay by so we only need one so then at the uh April 1st council meeting that's when we would vote them I want to have time to for us to have sort of informal interview process where we speak to each one of them and and then also give the council time to actually if you want to call them up and ask them questions I think that we should we should do our due diligence and make sure that um that whoever the the fifth or the fifth sixth and seventh members are um that we get the very best hopefully we'll have more uh we'll have more come in but even with two if it turns out to be a five member Council I want to I want to make sure we get the best so if everybody's good with that that's what I would like to do and um and then I guess maybe uh we'll figure out after the April 1st what day is a good day we can maybe by by the time we have our work session maybe we can have the special meeting just before it bring them in and and then now we've got our council member and or members and then we go right into a work session I give that yeah okay and anything else is I'm ready to go me too uh motion to adjourn motion I have a second all right all in favor"
