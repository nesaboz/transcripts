flag of the united states of america and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all medicare please call council member banker here councilmember glenn dunn yeah councilmember leslie otero here councilmember rita spoke here vice mayor dave gavis here mayor joseph manzo here city manager lee lynn [Music] okay thank you first item in business is approval of the agenda motion please second the comments from the city back to council all in favor aye opposed passes 6-0 is approved next comes the citizen commons we have a three-minute presentation by any citizen that would like to address us the procedure for this is as follows one second you come up to the podium here please give your name and residency um i will tell you that there should be out there and on that presentation table of conduct that is the rules that we operate by um you speak respectfully to the council and we'll speak respectfully with you that's the basic just of 12 rules there you have three minutes of time unless someone gives you extra time you cannot speak on any item that's on the agenda during this portion if there's something you wish to speak of that's on the agenda i would call for citizen comments at that time when you come up and speak at that point okay so if it's on the agenda you'll talk later about it if it's not on the agenda now is the time to speak to the council finally the last thing is don't expect counsel to get a discussion with you you're not permitted under the rules to speak back and forth with you so the most we're going to say to you is thank you i do have the option of referring something of concern to the city manager to the city attorney with that said someone anyone like to speak with counsel yes sir yes we granted mike about two inches of value defined joshua seventh street i'm going to be talking about the federal lawsuit so if anybody wants to recuse themselves only okay about a year ago a council member reed assault put forth in motion removed june james coy from the parks airport it didn't have anything to do with her job performance it was in part due to what she said at the bellaire shores council meeting twice this council was warned by the mayor that this was a violation of her first amendment rights the city attorney also warned not to remove her three of the council members who voted to pass this motion are still active which is gwen gunn rita swope dave gaddis they ignored this legal advice due to them proving that they're not capable of putting the city's best interest ahead of their own personal achievements and personal indebtedness even to the extent of getting the city involved in the six-figure lawsuit i call that they do the right thing and they stand down and resign from their position and not causing more liability to the city thank you thank you thank you for your comment yes good evening my name is jolie rodero and i live on 113 12th street i also have um in case i run over three minutes from my husband pete and from the development on one second please on that can i shut down just the hands please is that correct you're giving your three minutes all right and yes ms welsh yes paddy nine minutes for missouri on the floor i begin with like a green support joshua's statement that uh due to this uh some members of this council's misbehavior the city is now facing a large federal discrimination suit and of which most likely the bellier beach legal has to pay for your defense i would ask that they all resign as well what i'm really going to talk about is a sign that's uh being planned for outside and i'm assuming that perhaps maybe i'm assuming correctly that you already had permitting requests done or any kind of studies done because if um if it hasn't occurred yet you will need them not only the permitting but you will need environmental studies and you will need traffic impact studies because we've contacted the dot and those are going to be mandatory i would like that if you have any studies with reference to that sign that i can have a copy of it bella beach belongs to the florida coastal island sanctuaries program that works to protect certain and endangered coastal birds two particular birds the little blue heron and the tri-color heron they nest right out there on bird island right outside of our city hall and they're threatened and endangered it is part of this floral coastal program to protect these endangered birds the retention pond across the street is also home to local and endangered migrant and migratory birds and it's also our responsibility to protect them we're constantly being told to shut off bright lights to save the sea turtles yet bright lights affect all wildlife they affect their flying habits their breeding habits bellaire beach city hall is already lit up like the taj mahal every single night and now you will have a colored blinking or rotating bright the electric sign in front what is the impact of this sign on traffic slowly stopping to be designed we already have backups on up and down the causeway what is the impact on the homeowners that face the causeway what is uh most importantly our coastal and dangerous birds how is that damage measured and what is beller beach city going to do about that i'd like to know it in the course of the evening if you have charged a committee to study these topics and the environmental impact on the sign and when they meet so that i can follow up on that i think the true measure of this sign is a potential revenue that the city could see by renting out space on its advertising sign and i will request again request copies of all the studies since i don't know how the city is going to conduct this business i would like to make some suggestions in the event that it continues to go on and go through the design whether the sign be turned off at night every night like the closing of their beach gates that the colors the brightness the solid versus blinking or the sun be selected to cause the least harm to the birds what is the increased cost of operating this sign is this in the budget has it been accounted for how about the longevity of the sign usually it's about eight years and how will it be disposed adding to landfill and is there again i already asked if there's a sign committee charged with the completion of these studies and if so i'd like to know the members and when they meet thank you thank you before you step away you made several requests are those to be considered public reference requests okay then um one second so um i'm not sure how he wasn't taking notes of this but she can review the tape or the we're not supposed to interact with the residents okay so if we're going to dispense with the rules then we should have done that in the beginning but if you want to make a motion dispense with the rules we'll dispense with the rules yes i'd like to motion that i respond to that citizen's comment like we normally do at every other previous meeting and seem to be typing up the rules just for this one occasion and i'd like to just kind of relax so i can make a comment questions had an interaction with residents so um if that's what the council votes for then we'll have the interaction with the residents it's not my job to make the rulings on the fly request to call the questions you know if you wanted to be mayor you should run for you don't know your procedure what happens after you get done talking what's the next spot does anybody know debate and then after debate what happens anybody just jump right in some comments citizen comments correct the mundo and if i don't let the citizens speak what am i violating the open public meeting rules so we don't hold the question yet but thank you despair the commentary move on well you wanted to call the question if you've tried that before it didn't work in the past it's not going to work with me i accept your friendly reminder no problem any other council comments well yes i'd like to make a comment uh it seems that we just randomly bend the rules whenever we feel like it i think basically you pick your favorites and those are the ones that we comment back and forth with everybody else that you don't agree with they're ignored and uh and chastised so i think if uh mr gunn would like to respond i'm i'm all in for it and the personal attack rule that you just did say i pick and choose favors would that be like you were you picking your motion favor right back at you my friend okay i'll pick favorites with the rules the rule says you like like a child you get that from your friend the rule says we don't have an interaction every time you've had an interaction the council voted to have that interaction unless you change the ordinance which you don't have time to do because you're sticking your nose in my lawsuit you wind up having a rule we have with that said any further council comments everyone heard that his lawsuit oh yeah he took you a city council resolution to figure it out my lawsuit man zoe beller short david michael gaddis i would just like to if we're going to suspend the rules we're suspended for all we will okay for this for this segment i understand the rules in that and by pitting these poor people that sit here until 11 o'clock tonight they want to go home and they make comments i would love to entertain your thoughts and wishes and desires you're the people on the city or you know your tax money so i i understand and i would i support you thank you okay thank you any citizen comments the child is welcome to comment on this particular topic just on this motion to uh to open it up for back and forth okay back to counsel i have one more which is i know that everyone feels like i'm trying to stifle them but the truth is is that our mayor which i'm not allowed to address actually no citizen comments to the end of the night i'm the one who have gone back for you the one for me you'd all be here at 11 o'clock so i hope you remember that yes and that stroke of brilliance by david who was a council member at the time the reason why i moved to the end of the night mr gunn if you're going to keep playing with your fingers go outside and play with yourself and come back when you're done okay mr gaddis it was at the end of the night so that we would have that interaction which would have been our immediate point thereafter you moved into the beginning and our part doesn't come until oh i am 17. we're on item two so we're the ones who got penalized by your brothers i'll call the question all in favor of having a dialogue back and forth with each person who comes up on citizen comments this evening i i i post mr gunn you may address ms rodero you are up here right now and you have plenty of time left so mr gunn will now address your comments thank you i just want to address some of the issues you raised about the ginger old sign because i think there's a concern that the city is just leaping into this thing blindly digital or electronics so the city manager and his staff is a intelligently working on some implementation and ordinance guidelines for further down the road when other people may come forward and say hey i want a digital assignment so with respect to the background the city of baylor beach has begun the acquisition process to replace an older mining design the new sign will incorporate electronic panels that provide an efficient and effective means of displaying timely public notifications the displays are highly customizable with respect to color font size brightness screen transition and animation and a message quality which is how long the message stays on the screen okay in order to balance the public service provided by electronic display with traffic safety as well as the residential community ambiance or play with miller beach the following guidelines are being distilled and looked at okay because we've done some research and there are old standards for how progressive communities implement electronic signs okay it's not new technology and there's a lot of guidance out there how people have done it successfully as well as how people have done it properly just created new problems okay so with those thoughts in mind further down the road i i anticipate that the city will be talking and working with our planning and zoning committee for future requests for digital signs and the consideration of dealing with some of these electronic signs within the city of denver beach the areas of emphasis with respect to electronic signs include some of the following i know in the future there was a concern about oh well anybody can just put a digital sign now wherever they want well the gold standard is you tie the placement of digital signs basically to the volume of traffic on roadways so if you if you put some constraints around the volume of traffic on the roadways obviously you don't have the traffic volume on a residential street so that might prohibit you from placing any electronic sign advertising that your house is foreseen or you're having a garage sale on this weekend or something along those lines okay uh there's also some considerations for whether the electronic sign is placed on the person's premise or the business premise or off the pros so again these are a lot of things that we're looking at and trying to understand and be smart about with the implementation of this thing there are guidelines for the setback how far back from the street you have to place this sign and there are also traffic safety impacts okay there are concerns about the hours of operation and one of the factors like you said is there are energy consumption costs to the skin and typically those are a little more expensive than a residential home it can be up to 30 times depending on how bright it is or how how many hours of operation you have but so we're being respectful trying to understand that and understand that this thing may not need to be on 24 hours a day there are also concerns about brightness in daylight these gold standard is less than 5 000 nits which is a unit of brightness for these signs if you drive around and look at some of the signs that are out there on commercial properties they are very offensive and never at any time was the goal or the anticipated need meant to be a bright fireworks display okay and other times other than daytime the gold standard is less than 250 minutes so you can see that it changes greatly from day to night and of course there's an auto trust function uh that's uh basically tied to the ending so on a cloudy day it's certainly not going to be as bright as if the sun is out full of water the size will be a function of zoning or adjacent structures and that's tied to the planning any possible groundwork that we laid for future zoning restrictions on this thing there are concerns enrolled standards about minimal message duration which is this wall time of talking how long should that message be on display on the screen the issue there is if you have too short of dwell time like three to five seconds you're creating a distraction to drivers so what you do is you set a minimum dwell time of like 11 seconds which is the standard for a 35 mile per hour roadway and a view when you come into view at 500 feet so i mean this stuff isn't just made up there are standards forcing this stuff and we're looking very seriously at this time you're not just going to jump into this thing and of course the last thing is a maximum transition time and you don't want to sing too slow or otherwise people will be looking at the sign waiting for it to change over and you don't want to have sequential messages you don't want to have screen a tied to screen b because then that's a distraction as well so you limit sequential messages and you maximize the amount of time that the screen changes display okay so i think what i'm just trying to uh say here is that we we're doing some poland and we're putting some critical thought to this thing we're not just shotguning the approach to this thing the this the display has to have a default setting so if there is a problem with the display or the power outage or some problem with the display it shuts off basically so you don't have a funny message on the sign blanking flashing and distracting drivers no interactive displays with pedestrians or cars some of these other municipalities are getting so advanced with this stuff as your car drives by the digital side interacts with with your telephone or your car say hey you know hey why don't you stop in and we'll give you a free uh free stay at the hotel if you come in and register any questions on anything for you mr gun but i beg to differ if you didn't address any of my comments which were particularly about environmental studies not speaking about environmental studies being done to impact birds or the traffic study you haven't done from what i've heard from you any kind of official study you're just following guidelines that are published out there which is great but i don't trust the council since the idea of design to begin with was in opposition of all the residents that responded to your survey twice that they didn't want this sign yet you went ahead shotgunning as you said the sign ahead so since it's coming whether we like it or not it's being rammed down our throats i want to make sure that you do follow all the guidelines that there is an environmental study not just you reading your guidelines just you designing what so-and-so is doing down the street but that the governmental agencies say this will not damage these birds these will not dodge will not impact our traffic we know the traffic here is horrific on the weekends and on the set and we don't want any more distractions so all you told me was how the sign works and frankly i don't care how the sign works because i don't want the sign period i think it is a crass destruction uh distraction to their city we don't need that sign i think i heard a gentleman in our last your last council meeting and i think he's the gentleman that maybe the company that's going to do the sign from the way he was speaking and i think the primary reason is the uh revenues that advertising and that sign are going to be able to bring well at least it will offset the high cost of running the sign so i thank you for your comments i don't like your comments on the council i think you will sound like high schoolers or middle schoolers bitcoin back and forth protocol is protocol and you need to follow the rules that's how we are all civil i follow the rules i don't speak longer than i have to right thank you my honest thank thanks mr darrell hang on mr bear mr darrell yes i wanted to address your comments i have a right to speak here too at least on this issue you said it exactly what i was thinking i don't care how many pixels nips and whatever the hell the sign runs with i care about what you just brought up which i was unaware of environmental studies and traffic studies that i know i have not heard one word about in any of the planning of this and why would that be any different i'm going to show later on this letter that i demanded from the florida depa you might remember that our beautiful seos were clear-cut to the ground in november by our city manager and he didn't know me there despite the fact that there was a sign not more than 20 foot away from the sixth street uh dunes that sign has been removed i still have a picture of it we like to say we didn't know any better no one told us that was wrong i didn't know i couldn't run that red light well dep does have rules and if you're aware of them then i'm going to refer this to our city attorney and to our city manager for follow-up we have a citizen that has said that there's rules i'm aware of no studies that have been done whatsoever so i'd like to know if there have been studies if there's studies if they've been done and what the results of those studies are so that we don't get any more dep letters telling us more about more laws that also goes for the department of traffic and if there's a highway study that needs to be done i believe that's the county a county road out there so i guess it's the county i don't know you've done more research city manager well we haven't done any studies and i i think she's erring on the on the wrong side personally and there's a lot of things you do studies for there was a sign out there that put out more lumens than this thing does and now you're telling me that this sign's bad for the birds yeah we had a sign out there that put out more light than the sign so i i will look into it just to clarify and i'll get you get you an answer and i'll get some console answers about opening up the studies and uh conversations with the teen i will send them to you so that you can that's what we spoke to i don't think dot has anything to do with this traffic i have seen online and heard from neighbors that we intend on advertising on this side i know everyone on the council we've met and we have not one time discussed ever advertising just because the salesman brings up and you can do it with this sign does not mean we're going to do it he could very well say we can throw it in the water we're not gonna do it so i appreciate uh your honesty and if if you're gonna post things online you might as well clarify and say this is my opinion that they're going to advertise instead they're probably going to advertise they that is my opinion and i can't post it any way i like it in your council meeting last month the salesman or the gentleman actually said it because there was um i'm going to say reluctance a little reluctance from the council and says oh and by the way you can do this and get revenue now based on the way this council has performed i don't put anything past it so if there's a way to make money in that site i'm sure you will find it and we'll go for it down the road will you vote just sorry i appreciate you bringing up the wildlife issues and everything like that and i'm all for wildlife but just go right down the street here at 9th street for years there's been sea ducks that harbor on that beach okay migrate out into the water once was a protected beach that no boats would come in or have to come in and out of speed now you have speed ooh cds whatever you want motorized chris i think they think they're bowling pins some of these kids try to hit them that's right you have the electric bikes that clear the path they almost hit me i mean i'm a bigger target and you know when i contacted the fwc and i don't want to show the figure figure finger they gave me here like they more or less did and i got a reply back tonight about the buoys okay and i've been asking for a meeting with the mayor about my shores and everything like that so the attorney from the fwc contacted me tonight at 5 30 and 5 15 whatever and said you can file for a variance but you have to be under the statute please click the link click the link it says statute not available government government and especially yes but you make some valid concerns no and and i think it's just a matter of continuing to push because i agree with you with reference to the beach in the sense of the buoys are missing and the boat's coming close twice and the mayor brings up that dep letter and i responded to everyone on that letter mr mayor last week and crickets came back they're more concerned about a mowing i call it a moan mishap that people getting skin cancer on the beach ducks being killed manatees no longer being protected in that certain area they used to always swim in may okay migrate up migrate down that's it it's just about being vocal and non-stop thank you thank you folks i want to just give you well i'll start with you in one second um if somebody says something you agree with or you don't agree with our rules call that the audience has to stay quiet so i you know i hear applause but you know we don't want to have applause like that the rule is we're supposed to just basically sit there as the audience so please let's follow that one sir okay my name is 27th flight right around oregon i just i'm out here just to support the lady that was here earlier and i'm 110 with her as far as the uh having a street light and i don't know you all by name but the gentleman over here who give us a wonderful description of what to sign on all the statistics of what the sign is about but yet you use the terminology of destruction destructive keeping it away from being disrupted many many times that only tells you that this sign will be destructive and you're basically trying to find to how to make that less destructive it's to me clear understanding that sign will be destructive for drivers so and i'm also supporting her from an environment so that's why i'm here thank you any other citizens like two of them john mancic 22nd street i have fought seriously about whether or not to come up here tonight because i didn't know if i could contain myself i'm really living with what's going on the lawsuit the sign i don't think that we've done right i'm not gonna use council members names in general or directly someone at the last council meeting or the one before because i was out of town for the special meeting in the work session but i like the wave i wanted just cost the taxpayers five thousand dollars more because that was personal it wasn't in the best interest of the city and yet two surveys were conducted 76 of the people said they didn't want to you didn't listen to we the people that's who you represent that's who you serve second item that really upset me i didn't make that last meeting because i was preparing to go on vacation i find out somebody on the council decided they wanted to look into a new city attorney or for whatever reason review the contract i don't know what was said how it was said tone or whatever i intend to listen to the voice the tape of that meeting i'm shocked i have great deal of respect for mr riley i have said so on multiple occasions he's given this council wise counsel and try to keep y'all out of trouble and now he has given his notice and yet you've been served with a federal lawsuit i don't know a lawyer who would want to touch it with a 20-foot pole in conclusion i concur with the other residents who have also said the same thing those of you named in that suit you need to step down thank you thank you mr manson i did not mention anybody by name i said thank you yeah my name is um [Music] um the sign it was a long debate about it it got passed i made comments and i was getting responses quarter one against it i agree with you i believe this residents did not want it i would like to knock on everybody's poor in this township like i did my campaign and say give me 40 bucks for the sign because that's what it would cost i don't think anyone would show well i shouldn't take it the majority of me and for clarification i was not at the last meeting there was a vote taken but i expressed wholeheartedly i could not hear very well and there was no way mr wiley that i was voting to have you replace i thought it was for other litigation that was coming forward that they were seeking to entertain i think you've done a marvelous job i got your goals right here it's the last three months there's not one blind item one here that's not reasonable and not anybody works for a living when pay all right i think mr riley does a marvelous job for us he tells me everything i don't want to hear so that's his job all right all right i mean and then you go forward and i i we got a resume letter from today a couple weeks ago i hope you do first off with regards to the sign it's it's something it's been voted on unfortunately there are some issues and there might be a possibility if there's some technical issue it might be stopped but it's [Music] [Applause] make it um that's the first thing um i was gonna wait until later on but since you brought the topic up with fred riley that was at the work session last time that's why you missed it it wasn't at the regular council meeting and it's available on tape you can hear it the person who made that was the same person who was uh after 22 years of paul moreno said we were moving too fast to put his contract out for me it had never been been once in 22 years but this had been not even 22 months and there was this great urgent need in that person's opinion to bid this contract um they were ready to authorize the city manager that night to go out to bid and i said he couldn't do that he'd bring it to this meeting mr riley listen to the tape he and i spoke afterwards after he listened to that tape they told me what was going to happen and i was just blown away i was blown away that we lost a fine attorney an excellent attorney there was a comment made last time that we'll beat it out and if fred riley is the best we can do well that will keep him he'll never do better than fred riley never this man has given this city umpteen free hours see how many attorneys give free hours see if any of the attorneys that will bid on this job if any attorneys bid on his job give you free hours he's also given expert legal advice and i know i'm an attorney i can speak from authority yes he's taught people some things they don't want to hear and then don't follow it sometimes because they know more um fred riley did an excellent job not only did he do an excellent job he did an excellent job about diffusing some very difficult situations not just here but on the outside what comes to mind was our city manager ripping out campaign signs last year and a uh citizen i believe his name is mr alfond came to our council meeting uh this man happened to be a partner in a major law firm that specialized in constitutional law and he said i'm not going to sue your city but basically i could have fred riley worked with him to defuse the situation and make sure he never got into another 1983 lawsuit you can thank fred riley for that he did that all himself and there's been other times when he's intervened and stopped really you know potentially dangerous situations legal dangerous situations from becoming dangerous situations he's a fine attorney he's an honest attorney he's a good man i'm gonna miss you it's a loss of great loss to our city a great loss and this mayor will always support you and i'll support you if i'm not the mayor and i will defend you against anybody who wants to give some revisions history i was here and i know what you said and i know what you did you're an excellent attorney in my book so i share your sentiments mr hansen mr god with respect to the sign that the council voted to acquire that was the original sign design that was brought to this council where we initially went out to look for an electronic sign and that design was unanimous unanimously considered appropriate at the time and the design that we wanted with the win at that time the council when they found out that sign was in excess of 50 000 the council said no we think we'd be better than that and we sent the contractor back to the drawing board and he came back with a sign that was twenty thousand dollars cheaper so without be laboring going through any additional cycles on this thing we voted for the original design and it must reduce cost so you know i recognize that no amount of discourse will change anyone's opinion in here but that was the silence indiana slave voted for except for the prize originally by the council i respect your first amendment rights as it does everybody on this council and thank you very much for bringing those before us thank you listen um i'm going to agree with what dave said what the mayor said i was very upset to get the resignation notice [Music] he's done a wonderful job for us been very understanding through some difficult times and i don't want him to go could you re rescind your resignation yeah i'll second them anybody else no i can count so you know out of seven i can count four and i you know i appreciate the comments everyone's made but i i don't see a compelling reason for you to do that unless you all have something else you want to tell me i i mr i think if court if the council was uh had full session here with all our members i think he would get four votes important i think he would get four votes if rob and i was well i i'm going to be conti continue to be hopefully a consummate professional um i came into this job it has been very difficult because the as i've said before the council has very different uh viewpoints and there's been conflict during the time that i've been here and i've done my very best to bridge the conflict the um the way i took the vote that you had at a meeting where i wasn't in attendance was basically a vote showing of no confidence and that's fine you can have a vote of no confidence that if that's what i'm faced with i can count and i really don't have any grand desire to go through the procedure of going through an rfp for a position that i currently have i would hope that each one of the seven of you would recognize that i have done a good job under difficult circumstances but having said all that if you all decide it's time to make a change that's fine there's not going to be hard feelings from me i am a professional i've been a lawyer for almost 35 years and this isn't the first time that i and a client saw things differently and we parted ways and as a professional i will part ways and i will uh wish you the best and i hope you'll do the same for me so that's a roundabout answer to your question um but it is you know it has been the thing that deters me from reconsidering anything is the level of conflict on the council and i don't know that i can fix that i can't i haven't been able to fix it in two years so i if you all decided it was time to make a change i respect your decision and i will graciously step aside mr riley i have a proposal for you it's always nice making a proposal in front of 50 people item eight on the agenda tonight is to afford the council to authorize the city manager to bid for services for an attorney now if your resignation stays we have no choice but to approve that even i would have to vote for that one because our city must have a city attorney however we're going to open that up for discussion and i just heard leslie and tara say something and leslie was one of the people that supported bringing this up to originally uh bring this to this uh discussion but now it seems like there's been a change of opinion um i can count too and what i'm cleaning is lester the tarots on our side here we have leslie we have made i think frank bancard and we have i know robinaki when she gets back because she voted against joey along with me so you may have your four votes and i don't want this to be something i'm never going to hold you to something that you don't want to do our city right now needs a competent excellent attorney more than ever we need someone and you can see what's going on accounts i can't help you i'll do my best to try and help you make the council work together it's going to be a little bit of an effort i think given the situation but we'll try i'll commit to you that i'll do my best for what that's worth it'll take six other people to do that but i'm gonna ask you to reconsider you don't have to make a decision right this moment but item date is coming up and at that point i'm going to ask you to you know what you might want to do i can call a special counsel meeting and we wouldn't lose any ground again i can't let the city have no attorney so you might have to vote for that but i'll be voting because you're not in the position because i want you out of the position that's a big difference and i think les results of the other attorney up here we have two real attorneys on this council and um she recognizes the unfortunate thing that you this board and every other board in florida has is you can't discuss things unless you're in a public meeting to discuss them so i fully understand why that makes things complex i fully understand you know that there may be a difference of opinion and that's that's fine again stress i respect the fact that there are differences of opinion um and i will ponder it until i remain comes up so i guess it's my answer for now mr rob the baby's crying maybe once a year too anyone else on counseling we have mr hands actually here do i have any time left i got one more comment you sure do i think you do okay first off all right mr gunn thank you for your comment i appreciate that about my first amendment rights i take it seriously and um i guess in conjunction with what just transpired here i followed the strategic plan being built and everything and how that was supposed to be the cornerstone your roadmap if you will counsel on how to conduct business for the city if i may because i've seen it different times in the course of time where personal opinion gets in a way of city business and it clouds judgment that's not what you're up there for i have been in elected office not public office but i've been in elected office and one of the things that i was always told don't think about what's good for the short term what's good for the organization what's best for the organization in this case the organization is the city of bel air beach it's citizens that's where you all serve listen to the citizens weigh their input and again seventy percent of the people i understand signs that issue but it's like thumbs your nose as what's in the best interest of the city going forward that's all i ask as a taxpayer and a citizen and i'm sure these folks out here that's all they ask put the partisanship aside it's we the people thank you thank you mr hansen any other citizens like to address the council yesterday my name is barry gray let me question one question answers to first who's going to be the arbiter of the truth that's going to go on the sign and number two do you have a public information i'm sorry i i can barely hear your comments mr gray you gotta talk right into that mike we spent thousands of dollars i'm sorry who is going to be the arbiter of the truth that's going to go in the sun who's going to decide what your message is and do you have a public information officer there is no public information officer and the sign is controlled by our city manager many other citizens like to address council seeing other hands on close citizen comments and move to the presentation by the pinellas county sheriff's park sheriff's see two sheriff's officers will one of you be making a presentation today good evening council in regards to any new items to discuss regarding crime in the city there's nothing new or anything to pass on everything is a beautiful city to live in from a crime perspective good clarification any questions concerns sheriff i love it when you bring me a bunch of zeros um you know zero crime zero nothing i mean we had nothing again this is i think two months in a row uh kudos to the men and women of the department excellent job as always excellent job to our citizens who are out there paying attention to what's going on in their neighborhoods because they don't do it alone they have some good help but um it doesn't get any better than this so all i could say is thank you and please keep up the wonderful work thank you very much anybody else [Applause] thank you all right we have uh 9 4's presidential presentation of florida city's certificate of completion for the leadership academy one to the vice mayor dave gaddis fourth in a

[Applause] congratulations okay next four four items are consent agenda i'm gonna read all four of them i'll ask for a motion and we will approve them there's no discussion on a consent agenda item book so we're just going to pass this fairly quickly consent agenda item number five approval of july 12 2021 city council meeting minutes item six approval of july 19 2021 budget workshop minutes item seven approval of july 17 special city council meeting minutes and eighth request well no no no idma is in consent agenda request authorization for city manager to advertise for legal services i do believe we're going to have some discussion maybe on that and we've already passed the agenda can i move at this point to remove item eight from the consent agenda i'm gonna have to defer to that city attorneys i thought that we had with an energy um can we move this at this point i thought once an agenda is approved you can't i mean we're not deleting it we're just moving it off the consent agenda to to thoroughly discuss any item i i don't see why you couldn't do that we're not removing it we're just moving it into the regular business okay i have an emotion by leslie detero to move by [Music] we've discussed it i think we need to have some discussion that's why i want to move it off the consent and put it on the right i think we need a discussion um whether it passes or doesn't pass i think we need to discuss this in fairness to mr riley and to the citizens of this city mr banker anyone else comments i'll move to the city uh residence and comments back to council leslie and the last word okay so the what we're voting on now is a simple movement not passing anything we're taking item eight off the consent agenda we're gonna move it actually it's gonna be the next item so it's gonna go right to the regular agenda right before item nine so but yes vote moves that um let's do this patty i'm gonna do this i want this done by uh my voice not my voice okay council member banker yes councilmember gun name council member no tarot yes council member slope may vice mayor gaddis name we're deadlocked at three threes of motion fads so i'll call this consent agenda with item eight in it um request authorization for the city manager to advertise for legal services and this would um allow him to uh the explanation is considered consensus at a budget workshop to advertise a request for proposals just know that consensus was five to two and one persons who voted five was didn't hear what he was voting on so it was really four to three probably okay um motion to approve the consent agenda in his totality i'll again ask that this be done in a voice vote so what we're doing i'll call this question properly i'll reread it i'm five six seven eight approval five approval of the july 12 2021 city council meeting meeting minutes uh item six approved july 19 2021 budget workshop minutes item seven approval of july 19th 2021 special city council meeting minutes and item a request authorization for the city manager to advertise for legal services by the city of attorney yes vote passes all of them no vote kills him adam kirk councilmember banker no councilmember aye councilmember otero no councilmember slope i vice mayor davis all right man absolutely now so it's three to three and guess what consent agenda is not approved we will not have any further discussion because that will come up at a special meeting we're without a city attorney folks in two weeks so two weeks mr riley two weeks right we have left 19th 19th we're without a city attorney regular agenda park uh item nine regular agenda park and recreation board event approval this is for council approval of the events that have been proposed by the board funding is in the approved budget i thought i saw the parks board chairperson here is she still here yes would you like to speak with us before we do this no i mean if you have any questions i think we will you know i know i will um so why don't you come up first let me get a motion so this second second second ring is slow dave uh no let's hear it okay mr just give us your information for the record and then whatever you wish just tell us regarding the proposal and then we'll go with council questions then citizen questions okay i'm not sure if you want me to read this or i mean i everyone okay so everyone's received a copy of it hopefully they reviewed it if you want to just hit us with the highlights and any information that you couldn't put on there that maybe you want to extrapolate on or you know anything that you think we need to know before everybody has beef it may not be any questions but i might have a few so yeah yeah okay no problem um so we have three events that we're looking at towards the end of the year that we're asking you to vote on one is jazz in the park which is set uh saturday september 25th from five to eight so we're just trying to keep them i just from bringing this up over the last couple of months and just try to cover everybody's points like um we wanted to make sure it was a bella beach private party residence only we wanted to keep it simple it's just low-key not a lot no vendors just relax and listen to some music sit outside enjoy the weather and maybe get to know some of our neighbors that we don't know so we try to keep it simple with the budget and if you have any questions about anything on there you guys have questions about parking and we provided the schematics on like where things would be but because there's so little you know there was just maybe two or three things on each map um the second event would be basically like a pet and house halloween costume parade for the kids and i know there's a lot of dogs in this community so it's just a morning event a simple parade and then a contest and we had some nice prizes for first second and third place because i know i've seen these um before and people went to a lot of trouble and they spent a lot of money for some of these costumes so we wanted to make sure that they were you know if they really won first place that they you know was appreciative of their price and then the third one is just a super simple holiday social tree lighting on monday december 6th from five to six before council meeting so we figured people would be here and just a little holiday cheer i put out a bid for some christmas carolers and just we would have some you know whatever cookies and hot chocolate depending on the weather so i mean i'd be happy to answer any questions that you have pretty much have all the information in the packet that was provided i don't really have any questions but i did want to thank you for this report that's what i've been asking for for a very long time it was very detailed very organized and i really appreciate it so thank you very much no problem chairperson live i had some questions for you and um i was at the last event i participated in it as did most of the people [Music] first i wasn't at it so i'm not familiar with anything i was so that's wrong okay first of all there was no problem with outsiders attending this we had a handful of people that attended um i believe um one or two people actually commented from indian rocks the wonderful time they had in our city they got to see it a chance that they didn't really normally get there was no overflow streets were not crowded with people in fact the only people that parked on the streets were the vendors it was far from there was no street that was full of people in fact the uh city-wise garage sale causes one hell of a mess on our streets this caused no mess on the street so i don't know that we have to be exclusionary and i say that for a reason okay um let me finish then you're having a chance to speak okay um because i have to vote on this right now and it's not safe well with me and i'll tell you why it's not safe but with me we fight with other cities that are exclusionary that tell us we can't go on their white sand and we can't put our our chair wherever they don't want it to be and here we are saying you can't come to our park on a sunday or saturday listen to some jazz music i mean this isn't the clearwater jazz festival this is a small local thing which i hope that will get nice attendance with our citizens but it doesn't bother me if someone from other shore organic rocks or clearwater comes to this entire city and i'll tell you why i visit their cities i go to largo for the treat for their tree lighting um i went to uh to indian shores for their memorial day picnic i was invited by their mayor but it was a beautiful event it was open to everybody you had to pay if you were an outsider but you're able to go and all the other city spokes to us they don't say go home and i have a real problem putting my name to some people we're gonna tell people to go home and that's my first question is how are you gonna police this that's my first you can answer them all at once i'm just to give it to you then turn the floor back to you so first is how we're going to police this when you're really going to send somebody home if they're you know from indian rocks i don't like that that's the first thing um no let me finish and then you can you'll [Music] of the council as we set aside budget for it but the budget was to be used in the event that the sponsorship and the sales and other things that we did didn't cover the amount of the festival well not only did that parks board cover it they made seventeen hundred dollars worth of profit which they turned over to the city manager and then they did other events like the halloween parade and stuff in charge for that so when i look at this i mean the only thing i see that there's a vendor there's an italian ice vendor we're not even getting revenue from that so the question would be is sponsorship opportunities and or vendor opportunities to try and make this thing this is two thousand two hundred and seventy five dollars for this festival and there's really no offset to it so it's really just the city dipping into its pocket to do it and again i don't have a problem if you tried and said well we only got a thousand dollars of vendors or a sponsorship people sponsored last time they just outright gave us contributions um and i don't see that in here so that was my second question and um it's not self-funding yeah that was it that was everything so basically that's not self-funding [Music] um if you could convince me that you know it's not going to be a scene because the last thing i need is some nice family coming over the bridge saying oh wow there's some music in the park we want to go and listen and then we have a big to-do and the sheriff's telling to go home and putting the sheriff in a bad place i don't like that so i'll turn it back over to you and i'm coming back to council then okay um okay so for the first being exclusionary i was only listening to the comments that were made earlier in the year and i believe that you yourself like mentioned id people which we would never do i'm more than happy to have people from anywhere that walk over the bridge we would never exclude anybody but it seemed to be such a concern of people that were coming to me saying we're concerned about parking we're concerned about you know um just they're being crowding about like blocking like the entry way and so parking schematic so i was only answering what was requested of us we would never turn anybody away and then as far as the fundraising we voted because you mentioned that a couple of months ago we voted as a board there are basically four of us and just pulling what's on this paper off is gonna be a challenge but we can do it but as far as like fundraising and like getting lots of vendors out here it just wasn't it just wasn't possible so if we were going to do a fundraising event because we've already been approved this budget we would do it for a charity or we would try to raise money for something for a cause we wouldn't try to raise money to offset this so if you if you don't want to have these we're not married to them we don't i mean i won't lose one minute of sleep if these things don't happen it's not to like prove a point i wasn't at any of the past events i didn't really even know what i walked into i was just trying to do something good and fun and like that we could enjoy like i don't i don't i've maybe met four people that are sitting here so if you really don't want to have these events i don't mind like but we're willing to do the work and we're willing to like do this and these are so small and we said because we're new and we've never done anything like this before we wanted to start small so we would be successful if if we like get out over our skis and have all these offenders and all these people like we just couldn't do it so we voted as a board and this was what we came up with if you don't want to do it we're fine with it like we're we're happy with what we're doing we feel like we're bringing good things like as far as like you know different activities people can um attend and different things that they can buy like bella beach t-shirts and you know beach towels and stuff like that so it's up to you you guys can vote i'm not going to fight about it it's completely up to you so hopefully that answers your personal it does um and no one's trying to tell you can't do it i'm just my job is you know i heard a lot last time i heard about it had to be self-funded it had to be the greatest event since woodstock i just saw that so you know i'm afraid what the opportunities were for funding and you answered the question i have one other suggestion to you um this is something probably nobody ever thought about but i did uh it's september 25th sun sets at 7 21 and you have this going to 8 o'clock so i don't believe you have lighting back there you might want to start this one hour early from 4 to 7 and this way you'll have everybody leaving in the light i think you're doing a great job and it's going to be hard to live up to the expectations that were set by the last event however as far as the the problem with people coming in from the outside i would never expect anyone to turn someone away coming over that bridge or walking off the beach and enjoying our event i think what they were trying to say is don't advertise don't call people from neighboring cities and and turn it into a giant festival basically festivals like that of that proportion are designed to draw e-commerce or non-e-commerce but commerce into a community that actually has businesses they have they want people to come for that reason we don't have that right therefore i don't mind it being small i think it's a great thing i prefer the intimate beller beach setting where we get to know people whenever the crowds are large you just can't do that so i think you're right on track yeah it's going to cost a little bit of money it's not a whole lot and i'm sure that uh now that the word is out there probably will be some donations coming in that may help offset that cost so a great job and a very very organized i love the report i love the map i can tell a lot of work went into this i also listened to about half of the meeting recording and i was very impressed with the entire team oh thank you thank you very much i think you're spot on i think the original tank was start small baby steps and build on that you were given a budget you're working within the budget and there was never any discussion about exclusionary thing we thought that in order to keep it small we just managed that through marketing and putting down plans and stuff like that i think the spot on my vote is to move forward and go forward i think you've done an excellent job right you got to get that mic real close to you i think you've done an excellent job drives and everything i guess i'm just an old stickler and you might i don't believe government should be dabbling into entertaining people at taxpayers expense because not all taxpayers will be entertained we're involved in this uh as mr gaddis says you know you see the big signs like indian rocks beach or beachfest that is because they have businesses okay and those businesses are putting up the funds and everything like that i think government should stay out and entertain people no no disrespect no but like i said we're not married to these events if you guys don't want them it's just less work work for us like we're fine with it but we're more than happy to do it if you guys would like us to do it i mean it's just um it's totally fine plus didn't give any first comments and glenn's coming back for a second all right well i was just going to say that you know the third priority of the strategic plan is community and this this festival is basically an opportunity to bring residents of delaware beach together meet your neighbors and uh build a literal camaraderie and community cohesion so yeah the entertainment part is going to be the vehicle with the real priority and purpose back to council [Music] so what i'm going to do is i'm going to call it one at a time it's not going to be three or zero so it's going to go one time little voice vote on each of these um first is to approve the september 245th 2021 jazz in the park festival all in favor all right opposed no so we have four to two opposed our vanguard and banza october 30th 2021 pets and pal's halloween costume and parade custom parade and contest 10 a.m to 12 p.m all in favor aye aye opposed is five to one bangkok opposed december 6 2021 holiday social and tree lighting from 5 to 6 p.m all in favor opposed no six to one banker opposed i'm sorry five to one okay so all three events are author us and please give consideration in changing that time about one era make for a lot safer thank you and thank you to the committee for the hard work before we get into the next discussion at 7-12 you're going for an hour almost 15 does anyone need a break no one needs a break we'll move on item 10 authorize the city manager proceed with providing code enforcement services internally the description is to provide in-house code enforcement for cost savings with more code enforcement hours motion was made by the city manager the first [Music] um i think this makes perfect sense for years we had our own enforcement officer rather than paying the sheriffs to do it and i think it makes sense to do it this way financially and logistically [Music] this be the removal of the deputy all together or are we still going to use the deputy part time no the the deputy wouldn't be used at all it's it's uh how code of course was sent by the sheriff uh it's how many other hours do we want to assign to them so so we would take the sheriff completely out of the equation right if the problem i have with that is when you have an active sheriff deputy on the street and you have a public public employee doing code enforcement active deputies knocks on the door i'm just going to use like short-term rounds that's when the door starts asking questions okay probably going to get a lot of lies all right imagine we say this is an official investigation if you lie to me it's now become a felony our code enforcement officer doesn't have that authority i would think that we should keep the deputy on some type of a retainer to do certain things like that um our code enforcement person can always you know grasp cuttings and other things and contractors not providing by the law or whatever like that use our in-house people on that but to take away that official capacity of an officer of the law i think we just put ourselves into a bad situation um i'd like to ask a question go ahead and then i got sort of glenn's answers ahead lynn do you know if uh if the deputy actually went through and memorized our our code no he did not we that's part of my concern that we have this partial issue with not knowing all the codes he's a deputy sheriff that's what he is he's not he's not a trained code enforcement officer he was a retired deputy and i don't have anything against danny uh who was our current deputy the fact of the matter is i'm looking at it from the bigger picture if you want to keep the sheriff that's fine with me but what i want to constantly do is realize it's going to probably cost you another 15 or 20 thousand dollars in code enforcement because we need if we're gonna use the sheriff's code enforcement we need to use it more hours okay right now he gets twelve eight you know depending on what we need them for but a lot of things get missed i'm going to give you an example of something that happened today last week he sent an email in to to have grass notice sent out okay because it was too high today he sends an email and says well we need to do a notice of abatement because it's 36 inches high this is what the email says to me i'm sitting here saying wait a minute how did the grass grow from seven inches to 36 inches in a week well that tells me that we didn't pay attention to it and i went and looked at the lot and it's probably more like 18 or 20 but as far as short-term rentals that's an iffy subject i mean we've had complaints from the property owners that the sheriff is harassing them so they're kind of up in the air about the short term i will tell you that uh and we have caught up the example on 8th street there's two of them uh we've had two hearings for that house and we're investigating possibly a third one so but you know so to me at this point if you want to leave the sheriff then what i'm going to ask you to do in the budget is increase the budget to a half-time person which will cost us about 53 000 annually why couldn't we use both i think it conflicts it because it creates a conflict between who's doing what we're still doing all the administration anyway so the sheriff isn't doing the administration does mr passion say you know did he read the whole code no you said no so you say dan okay this is what you're going to do dan these are the codes we want you to enforce the ones that we believe that we're going to get snuggered all right and we give our in-house person the easy ones the grass or whatever but uh the ones that we need an officer of the wall we should have that ability and as i heard other people in council say when it comes to spending money we got the money and i don't want to spend any money okay but i think this is money well spent but i don't think splitting it up is a good idea i i really don't i think you either have to do it this way or this way and i don't have a problem either way you know i've actually discussed it with danny i've discussed it with the sheriff's office and and they will say that they need more hours so if that's what the consul chooses to do if we do 20 hours a week it will cost us about fifty three thousand dollars a year per total plus we're still spending money because the administrative person who is laura still has to do all the letters the sheriff doesn't do anything with that they don't they don't touch any of the administrative function of the process so she's going to be taxed with more work she's doing that now you know give us now should be doing field work well that's why i asked for a part-time person in the office that's that's what's exactly causes it's a wash with the current situation so if it's a wash then why would you want to get rid of the sheriff it's a it's a worship you don't have the sheriff's department is what i'm telling you it's a war in cost wise i'm just saying you're going to be bringing on somebody for our time correct and that's right that'll be it'll it'll be a wash because we're going to use that part-time person to fill in for laura internally okay and then laura will go out in the field so the the cost difference in code enforcement is a is a war currently now if you want to leave the sheriff then we just need to increase what i'm saying is we're going to use two civilians when we're giving up a deputy or an officer it just doesn't make any sense liam are you ready to tell us hang [Music] a little corporate history on this thing several councils back we moved to go to a sheriff's office because we felt we needed some authority and the guy that they do reluctantly it was undertaken because there were some current concerns about training and that sort of thing the city manager has been moderating the situation and you know training was a consideration for this thing and the results just didn't come around the guy who manages this thing tactically is a city manager he's saying he can do a more effective job more efficiently cost neutral if we go with his proposal we always have a sheriff's deputy on call within elder impeach and he can be tasked with code enforcement is that my understanding well he could be you know if we have an issue that we need the code enforcement to deal with it yes he can be passed so so i guess my point is we're covered with the sheriff's office so we're going to call the sheriff mr ghana if we have a no no not to go check the grass and police the tactical supervisor's job i'm not going to micromanage this guy if he says he can do it more effectively more efficiently he can't do it more efficiently and lastly the thing is is with the change in the florida statutes where you cannot call in uh anonymously it's going to put more strain on the code important system so you need to have somebody out there who is well versed well trained and it's going to take one of our people to do that who knows the code right now that's that's laura so you you make a good point if you're done i don't want to interrupt you but uh with this new law and i advise all you people out there to tell your friends and neighbors call your counsel person when you have a complaint and make them belly up to the bar and file the complaint with the city so you can stay anonymous just a real quick question uh city major reese how many times has this year knocked on a rental property and nobody's answered because the man is standing there in the uniform with the sheriff's vehicle oh that that happens regularly and we do get a lot of complaints about that that uh they're sending a sheriff's deputy and uh they can you know we just had one recently that complained that uh he didn't want the sheriff stepping on his property you know that house actually and and i think you may get a little more information from the sheriff's deputy maybe sometimes but you know i've dealt with the uh short-term runs myself on various occasions and i got i've gotten more information out of the people that are there than the sheriff's deputy has in the past and i i think it's just the individual sometimes how do you handle it that's really what i think it is but like i said all i'm asking is if if you want to leave it as it is all i'm asking you to do is increase the budget so i can say to the sheriff you've got 20 hours a week i'd like to say a few words so i've been watching this for the last two years and i've been told that i can't talk about it i was told that by danny doherty who's been telling me what's been going on and you all aren't going to like some of the stuff i have to say don't bother okay let's talk about deputy dougherty number one he was invited personally by me tonight i don't see him here sheriff you hear me please tell sheriff culpery how disappointed i am not for the control that you did here that was perfect your superiors would not let deputy doherty come here tonight and speak for himself they told him he could not come to this meeting not in uniform not as a civilian 1983 mean anything to the sheriff it should you just deprived that man of his opportunity to speak to this council deputy dougherty offered to do ride alongs with every one of us so that we could see what he goes through and i don't place blind allegiance into mr reeves or anyone else as ronald reagan said trust but verify i'll trust but i'll verify what you tell me let's verify some of that stuff you get you just told people here you don't get information from the sheriff's office well this is something that's near and dear to my heart because i serve on the emergency board of all pinellas county and i'm in the process of trying to get us a new cadet system that's computer assisted dispatch that puts all the information about a call at not only the sheriff's disposal but in the future we hope that it'll put it at fire and ambulance that's what we're trying to do what i'm holding here are cad reports laura mataloni could never do this this is in the sheriff's system okay every time danny doherty hits a building or or a house in this town there's a record of it i'll give you one example i'm not going to say the place trash in roadway remove traction northbound needs a billboard placed it in the dumpster and city hall gulf boulevard 20th every time he goes someplace this is in the cad system why is that important you can search upon it if there's any criminal activity or if there's a pattern of any problems in that house the sheriff can use it for law enforcement that's a benefit that the sheriff gives us that they'll never get going inside that's number one frank banker's talking about having a uniformed officer one of the reasons that we did this was that we would have we only have one person at any given moment in battle beach and that's all we need small city and it's working great so far this gives us a second person there have been multiple opportunities where danny doherty answered a call while he was doing code he was the responding officer and lynn reeves yelled at him he saved the person it was a hot call it was an assault and he was the first responder he was only a block or two away he heard it he responded he also hit the pause button on his timer of the time that he gives us another beach he finished the hot call put himself at risk because he's a darn good officer and he answered that call and then he came back and he gave us more time than his shift his shift has been progressively cut down over time one of the reasons why we went to an outside code enforcement officer is that our internal code enforcement officer does it work weekends well guess what bad people bad bad boys and girls when are you going to put that new roof on or put that new door in that you don't want code to see let me give you an opportunity saturday and sunday yeah that would be the right answer and that's exactly what they did as for having the uh what we're saying that he doesn't know the code memorized i challenge anybody to memorize our code you know it's illegal to have a lawn chair in your front yard for more than 24 hours don't see any cities that have that one okay yeah maybe even knows that's wrong okay nobody knows that and nobody's going to be enforcing that we have some laws that i just shake my head out and go why did we put this here okay it's a beach community it's not a condo association so maybe he doesn't know everyone but he knows the main ones when he first came on i met him and i said danny i had a lot of complaints about the past it was when i went around door-to-door i was like frank banker i went door-to-door that was my number one complaint uneven code enforcement lack of code enforcement retaliatory code enforcement city manager will pull my campaign sign like he did he leaves other people's in interest he wasn't a big supporter of me that was all over the city but stuff like that people were driven out of this city before they ever completed their house that's verified the person with that harder drive they got soaked up bella beach they're like we don't want to live here i haven't had a complaint yet about dandy darby not a complaint yet and i've told this story many times before there was a house on the corner by me it was tremendously overgrown for years years so you'll wonder just what our code people were doing all of them okay and i watched danny i didn't hear him but i watched him from my window dealing with a fairly difficult owner and that house if you go there today looks beautiful it's not going to be on the cover of better homes and gardens or anything it is a nice looking house it fits in well danny did it without threats without summonses without hauling people into court danny dougherty also folks he told me this story again he told me not to tell this stuff so i had to sit by when he first came here somebody had pilot debris he was catching all kinds of flak from city hall here danny and his daughter on their own time when picked up this elderly person's debris and took it to the dump and no good deed ever goes unpunished he got to the bridge out of the back of his truck and he had to pick it all up off the road okay that's danny doherty folks let me tell you something else danny dardy just did i'm not gonna mention the ladies name although i know it and i think it's a public record at this point you know you've all seen that that uh commercial help i've fallen and i can't get up right well that happened in bellar beach woman's family called no one's seen her for four days relatives didn't know where she was danny been on patrol the house didn't look right to him he is paying attention maybe he doesn't know every species of weed but he knew something was wrong with that house the other officer said that we can't go in there he's like this is circumstances were going in finally they tried to handle on the door they opened up the door because it was wide open and there was the lady having fallen couldn't get up for almost four days she was near death danny doherty deserves our highest award folks we lose our city attorney in one night now we're going to lose our law enforcement code officer rob and that's not all mr reeves i've heard about the treatment he's received in city hall from you and laura and it's disgusting you complained that i created a hospital work environment with you he described your environment as toxic you don't even other than patty gentry they don't even say good morning to this man they got the nerve to go and take pictures with the police and say we support blue well that's how they treat it when they're not on camera folks his time has been progressively cut from 14 hours to eight hours he doesn't work weekends anymore in fact he was told never to work without windrix being president why does he not know what he's doing why don't you go pick up the telephone and call one of my counterparts mayor mary beth henderson of reddington they used danny garden they're happier than a clan with him he seems to know their code now for all people who are analytical and numbers people i'd like to see a comparison of how many things that danny has found in this city and and hits which is this first of all i don't see much of a difference the code reports look the same to me i drive around the city it looks very nice yes we occasionally get an individual that creates a problem that is taken care of it is done without problems it's done without threats of law enforcement that without being heavy-handed i had to laugh when mr reeves said that danny was complaining about a short-term rental i got one of those telephone calls and guess what i got a complaint about mr reeves one time on a short-term rental he was here on a sunday and my doorbell's gone you know what i said man you can't have a short-term rental i support the city manager on that instead of faulting danny doherty without even knowing what he did how about supporting blue that's what we're supposed to stand for right in terms of the money well if we can spend five thousand dollars for a wave sign don't tell me about the money um we've used money here for what we want to use money we just spent four thousand three four thousand dollars for public relations events how about safety and security it's supposed to be our number one thing in our strategic plan danny doherty is getting another bad deal from this city and i don't like it i don't like the way he's been treated right here i don't like the way this is being supervised i don't like anything about this he's an excellent sheriff he's a highly skilled sheriff this guy was an instructor for the swat team he's no lightning he's smart and he has the right temperament he's an excellent sheriff he's an excellent code officer there is an option to do both other cities do it i'm friends with a code officer in a big city and i'm not going to say what city that is because i don't want that person to be harassed but you can't split it and there's also another opportunity the county offers code services so we don't have to use more of inside but if we are going to do laura inside the code i mean everybody forgot this little tidbit but i didn't forget it when we gave laura the inside job i'm sorry when she came inside because she used to be a full-time coach when she came inside mr reeves gave her a 6 000 raise well if she's going to go outside forty percent my accounting in me tells me we get twenty four hundred back you don't get a six thousand dollar raising you'll bet to do your own your old job i don't support this at all and if we are going to support it then let's get the money back when we need to claw it back because she's not doing the job that we gave her two years ago she's doing a different job right now i have nothing but complaints about laura nothing and i've heard her personality the other day i heard a telephone call june called headquarters sounded like there was a funeral going on here the way that phone was answered it was embarrassing so quite frankly i don't support this and and if we get all kinds of complaints it's coming back to this council somebody said but stops with me that same person told me i don't manage the city manager you can't have it both ways you vote for this you own your vote i get code complaints we'll come back here and we'll deal with them as a council i'm disgusted and embarrassed and sheriff when you tell sheriff deary that i was upset that danny wasn't allowed to be here also tell him that the mayor apologizes for the treatment that deputy dougherty got in bel air beach wake up i would just like to qualify mr banker's statement about anonymous calls call your council member from past experiences on the council that's not necessarily true delaying the sunshine and public records songs i have seen people come back and do a public records request asking for specific names so i guess what i'm saying is there is no culling of silence that comes down gives you 100 anonymous details that you're always subject and the council members are subject to public record requests well mr john as long as there's a record you're right right [Music] you're right i'm on 6th street beach it's about every day monday through friday come see me there's no record sir please talk right into that microphone okay i i do have the experience now so perfect we're still learning here okay so again my name is foam i'm a little right off of bayshore um so i actually had a experience with uh the court enforcer um danny's his name not myself but heard it through the neighbor next door um the experience that we that my neighbor had which was passed on to me um it was much more human much more friendly dealing with the officer that's the the lady that who does the uh so i'm just out here to tell the council the members that we're here to support our existing code enforcement okay thank you mr hanson 22nd street for what it's worth i concur with the previous speaker keep the deputy we spend money in different places for different things we can afford the extra money i believe to keep [Music] deputy doherty on staff as he was originally supposed to be not as it's been modified i like the idea of having him on staff as an extra law enforcement based on what you've described so i encourage council to keep him as code enforcement thank you thank you mr hansig yes ma'am hi my name is laurie i live on bayshore next to my husband i had a good experiences with officer dougherty i find them to be professional i had i find to be very good in neutralizing situations we have had issues with neighbors fences things like that i think he has a lot of good qualities in our community that benefit our community with his approach to how he handles things i have called um over here a couple different times and dealt with different people who answered the phone and i have to concur that the demeanor and the lack of information is noticeable we live here now full time since 2014 we bought our house in 0-6 we were visiting [Music] um so anyways you'll see us at more meetings and um i vote for keeping him on and [Music] if thank you thank you yes june vancouy 7th street builder beach um i've had a couple opportunities to speak to the deputy doherty and and then speaking down i i've heard million times he's told me that he's backed up other deputies while he was on duty no let's think about this he cuts off the time clock for bella beach to make that happen he goes on the sheriff's time clock with no added expense to this city so we have a back and and with the uh i spoke to him also about the lady that had fallen and it was very disheartening to find out that this city the neighbors didn't even know that this lady had health issues and or took the time but we had an officer who paid attention paid attention in our community to know once there's an issue okay he cared and it's about about him picking up that that was not only deputy dougherty but i want you to know that his daughter that helped him is also a sheriff deputy so they both did that off the clock out of the goodness of their heart and that's what the sheriff is all about and work with people that's what we're supposed to be about helping each other being a community and i don't see that happening with laura when we went around campaigning for the mayor we heard nothing but complaint after complaint after complaint some people were even given enough time to respond to the notice that they were given to comply because they just moved in they had no idea that these these things had existed so so i say we we need to keep this deputy not only that he has said time and time again that he is willing to work nights and weekends when do we have a lot more problems nights weekends so why would we not do that especially since our current code officer does not want to do that coupled with the fact again she was given six thousand dollars more to go into the office that was the deal so if she's coming back to street we should get that money back thank you thank you any other citizen comments there being none coming back to council council leslie terry last word before we call the question just you want to look back frank and then let's do one last workout well i go ahead and know three items from parks a couple colleagues said you know this is a great way to get involved with your community i haven't heard one person out there saying you get rid of them so we'll see how this vote goes we listen to your name and i'm just going to say i had to endure 115 days of horns beeping outside my window because people supposedly support blue some people who write on this council who supported blue they supported with financial contributions and they held science i'm here by watching that vote too and so is that young lady with the camera go ahead that's the other last word i think it makes sense like i said financially logistically to bring it back in-house all right so i'm calling the question at this point item 10 to authorize the city manager to proceed with providing code enforcement services internally madam clerk i'm going to ask that this role be called council members council member banker no councilmember gunn yes council member ontario yes councilmember sloan yes vicente no very handsome no so motion fails i'd like to ask one question sure as i told you earlier it doesn't matter to me either way but i think we need to increase the budget for 20 hours we have a budget session coming up make your proposal i want to talk with you about um better utilizing the sheriff's time because we have the sheriff directing traffic and that's not what i had in mind so let's talk about cost savings areas and what we can do that's a budget session but i don't see why a few thousand if that's our priority should be a problem here okay so i'll i'll make the adjustment and bring it to you guys please and mr reeves mr dardy and i are friends so i'm just going to leave it at that okay he'll tell me what's happening well it's a mission mayor okay i don't appreciate your [Music] no i [Music] we support blue in my house we're done with this discussion item 11. ordinance 21 dad showed five an ordinance of the city council of the city of bel air beach florida providing for an

have a motion so then peter makes the motion sure second is frank van gaardran's quote city manager this uh ordinance change was uh recommended by the planning board when they did the code reviews so this is a process we've been doing bringing forward a couple each month to move those recommendations for and note that there's the curve inserts there's i think that's what we're talking about with the blocking of the curves and valley curves um and i think there's an uh and i'm going to just check with these i know there's a provision for ada accessibility that was our biggest concern about that we don't obviously want curbs blocked because it restricts water is that are you happy with that for ada purposes that's sufficient uh i'm the author of that language and you're having exceptions okay and i in writing looked at a number of um resources related to the ada and that that is the specific language that's used so it's consistent with the ada uh guidelines that i reviewed thank you

end-to-end 10-77-7 of the city code of ordnance is providing for incorporation and recitals providing for approval of amendments in section 10-2 10-32 b-1 10-32 b-4 10-35 10-37 10-38-82 10-74-14 and 10-77-7 of the city code ordinances providing for a copy to be kept on file providing for several ability providing for the repeal of all organization conflict herewith and providing for an effective date the descriptions to modify the legal standards relating to building related to buildings and building regulation first in motion second sorry seven day gas great assault i'll go ahead and defer to the city manager the reeves aaron console this is just uh another changes that the planning board did recommended and we reviewed those uh four months ago roughly and we're just bringing the updated ordinances to you a couple of times i have a question for you mr city manager at first i thought we changed this because i had a question when we had a new work session but then i went back and looked at the uh code and it actually says this so i'm going to read it call in one sentence pause two sentences we put it in context and then you can tell me what's meant by it because i this is existing now and then the new one will incorporate that so 10-35 sanitary facilities yes it's clamors being the mayor of better beach we're talking about sanitary facilities a portable sanitary facility shall be supplied to a new construction site within the city after the initial grading has been completed and before the foundation work has begun we're cool such portable sanitary facilities shall be maintained at the site in an inconspicuous location to be specified in the site plan until after the hookup of interior sanitary facilities so my question is since i've built my own house and seen plenty of others being built typically they are not able to place them any further than curbside so what exactly is an inconspicuous location and is every house that has ever been built here in violation of this ordinance i really don't want to revise it and still have it vague well what was brought up about this by the code review board was the fact that porta potties are sometimes aren't set back in the lot a little bit uh they're end up in the curve they end up in the roadways so that's what the code or the code review committee was trying to change a little bit to try to get the contractors to maybe put some shielding in front of them uh or you know as an example uh i'll use a house that's being built on belt boulevard they have a fence around it so their porta potties is probably inside but that that's what the concept was that's what i thought and then we run into problems with having fencing in your front door which is also illegal um and i mean not during construction you you can have a fence you can have a fence it's just like a buildable bird [Music] i don't care my house is built it really doesn't matter to me i think it's ridiculous because quite frankly it's hard enough for them to pump the darn stuff out of this without having more hazards to go around but if it's so important that we have a fence around it and make the person no defense it's a small expense to pay when you're building a house with that said i i have no idea what inconspicuous meant i think if i pulled 10 people we get 10 different things it's really hard when you clear cut a lot to have anything inconspicuous it's a flat lot of sand and they can't really put it in the back because they won't go off-road with their heavy trucks and then they got to pump the stuff out and you don't want to go in the back and pump it out so all i'm saying is as long as we're revising this now can we make it something that people could understand and if we want fencing then say fencing and if we wanted to if we want people to use their best efforts to make it inconspicuous then say that but this is the way i read this right now i wouldn't know what to do and i tell you the port of john guy just drops it in the front door so i mean we're just using the words that the they wanted it shielded that's what they really wanted and uh this is this came directly from the planning board report let's say that and how would you like it shielded a fence uh gold uh bars i mean what would you like i think i think this is giving uh the contractor the flexibility to work with his surroundings and i see no reason at all to make it very specific i think it's it's plain as day inconspicuous shielded location don't make it such a big eyesore you know well as an attorney yes when we're passing law folks people up here don't want to deal with an attorney you will down the road anyway okay so as an attorney you read it for floyd for vagueness she's also an attorney and a professor at that so this is vague i don't know what inconspicuous means it means something to lynn reeves it means something to laura i need something to do but he has 10 people so if you want it shielded say you want to shield it that's simple inconspicuous it means something to everybody to inconspicuous to me maybe maybe like what lynn just said i don't want it dropped in the curve you know hard to disagree with that okay but inconspicuous i gotta hide it behind a tree in my backyard and now my neighbor's gonna smell it and you know what look at that doesn't curb it's only a couple of months i got pictures of people in this room who built houses had to report a job right at the phone we did it too that's where they dropped them so i don't know you know we have a 25 foot setback and you can't have anything in it so i don't know how you make it inconspicuous unless you happen to have some palm trees that are small i don't know how you're going to do that if you want to shield it just say you want to shield it that's simple shielding it is an option according to this it could be or shielded okay but i don't know i just don't understand [Music] the wording inconspicuous have been in the ordinance we've had a few complaints about porta potties most recently on 15th street probably the most so you know and i understand to some degree but fortifiers are part of construction that's that's the life of construction you know uh it's not like you have a restroom it's not an outhouse yeah i agree so in other words a construction site is a construction site and let's deal with it by exception rather than you're redoing the code now mr gun that's what we're doing this is a a motion to redo the code so if we're going to redo it do it right instead of doing it wrong i don't know that's just a legal thought make your laws right not wrong [Music] yes sir because i'd probably use the portable porta john more than anybody in this room so the facts the fact here is you only have about a 15 foot honey dipper hose you put it too far away you can't clean it down all right then you really get to spill i mean you think red tide's bad all right so it should be as close to an area where the truck can pull up bottom line and the other thing i have a big problem with is the second page here uh 6 pm to 7 am on weekdays frank they can't hear you there you go i gotta learn how to use am a lot of people told me they would like that 7 a.m to move to 8 a.m okay especially on the weekends in the construction business if it says 7am you get guys pulling up at 6 30 in the morning yakking drinking coffee out in front of the construction site it's a lot better to have yakking at 7 30 frank i'll agree with you and it's not just the yacking they back up they've got the automatic beepers on the back when they're beeping [Music] just to clarify all that was added to this was inconspicuous was evidently already there i said that yeah i said that i just didn't know what inconspicuous meant anyway mr bangert's point he's talking about ours he has a problem with the hours the hours on saturday is that what you said i have a i have a problem with i'm feeling pretty good here i have a problem 7 am anytime especially on saturdays i think it should be 8 am across the board 8 to 6. i'll disagree with that and the reason why is because at 8 00 a.m many people in our neighborhood is going to work you've got big trucks heavy machinery hopefully they're all moved in by 8 o'clock otherwise you're going to be fighting with them to get out as they're trying to get in uh so i'm okay with this um well if you're only gonna fight with them on the initial day that they start up most those contractors will drop their equipment off the night before anyway so plus the backup alarms and everything like that as the mayor says they go off but thank you citizens mr hands see how i followed mr gun i would have been breaking the law i won't break the law that's why we invaded big bucks i do have the bill thank you i appreciate you all mister johnny john hansen 22nd street i can appreciate what the community tried to do but let's face reality porta potties are part of destruction and like was mentioned momentarily [Music] you put that thing too far off the street and they can't bump it out it ain't broke don't fix it speaking about the time though i haven't something that maybe the city needs to take a look at and i know this from personal experience several years ago after we bought our house we were over here for a weekend working on it and unfortunately the transformer right there on our property blew in august notified duke best they could do is get somebody out there you know um next morning saturday night they showed up sunday morning they started working before seven o'clock some schmuck and i mean some schmuck on 23rd called the sheriff on 23rd on the other side of the north side they had power so we had to wait until after 8 o'clock there needs to be an exception in our code if you will for emergencies and i've got something else okay for simple reasons and it's obvious i have a diagnosis that requires me to use oxygen at night that machine goes down i can still breathe okay don't get me wrong but if it's for an extended period of time i might be sol so you need to do something with the code for emergency use i mean it doesn't get duke isn't going to make exceptions but there are other people who have medical conditions that need that power 24 7. but back to this thing any bug don't fix it mr hansen just as a piece of information the um rule is written it does say uh you know it gives the hours six to seven weekends you know except for the holidays and then it says except in case of urgent necessity to protect public health and safety and then only with authorization from the city manager or his or her designate so um yeah by then it'd still be seven o'clock and you still won't have power so um you know again the city manager and i will speak in his defense is usually available at pretty pretty crazy hours sometimes and i've seen him work on the weekends doing certain things particularly with short-term rental but you know available every morning at seven o'clock or on a sunday or a saturday i mean i don't know you know i doubt i'd have any of those would be on every day so nor is it required so maybe that's the problem maybe this thing isn't ready for you know prime time i mean if we're going to look at these ordinances like i said you know let's make them right get it right we're not going to revise them again hopefully anytime soon but thank you just i want to let you know there was an emergency thing but you got to go to congress to get an authorization i think like i said i think it was early on you know coming over on weekends and it just happened to be within a couple of months of purchasing the house but like you said and we didn't know the time you had to go through the city manager tell the power company or tell the deputy it's okay which still doesn't make a whole lot of sense but thank you thank you other citizens comments come back to council no final comments you're planning i believe the protocol question please [Music] yeah now if we're going to call the question that actually has to be bullied about mr gone i was ready to do that anyway because nobody made any comments but if you'd like we'll go through the protocol call the question be sure you want to do this because i was going to do it anyway nobody was making any comments withdrawal from video to the expert if you call the question i need to get a second we need to have a majority wait i think it's debatable i have to check my cheat sheet or we can just say nothing that's all right perfect read the smoke decides on that we have the last word certainly ordinance 2106 an ordinance of the city council of the city of bellar beach florida providing for amendments in section 10-210-32b1-10-32 before 10-35-10-37-10-382-10-74-14 and 210-77-7 of the city code ordinances providing for incorporation of recitals providing for approval of amendments to section 10-2-10-32 b-1 10-32 b-4 [Music] 10-35-10-37-10-38-82 10-74-14 and 10-77-7 of the city code ordinances providing for a copy to be kept on file funding for several ability providing for the repeal of all ordinances in conflict here with and providing for an effective date ms uh clerk this is reading one right okay so we'll call them all please council member hi council member notaro um council member slope i council member banker no no so it passes four to two first reading uh madam clerk will advertise it and we'll bring it back for a second reading and final reading in september unfinished business we have any there is none city attorney fred riley yes it is your time i would ask the city council to give me the flexibility to propose a way forward and let me explain it fully i'm sitting here thinking very diligently about what would be the most appropriate thing so with your uh authority i'll explain what i think you should do this is your time as city manager as city uh attorney we don't even need to give permission does anybody have any objections okay i'll say several things that are factually based um this evening three of the council members asked me to reconsider three of the council members voted in favor of uh and those three that asked me to reconsider did not vote for um going forward with the uh rfp process so three of you did so it obviously is a standoff the councilwoman robert aki is not here and i think it would be inappropriate for me to guess what she her view on this would be and i'm not going to project what her view may be but the as i said earlier the difficult thing for the city council is you'll have to discuss things in public so as we've seen tonight that is a messy process at times the thing that i will suggest to you is the best way forward is to do two things one is to normally at mid-month you have your work session and to have a special meeting where you consider whether you want to go forward with the rfp process and it at that special meeting in an ideal world all seven of the council members would be here and you'd either you one way or another would decide to go with that or not so i again stress that i have been a lawyer a long time i've parted ways with clients and i am going to be professional about what i do and that's not going to stop i may not like some things that i wouldn't be professional about having said that the reason that i picked no or august 19th was that was 30 days my contract required me to give you 30 days notice if you all had decided to go ahead tonight with the rfp process then you have a pretty defined timeline as to when you would be able to bring somebody new warm okay without being able to go forward with the rfp you don't have a defined timeline so the second part of my uh proposal is that i will move the resignation date to app the day after your first meeting in september and that way you have a an attorney available to get you to the tuesday or the first meeting in september is september 6th i'm sure that's the holiday okay so september 8th i would suggest i move the date to september 9th and at the workshop if y'all decide to go forward with the rfp process then you know i don't know what i'll decide although i probably do know but that that to me is fair it gives you all the ability to have an attorney and the last thing i want to do for for any client or is leave them high and dry and not able to do things in the interim so that's my proposal two things one schedule your workshop and but also schedule a special meeting to address the rfp issue and because you have to do something and also um i will if you'll agree to this then tomorrow i'll send an email following up and changing my resignation date to september 9th and that way everything's covered i think that's a very realistic and reasonable proposal it's more than fair it's more than fair given what's happened here um you didn't have to do that well i left one thing out this is an easy yes or no uh type of decision and it does really shouldn't require any great um so here's to me to me it's a very fair thing and it does what really should be done i mean there's two two attorneys on the the council and the two attorneys know as well as i do you have as a florida attorney you have an obligation to do what's in your best interest your client and you're obligated to put that ahead of even your own interests and that's what i'm trying to do mr reese when is our um we haven't scheduled it yet for a work session what were you thinking the 16th of august it's the 16th uh yeah we discussed that we're going to do the sign ordinance that night and uh there'll be some comments about the budget a little bit not a whole lot because we've pretty much been through it uh we will have the uh well that would be something i'll speak about it in my return i'm david yes i am glenn frank banker i can make myself available okay i i don't i don't agree with any of this i think this uh i i appreciate him giving us until september i would be that kind hard um i think we should have an emergency council meeting this week if robin's in town i don't know where where she is but i mean if if the majority of council wants us to go without a city attorney and put this whole city at risk let me answer that at the mail ballot box i'm with you i can call it for any night we want to have that authority that's why i was pulling to make sure we get i really want seven council members here and then you own your vote i'm with you i want people to own that book um but i i don't wanna mr riley has given us he didn't have to do this really thank you um but we owe him a yes no and and quite frankly if we don't if he doesn't have that support then we need to get mr reeves moving on this thing we can't put him behind the eight ball we do need at that point to get a city attorney so we have definitely attorneys that i'll call a city meeting for tomorrow but ramanaki is not here she's a vital part of this i know you don't want to speculate but she was one of the people who voted against putting this rfp out so you know fox news network can project that she might be on your side and i want to make sure all seven people are here and have a voice and i also want to make sure citizens have a chance to have their voices heard so i'll pick any night you want i'm pretty much available this entire month with the exception of time that i'm at the city's convention other than that i can't do anything um august 16th works for me is before the whole resignation that goes into effect and so i don't know why that would be a big concern you wait till that night and lynn just real quick if i can ask you a question before the lady cities would supply an attorney if it came down to that is that correct uh knowing what the fred had submitted i've already contacted three firms and uh i had proposals from them to fill them as interim city attorneys to the rfps done which typically was what would happen if the attorney left before the frank i'd like to move it quicker but i think the 16th we seem to have consensus does anyone know if robin aki is available that night can anyone find out besides one of the council people even though that's not a sunshine law mayor yes i can contact can you yeah i don't know how quickly i believe that okay so here's what i'm going to do i'm going to use my authority the 16th before we're going to have a work session of 16 at 6 o'clock is that worth that one on the budget once that's on a weird time no no no it'll we'd do the special meeting first okay so special meeting will be six o'clock right now i if again i want perfect attendance that i'd like to be right back where we are now and we've accomplished nothing and we'll follow it up with the work session okay so that's an authorized meeting at this point okay and if you find out differently and patty if you will poll the council it's not a sunshine violation to ask other council members but i'd rather no council member have to count you know contact another council member okay it's just simply are you available or you're not for whatever day 16th is a good day it looks like okay mr riley are you available that day the 16th yes it's two weeks from that yes i am okay i'd like you to be here and the kid is still crying all right anything else mr arrived that's true okay thank you city manager uh at the last meeting you asked me to verify the contract cancellation for uh esg i did that in our contract it says seven days notice fred and i reviewed it and i've already sent the letter of notice out and actually today i got the card back that they received so we're good moving forward with that uh the generator prices were waiting on that and we'll discuss that at the work session um and the signed ordinance and that's other things you have you have the code report and things of that nature but that's all i have okay and i've alluded to it before i we did get a letter from the florida department of epa because i know there's a lot of citizen concern about the what happened out in november out of the dunes that's not going to happen anymore they've been very clear about what the rules are and city manager now has this information i hope it will get integrated somehow into our procedure regulations book i don't think we need to make an ordinance out of this but i think at least you know you would have it in regulation so that if you know you're out on a vacation or something the dpw people and everybody else will know what the procedure is and that procedure is a simple one um it can only be done in the winter months the seedlings have to drop off the uh the um sea oats and you can't cut them lower than 18 inches and you have to leave this was interesting that earns up you have to leave the clippings there that's right so if we're doing that to clean the junk out that isn't the best thing because we're going to leave the job there so no you you pick the jug out right but they have different junk you're going to see a job but the co stay there because it's like a fertilizer so that's it okay um there is something else mr uh reeves you know what this is and i'm not going to bring it out in a public session you and i had a meeting on this and we were going to meet with mr riley you know what i'm talking about right our conversation on a yeah about two weeks ago right so just just keeping it on the radar that is something that you should follow up on okay i'll see what prince no rush but well september a little bit [Music] it's more just to decide where to begin i mean there was a lot of issues that that's all waxed there before we bring it up to the citizens and let's see where we're at with issues on this okay okay nice city clerk nothing city council comments um let me start with frank baker uh just what i spoke about earlier today about the fwc and then buoys i um i guess i'll contact you city manager and mr riley i there is no official form to put variance together um but uh she just has to comply with a statute that doesn't exist so i'll email you two more and more anything else okay no great as well [Music] [Applause] everybody 22 were all"
