    "transcript": "[Music] you know position and um he said that you know there are questions of whether he's liable and everything like that which i really believe is a term i think he said he was going to get along with the attorney which the next day there was a letter and i think she addressed some of the main concerns and during the conversation they had the month previous they wanted to put in interlocal ruling buildings together which was in place for 18 years so i think i think we're on a good track here getting this done and i did bring up to him that council actually suggested putting five in place instead of just a two but everything that kind of got shot down there's no no no no that never got shot down we just tabled they were talking about a cost of like a hundred thousand dollars i just didn't believe that it would cost a thousand dollars to do three easements you know 60 foot wide or 100 for what um i think they were thinking the whole city and i think you're talking about just the easements right she was talking if they put the 17 that were removed it could be up to a hundred thousand dollars and um he said we're not looking to do that but um we are i think he didn't say sympathetically it seems sympathetic to at least 6th and 12th street and possibly controlling that area a little bit more from 28th street indianapolis 2. well they're still there's still 1 to 17th street which will bring up tomorrow night which is unpermitted and which is in their jurisdiction but i think her letter really hammers all the issues out and then fred we still have to decide on what we want to do in dollar page correct yeah there are two separate issues one is the issue of how you want to designate it and that that's when may want to comment what we manually propelled vessels only language and we got a another response from the state agency that really wasn't that enthusiastic about that so the the two issues are what what do you want to do within your jurisdiction and then two what do you want to do about working with the neighboring municipality to have the buoys go to the whole length or cover the access areas that we currently have drawing up an interlocal agreement for that single purpose should be relatively straightforward um i know we have citizens that want to comment on this book i want to go through council first it's a work session but we have to ask because normally we don't we always allow the citizens to speak but it has to be voted on so does anybody have an objection to have citizens speak on these issues hearing none um at some point when we when the council has kind of debated it then i'm going to call because i know bill has come down especially before our code says only those who have previously indicated a desire to address the city council during a work session may speak to it and i think um you know if we open it up to the public we're going to be here till thursday we always have opened it up to the public so i would object to okay we it one objection what's the code saying it's a this is 254 sub d only those persons who have previously indicated the desire to address the city council during the work session may speak to the issue except any member of the city council may ask questions of any person in the council chambers or any other member of the public any member of the public may be heard on any matter on the agenda of a work session when approved by a majority of the city council and the mayor recognizes such a person during the meeting so i guess he gave us suggestions [Music] i think that's what i just did the last sentence i opened it up too we don't have anybody formally designated yeah um council members well whenever you're in the middle of what i'm talking about as soon as i finish yes okay fine so what i did was i just opened it up for that last sentence there i i thought it was right um so you can indicate now in this situation let me just say phil lusk has come here for that he indicated to me he wants to speak so he definitely wants to speak tonight however we've always opened it up i've never uh chaired a meeting where we didn't allow the public to speak on any issue um and that's why we just opened it up i mean this is a very ambitious agenda there's nine items on it we will not get this done by 10 o'clock probably and we'll probably call it like we did last time um well we've got a majority of the city council has to approve opening it up to people who have not initially um who have not indicated a desire to speak okay so uh so i i asked for that before i'm gonna ask for it again let's get a form okay i'm sorry before we do this go ahead yes um i'm with leslie on it i think we should follow the rules that are already preset and not continuing to set them aside what rule would you like to follow the one that allows a pre a person who has pre-indicated that they want to speak or the one that allows us to open it up to the floor because that's what we've traditionally followed you can follow either or we follow both of them following the rules go ahead frank i actually asked mr bus to attend the last meeting which he was here for hours and we never got into this situation so he probably had better things to do i asked him well i asked him again to attend tonight he just i sat down with him he went over this for a couple hours so he's a boater he has a lot of knowledge on this and i think he should have an ample opportunity to speak i don't want everybody in the audience to speak on any issue that's what we have to follow and if you don't have time for counsel don't be on counseling object to anyone speaking however i do object to a full-on back and forth which seems to be the biggest problem we have in our meetings is it turns into a debate or an ongoing back and forth discussion between the citizen comments and the council so if we agree to not have a back and forth i think we should just listen to what mr has to say and then we take that into consideration and to that point we have the last two meetings during citizen comments suspended the rules so if you have that back and forth so we can't have our cake and eat it too as my mother used to tell me which one you want you know if we want to have a back and forth then don't suspend the rules during citizen comments there is no citizen comments this is a work session so i'm going to bring it up again ahead leslie the rule says it has to be approved by a majority of the city council so i think if we're going to approve people who have not previously indicated a desire to address the city council we have to vote on it correct so that's what i asked for there was no one who said a word but let's do it again officially um we're not supposed to take a vote but we have to want this mountain clerk yeah yes and mayor when i raise my hand um i i can't see you so i'm not sure if you see me okay okay so friend's almost blocking you i know so when i do that i don't know if you see me or not okay all right so let's take the vote okay so the vote is real simple i forget about anybody who's said anything previously this is to open up the discussion our discussions we're gonna do just like we do during regular counsel sessions you're going to come up you're going to speak from the podium when i call when we finish city council debate you speak for the podium and that's it there's no back and forth unless somebody makes a motion to suspend those rules and i'm not going to vote for that tonight either so come you come up you speak your piece and then you sit back down and then the council debates we're not passing anything tonight this is a work session since the law doesn't allow us to talk with each other outside of here it's the only way we can legally speak with each other so it's just to throw out ideas so we want to hear you with that said this is to open up the floor to anyone who wishes to speak at the appointed time during each item now clerk you want to call by person this way we have it on the record up to you yeah please council member aki aye council member banker yes council member gunn yay council member notaro no councilmember swope no vice mayor gattis hi mayor manzo aye so it passes four to three citizens will hear from you i you don't have to raise your hand while we're talking at each at each point when the council has discussed it sufficiently i'll say let's take a break and have the citizens speak and that should be your one and only time to come up and speak no one will go back to council okay all right thank you all right so we're back to the bowie ordinance we have to decide where we want to go as baylor beach correct that's where we're at mr riley mr robert absolutely it's a work session if we did nothing with our movie awareness with balor beach where would that put us since sensibility awareness is already approved for a year it's got three years i think of maintenance on it before it has to be readdressed if we just left it playing limbo and did nothing with it left the buildings marked as they are is there a penalty a fine that we can face my understanding is that many of the buoys have been washed away and you have an incomplete system this is not in bellar beach in balor shores yes i'm not talking about it's all about ballard beach if we just leave our buoys the way they're marked do nothing about it right now where does that put us it's status quo there's no there's no change that that is not correct florida wildlife commission says either change them or take them out that's quote unquote what the gentleman told me and how soon do we have to take him out he didn't give me the time but he said we'll work with you to get your ordinance straight out but because this was brought to our attention he says you have to come into compliance and some of the compliance things which you have in your packet get to the page which unfortunately we don't have those things uh and i did talk to some other cities and basically what they told me is we have talked to the fwc for many years as an example medium rocks told me they submitted their permit they haven't talked to him since the permit was established but voting restrictions say that to have other than what we have now it says you got to be within 500 feet of a boat ramp or a fuel pump or 300 feet of a lock 300 feet of bridge fender 300 feet of a bridge span on a lake on the creek unfortunately we don't have any of that so their position now that has been brought to their attention is you need to re-mark your buoys you can link where they're at but you need to decide what you want to call it and create an ordinance for that see my question here we have three label lines here in 2019 and the person usually signs off in the buoys and i've found all this out within the last six six months i've been on campus first the signs off in the movies i have emails from 2019 through 2020. according to the file department this includes 33 idle speed no weight boost she's acknowledging okay up to 2020 she writes is this extending or shading the oversize of the idle speed zone can just say anything about your buoys or mismarked she approved a permit knowingly three times in a six-month period that the buoys weren't in compliance according to her statute so now there's this and i think it's an idle threat it changes and according to our city manager no other towns are being addressed plans i then rode to the fwc and asked what towns on our island are being addressed they replied as of july no so why are we being succumbed to this because i bought a safety issue and again when i thought to save the issue this document speaks for itself and i'll submit it for evidence and it's it's it's an email okay but we would have just said and this is for the record hey we removed too many buoys that we need to put five back five would have been put back it would have been improved and it would have been done i think we're just being persecuted because fwc didn't do their job and and i want to say again we did not remove any boobs the is to move remove unnecessary buoys fwc didn't know if there was one building to be removed or if there was remove 17. all they got was a document in front of them they approved it with the language idle speed no way and that's that's my whole point here okay citizens came to me i was a citizen that complained before being on council that votes were coming in okay at high speeds okay i got involved in this if we would have just done what this document said and said hey look we removed too many bullies we need to put five back i think this whole matter has been done and i want that clear on the record because i got accused of saying well you went a little bit too far and you opened the door with fwc i never approached fwc until fwc got involved and said oh you can't do this you know frank we like to hold up our strategic plan and wave it like it's been handed down from moses on the mount guess what you know follow it okay you're out trying to help people for the safety what i'm hearing tonight was if it wasn't for that complaint everything would be wonderful well i'm glad you made the inquiry of fwc and if fwc is telling us to remove our buoys and endanger the lives of our swimmers man i still have the card from the reporter on news 8. we'll get him down to this beach we'll get you out on that beach and you tell the whole world what's going on because that's i'm not going to say word bull and you know what it ends that's nonsense i can't believe that's what the state of florida stands for that you're going to endanger people can't believe that's what our city stands for i applaud what you've done i'll stand behind you 100 okay if this is what fwc wants is to remove these things no we will revise the ordnance we'll do what we have to do and we'll come up with the vote as to what we're going to do whether it be nothing paddle boards or you know no wait zone or whatever whatever we're going to be allowed to do but i'm with you frank i mean we could be held hostage by a bunch of bureaucrats the same bureaucrats that when you hand them an investigation they flub it i'm just unimpressed i'm sorry i'm not seeing or hearing the same thing that i just heard which is remove your boobies i think it's we're out of spec we've been put on their radar and they're saying fix the problem or remove them we're given a choice one way or the other they're not telling us to get rid of our buoys they're saying fix the problem i don't know how we got on the radar i you know it's it's too bad but if we're not in space with the state of florida we have a problem we need to just correct it and move on um so that's that's that's my stance on it there's no sense in debating over who did what or why let's just fix the problem and move on this is taking a lot of time for a problem that we really can't control beyond the parameters that we're given what's our alternatives at this point i i know when we were last when when the ordinance the revised ordinance came out it was nothing in in this swim zone which by the way the best beach in the country clearwater just there the other week has big telephone poles driven in the water swim zone that's it didn't have to worry about getting hit in the head with anything okay so what are our options at this point i know we've been back and forth i'm actually confused i know no is always the option no no you know nothing they're totally happy with that we were talking about paddle boards we were talking about a no wait so they came back to you they said they weren't thrilled with stuff so can you just like in a thumbnail give us what's our options at this point so we can pick so so everybody in the room understands and i'll ask lynn to comment if he would like to we've twice submitted draft ordinances for their review the based on the most recent feedback we we've received or lynn's received the the three options that really are available are no motorized vessels no motorboats or uh motorboats prohibited those are the three three options having said that's your understanding yes having said that the thing that you know i'm putting i'm very much uh will say this comment in line with what uh vice mayor gattis just said um to me it's a problem that's readily available affects the uh thing the premise that i have always taken in discussing this with lynn and then discussing it with the city council is there's a florida statute that says if you're going to do this you have to follow a certain procedure and that's the procedure that we have followed the procedure requires that you submit the resolution or excuse me the ordinance to fwc after it's been approved the point that i discussed with lynn several times was since there's always already an ongoing discussion and this will in my opinion be scrutinized send it to them ahead of time so that the city council doesn't pass something that they in turn then have trouble with for some unbeknownst reason so twice we've done that and we've we've gotten uh two responses and that now leave us with though in my understanding those three options so that's where you are i would if you're going to choose one of those three i would revise the ordinance again have lynn send it to them again and get finality on their approval so that you you know with clarity that if you do indeed enact the ordinance then they will not have any uh further issue with it so that that's where you stand in my opinion so the three choices are number one no vessels or swim area that means all vessels i'm reading this right from there no that's no no it's the next next one below it no motorized vessels or no motor boats or motorboats prohibited so all vessels equipped with any mechanical means of propulsion are prohibited from entering the marked area even if the mechanical means of propulsion is not in use that's what they that's our option according to what feedback we've gotten from fwc that's correct mayor just to clarify we we got approval of the no vessel zone okay and then there was some discussion by council about what we're about um whatever you want to call it and and that's when we went back to them and this is the options in the email that they sent back to us a copy of the resolution they said those two things no motorized vessels which doesn't prohibit a paddleboard a canoe or anything like that no motorboats or motorboats prohibited so that's what they came back was but we still have the option of no vessels if we if that's what we wanted to go to that means nothing okay but the third option is manually propelled vessels only that's not an option number three manually propelled vessels only that's kind of boards canoes that kind of stuff so there's not an option i just i was reading all three of these and they said number two and then number one so i'm wondering myself why is number three not an option i thought those are our three choices because this is going to be easy we can go around the table and each person could say where we're at and see if we can get this thing out of committee i mean ultimately we're going to have to kind of get one of the three i think but if i only have two to pick from then just one of the two one second though let me just get through this i i don't either in the response was no motorized vessels or no motor boats or motorboat motors or notable boards uh prohibited all vessels equipped with mechanical means of propulsion aren't prohibited so what they're basically saying is that's just a word to say it's got a motor sometimes whether it's an electric motor or whatever it would be perfect so that's it we've got two choices nothing or no motorized vessels no motorboats or motorboats prohibited which means you can put your canoe your kayak but you can't do anything more no motors even if they're not running to me it's they sound the same just different way of saying them either no motors or manually anyway so just this is the way they want the wording but it means the same thing so i think it's basically what we wanted just not the way we wanted but it's still what we wanted so i think we should be happy with that and go forward with that and move this agenda on i have a question about that which is how did we get a pigeonholed into f2 how did that happen because originally we were looking at d e f f 1 f 2 f 3. now i'm hearing we only have f2 no motorized vessels no boats nothing with power no yes answer bucks you can't raise your trim turn your engine off you can't do anything and i'm just a little confused how we got is it because we gave some parameters that we were looking for to fwc and that's what they came back with we gave them an updated ordinance and because of the discussion with canoes and all kayaks whatever fred updated the ordinance we sent it back to them and listen and you've got a copy of what they sent back to us with their highlights all right okay so their their answers they're giving us are based on what we're looking for every time you send a letter they come back but okay yep you're in the right direction but because of the way that you worded this now you can only select f2 basically is that what i'm hearing that's my understanding yeah well yeah i mean i still see it as all the same no power driven vessels to me is the same as no motorized vessels which is the same as no internal combustion motors so to me it just all seems like just synonyms all meaning the same thing so i don't understand why we're going between e and f2 and one and three it seems like it's all the same to me so i say we pick either no motorized vessels no motorboats or motorboats prohibited one of the three they gave us probably no motorized vessels is the easiest in my opinion and just let's go forward i think we're i think we're making this a lot more complicated than it needs to be i would agree i think we're we're all agreeing on manually propelled vessels are okay but turn your engine off you know you can't come in with your engine on well you can't yeah i think i have some just some guidance that might bring you in a little different direction you are vision though a little bit um you want to hear from bill i know he's prepared for this tonight so um um yeah it should yeah first of all great dialogue because the questions are really important and it's part of why i wanted to come down here i don't want to waste any time if the entire council wants to exclude motors from north the south bellar beach it's a it's new to exercise for me if you've already concluded we don't want both but i will say for 70 years we've had folks come into our beach we've never had an accident from north to south you're going to get it individual stepping out of order occasionally and that applies to everything automobiles buttons so i am a little confused in planning some ketchup i've been helped a little bit with some of the communication that's happened over the few months i'm really curious if you all are aware that what we change if we're doing between two cities means that you are also making decisions for belarus shores to not have boats come in as well now i come from 40 years of boating on the west coast my parents had 450 feet out of gulf of mexico my dad would have been really upset if someone decided you and your family cannot idle no way into your home that's the bellar shore side which i found interesting on this letter that they're not prepared yet to make decisions they're waiting for proposals is it just the parking lots that you're creating swim areas these this is where swim areas start to make sense when you drive the coast as a boater and an example there you just brought up clearwater i know the whole area of clearwater what you are referencing is the public beach in comparison to bellar beach that's morgan street park yeah we should probably have some buoys out there that say no swim separate them by 75 yards but getting back to the issue at hand and i think this is where dave was going is it the way we're asking for an ordinance update because we do have options if you look at this graph that everybody has if this is such a dangerous issue which i can't find any i don't recall any incidents i am a voter that idles up and anchors walk the dog get a bag of ice say hello to some friends it's never been an issue but there are areas under this 327.46 f5 that go down and say you can municipalities and counties have the authority to establish my ordinance the following other voting restriction areas and ordinance establishing a slow speed minimum wage or numerical speed limit and there's some criteria under there do we not meet subject to unsafe levels of vessel traffic congestion isn't that what you're arguing is we have unsafe traffic therefore we fall under which which to me i'll be honest with you is the complete opposite of what the logic should be you should have no motor exclusion if it's unsafe but they're saying here under this one 327 46 1c2b if it's unsafe how do you establish that to get slow speed item now i'm not sure if everyone is aware though that our ordinance to date until we change it and i understand the proactive side of getting ahead of the process we've submitted an ordinance that's changing what we've always had that is the same for belarus shores and i'm not sure if they're aware that there's a potential that you're taking their ability to bring voters in now if that's the case i am in 100 agreement that slow the role i'm confident that fwc is our friend and should always be our friend no matter what a slip through what have you talked to a lot of different municipalities people have different relationships it's like the general contractor going to get his permit this guy plays nice this guy doesn't sometimes things move quicker municipalities have worded things differently to get certain things done above the mexico others things just haven't been checked you also have this no booby thing that has been brought up right in clearwater when you go past the public beach there's no movies and you're still in clearwater there's a beautiful home that's all hogan's home down there and others no books same key just north of us no wounds no accidents so we have options you can have ordinances without boots you can't have buoys without ordinances we just seem to be down a path maybe because we're being told or we've asked for it but then going forward even though 70 years have been a certain way you don't have votes in here even though there has not been a problem with it yet the problems observed i guess are bellar shores and pictures there so much more to talk on a subject i'm late you guys have been talking about it for a long time there's options do you do a study what does the fwc really want do you let the water settle a little bit and they're not going to come at us next month and say you're fine for not doing this because we sent a letter last month um i'll offer help where i can but i just really am not sure where all of you are are we taking a city and even previous to that that has allowed one of the residents to pull up in their boat safely that's idle no way and we're taking it away as a result of solving honorably solid so marking on access for the other residents and creating swim zones outside of this i'm a little confused on the ultimate goal but those options and an enclosure worst case scenario option i'll just give you a perspective from a boater perspective if you're out of the water one based on your experience you know standards without movies that's put aside not everyone has that experience buoys help regardless what is stated on them we know that and then you have what is stated we all know that hey that's motor exclusion they're protecting the grass over there that's a public swimming area so as a boater you know the differences but visually creating a line of buoys on the gulf of expo in a safe area like ours you can accomplish a lot by doing things creatively here's an example if you have belair shores and there are lots two or one i'm not sure what's still open on the table there create swim zones you now in the bel air shores area through their approval have created swim zones a marker left and right 75 yards apart out in the water that area that whole parking lot going out is motor exclusion it's like clearwater beach morgan street same thing spread it out 75 yards all you're using is coordinates on the gulf of mexico very similar to how these buoys were set you could also take our four easements that go north of bel air shores all the way to the sand key line and create a an area of swim zone as well so what you did was you didn't strip the city of having boat access and were a boating community but made these areas of access swim areas visually when you go down the gulf of mexico you created a straight line no the voter's gonna know that so there's a lot of discussion that you could have my first question was where are you at i'm late to the game if you guys already decided to take that away and then there's no more discussion so hope that helps thank you very much bill i'm gonna open it up to other citizens and i'll come back to council and bill we'll address you but we'll address your comments after we finish anyone else want to speak on this issue so you know other hands i'll bring you back to council bill let me just say a couple things um number one bell assures their own sovereignty so what we do in here does not control what they do there it's frank's gonna go speak there tomorrow night you know they've been very receptive and i'll tell you what that wasn't the case just a couple of months ago not to us but they were debating this amongst themselves and they weren't too crazy about putting bullies out there so this is really good and i hope that they'll go along with something for protection of the individual so that's great and i encourage it um we i don't believe as a council we made up our mind um this discussion came because original things said no i said no what about paddleboards kayaks that kind of stuff you know you're not really going to get you know significantly hurt i mean you might get a bump on the head but can we do it and then we got to this whole discussion dave yeah what about idling and i'm like well can we do that can we set up a zone for that then i believe we were told no we can't do it so i don't think any real decision has been made it's all on the table but now we've had um lynn and fred reilly go back to fwc and i'm as confused as anyone else because it seems like our choices are getting taken away when everything was on the tables here so and now we're being strong-armed like fix-it or rebels and i don't like that at all if they said that i really don't like that um then they're not our friends so we'll fix it um but it's not what else you're gonna rip the buoys out good let me know the day that happens so you're here with a tv crew i don't think they'll do that okay i'll call their bluff yeah see what i think we've failed to do is agree upon what we would like to do if we could have our way what do we want as a council we need to we need to reach a consensus on what it is that's best for about our beach and once we've completely decided on that rather than just saying allowing somebody to tell us what what our options are then we go back to fwc and just rather than write the ordinance just say this is what we're looking for this is this is what the city would like to have um i am blown away that we have a long beach and we're about to completely exclude boaters 100 i understand we don't want boaters knocking down our beach but it's a little bit shocking and uh i think we just need to we need to tell him what it is that we're looking for and let fred get involved and go back and have another conversation with them maybe we'll wear them down i don't know for the government what we were talking about i'll tell you what i'd be satisfied with and i'm not a boater i don't have a dog in the fight but i do respect the rights of all the their voters he's telling us we've done it for many many years but i've also almost been run over out there swimming that's nonsense because they're going to hit and then they're going to run you know and my skull is going to be carved open with some problem i don't need that and neither do we as a city you're on notice that there's a problem i don't know how many times frank banco has just given us proof of him seeing stuff of course across the street and also stuff here so if i was the governor and what could i do i would love to have what we had talked about one or remember we're only talking from ninth 19th street north that's all we're speaking about have a zone however big is sufficient i don't know how many blocks you need to bring a 25-foot motorboat a block or two where you can come in and do just what we're talking about you mark it off you swim at your own risk over there you know that people may be idling in the responsible people will i win the yahoos will come in too fast and cause problems but the bottom line is that's the zone where boats are going to come and it's marked off and i think when we brought that up we were told you can't do that and so that would be in my perfect world this protects your voters rings and protects your swimmers rights you want to swim in that zone okay mayor just to clarify something and i'm going to use clearwater beach as an example once you get past into north beach that there is no more swim zone okay and any anybody can go in there and if we want to just create a swim zone and it's i don't know 100 yards this way from morgan park 100 yards that way that's the swim zone we get rid of the rest of the buoys and that's the school zone then there's no regulation i guess to some degree but if you want to go swim then you need to swim in that area but the way it's set up now because we have all those movies we either have the option of making a no motor boats or whatever other things they talk about or make it a better investment exclusion so i don't think the constant wants to do that but you know maybe the solution is to do kind of what clearwater beach has done and uh just make it you know whatever it is you know we can map it and figure out how far and then we go back to fwc and say okay this is our swim zone from balor beach it may be 10 movies i i don't know you know but what's the space approximate footage from 19th to our northern border how many i mean you say 100 yards does that seem small in comparison to what i know like nine tenths of a mile something like that okay i might be off all right so if we get a half a mile and a half a mile everybody would be happy with that so i mean that's an option and that's probably what you would maybe suggest to bell or short because whatever happens they're going to have to create an ordinance to meet what we're looking for well here's that's a good question now mr mr riley might be able to answer this we created an interlocal agreement like we once had does that interlocal agreement cover the buoys in those coordinates that we're going to request regardless of what their ordinance is since the interlocal agreement will be maintained and addressed by belarus beach with coordinates is from i'm giving to you right now it doesn't matter at 6 30 12th street or whatever down does that interlocable grieving abide by the laws of jurisdictions without belief shortage revamping their word they have almost the same warnings that we have right now when it comes to a synthetic um i'm going to hopefully answer your question i'll give it what i would call a conceptual answer okay where their jurisdiction ends the city of bel air beach's jurisdiction begins so you have two different jurisdictions each city has to uh only has jurisdiction over what is within their their own jurisdiction so that's that's what you can pass an ordinance for the ordinance that we prepared designated the swim area and it it designated it from one end of the city's jurisdiction to the northern end okay um as bill had explained you you conceivably or conceptually could create several different swim areas between in there you just have to define them okay and the nuance of all this is that the interlocal agreement is to address what you're going to do in the area that is for the benefit of the citizens of bel air beach yet it's not within your jurisdiction that's what the interlocal agreement would address and then the other thing like to me it's just again conceptually prudent is your thinking through how do we make continuity along this stretch of beach between the two cities and continuity is how do you have continuity of a purpose and that we're trying to um you know you don't want it complicated part of the the practical thing with all of this is it needs it needs to be uncomplicated so that you know people can look at the buoy and understand immediately what it means and that that's really what you're looking for whether you're a swimmer or you're a voter so you know the the other thing i would say based on the letter from regina is they're they're trying to address how how this if you were going to do it in a local agreement how how it would be come together and they're proposing you know basically an allocation of costs so that that's also a part of what her letter says is uh in my opinion can i say something um i understand that going back what mr lesson said i know that for years we've done it this way there's never been a problem so i don't really like the i call that bearing or getting in the sand where there's no problem you ignore it before it becomes a problem so i like the proactive approach even though there has never been an accident doesn't mean there can't be one tomorrow so um so i think something should be done going kind of what you were just saying i was going to bring up i do not like this letter from this lawyer from bellaire saying payment of attorney's fees i think that is ballsy i would never expect to say to any other city that we would do an agreement and say oh hey by the way paid fred's fees i think i'm so i'm against that far that's ridiculous um i like the idea of a swim area because i'm with you dave i mean we voted up to the beach responsibly and enjoyed it and picked up family and done all that so i want to find a compromise where you can go but then it's also safe for swimmers so i'm kind of leaning towards the idea of a swim zone kind of like what linda said where i don't know um but that doesn't solve the problem with the parking accesses for our residents that access the uh 6 12th and 18th parking lots so we gotta figure that out too but that may be two separate issues and maybe instead of trying to solve both at one time maybe we need to focus on our city and deal with our buoys and swim zones and once that's established then we can try to get together with bell or shore not pay their attorney fees i will never agree to that that is ridiculous and rude on their part um that's where i stand i mean we can't do anything that's theirs i mean ask them we can tell them what we're doing we can suggest but ultimately they make the final and only decision on that we have no second period we have no rights the deeds to start telling them we're doing a war i don't believe we have that right um so i think that we can only talk about 19th straight and above how we split it i don't know we're giving more protection than people have right now so nobody should complain that i didn't get the swing zone you know i got the swim boat zone you have a sleep mode zone right now so you know if we make it swim only it's only going to get better now who gets the swim zone well i don't know i don't know i don't know where we make the line of demarcation our lines and demarcation maybe make it every other block and then to build us this point um those that are not familiar with the area they see a line of buoys and they stay out the ones that really are from here know and then they come in and you know they know every other block you can come in and it's a non-swim or every two blocks it's an on-screen zone something like that but then you do have that visual if buoys are in line and people will just by seeing it they're not going to most of them aren't going to ride up and see what they say they're going to stay away i don't think it's possible to have a swim zone broken up along the belair beach beach i can swim in front of that condo i can't swim in front of that condo i mean that this just is doesn't make any sense and to me when it talks about manually propelled vehicle vessels it says if they have a mechanical means of propulsion they can enter the area only if the mechanical means of propulsion is not in use so they can come up and we have people that come up to the condor next to us come into their boat anchor it there pick up the kids and so on but they've got to get in manually as opposed to on the engine i think that's the only sensible way to do it do it for our entire beach and worry later about bellator shore i agree with you um it's never a no-spoon zone you're always allowed to swim in the boating area you just have to be cognizant that possibility of a boat coming in there's never no swim zone it's a no boat zone of course i'll say um so you're always able to swim if you want to swim but you know you just better keep an eye on things i don't think it's feasible to break up our beach into x feet versus xv i mean she makes an excellent point who's the villain that's going to go tell what condos no longer and she lives in the condos maybe you should start with yours i'm just kidding right now you have boats right yeah okay so it's not you know well no i agree with what mr ruski said yeah and we argued we had coffee we alienated a couple of tenants there but um it was a good conversation but um the bottom line is if there is a visual like line it'll keep the weekend warriors in my opinion now we've been doing it for an hour and here we want to go with this because we either have to give um mr riley and mr riv some more direction or we need to kind of come to a consensus so that we can bring this either back to fwc for ordinance approval so we can vote on it or we can keep studying it right right lastly let's go around the table let's start let's see what's going on this coordinates page manually propelled vessels only um and if you haven't met with him you have to turn it off you know if you want to come in and you've got a you've got a panel in that would be my suggestion that we do our board leads that way and then the mwc said they're not allowing that option according to when that wasn't somebody said that wasn't an option only went into it that was what we said back to them okay they said no okay i said no yeah they got into the issue with they've got to lift their motor out you know it's very hard to control that's what they said it's possible to do so mechanical means of propulsion is tilted it doesn't say if you can't do it you can't come in you know i could go back to and ask them if if we put a swim zone and i'm just going to use the scenario that we took morgan and went so far that way and so far that way and centered it this is the swim zone is that okay with you or is it okay to put multiple smooth zones there that's a couple options and we'll sketch a couple of maps out and i'll send it to them and say does this work and at the same time you might as well since we're going to hopefully work something out that fell ashore you might as well throw that on the map too and say you know would you know in frank's case at 6th street would you put two buoys there and make it a swimsuit probably and but it's probably the two buoys and then 12th street the same thing would you allow us to do breakups like that but that's i think that's a couple of good questions you need to ask them that's exactly what i was going to suggest i like what bill brought up i think it's a great idea and uh i think that will give the the perception that folks are not allowed for people that don't live here but for people that do live here they're not going to abuse our beach they're not going to um look whenever i go up and down the beach i stay as far away from those buoys as i can i don't i don't come near the beach and most people do that already you're always going to have that one one guy in his little boat it's going to cross that boundary and no matter what we do he's going to continue doing it's not going to change but let's let's move forward on this and see if they'll buy that idea because i like it that's what i said before i'm gonna stick with it multiple swim zones ideally every other block okay this way no one if you live in a condo you could walk one block or you can walk one block the other way no one's being put out of their way no one's getting benefited over the next person every other blocking them to bill lusk's point i really like that idea about the visual bill that you look down you're gonna see old buoys as dave just said locals know that you can come in every other block and by the way locals okay if you abuse it and somebody's head gets carved up i'm sure the council wherever the council is at that point is going to be having another meeting on this ordinance it could be banned right so i mean hopefully it's an outsider that's not paying attention but i'm taking bill at his word i've never heard of any problems um but you know if everybody's responsible it could work so as many as possible every two blocks every one block whatever if possible have swim zone boat zone and boats we'll give them a couple options right and boat is boat swimming so anyone wants to do a long distance swim no one's stopping here that's the consensus okay well i'm going right around the table from everyone no i agree with multiple swing zones that way it's kind of the best of both worlds right um since we have a few voters here i'd hate to ask mr i don't want to go back to florida we're trying to do what [Music] you have to stay a hundred yards from a bill media i should i can pull right next to it just don't cross it it's like a line you can go right next to it and most others who are conscientious don't yes and that's the law because i can't find that written okay yes they're there council members won't look i'm okay with uh multiple swim zones but i think we need to figure out where they're gonna be first because i don't think it's um really right to limit the condo owners because that's a whole other world but i think we should just put a plan together and then sit down and look at it and figure out where we're going to go instead of all this back and forth trying to figure out multiple cities standing on it and everything let's just have city manager put together a map like he said and we'll take a look at it and then move forward what's going on okay so i think we have consensus it's multiple swim zones see what you could do with that you know what tell them that's what our council wants yeah so tell them to make it happen it's got to be possible correct not not to complicate things but i'll just say this because it has not yet been brought up this evening it was brought up the last time you discussed them there was a a very concerted effort to accommodate people that were on panel boards and uh things like that and that that is another big thing if you do the separate basically the separate two zones then you know somebody on a paddle board can use go right down the line and there's there's no issues so i mean what the council is really trying to do is find a workable solution that will take into account the various uses of the beach and that that's why you're having a winky debate over there just and if we get a no from them i think we should ramp this up to mr moreno the chairman of fwc uh i think the next week might be december or january i try to get on the october meeting i apply a timely manner i got nothing but crickets back okay for the public comment session next time they rotate their remains if this is a result i will get the 10 letter b to express my anger there but what i'm saying is i don't think we're getting the right person uh their strategic plan is pretty crystal clear okay i think he needs to be addressed in some of these commissions fred when i spoke when i was thinking about people on cattle boards and things like that envisioning them going straight out and then beyond the buoys and working the thing out there we let you get into the water some cities don't even let you do that but we let you get into the water but it wasn't to like be paddle boarding up and down and come into people's head and stuff that that's not what i envisioned i would not vote for that well i i understand that but the the thing that you have to factor in is they basically are the buoys have to be clear about what what is allowed and what's not allowed and you only have so many words in which to do it and they've defined in the administrative code provision what what are the options so to me going back to them again and doing what y'all have instructed lin to do shows absolute good faith on the city council's work to try and find a workable solution and work with them so i i would hope they would be receptive to that you know i know this is probably a massive long shot even a government entity but you know it's like we have people coming on the telephone even if they can't come in person it would really be helpful if a representative who could talk with us would be here i mean either on telephone or in person because we could hash all of this stuff out with them and you know we keep sending you guys back and then you get answers and you bring them back and you're doing wonderfully but it could probably be a lot more done if they would send somebody because like you said we are trying to just keep our citizens safe here so we're not trying to make trouble well i'm not trying to make trouble with this comment either but i i will say it nonetheless what i fully expect uh you will get by making having lynn propose this to him hopefully they will say yeah we'll receptive but they are more likely to say uh send us another ordinance and we'll look at it and then what you would have to do as a council is decide how you want to define the swim zones and you know just like you've already done it for the draft ordinance we prepared you you would have to have a definition and ideally a map so it's easier for them to conceptually understand what you're even talking about all right folks are we done with number one this one should be a quick one discussion on sign ordinance digital uh who brought this argentinian manager well at the last council meeting in the homework session it was brought up that we needed to adjust our sign ordinance to add digital signs into it so fred prepared something in it and it's kind of uh it's little or nothing or some great plan so i think what we need to know for fred and my sake is how far you want to go and how important is it in the bigger scheme of things is it a problem that's i guess how i would look at it not a problem yet but i just know the sign has been turned on so if conceivably it could become a problem we don't have to deal with this i think glenn gunn brought this up and said we should address it is glenn on the line yes he is okay glenn brought this up and he had concerns so why don't we get out to him first because he had some specific concerns on digital council member gunn yeah some considerations for best practices that other disabilities have incorporated into their ordinances i think for the most part fred's outline kind of touches on some of those things although i'm not quite sure it touches on everything and there are some uh issues here very quickly well let me just remember i think one of the things was that long time that is typically based on some sort of formula the number that was included in the campus it was 15 seconds and typically that number comes from a formula based on the line of cycle hardware shooting how fast the traffic's moving and 435 miles an hour and 500 feet the standard is 11 seconds so i'm not quite sure where where that comes from and the other thing that i've thought about is at the very end we need to think about whether how this is going to interact with sewing and whether this is a uh my right kind of ordinance or a special use program required and we may want to pitch this to the advisory committee or even a claim zone to to give some consideration to this and maybe some feedback on that sort of thing those are probably the big things that i've seen this and i i think it's an important thing that needs to be added and might as well do it now rather than you know everything is always trying to get ahead of the thing uh the only thing [Music] i've seen is unexpected consequences out of all of this stuff so maybe we just need to pitch it at the advisory committee and let them think about this thing and come back to us that's your real question thank you glenn fred may i'll make a couple comments um one i made told then earlier today i made a mistake in not getting this to you earlier which was my intention i didn't really realize it would be on the workshop agenda for the night so in an ideal world i would have got you the memo when the packet went out so i'll take a deep mirror on that one having said that the what i tried to do in the memo was pick two cities that everybody here is familiar with bel air which is in many ways is similar to bel air beach it's a residential community with very little commercial real estate they are primarily focused on the resident the residents who live in a residential zoned areas they they have minimal standards related to illuminated signs the other example is tampa which has you know massive standards because they're a fully developed metropolitan a large metropolitan city and they have areas that have neon signs and flashing signs and you know dale mabry has everything that's in there and i would submit to a lot of the the regulation that's that tampa's put in place is primarily due to what has occurred on dale mabry although there's other strips that i'm sure it's applicable to but the purpose of giving you those two is you have two different ends of the spectrum i would submit to the council you you're a lot closer to the city of bel air situation but i wanted to give you some of the things that are being done and glenn cited one of them the the you know a 15 sec it doesn't change any more often than 15 seconds there's all that sort of stuff that that you're really trying to do to to make it uh you know it's not assaulting the senses it's not having billboards that are flashing every five seconds with a different message it distracts people from driving a vehicle on i-4 you're trying to avoid that but you don't have that here so i wanted to give you two different ends of the spectrum and give you a basis we're starting to discuss what what's the right fit for the city of bel air beach council member gunn sure glenn gunn yeah i i just had a couple other inputs uh what was as i read through saint tampa's inputs there just some of the phraseology and some of the technology sounds a little so we have to question how old some of these guidelines are and whether or not they're actually keeping up with the changing times and technology one would be the lighting and how it's based on gps to figure out sunrise and sunset versus ambient lighting conditions because on days when you have cloud cover or overcast you're going to want to tone down the lights a little better or whatever the other thing is it talks about uh uh foot candles and that sort of thing and one of the things that comes out of the typical best practice of studies is you start throwing out all these measurements and hey who's in charge of measuring and how is it measured and how do you know when they're out of calibration or something like that so there are some more realistic uh approaches to some of this stuff and i just think we just probably need to incorporate some hiding as well thanks when we passed this sign ordinance we said we were going to go back and deal with the digital so i guess we have to deal with the digital and i'd like to see this council which ends in march deal with this okay i don't have a problem with this going out to the planning board and or the citizens advisory committee but it would have to be turned around quickly because for us to make this law it would have to be no later than on the february agenda we'd have february and we'd have march and we could pass it and if we can't do that and i'm not in favor of turning down to anyone then we make the decision as um but i'm afraid it's not a demerit but there's nobody can digest tampa's thing by just doing this and trying to run meetings so i need to study this there's a lot of information meaning for tampa i i just i did read bel airs and it's really easy to understand but there's not a lot in it that's why it's easy and i mean so i think maybe somewhere in between the two because the other thing looks like you need to be an engineer to understand it so i don't know maybe we can get something that is workable how we do it again i don't have a problem with it but it would have to be turned around on our desks basically for the january work session i don't believe when we normally have a december work session right shaking said no so it would be january so that would give a month month and a half if they can do it wonderful if not then we have to move forward as a council because we really should put something together it's our sign ordinance and we need to fix it and we passed it partially i'd like to see the council and the committee working on it simultaneously i'd like to see what they come back with and i think each of us should take this this is a this is a good starting point and pick it apart add to it see what it is we like don't like about it and maybe compile it i just hand it over to hand it back to friend let him compile it into a document that it's uh maybe all of our input combined and we can do that without actually violating any sunshine law and and then we compare that to what the to what the citizens committee advisory committee recommends um maybe maybe by that time we'll be able to reach a consensus on something i don't i don't think that i don't think it's going to be that difficult because we i think we all know what we want it's just a matter of okay how do we put it in writing and give us something to vote on certainly to mr gunn's point does not need to be overly technical because who's going to be the judging that there there you go for about the time frame uh well and since we don't have a alert section in december when is the next citizen advisory tomorrow tomorrow okay all right well uh it's not on the agenda but i could give it out to him what's on the agenda tomorrow is uh the gulf boulevard underground and the yeah again i i don't have a problem with it but we're not we shouldn't kill it by sending it to committee so um i'm only in favor of that if we can move this this should be there should be a word of ordinance here for jen for february the latest that's plenty of time if you have to meet twice you meet twice in a month um you know it's supposed to be a swamp team kind of thing where you come after an issue well here's an issue and um you know what i think it's incumbent on this council to not leave this for another council to clean up that's my feeling i don't know how everybody else feels well not only that but this is this is nowhere near as difficult as what we had to do for the residences this should be very simple very easy to clean up and wrap it up and let's move forward listen i think you wanted to say something like to do talking um the dwell time seems to be the the key thing in there you can't change it more than 15 less than 15 seconds and you can't have movement and messages are not supposed to i mean that sort of stuff i think is pretty basic and then i think we need to look at um should i say the operating manual for the sign i guess kyle finally figured out how to get it to what's included in that and how we can incorporate that into our sign ordinance council member gunn yeah along with the dwell time one last uh timing issue is the the transition times typically no more than a second i think that's that's one last thing that that probably needs to be considered in this but it goes back to the planning and zoning considerations for this thing whether it's going to be a buy right kind of thing anybody can incorporate it uh how are you going to partition this vein so that it's restricted to uh high east traffic areas and not residential streets or that sort of thing and then the the one last thing is uh [Music] just uh who's going to go in and take a look at this there whether it's a biraite like i said or a special used permit how do you want to handle that so there are some other considerations just besides just being a technical aspect that you may want to consider thanks a lot anyone else what's our consensus we want to move this forward um with the committees with the times uh time constraints that we basically have this ready for discussion by our january reception it's up to the concert that's why i'm asking of course blizzard works for nothing works for me i find that it works for dave frank i'm against any type of digital site to the i remember going door-to-door i remember years before people were complaining and we had those blue banners on the top of the whole welcome to del oro beach what are we doing they're telling me okay we want this nice quiet little neighborhood now we've got a big sign out there welcome to bel air beach and then i don't know if there's a mental health issues in this city [Music] well we have a digital sign now we have to control it i know and that's what we're doing that's right i'm not i don't like the digital sign either but now that we have a digital sign um we've got to do something to normally have one in everybody's front yard um so i'll just take that as a you know you want to go forward with the regulations or okay i i guess i will go okay put some regulations in place patty what do we have on the glen glen yes anything else consensus consensus uh well no i i kind of feel like i've said all along do this you know if we're going to look through it right and uh i don't feel the artificially closed time constraints on here we've gone through the lion's share of the side organs that we were interested in again i think there are some aspects of this thing we just want to make a slowly with this especially when it comes to how you want to measure it or manage it as a planning and zoning issue or or by right kind of ordinance that that's my own feedback i can go either way but i just personally don't see we should rush this thing through and come up with a piece of you know garbage and garbage out if you want to do it that's i say do it right either look at it after the first wash and say yeah we're ready to go or no let's do this thing around that's that's my way thank you rita uh yes i'm gonna actually agree 100 percent with um councilmember glenn gunn okay so i've got four people who want to move it forward with the deadline constraints leslie dave myself and robin that's a consensus so that's the way to move forward with the other things noted um if it becomes death by committee i i i'm not in favor of it i think that's what the four folks here have said so what's going to happen this is going to be brought up we're going to make a best attempt to come up with something number one i think digital science and then it's got a brackets illuminated signs it's a it's a little deceiving about what it's not it's not your fault but that's not the entire focus uh it's it's science eliminated science period for both boulevard that's that's where it's happening at and once we reach what we think is something that may may be able to vote upon well we still have to we have to reach a consensus if it doesn't happen it doesn't happen but that i think it's a it's a noble goal and i'll do my best to try to push that forward all right fred and lynn any questions before you move it on if i need a break it's an hour 23 minutes three discussion of attorney general opinion public records leads yes mayor console uh i asked the city attorney three months ago to get some clarification because we've got two or three different versions of what is and what isn't and he gave us this information uh returned it patty and i looked at it we talked about it and he gave him some comments also and i'm just trying to get some direction from the console because we keep coming back to a public records request that we're not able to fulfill uh because as an example somebody says i get paid eighty dollars an hour and that's what i want to provide the public workers and uh we just need to get this resolved because our policy says that you know public records are supposed to be given to the clerk you know if you have you know if you use another source or it's it's on the council member that doesn't use the clerk as their depository if everybody used the clerk as a repository we wouldn't have any problem with turning out a public records request right now patty she could probably give you an update of how many public records requests are in line at the current time they're in different process right now but approximately 12 some of them are very uh complicated and some are very simple but you i can't keep putting the simple ones ahead of the complicated ones you know because you know i move i tried that i tried to just do a quick response and then it was kind of like that's not fair to the people who are waiting i should be spending time on that even if i am only able to spend you know a portion of time on it should be devoted to that first request not the other one so yeah it's um and then trying to wait for responses uh for records that i don't have that weren't copied to me as as a another part of it so right now there is approximately 12. so fred put together uh kind of a couple draft questions and we just want you know we were trying to get clarification because we've gotten two different sides of it one says no you don't get paid for it another clarification says yes you need a paperwork and fred and i talk about this and i guess what i'm asking is so the staff gets clear guidance on what we need to do or not need to do and how we need to proceed forward so that's why i was asking about an attorney were you asking this question for records requests that are made of the city of records that are being held by an outside person not the city itself yeah they would be held by you know they could be held you know they could be held by the mayor they could be held by frank that would be owned by rob that's where you know and the clarification is because this is another issue uh can can robin submit to say i'm gonna use i don't know what she gets paid an hour but i'll say she gets two hundred dollars or something or maybe more than that i don't know but this does she does she have the right you know is that how you charge for public records i'm just trying to get clarification and that's why why are you trying to get that clarification for an outside record holder because the city clerk has received numerous several correspondence that says i either get this or i'm going to do this and we need to resolve it's one way or the other that's all i don't know that you do i really don't because you're very we're crystal clear that's why i asked you the question what happens when it's a city record we know what that policy is you make a request of the city the clerk she if it's a simple request she can provide it to you sometimes free of charge if it's only going to take a minute or two you know give me a you know give me a copy of last week's agenda she'll shoot that over to you at no charge you make a complex records request then there's a fee and there's a voluminous records charge we know what that is okay but the way i see it and i read the law and i know that book backward and forward okay when a request is made of you an anonymous request usually because usually a person if they're going to identify themselves can go right to the records holder so an anonymous request is made of patty your job is strictly an intermediary you're not there to judge whether the request is reasonable whether the person should be paid or not you're strictly the intermediary it's up to that records holder and the law is very clear quite frankly um it's it's i've given it to fred multiple times i have it here i'll read it to the record if you'd like but every person on every committee on every group is what's known as an agency there are multiple people holding multiple records i'll give you an example there's a facebook site for this city that was held by one individual council members received information about the city that that site's no longer up i hope everybody archived all that information they got now if a records request is made of one of those individuals who received that information it's between that person and the requester you're simply the intermediary so i don't see that this is necessary at all if there's a disagreement when it comes to the price charged okay because the law says reasonable and the attorney general's not going to define that there's case law on that reasonable means fair customary applicable i don't think robin can charge 500 an hour i don't charge 300 an hour okay because that you have to go by the lowest value can be done so robin could get a clerk if necessary to pull a record and that might be 75 an hour that's what the county charge is 71 dollars an hour but reasonable is in the eye of the beholder so i don't know why we're doing this because there's already a dispute process and it's not coming to the city manager and as i said publicly once before it's not coming to the city council as one citizen did it got the city into a massive lawsuit okay the process is to go to the court that's how you do it that's florida's law if you are refused records you have the right to go to the court seek seek those records and get legal fees so i don't know why we're spending city money on our city attorney who has to write a memo of law i'm a city attorney who's come out publicly and said that these people are supposed to be paid the law says that clearly i i don't know why we're doing this other than to just like cover our traps i don't get it why are we doing it penny came to me and and asked me all i'm trying to do is get some clarification if council doesn't want to do it that's it it doesn't matter to me i'm just trying to get clarification she's got as she said 12 or whatever amount of backlog and [Music] people keep sending letters to to her or the people requesting it send a letter and say when am i going to get this when am i going to get this and i'm just trying to find out what the council wants to do have you when they say when am i going to get this and there's a fee attached have we said when you pay the fee well that's that's not me i don't have any i'm just passing on what because the reason i don't get involved all right the reason i'm asking is because is what the chairman just stated about the law i had a public records request of the fwc which came back with an exorbitant amount of money and they claim they don't have a main server okay each agency has their own computer so they have to redact the information from there and attract people like that so their bottom line was if you don't like it take it to court stop it so just either pay three thousand dollars so i'm saying when the person asks because i haven't i have an outstanding uh so the parents asked for the public record and they repeatedly asked me i believe that law says reasonable bad time is submitted do we say we owe this amount of money and do they say we're not paying it or i'm sorry i mean here you are no i'm saying what's the answer i mean when the person makes the second request third request and they say well you owe this amount of money and they don't pay it you have to provide the record great i understand is the record what's the statute of limitations i guess for it hanging out there so it my opinion is until you pay are you going to court i've had where i've had i had two requests in the fall they were voluminous they would require redaction one of them was illegal um from somebody you should know better and uh i said here's what it's going to cost there's an estimate it's an estimate and neither party elected to pay that estimate and that was just an estimate i will not make the mistake i made last time which is to give the city the records without getting the deposit you can ask for a deposit yeah my mistake too but burn me once you will not burn me twice the problem is is that the city does not have say in this matter only for its own records this may help there's two paragraphs which define this law and it is crystal clear and this is the state statute okay fred reilly this is a letter i sent him october 18th for you records folks go ask patty for a copy of it um section 119.0 paragraph two florida statute um defines agency okay to say it's any state county district authority or municipal officer that's us department division board bureau commission or other separate unit of government created or established by law including for the purposes of this chapter commission on ethics the public service commission the office of public counsel and any other public or private agency comma person corporation or business entity acting on behalf of any public agency so would we all agree that we're agencies and so is every member of the parks board of planning board the board of adjustment the citizen advisory committee and every other committee we could possibly conceive of that's that then you go to the next paragraph 119.074 d florida statute i'm just going to cut right to the chase okay the agency may charge in addition to the actual cost of duplication a special service charge which shall be reasonable and shall be based on the cost incurred for such extensive use of information technology services or the labor costs of the personnel providing the service that is actually incurred by the agency or attributable to the agency for the clerical and supervisory assistance required or both if you're an agency you get paid for your work we're all ages in the case of robin renowned surgeon i don't know a thousand dollars an hour or whatever okay 500 a billion whatever she doesn't get that she can hire a clerk to do that she gets whatever the cost for the clerk is to dig through the records i did not in my situation otherwise i'd come right to you as soon as i finished um i did not charge my highest rate i charged the lowest rate but the lowest rate that i charged was to this is with the state of new jersey and by the way new jersey always pays its bill city of bellerin beach didn't and that's another law frank to know if someone did not pay your bill you do not have to do many more records until they pay prior vote we have leslie next to them to come differently i'm looking at our city of valor beach public records policy section 4.3 and it says that elected officials will be given email addresses and it says if an elected official city staff member or employee utilized personal email accounts slash addresses to conduct municipal business then the city clerk shall be copied on all email accounts correspondence to ensure full accountability under the public records law of florida now it's shale legally required it's not there's made and then there's shell means you got to do it and then if you look at public records policy 1.7 failure to comply the failure of an officer or employee of the city of bellar beach to comply with this policy shall result in disciplinary action by the city and any penalty set forth in section 119.10 of the florida statutes so i mean it's clear that we provide or provide with email addresses to use if we don't we are required to copy the city clerk so that this issue doesn't come up and then the city clerk gets to charge whatever the city clerk does but it's a violation of the public records policy to not copy any on all those um city emails you know and that's that's where all you do whenever you respond to someone but no matter what email address you're sending from you click cc and put paddy's email address in there and you're no longer the custodian if you're not doing that this is where i'm i'm struggling if you don't do that well then why is patty responsible for gathering private rec whether they're public request records but they're being held privately and she gets caught in the middle of it it should be this is all the records i have if there's any more you'll need to contact dave gatts because he may hope he may be holding records that i don't have but i don't think that the city the city clerk should be plugged into evidence gathering for for whoever it may be whenever she doesn't have those records and then the city gets dragged into this negotiation process which is a complete waste of time and costs the city way more money than it should have unless i'm i'm reading into this the wrong way i believe that's the way we should be handling this yeah we're getting into it the wrong way this city thinks it can do what it wants i didn't vote for that policy and i went back today and prepping for this meeting and looked back on the vote and what i said somebody don't embarrass the person called the point of order because i was giving legal advice leslie you're an attorney i believe when we were running you said you were like cops in your class i'm gonna give you that okay that's a great honor since when does a city get to dictate the communications and how an elected official shall communicate with anyone it's that is not constitutional this policy is worthless and by the way it's under-inclusive because mr gattis and jody shirley rios we're all members of that site and all received city information and i wonder if patty got copies of all that information on that facebook page that alleged to be a bellar beach information site because there's a bunch of people that are looking for that information i don't think you got that i don't think you got that at all and i'll bet you some of these people may not have kept screen caps but i'll also bet you maybe some other people did so let me tell you i don't like the policy i don't like the idea that you can tell anyone who you communicate with now granted the city partners the state of florida makes all communications public records but you have to request them that's a big difference than cc and paddy on every now maybe i don't want the city to see what i wrote now if somebody comes along like the telepathic person we have that one day walked into headquarters supposedly without being tipped off and said i want the memo from fred riley to joe manzo on the attorney general's opinion and i want to stay anonymous why does patty get dragged into it because some people fully operating within the law days you don't want to identify themselves but they don't have to go through that they can make the anonymous request of me you and anyone else on council or anybody on any of these boards so they don't have to go through patty but they're not the orbiters lynn reeves patty gentry they're not supposed to sit there and say well your number's too high or cheap frank banker you charge me this number i think it's too much that's for the person who gets making the records request and if they think that frank or i or rob and whomever is out of line they'd come back and tell you they can take it right to the court like frank was just told we just had it with a board a county board that i was looking for something with and they were like here's what it's going to cost you don't want it don't don't bother us and they're not charging five bucks an hour they're charging like seventy dollars an hour so they can get seventy dollars an hour for a clerical person i think i'm over 75. yeah go ahead yeah my uh my opinion is that i've heard the two different slides and this is precisely why i think we need to seek an agile of this because we need a third party impartial intervention to solve these issues and the forefront is the city has a policy on public records and the question is does it hold waters with respect to the sunshine and public records for the state of florida because more importantly does it if someone chooses to keep their own public records and keep and not copying the city clerk on it our policy says they are responsible for whatever comes out of that and the question is is does the public go straight to the records holder and he's a city removed out of the interview or a position on that sort of thing i find it kind of uh i guess i'm kind of uh astonished by a public official who says if you want this record you go to court and ask for it because uh you know everybody else seems to be taking the hiring of uh a republican public official elected official and there's a policy for handling i understand not only the written uh laws regarding public records but i understand intent and that's kind of the way i'm going to align with what my parents are just thinking the that's uh being held there's a there's a bunch of pending requests that are being held hostages with this thing because the uh the person who holds those records is saying i've never been paid and therefore i'm not giving you any more information so i think at this point it's incumbent to seek a third party an impartial uh opinion on the central software otherwise it will never ever be resolved and whenever it comes down hey that's question asked questions or i understand it but i think we need to move forward and resolve this question once and for all thank you let me understand you here um there's when it comes to a public records request there's nothing that i know of that's being held back for lack of payment okay um patty i'm going to put you on the spot how many records are you holding back right now because the agency refuses to tender those records you're not holding any of mine who else are you holding where the agency an elected official or anyone else is not giving those records because they haven't been paid i don't hold right now you have 12 records requests how many are being held back because the person refuses to hand those records over i'm going to answer your question i'm just not sure it's what you're asking me so just tell me um whatever record i can provide you know if they ask me for a portion of this this and this if i can give them part a and i can calculate a cost for that then i give them that and and they pay if i if i'm waiting for someone else or someone has told me that you know they won't provide it or they don't have anything then it just moves forward i'm not holding anyone hostage i don't hold any records back i never do that uh so is that an answer yeah i just want to make sure i'm answering your questions and if something is held back and and glenn let me clarify about taking the high road there's the law of the state of florida and it says if you don't get a record that you feel you're entitled to for whatever reason the person privileged the record the person refused to provide it the person wants to charge frank banker three thousand dollars for it your only option repeat only option is to go to court that's what the legislature passed it's not my rule it's not my preference it's what the rule is we play by the rules so go ahead ask the attorney general what do you do ask the attorney general if you're if your law is constitutional there's another alternative to that you can test that law in accordance if it's constitutional or not you're going to have discipline on an elected official leslie for not giving a record over discipline me i got tons of records and you use your own personal server too and so do several other people so i'll tell you what disappoint me you wouldn't dare okay who's next [Music] no one wants to speak back to council we want to go with this i know where i want to go table this thing is we have no standing as a waste of city money we've wasted enough on this record to request nonsense the law said no one has come back to me with a legal argument that's contrary to what i read into the record there's no confusion on that does anybody think we're not agencies then agencies is entitled to be paid don't confuse what the florida league of cities says is best practices with what law is the law is crystal clear on this and the attorney general is not going to define reasonable fred you will need to write a legal opinion on this a legal memorandum of law and that's going to cost quite a bit of money you also have to have an opinion because it says before we seek the attorney general's opinion we need to seek your opinion you've already given us opinion and public section on this and privately i think with advice to individuals so i think we're wasting money i think we need to move on to something else okay well let's before we move this on we've got to decide where we're going with it because we need to tell them whether we're going forward or not um you're not it's not a vote but i'm not going forward with it leslie what do you want to do i'm going to look in the disciplinary action by the city and penalty set forth in section 119.10 of the florida statutes i don't know what that means it seems like a table to tell you okay yeah table table table uh 749 anybody needing a break uh 10 minutes we're back on eight o'clock item four best practices discussion of ways to improve information sharing transparency and management effectiveness staff reporting each council advisory committee so all they put on by city manager where this was put on by council member yeah i think in the interest of time and uh to uh for better communication purposes i would request that you just move this one to the next work session so that we can discuss his face to trace rather than trying to discuss this online with the inherent communication problems if that's okay does anyone have an objection to that move to the next work session thank you suggestion everybody's good with it glenn um just one thing if there's any i mean there's no backup for this if there's any information that you might have or any anything we could read beforehand it might be helpful just no no i i really don't have anything i i will probably kind of outline it before the next week after so i do that but i think it's just to bring into alignment every a little more structured reporting from the city manager the city attorney and the city clerk to give us an idea of what objectives they have over the next coming period what kind of problems what kind of solutions they have for us and also to get some of this in front of us into the background package prior to the council meetings so that we can think about things and they can ask questions rather than just walk into the council meeting and be kind of blindsided by an issue or or haven't had time to think about an issue that's all i'm trying to solve here it's a good idea glenn and if you have anything in advance that's great patty would you please put this on our january 2022 work session yes thank you sam yeah can i suggest we've been here for two hours we've gotten through about four things can we put a camp on the meeting tonight that at 10 o'clock where history does anybody have an objection to that ten o'clock nine o'clock ten o'clock yeah let's see how we feel at ten o'clock delays and if anybody gets you know due to the diarrhea do it quicker it's eight o'clock we might be able to get through the rest of this stuff some of it's pretty quick i think maybe all right number five discussion on beach mobility mats we saw the presentation last time there's some information in our packet over here and turn it over to city manager because i think you were going to look into some of the feasibility on this right yes and it appears the requirements that after talking to a city south of here and looking at some of the information they sent me it appears we wouldn't qualify you would not would not qualify because there has to be a 175 foot open area at the end of the mat and i put a picture in your packet and we have 167 feet from the entrance to the water so it appears we won't qualify for it i didn't get a sample this is what it looks like i'll pass it around so if we do if there's something that's changed i'll go back to the ftd and find out but it's 175 feet and that's what the previous city said and we don't have any beach that's 175 feet the other thing they mentioned was maintenance wise there's one city south that they sweep it every day and then they [Applause] i think it's treasure island i believe it was they sweep it once a week but they have to repair divots in it which basically the sand you know from going across it so there's quite a bit of maintenance to it uh but uh that's where we're at with it and that's all i'm gonna tell you well i was reading the beller area neighborhood news and they actually have a picture of this thing and it stretches the length of the beach it's quite hard for everybody to see it but um my concern isn't you know so much now well now i know we have a space issue but if you're going sideways on this thing i'm looking at the thickness of that i'm just wondering if that becomes something that somebody is not paying attention might trip and break the neck on so you know you're walking up i'm not not for the person who has a mobility issue but for a kid who's running chasing a football on the beach all of a sudden they're gonna catch their foot in the edge of this thing and go flying so i had some concerns with this in terms of safety but you know we'll table it i guess for now unless anybody wants to go further it sounds like it's a no can do unless we get a little more each uh renourishment i guess right discussion of letter to town of bellar shore regarding beach access lots so before we get any further um i'm very proud they tell me if i'm saying anything incorrectly since we're not voting tonight because obviously this benefit me personally i don't have to recuse myself from this i'm going to do something which everybody's going to probably love i'm going to say very very little so if there's anything that's incorrect i'll say something but other than that i know how bellair shore is going to answer this i think personally we're probably not going to get much from it but with that said i'll open up the floor what my rationale was my rationale was to reflect what the city council discussed so i itemized the three things that the city council discussed and then requested action which is basically that they comply with their own ordinance and their code provisions and the thing i did not do was go back and recount past sins or past alleged sins um i i think what is more productive is to try and uh move forward with the neighbor and have a better relationship in the future with a neighbor and simply point out that you you are asking the neighbor to comply with the code that is governs that city so that's the rationale i like this i like the way you drafted this it may very well be the case that not everyone on their their their commission uh is aware of what's been going on i can't speak for them i don't know but this puts it in writing that we have concerns and let's send it to them and see what comes back anyone else on the council i would agree i agree with dave i think it's a good starting point i think the diplomatic approach is best to start with and then go from there i i don't know maybe i'm in the twilight zone here i mean i checked not to say i don't trust you but i checked the ordinance awards for work right and i'm thinking what's the problem it's crystal clear all right fix your departments we charge the space the fees and everything like that so what does this letter get us at the end of the day that's i guess that's my question i think and i'm with you because the rules are there so why aren't you following your own rules to me it's calling out that just to remind you here are the rules and we're asking you to follow them we shouldn't have to do that i understand that okay what i'm saying is what do we do with the next step i guess that's my question i mean so frank i have a one sentence note here so what if they don't and that's exactly what i heard um so what are you gonna do to me it's a nice letter it's a wonderful letter i already know the answer this complaint has already found its way to them they are not going to do anything on this they have proper sworn testimony the fact that they believe it's their lot that's it that's what they're going to tell you so i guess with frank what frank is saying is what we do next what do you do next i can't vote no i'll tell you my response to that but my response is the diplomatic approach thanks robin for saying that is to start with a neighbor that you want to have a better relationship with sort in a diplomatic way ask for them to comply with their own code without threatening them and if in the future there is uh you know continued uh refusal to follow their own code then at some point you'll have to address what step you should take and that that's really the only thing that you can do the the letter is a reasonable start and it's a reasonable thing i i would in talking to another attorney i would say you know they didn't threaten you they didn't threaten a good accord all they were asking for you is to comply with your own code permission and the code provision is to um acknowledge it is written the way it is because of the special relationship between this city and that city and the fact that the access lot is there for the benefit of citizens of this city that's why the code provisions are written the way they are and they should be adhering to that they they should show some comedy c-o-m-i-t-y and i'll see c-o-m-e-d-y [Music] you know resolve themselves to uh adhere to their own code in the future that's what a reasonable person would do y'all may be with with your projection of what re reaction you get you may be a thousand percent right but this is how you take the the high ground and that that's really some of you guys are throwing the end of your blocks or whatever it's bellar beach so i deal with it every day and i've talked to some of these residents great people all right and i want to have a great relationship with um i think you establish a great relationship by not violating your own accordances too you know and everyone is allowed to make a mistake and once you have once you repeat the mistake over and over and over again it becomes intentional in my view right so what would be the next course of business if they didn't do this if they don't if you send this letter and you find out that they are refusing to comply with their law and i'm just going to pick something for for example purposes they're issuing a parking pass in the future for somebody that's from timbuktu and timbuktu is in either city there's no basis for that issue somebody would tip up to and they do that for the next year it's a year-long parking permit then you have a basis to say you've blatantly violated your own code provision and you you know we asked you in a reasonable manner and you you've refused to do that at some point i mean there are all sorts of legal options one of them is seeking an injunction okay uh what if do they have the ability to change their ordinance in saying that we can now issue permits they can't change it and make it inconsistent with the documents that create these special relationships that was my thought or they theirs they shouldn't i mean they they can change their code anytime they choose if their city council decides to do that but if they change it it's inconsistent with the trust documents that's that's not going to solve the problem that will exacerbate the problem now if a car parks there without a bell or beach sticker landed well they actually laughed at us a couple meetings ago they actually said and i i'm paraphrasing but it's pretty much verbatim oh yeah they think they own the lots and they want to keep the revenue from towing i was hearing the suggestions were made about time i was in that work session i think i was going to vote it up because our carpet towed in tampa never once did we talk about keeping the revenue as a matter of fact my understanding is the tow truck company tows it and they keep the revenue that's how they do this for you for free basically so they laughed at us and they bastardized our suggestion that's two counts two commission sessions back if you need to request it from them as for your proof no need to gather it it's all out there public records request there's the attorney asking for the passes there's probably over a hundred of them that they've issued some of them have been duplicated 15 and 20 times over example alvarez construction uh example the pinellas film commission they filled up two lots with that they know full well what they're doing they've passed an a call ordinance revision which as you know you can't do but they give it anyway giving their city clerk the ability to issue passes so it's there they're doing it they're well aware of it and they don't care but by all means if this is a good starting point best of luck go in peace and let me know how you make out any uh anyone else citizens counsel your consensus that uh fred can move forward with the letter yes i'm just not going to vote on it but go in peace my son okay okay so to recap the letter as i wrote it was fine and i should send it and i will do so in the uh please copy me on that letter if you would pardon me except for the type mode leslie is pointed out we're heading to the heading says bel air shores it's bella shore i don't know if that's the type of leslie found but there's or is it more from the city council's perspective these points are a general concern and it says c-section 30-57 30-51 and for do me a favor please copy me on that i'm not doing too well i got 2d here it's one night yeah we're easy graders you'll copy me fred yes sir thank you sir anything else on that actually i'll copy the whole episode that's great discussion item seven now discussion on section 94-272 parking mobile homes on these boats trailers frank banghart bro what's up frank first gladly in the evergreen pan out show you incredible but uh as i had a citizen um brought to my attention you know supporting another council member's attention he doesn't have a doctorate and this is a voting community and i didn't know it until he brought it to my attention that you actually need a permit before you park your boat in your driveway for 24 hours and a lot of these boat owners parked their boats outside of our city limits he was hoping that we could probably provide a lot but that's not going to happen because grounds is too expensive but anyway what he's requesting is the charging batteries and a lot of these other owners have the same argument yellow bring your boat in maybe four or five o'clock in the evening put it on charge pull it out six o'clock three o'clock in the morning or whatever and go voting for the day without going to city mall and trying to obtain tomorrow first so i would like to just modify that section of the code and eliminate the 24 hour to 48 hours you're going to have a boat open your driveway for more than even 36 hours so 24 free basically after that you need to promote it i wish that's fair because if you think about you know it includes rvs if you think about somebody has an rv and they're going to go on an early morning trip they're just going to park it overnight to load it up you don't want to have to get a permit for that i think that's reasonable if you're going to park it in your driveway for a few weeks and he doesn't want it [Music] we get numerous complaints about boats and uh trailers rvs code enforcement does numerous complaints about these and the unfortunately just to clarify what the current ordinance says you get a permit three times a year for 48 hours okay uh that's for boats rv is a little different scenario that's you you just call and tell us so we can tell the code enforcement person that you're uh bringing it to load and unload okay but you know uh councilmember gunn did some study on this from for code enforcement and i gave you a copy of that well 31 of the parking issues so one third of them are somebody calling us to tell us i don't want to vote here we got an email from one gentleman that said you need to take a playbook out of indian rocks beach so and i'm going to pass this around that's jus that's just some pictures from one street about seven blocks and you know the individual that sent that email is not related to mr emperor who said the other email and you know i danny uh you know when he goes around he he sees the boats and we get complaints about so it's not just and routinely it's the same people over and over that keep doing it i don't think to my knowledge i don't think we've had probably any complaints about mr ankle at all but there's a couple places and like uh there's a gentleman on our 22nd donato he'll he'll leave his boat there for you know two or three days and then someone calls you go down there and then he gets kind of feisty with you so you know the the thing is i guess i look at it if they took the liberty of at least calling and telling so code enforcement knew it so as an example like a short turn around they told me it's their relatives or you know this then you know somebody calls and complains and you know we've got an answer for them but when they bring it and then it stays there for two or three days that becomes a problem he's only asking for 24 hours not two or three days right so i mean the question is is you know of course the same people that guy just described he's gonna he doesn't care about this he just gets one free day now can we live with one free day is it convenience to people i mean i don't know you just your relative just came in and brought the boat and arrived on saturday no one's here at headquarters i mean because i don't think anyone wants what no not permanently but i mean it wouldn't bother me if somebody had a boat in their driveway for 24 hours that just doesn't bother me well that's my father the one gentleman uh he's on hibiscus you know he said he kind of i don't know if you talk to him or not but he sent an email saying you guys are ridiculous you need to do what indian rocks does and i'm kind of like i don't think that's what eller beach wants to do i'm not i'm not looking for that either there's pictures i've seen driving around i don't want that i don't think he wants he never applied how do you have someone council member gun yeah i'm the guy reduced the data on their code enforcement stuff those four items to the left are the the 80 20 rule those those four issues eat most of our colored parts at lunch landscape is by far the biggest audience yeah we really do need a uh grass release there but the third one is parking and uh as the city manager said 30 of those issues for parking complaints are boat trailers and rvs parked in driveways i think you're getting ready to discuss the possibility of changing a ordinance based on a couple of complaints and i think the vast majority of people would certainly need to be surveyed before you do that because what i'm looking at is is the data saying most people don't like to walk out their front door and look at left and right and see a boat or that sort of thing it's just not gonna hold water there the uh the last thing i would probably tell out there is what is the real problem here is the problem uh he's got a restricted answer but same warnings that all his neighbors live by or is the problem having to go down to city hall and ask for a permit that may be the real problem here i would easily support maybe we have to take a look at the permit application process maybe as we can submit a request for a permit online and not have to take time or not to seek or whatever we can streamline the process and make it much more powerful that way it can be monitored and sourced i think some of the pictures that the city manager took and again some of the few document complaints just doesn't support changing the audience thank you thank you glenn opinion on this also if we don't have some sort of marker on any craft that's allowed to park how do you know the difference between a boat that's been there for 24 hours and one that's been there for 72 hours code enforcement may not they may not see it on the first two days whenever they're they're finally caught and they're approached about it they could easily just say no i just put it here i think that there has to be some way to control it and if you open it up more it's already being abused if you open it up even wider it's going to be abused even more if we get more and more relaxed we will have more boats in the street driveways and that's not really the the design it's not what we look like in bel air beach so i'm against it frank i think it's i like the idea i think we're overly strict sometimes i don't agree with surveying the citizens despite the comment that was made earlier not a boating community there's a lot of people who own boats and there's also a lot of people who don't so if you're going to take a poll my guess is the people who don't own them who don't have a dog in the fight again i don't want to look at them in my neighborhood but i talked to the gentleman that was just here at the break you know you bring the boat home you come home late at night it's out of the water now you're supposed to what clean it flush it and put it away just so that you can meet this kind of arbitrary rule of 24 hours i mean if it bothers somebody that much that there's a boat for 24 hours you really got to find something else to be looking at i do agree that we could come up with a sticker system or something but then you're going to on the weekends and pose upon the police or somebody to have to get that sticker they fold into city hall or someone and said you know okay they you know jon jones such and such street i put my boat out you know give me my marker okay but who's going to give him that marker we're not here 24 7. so enforcement may be a little bit of an issue i think in principle though i mean some stuff that we have is ridiculous and this is probably one of them that you can't wash your boat out of i know you can do it two or three times a year i don't know what you do the other 25 times that you take your boat out and you know not everybody has a marina and everybody has waterfront property so i think this helps a lot of individuals in the city and maybe it cuts down some of these code complaints because you know what we don't see on this thing nine out of 29 is how many were just there for a day that we don't know by this data so frank i'd support it with a little bit of tweaking in terms of how we would you know a little regulation as to how we're gonna market because i think that becomes the problem how do you obtain a permit now do you have to come to city hall for a lot of paperwork no it's it's a card you make it most of the time most of people are just calling and we email it to them and they put it on the boat or some people come and pick it up uh so you can print it out yourself and put it on yeah it's it's it's a you know uh i mean a good thing is where it says if you go up to the rvs it says a resident who is leaving or or going on a trip they don't have to come and get a permit all i have to do is call city hall and let us know so we can tell code enforcement the officers because i guarantee you when it happens routinely when somebody pulls their rv in the driveway if it's there more than 24 hours they're going to call city hall and say hey and you know a lot of times we don't know how long they've been there there was a gentleman he doesn't do any more because the deputy gave him a 160 ordinance violation but he he would bring his uh he had one of the tall high camper things he'd bring it there and you know he was told two or three times he didn't care give me a ticket well after he got some tickets he was doing it but uh you know that that's you know if they i guess i look at it if they call and let us know you know we may not need to do a lot of anything it's just we do get a lot of complaints and you know it's it's unfortunately it's the same people a lot for me i mean i'm i'm with you for including this i think this to me goes back to what i've said before it's about being the neighbor you know do you want to others did you want that on to you what happens if you had somebody that came and stayed with you that had a boat and parked it overnight and you were going to go first thing in the morning it was only going to be there 10 hours what happens if you had an rv that you want to use what happens if you have a situation when you want somebody to give you a little leniency so let's give our neighbors a limited seat i think people have way too much time in the city and people look out their windows too much at what their neighbors are doing and get up in arms and i have a lot more stuff going on so i'm not that neighbor um i could be but i chose not to because hey my grass is too tall i'd like somebody to give me an inch lean seat you know instead of calling the police on my neighbor and you know my next door could use it for me but i have not called you because i'm gonna be you know not gonna be that neighbor anyway that one's on the list see i didn't have to be that person one of my other neighbors has already probably done so um um i i'm for this because i think like people obviously the people are going to abuse it are going to abuse it how it stands right now so obviously since we already have 9 out of 29 so this ordinance hasn't stopped those what this will help do is the responsible people like that resident that came who just want to enjoy his boat be able to charge it overnight so he could take it out in the morning and then he's going to go park it and he even said hey there was a slip at the marina and he would take it but there's like a 10-year waiting list so that's one of our citizens who would enjoy one of those non-resident slips if it became available so i think i don't think we should do 48 hours but maybe how you had it in your email more than 24. so if there's 24.5 hours there in violation but if it's 23 it's okay yeah um i think i think it's reasonable to say less than 24 hours or not more than 20 however you want to i think it's fair i mean what happens if my phone had a technical issue on my dock and i had to put it in like you know save a few what happens if we had to put our boat in our front yard on the trailer for 10 hours while they worked on my dock and then we put it back on i mean i'd like someone to say okay that's fine i suppose having to spend the absorbing amount of money to try to put it somewhere while my doctor fits that's weird um frank i mean we don't we're not going to vote on this okay so you have yourself rob and myself that's three people that have indicated at least you know some support it's not binding of course you can move it forward if you'd like you don't need a consensus to move it forward it's you could make a mode you can make the motion to change the ordinance you've got at least enough for a discussion to get this thing out and get the citizens in it's a simple change so i don't i'm not going to say it's a simple change i think this would be a simple change fred will decide actually how much wording needs to be changed but hopefully it's a simple change and you know it seems simple um [Music] yeah you can bring it in you can actually bring that a proposal right up to that council session but fred has to change that ordinance uh and make draft of it i mean you've got at least three people that's a start you need to win at least one person over and nobody four four yeah just a suggestion so we alleviate the phone calls if you're going to have a 24 hour all i have to do is call city volcano it's kind of like if you're going to have a party at your house all you have to do is call city hall when you fill out a form facts to the to the you know that's easy yeah and you copy code on that too right right so because if you know if they call saturday and code walks around on monday and that boat's still there no mercy i mean at that point really that that's there's no excuse for that because we're giving them a break here you know like you say i mean i feel for you let's say you're working on the thing and you know it takes a little longer than you think and you know you take it to a marina it's crazy mayor to a piece um so the guy city hall closes at 4 30 a guy works for five o'clock he brings his boat in he calls it five o'clock leaves a message that's good enough yeah okay because if they got a you know we don't go out and give the guy a citation he's not he's not saying he ever got a citation no he just wants to eliminate i think the deputy talked to him one time i think he saw the vote that way offers some control there's some control there's a control factor whereas oh you don't have to call well there needs to be some some sort of notification of what what my intentions are what am i doing and that way it does avoid confusion i think i think yeah jumped in with that sorry daddy glenn yeah what i was going to say was in response to where robertson said yeah by far and large most of our residents are responsible people and do consider their neighbors but i will also say that there are going to be a small population of people who will take advantage of any given situation and if they're not monitored they're going to run with this thing and those are going to be the boats that are parked out there with trees growing in or or whatever and i think we could probably all sit around and come up with examples of that kind of effort you gave it so the the codes and ordinances kind of form a baseline of expected behavior within the the residency here and people move to baylor beach because they take a look around and say wow there's a nice clean appearance to this down the city and i really like to live there so they they have to accept those codes and audiences that go with that sort of thing and i don't think anybody's out there with a stopwatch saying hey you know you're both been in in your driveway for 24 and a half hours and i'm going to run your citation i don't think it's that it's come down to that but i think you need to have some sort of baseline for an expected behavior in all of these things that's what these codes are for and i would just be cautious of those unexpected consequences like in a lot of things we consider every time we meet one of those one of those things is going to be this and i'm just i'm just cautious to make cases on this one thank you thank you glenn anyone else frank you can move it forward um we have no problem counsel with him speaking with uh if um federally to the extent necessary friend may already have all the information no problem no one is indicating a problem so you can move it forward and we'll see it on the next agenda thanks frank um i had made his review of safety standards i put this one on after getting a letter from a citizen who actually spoke out at our last meeting i'm going to ask that we table this one right now um the person's not here if you can get advanced notice of this quick enough so they're not able to attend this meeting it i didn't notice i didn't see this um i see the pictures i have some questions i have some concerns but i think it would be better served if the person who witnessed it would be here and is able to speak about it certainly i could make my observations but we're not going to get anywhere without hearing from deborah mall and the other eyewitnesses so they asked a question didn't we all receive extensive detail of the situation with photographs and a clear description how much further can she take it other than what we already have i don't understand why we want to table this because i don't have detail that's why i mean but if you want to go through it i see a crane hanging over a guy's head i don't see a hard hat i don't see the sidewalks blocked um i have another person in the audience who was an eyewitness and i'm sure will come forward and speak up if she chooses um so i can't speak about what i didn't see i do see these pictures and um when i built my house with a crane if you did that you got thrown off the property i don't believe that that's osha compliant to have people working in place by the side and having a sidewalk that's open is a problem but this person was there all day and saw it and i believe even had some video so i you know i'd like to get something meaningful as opposed to me telling you what's already obvious in the picture thankfully nobody got hurt but you know there was a disturbing comment made a couple council sessions ago that about slip and falls about lawsuits oh we got insurance for that that is not the way to go about risk management the way to go about risk management is to avoid problems before they happen because you won't have insurance for long if you start dropping things on people's heads this to me looks like a disaster but mr mayor yes sir that's not a crane that's a man-lifting device and that's an illegal hitch okay you can't be hoisting material like that on a man lifting the device so yeah we've got something to talk about but i'm not prepared i mean you want to talk about it tonight i'd like a report as to why all this stuff was violated with that being your corner office mysteries right there right behind that sign right behind that palm tree i don't know if you were there i think kyle might have been in that weekend i'm not sure but somebody should have been supervising this a lot better than it was well kyle and i were both out there we weren't out there all the time but after i got these pictures i happen to see a crane right over here across the bridge going up on a four-story condo okay and i stopped to talk to the guy and what he had was he had cones around it there it was not blocking a sidewalk and he said that the crane operator over there was one individual that would put an air conditioner or something up on the roof but in any case i went back to the sign company and asked them and they they stated that they meet all the the uh this photo is taken uh they told me with 250 worth over 250 k and over dozens opponents that can be readily paced and has been in business for 45 years and they sent me a picture of the truck we reviewed the video to see several people said while i was over here on when this was happening well that is not totally correct we reviewed the video for the building uh some people that stated they were over here weren't over here on this day they might have been here the day before the day after but they weren't here when the supremes or this lift was operating and uh you know if you want us to put some more regulations on them you know one suggestion we got from the florida cities and annihilated at your desk was you know make them fill out a contractor declaration and maybe put some more you know information in our bids and stuff but traditionally the contractors are responsible for their safety requirements and if they're violating safety requirements it's the contractor typically is the person that's responsible for that and there was no you know when we looked at the videos from the cameras that are around the building there was very little uh passerbys or you know cars coming out it was here until roughly lunchtime it was not here all day either so that's that's just some information that we got from the videos we went back and reviewed let me see who's out there and so i mean it's up to the council with you know if you want us to get more strength in our policy when we get a contract out then we can do that he gave us insurance insurance we're named insured yes okay but i'm concerned that the super i mean arguably frank is an expert okay i could call him as an expert in trial with his experience okay and then he just told you this is illegal so why was it on our property to begin with okay we need to do a better job okay i'm really distressed by that comment that one of our council members made we have insurance okay as i said then i'll say it again i've got insurance too i don't bring a can of gasoline and start playing with it by the stove insurance companies aren't in business to pay out money to it for being reckless or being negligent and to me this is terrible and i just heard all i need to hear from an expert this should have never even been on the property what's more disturbing is there's a guy staying in front of the side of the sign is actually well okay no hard hat nothing well he's got i've [Music] and there's people walking by and brought this up to the counter session if you ever look at a welder's mark it will burn redness down and you don't know you get it until about 2 a.m it feels like someone just kept saying and who knows how many people went by there maybe in fact anyone maybe two or three people but two o'clock in the morning they tried what what the hell was going on didn't even know what happened so but as people on council told me hey it's here we it's about stepping up our game and if our approach to risk management is we got insurance it's a bad approach real bad approach mayor council member gunn sure you know listening to these these issues and seeing the pictures and stuff like that i i think we can do better on something stuff i i do i have formal safety training from the naval postgraduate school in monterey as well as the university of southern california so i think i can speak responsibly to causation factors and chains of mishaps and that sort of thing i think we can do better and what i would like to do is uh take a crap of building some sort of foundation and policy and i just recently read an article and i forwarded it to the city manager regarding the city of new orleans after the mishap at the hard rock cafe and how they are developing policies and city ordinances and guidelines revolving around contractor responsibility and building addie to the being process to ensure responsibility in your contractors so i'd like to kind of take this on as a pet project and they come up with kindness trial matter foundation with the city and club and uh that's all i got thanks thank you i i mean to me you know we can't fault the city because i wouldn't expect lynn to know as much as spring because what is appropriate crane or man lifter and it's not lin stop to go out there and tell the contractors people that they need to wear a hard hat it should be the contractor's responsibility and i think you know they're not out there supervising and berlin to say hold on wait a minute you gotta move your truck while the sign is up in the air you know i don't think it's lynn's responsibility but i do like the idea of maybe putting in some policy or safety declaration so putting on the contractor from the beginning that a they have to have the proper appointment that's osha or whatever approved and if they're in violation of that and something god forbid happens then maybe we're covered at that point we're probably never going to be covered but maybe a little so i i think that's a good idea if glenn wants to spearhead that that's i'm all for that it's a good idea fair yes council member sure uh yes i just wanted to comment saying i agree 100 with uh council member glenn dunn as well as council member dr ogie i think glenn should spare had this thing he's got a lot of knowledge and experience in it and i would love to see him take it on and help yes you can speak right at this mic here like uh um i witnessed it i drove in with my car i witnessed this thing being unintended okay and the sheriff was sitting in the parking lot the same time i pulled in so he witnessed me so i don't know who he's referring to didn't witness it but deborah mull said it was on her security cameras from her house i don't think i ever heard her say she was physically over here second of all there i know there has to be a perimeter setup a certain amount of feet where it's a safe distance from any kind of operating equipment that's just a standard osha thing third of all we roped off the sign the old whole the whole nine yards with that yellow tape we roped off the tennis courts for safety reasons i'm just wondering why we did not rope up any area near the sidewalk so no one got near it these are the things that that should be addressed before anybody starts they should come here and say okay i want to see what kind of safety precautions you're going to put in place to safeguard any anybody that comes into the area or in close contact of anything and and that's what it should be not just a policy set down but they should if they want a contract with rc they should come here and show us the safety measures that they physically know the safety measures that they're going to apply when doing work for our city thank you thank you anyone else back to council i think we're kind of in agreement that would maybe get glenna to maybe spearhead do a little bit of work on a policy uh here it doesn't have to be 65 000 pages but let's get something down i do like lynn what you have given us something to give to these contractors saying and you know i thought i could put up a sign every day but i mean the next time we do something say here here's our rules of procedure if you will and this is what we expect you to adhere to um and we'll be watching you know and if they're not adhering to it then it's incumbent on you lynn or uh kyle to stop them you know i mean i'm not going to get mad if the sign doesn't get put up because somebody's breaking safety rules again back to our strategic plan safely so i'm fine with it everybody else want to go forward in that manner we're all good everybody's saying yes okay glenn i got it you know there's a lot of human there's a lot of human factors in this thing and everybody plays a role if anybody happened to be walking by and saw something that didn't look right that they had a duty and an obligation to say something to track down the city manager or talk to the job supervisor i think everybody is kind of reluctant when they see something you know there's a bunch of experts operating heavy equipment or doing some highly technical thing and to stand over the shoulder of an electrician and say you know hey that doesn't cry or something i mean everybody is kind of hesitant to do something or where they just don't have the technical background to say something but uh everybody plays a role in this and uh i'll move forward and come up and try to come up with something we can't collaborate thank you glenn thanks for helping out on this um all right come to item nine general business do we have any items that were not on the agenda can i add an item for the next session maybe short for january can we maybe revisit the zoom virtual call-in because i think we have an election coming up and i think it may set a bad example if we keep having virtual zoom participants in the meetings i think that it it's going to come to a point where it's going to get used yeah i mean i i know you're going to bring this up but we have certain people that are coming in sporadically fred i remember asking this question back when this all started and we said we'll address it if it becomes a problem i don't think it's become a problem yet but it's becoming an issue okay um i think we need to address it at this point and what does it mean to attend a council session we know what the attorney general says that it's for when we started tonight we had four people here we were almost didn't have a quorum robin was a whole minute late which was no big deal right he came in but we you know we we would have waited a few minutes anyway but um we need people here you know and so i think it the next is session that's not a problem on that council the next work session that's january okay yes we have a list going forward like 12 months when four [Music] traditionally i thought when i started i remember i showed up for a non-existent work session and hadn't gotten in there dave was like what are you doing here i'm like oh there's a work session she's like no there's not i thought it was the second monday or third sorry and like every two weeks so the first monday and then the third monday is that because since i've been on council and before that they always say are you available and if not everyone's available then they change your group right today's always going to be the third here's what i would suggest for us we got three more months left four more months left with this council when the new council comes in okay have that make up their schedule all right i i just don't think we should give them their schedule or you know because there's gonna be new people there's definitely gonna be new people on council so um some new people so definitely have been this that's my point i mean you can make it right now for them and you can settle with it they can always change it so well until march can we at least make it the third yeah january be like well actually january the third monday is a holiday i think the third monday in february is a holiday also that's amazing so when those have come up we've either we've done you know either a day later or done a monday so what do you say a day later it's tuesday maybe it's tuesday a week later on on a monday but that's really up to the council what they want to do so since you're talking about maybe you should talk about january yeah let's because i'm afraid it's a lot easier to get things planned january 3rd is our meeting our council meeting right okay right after the new year and then the 17th that's where you're going to be martin luther king's birthday right maybe the 18th or tuesday 18th or 19th yeah if you want to expect sometimes people like to string an extra day i it doesn't matter to me i'm going to be here so i'm very flexible mayor council members well yeah oh yeah i just wanted to make a quick comment um sometimes you get a counselor doesn't show up or something they're protected by hipaa and i don't need to disclose any other thing about that so um obviously i care enough about the city to at least call in during my situation so i didn't really kind of appreciate because i think you're aiming that towards me and i just wanted to make my comment no i'm sorry rita i thought that but i wasn't aiming it towards anybody and i mean you don't have to give any excuses why you're on the phone or hippo or not just i was just saying it in general yeah we're just trying to schedule a date here so the choice i guess folks 17 is a holiday i don't care whether it's the 18th 19th 20th whenever the day whatever works for the majority will be today about the following day about just tuesday 18th tuesday january 18th you all good and then we'll put that on okay so that will do that's bigger february and february i mean we may not even have enough for a california see and if it's a short work session i know i think we only did this once but if there's only a couple of items which there never is anymore but if there's a couple of items you could always pull a work session after a council session if it's a normal council session if it's one of the lyndon's famous one clockers then forget it you know so that we can't do it i'll try to help you out although it's technically the next day anybody else leslie i promised you ten i'm giving you nine mess it up go ahead okay this won't take long you had asked about speed control on the bridge yes and uh i got them to put a box up there okay they did it for uh for a week the 85th percentile was 36.6 miles per hour the speed limit is 35 so they also had 37 604 vehicles at that time uh and they the sheriff categories is low the [Music] okay because 85 of the more than 85 percent of the population always follows the rules they follow speeding rules they don't rob they don't steal they don't cheat it's that like 5 so what did you find on the outliers because i think that's what our citizens were talking about they had 10 patrols for speeding and out of that 10 patrols we got eight tickets and we're going to continue this into december so i just want to give you that information that's an update and did you do a special petroleum or no i don't certainly don't want to but i asked him they sent the what do you call it i called the rat patrol out but they they sent some guys out for me if it doesn't cost us money yeah i gave you a picture of it this morning at six o'clock you kind of had an idea of you know both things with the digital it's set up to go off at 10 o'clock right now the digital caller 10 pm and the sign will stay lit all night but not right i think that was the concern that's a fair that's that's that's fair let's see what happens yeah i mean you know there's no like real light splash but it's what it looks like today with the digital off the light splashes outside so that's what good said initially all right anyone else anyone on the phone one thanks to lynn reeves sorry i almost gave you nine o'clock there uh leslie everyone okay with the journey you're adjourned thank you"
