Susan all right I know we talked about last yeah John hi de here all right perfect okay thank you Michael you might want to mute your phone you're not talking we got a lot of no problem thanks awesome okay and so the first agenda item today is um may please have a motion to approve today's agenda so move may I have a second second all in favor I I so today's agenda excuse me was that that was John and who on the second Patty all right thanks and then the second um agenda item today is to approve the minutes from October 12th 2023 park and rec board meeting may have a motion to approve the minutes so move I second Deb seconds all in favor I I so the um minutes from October 12th 2023 have been approved uh agenda item number three we have no citizens attending so we're going to go on to agenda item number four and real quick I'm just going to step in because we pretty much started on time but we're on a pretty tight schedule today so we're going to try to keep this meeting as distinct as possible because a couple of us have to be out the door at a very specific time so um I mean and usually we're pretty efficient but I'm just going to say there there's not going to be a lot of like roundt discussions and brainstorming today um on if we can help it we can move it to the next meeting um with that being said for the Halloween event recap I know Deb I mean it was successful we sweated a little bit in the beginning because everyone seemed to be late this year unless they were volunteering so all the volunteers were on time but then it ended up being really fun we had like 22 kids or something and um it ended up being really nice but we were nervous yeah we were nervous we were like we had no clue why everyone was late and even if you say you know it's a hard cut off at like 10:30 if the little kids come up you know and they you're going to let them sign up if you can fit them into the line it's like the only way you're going to cut them off is if they're completely done judging the kids and they've moved on to the dogs and you you just are like we usually pray them out there and let them do whatever they do and they just don't get judged or whatever but um what I would like you to do and if you could please email to either um Aaron or Kyle or Patty or all of them I don't know um if you have any suggestions like every year we kind of do like the good Bad and the Ugly but we just don't kind of have time for that this year so any suggestions you could make um the uh the chief of the fire department did apologize because they had an emergency like 20 minutes before and that's why that's right I forgot they didn't come yeah so we didn't really advertise it for that very reason like you know I didn't want the kids to expect it and be disappointed I want it to be more of a surprise if they were able to show up so I mean it was like no harm no foul um but pretty much you know again we had too much candy we had too many donuts we had too many dog treats but it's better too much than not enough um and I I'm it's just Murphy's law that the one year we cut back or cut it in half you know we're not going to have enough and we're going to be running around but um the one suggestion that I did hear was more tense more tense more tense because people were hot that's because they stood around for a long time this year waiting especially the people that did get there closer like the first ones there they weren't on time but they were there before the other people so you know it just in the shade it was beautiful it just is what it is we can't we can't put up 3010 out there I mean it's just kind of like so anyway we have two could we have four um if we have it in the park and rec board budget which that's where those get purchased out of we'll have to see if we have the the wiggle room at any given point so but yeah we can U as we get closer to the event for next year we can think about that we can think about that um does anybody have anything else to add for the Halloween event no but just for whoever worked it and I think pretty much everybody chipped in just thank you I think it was really nice and I think the people who came really enjoyed it MH I think so I hat didn't miss that I know you I had I had a I had a clown costume too well you would you and your puppy can be there next year you can do it next year and you don't have to get a new costume with a dog yes with a dog um okay so um the next agenda item is our next event which is the December 4th 5:00 p.m. holiday social in Christmas tree lighting this is probably our least um attended no I would say least well it may be least attended but it's also our least amount of like prep and work I mean it's our easiest you know last year we got here at 4: and we set up in 15 minutes and we all just sit around so we could move it back a little bit to like maybe 4:15 430 um the biggest thing that we have to do is it's it's our one event at least for this year that we're setting up a merchandise table um so we'll have the merchandise table we'll have like the welcome table or like the greeter table whatever you want to call that and then we'll have the the two food table we you know the music's pretty easy um the city takes care of the gifts we'll do our our toy drive again um so you know people can bring their toys and put them under the tree and whatever last year by that time is One Tree okay cuz we're looking to get a bigger tree sure thr on the one cuz we had those two small ones but they're kind of falling apart yeah yeah whatever you and not only that I don't mind getting here earlier I rather have everything set and then relax and okay so you want to keep it at four keep it a four I mean it's last year we didn't know we ended up having to decorate those trees at the last minute that's true you know are the toys supposed to be wrapped or are they out there so people know what they're getting or what no they're unwrapped and then we donate them to um like the big toys for to so like the the food drive for the holiday ends November 17th so we started I'd have to look at the date but we start like like maybe the the Monday after Thanksgiving so there's a couple like there's a good week and a half half where people can bring in toys yeah um so because last year at the event there was pretty a pretty significant amount of toys under the tree by the holiday social thanks unwrapped so it's unwrapped and then we took them um we took them somewhere to in Clearwater um I think it was Toys for Tots pelis oh that's nice it's a Marine Corps deal yeah it was a Marine core and it was they had a ginormous empty space and there were thousands of bikes in there that people had donated it was really cool to see um how many how just how many toys people donated was great um and then we do um dress up for the most part we dress up like knives like you don't have to wear you know elves a tie or a costume but we just dress nice for the holidays so professional holiday professional holidays and then of course we take pictures we have the plates and napkins and all that stuff left over from last year and I went to Costco shopping and we had plenty of stuff so we don't need to re that we obviously have um you know we pretty much have everything we need already for this event because we've purchased it for the past two years that's why we had food at that thing we are going to have food we're going to have two food Tes who going take care that me you yes all by herself well he pick she picks up the phone and orders yeah it's not too [Laughter] high I don't cook anything help but anything you want to take off of Tammy's hands is okay anything you want to take off of Tammy's hands is okay well that's what I'm saying Tammy if you want some help with I'll do that we had take care of cold beer or something like that we had very cold beer none of that we did have cold beer ice cold beer I remember that you want to know why it was left over from an event was left over from yes yeah yeah um you want if you want some help with that Tammy let me know okay I think what like Kyle and I talked about was um getting some hot appetizers from Cody's they're Beller Beach residents I'm going to call them today just like maybe some buffalo shrimp just a couple of things and then just like subsidize with some like just appetizers and some desserts and just easy last year we catered from Beller market and we had a ton ton ton of food left so that was kind of over the top are you overed or they overg gave like you over order over people didn't expect there to be there really surprised was going to food yeah yeah and we said it at the meetings before that but people just don't pick up and and especially if they're coming right from the whole premise was because they're coming a lot of them right from work to go to the city council meeting and you know we wanted to have something a little more substantial than a cupcake from Publix because that's what we did the year before so they're going right into the meeting with basically sugar and some hot chocolate which is more sugar and so anyway so we'll just have some some hearty appetizers there definitely be some sweets some desserts and then some beverages I don't know about the beer but there'll definitely be some Beverages and um you know so the first year we did Christmas carollers and it didn't work out that great last year I can't remember if we did anything and I couldn't find we did we did the um the cutting of the ribbons for the bricks for the bricks that was our it was the same time yeah we did it on the same day we did the brick no you're saying no no cuz I came to Chrisman I didn't come to the that was like months later we it was a very similar type of event it set up exactly the same the tables were in the same place everything but that was like took pictures at all four months later or something yeah so the first one for December we were all inside and then when it went time to light the tree we went outside right the tree was outside yeah well the tree is always outside for the for the mayor to hit the button the first year Manzo did did it the second year mayor gtis did it like but I think last year what we did was we had little little Christmas treat bags for the kids that's what I'm saying like a giveaway or something we did but I I can't remember um I don't remember that at all yeah maybe we just had Christmas bags and all you need is a re rethe these bags and just dump them in like that is that what you're going to do I think we have some Christmas maybe people just took stuff I mean markers maybe people just took some cookies home with them in the holiday bags I just know Christmas bags is that what it was people took you know what he said is not a bad idea just get Christmas bags and dump this candy in the Christmas bag Christmas bag oh yeah I wish you were talking about reusing put l beers on the pumpkins I think we already have the Christmas bags right we just have to I think maybe I don't know you remember we just went through all this and even if you don't the dollar store has them for $125 I'll be happy to pick them up you pick them up and I'll reload them okay you got it John I'll pick up all bag reload the Candy Christmas bags bring them to you these kids are going to eat this candy one way or the other well what's left Easter still coming up too good idea John good idea they better eat yeah that was a good idea okay so does anybody have any questions about anything for the event on the 4th yes that was just my my question uh Tammy so it's December 4th at 4 pm yes and then the event starts at 5: and it's only from 5: to 6 and then it is the um the uh city council meeting you want to make it 4:30 to 6 since we got here early and this way it gives people maybe a little more time to come so that they don't have a big space between that in the meeting I think it's been at 5:00 and it's been advertised you know what I mean like in different places already for 5:00 like it's been on the website at 5:00 okay um that works well and people get here early if they want to and then we're ready then we're ready and then um and then typically the only people that go into the meeting room are like you know the mayor and the council members and everybody else just kind of stays out in the lobby until and it seems to be plenty of time because besides lighting the tree and eating a couple things it's really just people walking and listening to it's like a little cocktail hour coils jingle and mingle last year yeah are there cocktails coil we did CU it was left over from an event I think we should have a bottle of maybe pyo or a bottle of wine well just like something I don't know what do you think do we need a liquid app no we don't as long as we don't sell it that's what came up last year as long as we don't sell it do we have money for that I mean it's not that much no I mean people barely drank last time I mean we might have had maybe an option drink just coffee and water um we've had coffee and hot chocolate water um if it's cool I think you said cider but I don't know if you're talking about like apple cider well yeah because that goes with like Christmas tree lightings and we can just do a regular cider apple cider is pretty expensive oh okay I just say cuz we found that out was like $8 a gallon now but that's not the side you're talking about I don't know what I'm talking about spk cider like the Costco yeah like a sparkling cage of something is it alcoholic or nonalcoholic it's oh could make could be kind of a drinking before it's like what um the other day it's like a sparkling CA okay yeah I mean it doesn't matter to me either way we can do whatever you guys are doing it doesn't matter to me I prefer alcohol but you know you don't need pretty go pretty slow if you had a couple beers at a city council meeting you might fall asleep okay take that under advisement okay well we'll we'll put it down and put a question mark and we'll figure out like if we have it in the budget how about that sure okay that sounds good all right anybody have anything else on that no um in here let me just so it's in the minutes we will put out Kyle if you're good with it since the um the last day to donate for the holiday food drive is the 17th why don't we put out um should we put them out the 20th the boxes for Toys for Tots or the 27th 20 minutes before Thanksgiving yeah 23rd is Thanksgiving right yeah yeah right after yeah I guess the Monday right after the Monday after okay so the 27th 1127 CH so that that'll be the 27th through the the 4th basically well no we collect them I think the no we collect it from the 27th until probably the um 20th mid December yeah mid December say the fifth Friday the 15th perfect gotcha okay thank you good question and that'll be enough time for us to get them wherever we're going to drop them off cuz they always want them early too so they can distribute them beforehand so I'll double check their I'll double check their dates too and we can easily revise that okay all right so here's the fun one Health and Wellness Fair does everybody have their John has got to stop calling at the Health and Welfare whoops I just I I don't want to strike out we need updates John we need updates from you you need update from me okay well my update is is I delivered I have delivered two letters to the one to the dentist and one today to shettle okay and they I

them the number I asked to speak with the office manager and they gave me his number so I'm going to call him probably tomorrow she said she was going to send him it right away and it might be something they were interested in okay awesome and it was ba and ba has combined with somebody no it was um off acad never them anything cuz I thought somebody else was finding a dermatologist Academic Alliance I didn't get the the location though they yeah it's okay let me just get to it um yeah Academic Alliance Dermatology and they just moved next to um McDonald's on West Bay they used to be inside the big diagnostic building there so now they're right across the street in their own private building they merged with a much larger company so I think now they would be willing to do something like that okay um I did so for mine Bay Dermatology was crossed off and then I did have um Artisan face and body was appending now there a no so there's an update for you Kyle why don't you do face cuz I can't do both no and Maria would have to work the table so it's okay no it's okay I'm good um so so what about jules's other one is that still a pending the life coach Julie yeah yeah she's still pending I sent her the a letter again yesterday or yesterday um was when I got her email so you know who else is a life coach well kind of was um Susan she's she's all if this doesn't work out Susan who helped us MTI maybe we can speak to her she's a life coach well she does like um like professional coaching I don't know kind of like a life coach I oh she works with Executives I thought yeah but so all right but still coaching and yeah if it falls out yeah well we also have I didn't get a hold of the CBD store yet like I have more people that have done it the last two years that I haven't contacted yet you want me to speak to Sira sure I mean that's a a true Health and Wellness medical marijuana place I mean it's it's you need a license everything's you cannot walk in without a license there sure yeah they're not selling just anything so maybe they can tell people like what to do for licenses to get a license like a VA rep from by Bay Pine Hospital has anyone thought of that a VA rep would be lovely from which hospital like B Pines cuz that's right go to Bay Pines um for veterans who may not know about other uh benefits that they have is that in um uh that's Tyrone Tyrone yeahp do you have a phone number that you could just forward me in contact oh cool are you sure yeah okay thank you go ahead okay yeah I'll put that thank you why you make Aaron call yeah you're the veteran yeah I guy oh yeah do you mind that would be I think it's a great suggestion do you have the letter with all the details not for this I I only have the I have a printed one in my car okay I can hand it to you yeah great and I can email you one so you um can forward it to them if you want to do and then okay so it it looks like we just have maybe 10 eight to 10 pendings that we need to and we every year it's just going to happen like a couple people are going to drop out the day of because someone gets sick or something happens so like if we have 26 tables and we book 28 people I still think we would be okay um on this sheet one blood has a table but they don't necessarily need a table because they're going to be in the parking lot so like if you know so if we do have a couple of overlaps um I I think we can fit it and not everybody needs a full six foot table like we can even actually like have someone share a table um so you're saying we can overlap yeah if we if we have to like see if all John's come through is yes and all the other ones come through is yes I if I would like to make room for them if we could fit it okay so we don't make John call the guy don't call him until you know wait and see if he could do it right who the dentist or still don't call him well we still won't have two you know yeah she didn't mean overlap like the same profession she meant overlap like two a space 28 people 26 people yeah two different interpretations so yeah the only way I would be like yeah two dentists if one was like a holistic dentist and one was just like talking about invisaline one talking about Dentures or like you know if they were talking about two completely different things makesense otherwise they're competing and you know that's um you know we've tried to steer clear of that just just a thought for the future I guess um this Dennis and I think they're different in different states but if you're going to have like a root canal or something like that you have to get a different kind of a dentist okay so doctor that's true if we want you know somebody else I have the name of the person that does the root canals because unfortunately somebody in our household needs one so I mean I could rather I could call up Dr Bush and say what I could call that guy whose contact information I have and see if he would be interested what do you know about Pearl Dentistry she's General Dentistry so it would be okay if we did the if you got an oral surgeon which is what oral surgeon right that's what we're talking and doonis Endo dentist is what a root root canal is I'll be I will I've had my dentist do a rookie out well some do that's why I said when he was talking and I was going not necessarily contact I mean Tom has done them my son-in-law depends on how bad they are and things like but holistic Dentistry does analyze it first M before well the general dentist will analyze it and send you to so I have a question this is kind of thinking outside the box but what about like an estate attorney or estate planning somebody like that it's not really health and wellness but it's like as you're lining up your health you're lining up your Affairs that's that's very good well you yeah you should bring in an Undertaker an Undertaker yeah they can do pre-planning funeral services [Laughter] Hallen kind of be on the life on the life thing you know what I mean then you could do like Neptune soci excuse me a moment that hello it is outside of the box I agree theate attorney does sound good cuz I yeah and you know what I we got a reference from her so we use the same people they use and she's excellent so like um I know who she's talking about and yeah so like we can have her do that and then I think like we need to have a hard cut off where let's see let's look at the calendar again um on this of can we do a hard cut off of November 17th for the all the pendings and then um today today is the 9th yeah right yeah eight days from now a week all right oh I got to know how you're out of it seriously oh yeah they just literally need to look at their schedule most of them and see if they're open like every once in a while like if it's a bigger place like Bay care or something something like that they have to make sure that they they schedule it but like if they know this far in advance they could schedule it where we run into problems is like if we get too close to the event like like Publix's last year the manager the manager switched over and she didn't have enough notice to book someone even though that the previous manager had said yes the new manager didn't book anybody so like as we get closer is when they run into booking problems not further out just because they have to put someone on schedule and sometimes the schedule comes out like a month in advance so I'll give them the piece of paper or contact them and I'll say I would like to check back on Thursday if that's okay with you you know because they may want to look you know I'm saying they're all working you know when you're talking to them so they got to go and find somebody if they want to do it so it's more than because it is a Saturday right but I don't like to just say tell me right I mean tell me right now it doesn't seem like it doesn't seem right so will that work I make all the contacts tomorrow and I'll say could could you let me know by next Thursday I'll be happy to give you a call that'd be great and then just the biggest question I get asked I don't know about you guys is how do I get the money like they're all worried about getting you the money like that second just tell them we're not sweating that $25 that they can pay it the day of they can do um a check they can run a credit card they can do cash um and so if they don't pay in ADV don't do it you're there I mean we're not going to go broke if you know if you're such a low rent you don't pay it after the fact I mean well just won't invite invite them back well we're fully capable just tell them the call Jen can take it over the phone yeah over the phone credit card yeah everybody everybody paid last year we didn't have any issue with that I can't believe anybody would pay $25 hour if they showed up yeah so it's fine um all she what did you guys think about the estate attorney we liked it you did what's her name again oh the one that um yeah I'll call her okay yeah yeah she was great great okay yeah I think it might be good you know sometimes people just don't realize you need all these things yeah and like yeah to have a good reference for that yeah that would be great I was just trying to think of something um I don't have a lot of Health think um connection yeah because if they well my husband's going to have a hip surgery a hip replacement so w it but that's he's all the way out and I don't know where he is so does anybody have any questions about this we're going to try to wrap up all the pendings by November 17th and see where we stand and how many tables that we have that are solid and then typically as we get closer to the event like maybe 10 days out all of like if I have 12 people that I have worked with I'm going to call those 12 people and say just want to confirm you were good you're table you know like make sure you find out if they need electricity like your stretch therapist we know know that they need wall space like they need for their table and whatnot so like we're pretty good at that if you have anybody that oh my friend is so and so and they want to be next to each other it's easy for us to know that it's better for us to know in advance okay um but for the most part just let them know that we provide the tables and then whatever they would like to do to make the tables look nice I would let them know that most people have chachies or something to give away because we had a couple of people last year that were like oh I didn't know I would have brought something [Music] um so you know you could just give examples of things that people have done in the past if they you know if they're kind of newer to doing this sort of event are we all good with that M yes excellent okay and then the welcome bags I did go pick up all the new embroidered items that we were out of stock on to make new welcome bags and do we still have two back there three three awesome so um we're all good with that and then the Beller Beach merchandise we did get the new Beller Beach like um cups the logoed cups that are back there they're $20 we had an example out at the Halloween event um so we'll have those out and I was going to ask Kyle what do you think because like right now only the new residents have access to get the kitchen towels for free what do you think if we sell the kitchen towels just at Christmas one day only just so people who normally are the kitchen towels yeah are actually like nice they're not very expensive either no yeah I want one kit they're not even yeah I'll put it together what the price would be good cuz then I'm thinking we would have another new item that we could sell that we don't normally sell and people have expressed interest in buying those cuz like they are you know they're nice and they're yeah they're very nice what what about the cozies oh John was asking about Koozies and I said we had done it once before as a as a giveaway for jazz and the Park um cuz with the bottles of water right or something yeah we we had cold bottles of water and we just put them in the Koozies and gave them away they've already been speacking everything you know so somebody's already made we made them and we gave them away you made them Kyle made them did you really you made the cozies would you just put a sticker on them or something or he ordered them ordered them okay all right right yeah but somebody had to come come up with a screen and all that you know what I'm saying not much I suppose but that was what KY did yeah he just online good yeah you know you go to those companies you can just do everything online okay what we did we did 100 um with the logo on it they were like white and we gave them out at our first event for free with the water bottles and then we had some extras but I don't think we ever sold them we had some that we got from the other place up the road where we were getting the T-shirt shirts I would buy those yeah those are hard to sell we eventually got rid of them but I think Nicole had to really push them I think the ones like if we went cuz those are real skinny ones it's hard to get a water bottle in I think if we got the ones not like the yetis but the ones that are more solid that oh yeah that you know what I mean that will stand up on their own yes the foam ones they would obviously be more expensive but I think mostly then you could sell those more than sell the other kind yes how much do they cost I mean you s for a couple two three bucks a piece or something like that cover your cost that way yeah we cover our cost I don't know what the the thicker ones are we can price them out do we do we have money in the budget for that yeah we have merchandise money okay yeah I I made sure that we we had a budget line item this year so okay yeah I think that's a good idea but like the thicker ones not the the thiny flat ones that everyone gives away for free like if you go to an IRB event you'll have 10 different vendors that are giving away those flat like we talked about maybe a Belair Beach Christmas ornament yeah like um did you look into like cuz those would need to be pre-ordered and designed and made I don't know maybe we can just do like a ball with sand in it and I can Cricket Bel a beach on it you don't want to volunteer for that right now it's Thanksgiving I you have a million things going on and you don't want to make to sell she's like a little elf until I until I start the pro going to let you volunteer for that then I'm not a little elf if you only had to make one but to make something that we're were going to sell I think that's a little too much for yeah probably um got another yard sale but I don't even know I you know I mean I'm sure Amazon has something where we would look to find like a cute little Beller Beach pre-made ornament or you know Etsy you could probably find something on Etsy that was cute but um you don't want to pay 12 bucks for an ornament though from Etsy because then we would have to charge even make any money I mean it's not even they can go on Etsy and Order their own you know what I mean MH um but anyway for the most part um we're sitting pretty good we have beach towels we have hand towels we'll have kitchen towels we'll have the new cups we got the new hats they came in the wrong color of blue so they aren't in the blue that I had but they're more of a blue that you have like that folder right there they're like the folder they're actually the same color as the folder color no they're not n no they're Royal yeah like this folder they're well closer to that closer to that somewhere between do these the logo on the on the blue they're almost the same color the blue and the logo and the background of the Hat almost are the same it's close H um but you can go but we got beige ones too so you can go back and look at them but we we're fully stocked on hats on cups we're good with towels water bottles um so we have a decent amount of merchandise to sell how many people will you like to work the merchandise table cuz I could help with that if you have a lot of stuff yeah usually it was just one person working and then we would give her a break when she went to eat so yeah it's fine do you want to do you're going to do it and then I'll break you and help if needed and I can break both of you yeah it's an hour and a half I can wait yeah if even yeah so that's perfect this is at the Christmas deal right yes at the Christmas de yeah so people can buy Christmas gifts so I'll wait till when to get my ads there we go and then um Beach cleanup Patty you said there were five new people yeah six people counting me awesome yeah but five new well I didn't really recognize them ex I was there but they already left so okay maybe there was this family of three that came from Largo or either it was a mother and daughter I can't remember but they came from

more like the three days I just said it too yeah all right okay well yeah move out um and then our next meeting date and time um so we switched that kind of in the beginning so it is December 4th the day of the event we're going to meet at 4 o'clock it says 4:15 but we're going to meet at 4: here and then for January if you guys want to look at your calendars real quick just so we can get it down um so we're not really going to have a meeting meeting it's just a set up it's just a setup yeah so I don't we don't even I don't think have to do an agenda right no we just do the public notice yeah can I ask a Citizens question so I went to the library today and so when we first moved here Belair Beach used to pay a little bit more money maybe almost all of it 90% no they paid all of it and so then you guys went down to 50% % which I'm like I still need a library so okay and then the lady from Belair Bluffs wor is in there today and they do 100% there do they so that needs to go before the council I think okay and I'll I'll I'll get up there and stand with you I will too oh yeah mhm yeah I might be on to something I mean literally when you guys paid 100% how much money came out of the budget for that program I'd have to look back because there weren't very many people that actually had a library card in b beach so it can't cuz Lloyd looked into that for me because I was livid yeah I think at the library they still tell you that Beller Beach will reimburse you 100% And then I came back here no they didn't tell me that well they told me that last time I went well I already knew because this is like my I I know issues they were having was people there were more library cards cards getting purchased or whatever but whether or not they were actually using them so it's kind of like people just getting a card to get a card I mean I don't know I bring it before Cil there's more history to it let it be talked about I will tell you one thing I don't need a card if I'm not borrowing a book that last thing I would be was like let me get a free library call yeah yeah you know like yeah unless I'm reading going on at that I can look at the past numbers to get some more it's a great Library I was in there today I yeah it is okay sorry no it's okay thank you um so back to January meeting yes ma'am how about Thursday the uh 11th or Thursday the 18th Thursday seem to work well the 11th would be right before our event right oh that's true well which might not be a bad idea that might not be a bad idea idea but then we'd have to be here on do we have to really do anything we don't have to really do anything for set set T set up said we did it last year with them we did all the numbers we did the numbers yeah the numbers and we SP a lot of time in that room yeah we for this thing why don't we just have our meeting on Friday then when we're setting up yeah so we'll do a meeting first and then do the setup should we order like a little luncheon or something like we could bring some yeah everybody bring a lunch we could eat here lunch during the meeting and then go work or I don't know I don't know so you want to have it early oh you eat lunch at late like at 2 oh I don't care yeah you let's not do lunch let's do like fruit or something I'll bring fruit party okay so the 12th at 2:00 does that work for everybody for a brief meeting and setup yeah that oh that's perfect um said Thank You 2: p.m. you so it's a half hour earlier than normal so hopefully we have a 30 minute meeting and then we just go set up the room and hopefully we can get the room set up in like an hour because we do need we don't put tablecloths and um we don't like we'll put the numbers down on the tables um we stopped doing the map because there were so many changes last minute and Kyle was running back like a million times so we stopped doing that what else did we set up the tables in the lobby I just feel like they do most of the set up but regardless like we were stuffing something we had um no we did it the day of the we had the food and everything we put but that was day off I know we were printing the numbers there was an issue with the numbers that day yeah we had a backwards number yeah [Music] remember I do remember working for quite a while though okay maybe it wasn't did we that same weekend did we do the stuffing the things for the things that we put the door knocker things door knockers is that what we did that is what we did we have been little busy town bees we don't have to do that this year there's no stuffing no we're not doing b beach bees okay so January 12th at 2 p.m. meeting and setup that'll work great and then we're just here once for the month um and then I know it's the found but the following Saturday we have Bridge cleanup and we are putting that on the keep panella's beautiful website just so we hopefully will fill this parking lot and get enough people to get underneath the bridge and get all of that cleaned up um I don't know is there any way who would I contact or who who could you help me contact because like you know Dave's like why don't they mow down here like the grass was up to my knees and we were worried about snakes and like it's hard to pick up garbage when the grass is so tall so I didn't know like if they would rather us just leave the garbage down there cuz that's not really like you're talking about the first island that we have the on the opposite side we have the little axis area no it's on this side is where we um we never left this side yeah this side but you're talking the opposite side's where like we have the drive-in ramp and then it ramps out that's the opposite side does have the ramp the so we as the counties and we we have a sign we have a we should sell a garbage there but that's about the extent of it it's not really our property no but I just didn't know like for us to be able to get down there and clean it up if we could request for it to be kind same on the other side of the bridge it would need a probably some kind of slope mower I don't even know what what they have that they would use to mow if you could get a tractor with like a slope more arm down there it might be a that's a big request I don't how large an area is it that's not modow pretty big I but you know what it actually looks shorter like when I walked the bridge yesterday the grass looks shorter than it did when we cleaned maybe they are so maybe they did mow yeah okay but anyway regardless we're just going to see if we can get more people here since we can accommodate the parking to help I mean because if we do up and down both sides of the bridge it's pretty big I mean and even what but what's that date again the 20th 20th okay Saturday 20th um what time want us here for the wealth and helmet wealth and helness say maybe we need a minister confused with your welfare thing 9:30 9:30 thank you this year the event is from 10:30 to 1:30 we shortened it by 1 hour so instead of us needing to be here at 9: we 9:30 and then were here an hour before and then if someone's a little bit late it's fine just because we should have the majority of it set up the day before there should be a ton but people will get here and as you remember from last year and the year before a lot of them need help and direction and the new people are going to want to know where to park you have to explain the whole Ninth Street thing so they can bring their stuff up the ramp or you know if they need to bring it up to the ramp and then rep park because we kind of all of them to park in the back so the residents can park in the front Okay um plus the blood mobile will be up front yes yeah and we usually like um put cones out to save spot for the blood mobile okay so anyway okay and I should have the bridge clean up on the 20th on here and it bridge is at 9 or 8 it's at 9 it's at 9 so that dab can come yes Deb's always there I didn't go this week but yeah you ever ask the bridge ladies if they want to do the bridge clean up no I don't know any of them by the way the Tall Grass you're not worried about snakes you know worried about triggers I had so many bug bites but did I just say that out loud there's no bugs anyway all right um so then um would someone like to make a motion to adjourn today's meeting I [Music] willich Michael hello maybe uh mik yeah I couldn't get off a mute I'm sorry so um yeah I got Deb on the motion and who seconded it me Tammy Tammy second it okay all in favor all right meeting a journ thank you guys you bye Michael thank youe
