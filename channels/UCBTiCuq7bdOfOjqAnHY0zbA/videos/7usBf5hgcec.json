    "transcript": "all right it's now 7 35 pm july 18th special council meeting will now come to order please rise and join me once again councilmember frank banker councilmember leslie otero here council member lloyd roberts councilmember jody shirley your council member mike zabel here vice mayor glenn gunn mayor dave gaddis interim city manager kyle riefler mr lynn reeves thank you very much all right we have one item on the agenda that is for consideration of setting the candidate military for fiscal year 2022-2023 before we continue we must have a motion excuse me they have to say what they want to set the military that's true oh i thought we were just moving to the motion would be to consider setting the tentative millage rate for fiscal year [Laughter] all right i'm gonna give some some details right quick and then um you'll have the floor the proposed millage rate is important because this rate cannot be increased unless each taxpayer is mailed a revised notice of proposed property tax also the final millage rate cannot exceed the tentative adopted millage rate but can always be lower we just finished discussing the proposed budget which is based around the same millage rate that we have today which is 2.0394 it is estimated that the proposed millage rate is 100 775 or nearly 14 more than the fiscal year 2021 2022 budget like last year this is due primarily to increase property values council member shirley you have the floors yes i would propose that we that we move forward with the budget as presented with the millage rate of 2.0394 thank you very much uh other comments uh yes uh i put that in for i mean i looked at was it possible impactful citizens and really i was focusing on state systems to people that have homesteaded here people that are current residents within the city limits and if they're in the homestead act obviously you have to break theirs and you have to break senior but you also have to save our homes cap maximum three percent raise on the homestead properties so i mean i don't like using work but it's a really a minimal impact by keeping the knowledge at its current rate as we saw in fact we just received the paper that uh the waste itself went 8.7 so we can't afford to give any breaks at this time so i would recommend as well voting for the 2.0 existing military thank you other comments um you mentioned a 14 increase in property values no i didn't say uh in property value i i just said that that the uh the amount estimated amount collected would be about 14 more than what it was yes just because the property back yeah all right um then why can't we roll this back so a rollback we would lose that 14 this is this is my opinion but uh we would lose that fourteen percent gain and um everything has gone up nine percent i'm not looking at i think the rollback rate would be like one point nine uh it's one point seven nine four those yeah uh it's a one point seven nine one six if we lose a hundred and seventy three thousand seven hundred from our current budget we'd have to find those cuts well what i'm saying is we haven't planned out with the 14 is going to equate actually the projections are on the next page page 10. uh preliminary though well one of the problems we have right now is is by going back we have to start the budget process completely over and we would have to do that if we decided to uh deal with rollback rate or something like that remember this is the tentative i just other salaries right which means that this sets the maximum that we can ask for so we can always reduce it whenever it comes time to actually vote for the actual mailing break but i i think most people will agree it's better safe than sorry but i i would support here for that great mayor i would support that from our support going forward other comments i support the 2.0 394 at this point as you said it's the maximum we can do if when we get through the budget we have our public hearings and hear from the citizens we can always go back but we can't go forward so this is just a cap thank you wood roberts yeah i concur i think i mentioned that last time we were talking about the military that the and glad one went through the actual arithmetic i tried right but the uh yeah i i said that i thought it would be a minimal additional cost of course everybody has a different definition of what the minimal is but i think the additional cost for each homeowner the fact that it is i'll use that term minimal the overall amount of money that's going to come back to the city is pretty substantial and i think we can definitely use that money thank you very much vice mayor gunn have we ever gotten a definitive answer on this partial rollback issue i mean we've been asking it forever let's explain it to me during the private budget meetings you see go back to against the 1.79 you can't get any of the money if you raise it just a little bit i don't want to take the words in your mouth like if you could explain how you're running today now you can modify that roll back it doesn't have to go all the way back and i looked at your [Music] your rollback number you know that's a pretty substantial rollback if you did the full amount i mean uh the current situation with inflation and things of that nature is if you really look at the amount of money that it could cost on average when we got 1200 some properties in the city it's probably 140 bucks a house we're only halfway through the year and inflation is 9.1 going crazy i only asked that okay so we've gotten that out of the way i'm not in favor of rolling back there's just too much uncertainty in this stage for the economy to go back right now and while short in the short term it would feel good i think you'd have a hard time explaining why you're bumping taxes up and that's cool going backwards is very easy but if you have to say okay the truth is change now we're increasing your taxes you're going to hear about that a lot more from your resume too i'm not disagreeing right it's politics i mean you love you today and i hate you more i mean but i i my philosophy is that people can spend their money very much any other comments from the council let's go to the citizens uh maintaining the military there is you know just asking gerald hayes last year kelly rolled back was it 10 or 15 basis points and nobody didn't hit the parade nobody said anything they didn't make a difference i mean i think you know as you guys go through the budget exercise there's a lot of projects um it's a blessing that the increase is here and so i think the citizens would rather see more projects handled and taken care of sooner or later so you know i support the conversation thank you thank you very much we have any other comments from the citizens all right let's take it back to the council any comments baby surely you have the last word all right so um patty what i'd like to do is take a roll call vote um based on our prior discussions i believe we are only considering two options we were presented with four in uh in the uh report and i don't think anyone is considering going higher than our current mailers am i correct okay good all right so um option a is the rollback rate of 1.7916 option b is the proposed and existing rate of 2.0394 [Music] when called please select option a or option b council member banker councilmember notaro council member roberts b councilmember shirley b council members abel vice mayor gunn clarification b is for 2.0394 correct so it's unanimous the intended millage rate will be set at 2.0394 mara will be interviewing four candidates for the city manager position advise everyone to carefully review each of the candidates and be prepared to ask questions would anyone like to make a motion to adjourn some that we're going to be interviewing tomorrow say that again before the four candidates right could you give us an email and we know right now you can just tell us who the four candidates are that we're interviewing yes and you and you got the applications right yes okay good okay mayor yes okay um it's ken griffin he was number 11 number 15 peter cavalli number 20 kyle riefler and number 28 robert daniels did all the other ones stipulate that they're not interested well i think mayor phil help me we had shane crawford who declined we had mr mendes who never replied and who was the other one i think there was one fabry had accepted another position thank you vice mayor we'll start out we'll have 10 minutes for a brief discussion and go over what we're doing and then we'll have 20 minutes for the candidate as soon as that one's over we'll have 10 minutes and then it'll be 20 for the next candidate at the end of this exercise it'll be two hours two hours elapsed and then um we'll take as long as we need to decide what we want to do with uh what's going to present it mayor just one just kind of a reminder i will not be able to participate through the whole thing i'll be in my car waiting to attend another meeting um so i don't know how much participation but this will be on zoom and recorded is that correct kyle's going to set up zoom meetings and you can join each one correct kyle cool you have to join separate zoom meetings for each camera yeah okay but they'll be recorded so if i miss the ones i miss i can get the recording is that correct yes right just like make sure you start recording if we decide that there are two worthy candidates to advance advance them to the next round is this the order quicker i am
