vice mayor Jody Shirley here mayor Dave gtis here city manager Kyle reefer here and and City attorney Randy MOA pres all right you second figure sounds like baseball stadi I think we're better now all right all right before we begin our agenda like to remind everyone that this Saturday still doing Victor there's a re I'll tell you what just going to pause the meeting for just a minute and see if we can get this fig out hello [Music] [Music] are we good can everyone hear me all right great I apologize for the technical difficulties let's move forward before we begin our agenda I'd like to remind everyone that this Saturday November the 11th Veterans Day this day holds a special place in our hearts as we come together to recognize the brave men and women who have served and continue to serve our great nation on this upcoming Veterans Day let us pay our respects and express our profound gratitude to those Heroes their service whether in times of war or peace reminds us of the values that Define our nation freedom justice and democracy let us ensure that their sacrifices are never forgotten and that our veterans know they are appreciated not just today but every day thank you Veterans for your service and dedication to our great nation the United States of America Now we move on to agenda item number one Mr yes sorry about it's possible i' like to suggest we have a couple of guests here tonight that actually are not from b beach and as entertaining as our meetings are if we could on item 30 I thought possibly is okay with the council if we could move that to the front of the regular agenda um so they don't have so we're on agenda item one which is the first order business approval of the agenda so uh before uh we can do that someone's going to have to make a motion to amend the agenda so are you making a yes agenda I move that we amend the agenda would anyone like to second that motion second second by Jody Shirley all right uh because we're just voting to amend the agenda there's no discussion all in favor I I can you oppos no all right well then the agenda is amended now uh I need a motion to approve the agenda as amended we clarify where number 30 correct item up to be the first item under the regular agenda so I don't know if we would make that 21 a 21 b or the easiest way to make that happen so what I would like to do is rather than reing okay we'll just call it item number 30 and it it'll be four number that's perfect that okay with you P thank you very much okay all right so would anyone like to make a motion to approve the agenda as amended Mo motion made by Lloyd Roberts do I have a second second second by jie J Shirley all in favor I oppos no all right one opposed so the motion passes and so the agenda is amended so we will move right over to item number 30 May mayor just some clarity it's my understanding that Mr Robert's Amendment such that it would make item 30 the first um Regular agenda item before 20 before what is presently 21 um so it would still be it would move to the beginning of the regular regular not ahead of all the other items yeah that makes sense okay so we will um make that put that right at the regular as the regular agenda begin all right so now we are on to Citizen comments item number two if any citizen would like to address the council about a topic not already on the agenda please raise your hand and wait to be called on we ask that you limit your comments to No More Than 3 minutes if any council member would like to respond to Citizen comments please hold your responses until we reach Council comments at the end of the meeting uh before I call on uh random citizens we already have two cards completed to speak uh the first is Clifford G this and I'm here for a happy occasion um we've had something happen here in the last 3 months that is rare that happens in any government unit and that's the tenaciousness of mayus and his leadership and persistence and rapidly um coming to the crisis that we had after Hurricane day and coming up with a tune restoration program in which he absolutely spearheaded and marshaled it all the way through success and I urge everyone to get out there and see what he did because it's just amazing 400 dump trucks a day coming in from Orlando with total precision and let me say Kyle did a lot to be able to help get all of the permitting together and Mr Mary you deserve an enormous credit because you singlehandedly did as I watched it and I just think that everybody in this community really got to be proud of what you did and I'm here to say thank you thank you Mr GI I normally I don't respond to Citizen comments but I I will add that um the county responding to multiple request and at the end of the day they they control the cing uh and they they did get it done uh and so um we owe just a world of gratitude to the county also for handing over some of that bad tax to protect our city all right we have uh another citizen who has requested to speak is a JJ squ I get that right yes sir apologize for my out it's about the last second so and I do like to commend the city for the doing restoration we just had a couple questions is concern citizens I'm at 276 Beach um I think that is great job there was tremendous amount of trucks coming in uh we're right on the seaw wall and we the Beach begins and the the the sand is incredible at the same time it's almost too incredible it's it's awfully High unless to the point that residents that have a a f a first floor access to the beach have no view of the beach because the sand is so high now we do have existing cosos and other things there for the Dooms um but with regards to um I consider myself still young but there's off we have also elderly people in our community and to be able to walk out on the beach you have to go up really high most people can't do it and then the drop off is just almost dead down at the beach so I'm concerned for um the safety that the hazards created by creating the Doom so H and we haven't really seen and I might have missed it in an email with regards to what the final plan is but when we talked to the people last week when they completed and we're right at the Morgan Street um beach access they said this is it so we just had concerns we're not sure if they're going to be planting any more vegetation up there um if they're planning on Lev it off but as it is right now um it does seem somewhat interesting as to how residents have access to the beach because it's such a high incline that um most elderly people I think would have enough time getting upstairs let alone being able to walk up to the beach the beach is also um somewhat soft in that point so wherever you put your feet in you're digging in probably a foot or so so we were just kind of hoping that maybe the the city could give us a little bit more idea of what they're planning on doing with the SE graes are they planning on Ling it off um but there is a somewhat of an access problem for residents that are directly on the beach so hopefully that can be addressed and that we can have some sort of vision as to what the final product and if that is the final product then we'll have to deal with it but hopefully they'll level it off somewhat so that other so everyone can have access to the beach thank you Mr I appreciate your your concerns and uh we'll have someone get would any other citizens like to speak please yes hi mayor council members good evening I'm Tammy lenda 97 Harbor Drive um I'm just here for a couple of save the dates um representing both our Community Foundation and the park and rec board um the first thing I'd like to make sure everybody takes note of is the um Foundation is having a holiday food drive the boxes are in the lobby um it started on November 1st and the last pickup to get it out is um November 17th um December 4th is our holiday social and Christmas tree lighting we once again we'll have it catered with heavy apps and sweets and then we'll do the Christmas tree lighting and it's we'll have some nice new Beller Beach loo items for sale for the holidays January 13th is the health and wellness Fair um one slight change with that this year it is only 3 hours long it's from 10:30 to 1:30 instead of from 10: to two and the last thing I'd like to mention is our January 20th Bridge cleanup um the one that we had in October was a little light light and mighty um but there is still a tremendous amount of garbage underneath the bridge from the hurricane so um we are going to bring in hopefully some people from keep's beautiful help to help us clean under the bridge but we're really going to try to get the word out for the January 20th clean up to get all that garbage picked up from underneath the bridge that's all thank you thank you m any other citizens all right citizen comments are now closed so now we're on to item number three this is a presentation from the pelis county sheriff's department uh beginning with law enforcement monthly report from Sergeant Bowman hello Sergeant how are you good thank you good evening mayor vice mayor council members um I'm going to cover the statistics that uh for your city for the month of September this past September you had one theft which is the same as what was the month before in August um just looking at year to date though uh the UCR and property crimes and person crimes are down uh last September we had 23 and we're at 16 for the year currently in September the city had uh seven people arrested here there were actually 10 charges the majority of the charges were traffic related so six out of the 10 were traffic as far as Deputy activity there were 664 events that occurred with 797 deputies responding um looking at them the the top uh the majority of the calls that we responded were directed patrols traffic stops house checks um vehicle illegally parked or abandoned and ordinance violations so that accounted for almost 80% of all the events there was one crash that was documented um for September and there were 192 citations the majority of those were warnings with that being 115 uh 51 were parking and 19 were traffic I was also provided with the annual stats did you want me to go over that as well it was uh October 1st to September 30th looking at the number of offenses uh that occurred the majority for the year the the highest number that you'll see is 22 uh burglary conveyances which could be cars being broken into uh more than likely um and then the rest after that uh that you see double digits is pretty much traffic offenses such as DUIs or driving on a suspended license as far as incidents the majority the higher number of incidents um are information calls so 16 of those were taken by our marine unit um 20 in had some sort of a Narcotics uh background to it whether it be a person um finding narcotics or um it being disposed of and then 18 were ordinance violations as far as the number of arrests for the year uh there were 43 subjects arrested for misdemeanors on 56 charges and that's accounts for 60% of the arrests that occurred um there were 18 on felonies and 11 people arrested on warrant as far as total citations for the year there were 2,26 um of those parking were 551 uh traffic citations were 289 and warnings were 1,333 and then for our crashes um that occurred in the city for the entire year there were a total of nine and almost half of them four of them were at Gulf Boulevard and Causeway Boulevard that concludes the information I have is there any questions Council any questions thank you very much Sergeant I appreciate it thank you have a good night hey now we're on to the code enforcement monthly report is Deputy clapa here tonight Deputy clapa is out of town so I'm they give their report uh so uh one thing noted um we have a pretty typical monthly code report here to about 60 to 70 events um this month uh if you look at the pie chart a little bit more attention was given to the uh front yards and the overgrowth of uh weeds um overgrowth of plants obstructing neighboring properties and clutters so a little bit less than we're used to on the um construction related nuisances so Deputy kapka must be making a impact on on that because we're used to seeing higher um pretty good distribution throughout the city um you as far as you know covering all streets and we still have the same uh two outstanding code cases um that we've had for months now so hoping it to get to a resolution soon uh on the uh construction project getting wrapped up and the uh other structure that needs uh permit from the County Council any questions for Deputy Reef reefer no questions thank you very much all right uh so now we'll move on to item number four a presentation from the penel Sun Coast fire and rescue District evening mayor vice mayor council members and our community Jeffrey Davidson fire chief for pel Sun Coast fire rescue District um he tell you everything that's going on with the fire district as well as the method report for October 2023 for b beach so we just last meeting I told you that we were awarded a female Grant it's called the safer Grant this a staffing for adequate fire emergency responses where it's 100% FEMA funded we were able to hire four additional firefighters um and we just recently completed that so all four new firefighter entes are on board and two of them are filing Marines one is filing with Coast Guard and that's something very special to me because now we have 14 of our Personnel here PR military about 30% of person which is uh pretty exceptional so hiring those for additional firefighters gives um an additional fire suppression unit from the beaches so the unit that we had down south was only two persons although it was built as an engine it can technically can be run as a squad which because it only had two firefighters on it but now it has three firefighters on it every single day so that's improving the fire service we miss service are along the beaches as well we're going to be advertising an RFP for three new fire stations uh the first advertisement should run on Sunday and it's going to be open for 30 days and we received an unsolicited proposal from P3 to build three of our fire stations rebuild them they're all as you know uh 58 years old 53 years old and run is not actually a fire station it's rented space in an office building um so that add run for um be on Sunday be open for 30 days we're also going to be posting for an RFQ for anyone who wants to put in for a design build for Ouran station uh which is going to house our Emergency Operations Center we're also working side by side with the county uh we're trying to incorporate M year f uh this much so that we could U have a peak time rescue for the uh to better to provide a better service to b beach um until the new fire station is built and then it would be full time the plan is to move the fire engine that's in Ino Beach station to the northern in the inck Beast to property is located between 24th and 25th Avenue uh three box from RE border here and when we get the rescue for time that'll be centrally located on Southern Indian Rocks Beach um we met today with the property owners we're looking at we' been talking for only two years now TR to negotiated property with the Church of the Isles which is a great location in in order to provide the best response times here you'll have you know from that property to this building right here is under 2 minute response time which is our goal uh and we're hoping that we have all that finalized and a deal in place by March we have some meetings in in January and everything is is positive and moving forward with that we're also there's a lot going on we're also uh going to the letter St session this year uh for Appropriations uh in order to do care existing Fire Station 27 which was originally built in 1965 it's 58y old fire stage the original station our district actually started uh in here in 1951 as a volunteer of firefighters in 1951 and that was the orasal fire station that we're still operating out of there was some additions need to it um but we need to have a stateof the art facility and we have state representative Kimberly bfield who's sponsoring our request um very positive as everyone's going to go around that requested for $7 million um so good things a lot of good things going on uh October was a slowth forgen responses into b beach which is a good thing we had 12 emergency responses to b beach including two water rescues two fire calls one M vehicle crash and seven calls for Emergency Medical Services I wanted to apologize that we were not able to be at the uh pets and Pa event on October 28th the crews were on their way here unfortunately there was a PR bad motor vehicle crash and there was they three uh adolescent trauma alerts and they were tied up there for quite some time so Russ we would have been here in October we had 592 fire training hours and 107 medical training hours for a combined total of 707 rain training hours for the month of October so we are constantly training our firefighters and paramedics um and last thing I want to wish we want to wish everybody h a blessed and safe Thanksgiving season and remember that the most common cause of residential fires anybody know unattended cooking right unattended cooking so we urge you to um keep a fire extinguish in near the kitchen and don't hesitate to call me morning after you've gotten your family and your loved ones out of the building right thank you thank you thank you like to congratulate you on the extra Personnel that's uh quite an accomplishment so good job there um questions or comments from anyone on the council no thank you Chief right thank you oh I do have one request I've asked for this before you've got a nice report that you're looking at and we're not and that's a lot of numbers for us to try to drink in okay sort of like drinking from a fire hose so um if you recommend it if you could email a copy of that before the meeting and uh that way it'll show up in our agenda and we can uh review it with you absolutely I'll get bet so you have it a few days before your meeting awesome thank you so much no thank you thanks for coming to Bell Beach tonight all right have a good night all right we're on to agenda item number five which is the city attorney's report Mr Mora you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor briefly as you folks are aware as EV by the seat at the end of the of the row here um we did receive a resignation from another council member uh late last month uh we are working on the process for and I imagine we may even be discussing at some point tonight um for member livingstones vacancy um as we speak of vacancies I'd like to take this opportunity to acknowledge as a charter officer um that this is I believe Patty's last meeting with us and it's been a pleasure in my room year here in change um to get to work with such a professional person um and somebody who's so attentive to detail and really cares about the job she's done for you guys and it's going to be regardless of how we move forward a loss for the city I think and and we just thank you Patty for the chance to work with you um otherwise I have nothing else to add but I'm happy to answer any questions you may have Council thank you very much Mr MOA right now we're on to the city manager report Mr reer you have the floor thank you mayor um cover these projects uh we have our Golf Boulevard undergrounding project continuing um waiting for Duke to wire the phase one section and completing Bal design plans and permitting for phase two the storm water Improvement projects uh combined projects are on the agenda tonight to um have the plans and final bid approved uh to go out and advertise on Wednesday November 8th the emergency Shore stabilization project uh is still underway uh most of the sand has been moved into place uh the planting is and restoration of the dunes uh or of the of the uh planting of the dunes I should say the restoration of the access point in Morgan Park is uh still being completed um I will do um communicating more with the county to find out uh the final expectation for the the dunes as far as the slope and uh and compaction of the sand um so we can answer some of the questions that were asked there in cient comments um so far what I do know is that the access points are 44 in wide um through the vegetation and um the idea is to maintain as much grade um on that pathway to prevent the water from um getting to the properties uh the city clerk search uh we I put on the agenda is one of the items um we have a candidate our top qualified candidate uh here tonight for the city council to interview I've included all of the um applications we've we've received for the opening and the RFP for audience Services uh we're drafting that and want to have it released in December and another agenda item tonight is the uh code review Services uh found a uh contract I'd like to get approved to piggy back and I just want to also thank Patty I got to spend a little over a year working whether as uh her City Clerk and uh her knowledge is really um I've learned a lot from her and a lot about this city and she's she's been here a long time and she definitely will be a loss um and I'll miss the dayto day with her but just want to say how much she's appreciated thank you Mr reer do we have any questions or comments for the city manager well okay so so I I do um whenever you contact the County would you ask them right now I I suspect the sand is Fluffy that it's it's light Airy and it's going to nourish a lot of our Beach uh because it's it I I can't see it staying that high so as it starts dropping down it has to go somewhere or it's going to get packed down one way or the other uh if they find out that or they they say that nope at the end it's only going to drop X number of feet at least that's our expectations um do we have a plan in place to uh to do anything um for for the residents and their their act their walkways or is or climbing a big hill the only way out uh I believe the hill will get easier to climb um but from the answer I got from Public Works director was that the intention of the design was to keep to go over the path to go over the Dune as much as possible and then and she provided some other um examples down south okay and the way that excuse me the way that it was explained to me was that anywhere there's a low point in the dune it's going to act as as a funnel if if we have a storm surge that's where the water's going to go uh so you definitely don't want to be right behind it if it's carved out too much um so um I think I think you're you're probably right it's just going to be a settling more than anything and uh uh maybe over time it'll get carved out just from people using it but uh um okay any other questions or comments um when they did that I noticed there was no like vibrating roller to compress that sand so it's like you said fluffy and it's the wind's going to blow it um Feet's going to move it uh one good storm is going to suck it back into the ocean um is there anything coming up to like preserve that uh like a boundary around put putting like a lower boundary around that because I can't see that stand lasting too long or is that just all County engineering I think it's a combination of the county and the state uh I will get an answer on that question because this is the first uh Beach project I've seen where they truck the sand in so I'm not sure what the expectations are but I'll get what was the total cost of that over 20 million right for the for penel County yes yeah yeah and uh and the the goal was to bring the sand in um pack it down as much as they could let grade it off and then put vegetation on it so something would be yeah the only they had was a little low profile Dozer pushing that sand um yeah which wasn't really too much of a compaction in my view council member Banker I've asked for sand for several years now and we got sand it may not in the form of beach nourishment but I can assure you it's going to nourish our beaches anything to prevent flooding storm surge on 100% for but the the what I'm so upset with our County that four or five years ago when I went to him about these Perpetual rights I said look no one's moving on this we need to either go to court and get a court order on the Perpetual rights or a court order that the Army Corps of Engineers is incorrect and they said we're trying to work it out in a meaningful fashion which never never really works out so what we did was we spent an absorbent amount of money to bring sand in from Orlando when they're sing 20 yards off the beach that we could have gotten from the Army Corps of Engineers now my question is if Beach renourishment and the Perpetual rights get signed will the county have the money to do a beach renourishment that if they have to any anyy up their share of their money or are we depleted I can assure you they have the money if they're willing to spend 300 million on a baseball stadium they'll find the money all right well I'm hoping anything else Mr reefer thank you mayor all right now we are on to item number seven which is the city clerk's report Miss Gentry you have the floor thank you um my report is just a standard uh recap of the monthly uh activities and but mayor I would like to say one thing okay go right I can't tell you how much I have enjoyed working with this Council this Council has been the best to work with and I really it makes my daily job unbelievably fulfilling and Kyle is the best city manager I have ever worked for I work for him every day all day all and he is the best so thank you for letting me say that no problem at all um do we have any comments for the city clerk Mr Roberts so when I found out Patty was leaving I had a brief conversation with her as to what she was going to do and the sole reason she told me was to spend more time with her grandchildren which is awesome but when I look through the city Charter I found that that particular reason requires a team notice so you know we can't broken the rules here so that's it Patty as a labor guy you're an outw employe you can leave anytime you're any other comments well um Patty I I can say it's been an absolute pleasure to work with you uh you saved my butt more than one time I would say I don't have enough fingers to count the number of times that you've called me out on a mistake uh but it's you were doing your job and uh and you made this job very very easy um I don't have other clerks to compare you to but uh if I did I I I'm almost certain that I would still say that you are the best you're going to be severely sorely missed and uh please come back and visit us from time to time all right anything else all right now we are on to the consent agenda which is items 8 through 15 apparently Addie wanted to wrap up all of her business before she left uh so everyone just bear with me uh this is for approval of the August 21st 2023 city council work session minutes the August 28th 2023 emergency city council meeting minutes the September 6th 2023 city council meeting and first public budget hearing meeting minutes the September 18th 2023 final public budget hearing me uh minutes the September 18th 2023 city council work session minutes the October 2nd 2023 city council meeting

Frank Banker do I have a second second second by Leslie NATO all in favor I any opposed all right the consent agenda passes thank you so much for your hard work Patty all right so now we are to the second reading and final public hearing items which are items number 16 through 20 I'm going to start out with uh item number 16 this is for consideration of ordinance 23-6 this is the second reading Mr MOA whenever you read these would you read them just a maybe just slightly slower if I must uh happily Mr Mayor this is city of b beach ordinance number 23-6 charart amendment number one an ordinance of the city council of the city of Belair Beach Florida submitting to the city electors a referendum question on the amendment of section 2.02 of the charter to increase the number of permissible consecutive terms for city council members including the mayor from two terms to three terms identifying the issue to appear on said ballot providing for ring providing for the adoption of valid Language by resolution providing for publication in accordance with the law and providing for an effective date this has been a second and final reading of ordinance number 23- 06 by title only Mr Mayor thank you Mr MOA let's go to the citizens for comments would anyone like to comment on ordinance 23-6 all right citizen comments are closed uh before we continue I'm going to need a motion to approve ordinance 23-6 so moved motion is made by Leslie NATO do I have a second second second by Lloyd Roberts Miss Notaro you have the floor um I think we've been over this so many times there's not much we can add to it at this point Council I'll reiterate again I don't believe this is a proper time to be changing our ch this is only we've only had the charter change what two and a half years ago needs to be redressed every five to six years this is like a self-serving these these changes I see as self-serving we're going from two to three terms uh we elect the president no more than two terms the governor no more than two terms I don't think people in Council should be serving more than two terms plus we have that caveat you only have to leave one year and you can run again this is unnecessary any other comments from the council I just want to remind the public that this is a a ballot item and the citizens will vote on it so no matter what's decided during this vote right now it's just to put it on the ballot and allow the citizens to make the decision nicely said vice mayor do anyone else like to comment no all right uh in that case would you please call the role council member Banker no council member Chester yes council member Noto yes council member Roberts I vice mayor Shirley I mayor gatis I so the citizens get to decide the second reading of ordinance 23-6 is approved all right now we are on to item number 17 this is consideration of ordinance 23-7 this is a second reading City attorney MOA yes Mr Mayor city of b beach ordinance number 23-7 for Charter amendment number two an ordinance of the city council of the city of Beller Beach Florida submitting to the city electors a referendum question on the amendment of sections 2.01 2.02 and 2.07 of the charter to reduce the number of at large members on the city council including the mayor from Seven members to five members to specify the timeline for transitioning to five members and to adjust the corresponding voting requirements for official action of a five- member Council identifying the issue to appear on said ballot provided for providing for ruming providing for the adoption of ballot Language by resolution providing for publication in accordance with the law and providing for an effective date this has been a full uh a reading of ordinance 23- 02-07 on second reading by title only thank you Mr MOA it's harder to do it when I slow you down does it does list fast all right let's go to the citizens for comments on uh ordinance 23-7 would anyone like to speak all right seeing as we have no takers uh citizen comments are now closed I'm going to need a motion to approve ordinance 23-7 so moved motion made by council member Noto do I have a second second second by Mr Roberts M Noto you have the floor well as um vice mayor Shirley just said that we're not voting to make this approval we are voting to put it on the ballot to give it to the citizens to make the decision thank you council member NATO would anyone else like to speak yes Mr banker while I'm big on reducing the size of government um mostly Financial wise um again this is not the appropriate time I believe to do it yes this will go on the ballot okay but when I was going around campaigning you wouldn't believe how many people didn't even know there was a council for Bor Beach when I was telling them I was running for Council so again you pump enough wine and cheese in the people mislead them in information you can just about get anything P today so again against these ordinance or these resolutions and these changes to the Charter thank you council member beard with anyone else like to speak on this topic oh yes after ly Roberts thank you we have discussed this a lot I think there's a couple of reasons that come to mind the first re that um Mr Mayor uh checked around other cities and towns similar in size to us and we one of the very few that actually have seven people sitting on either the commission or the council most of all of them had five which makes the most sense couped with the fact that we anticipate there'll be probably less people interested and running for these seats based on some new requirements handed down from the state so we really don't want to be in a situation um where it's difficult to actually find candidates that are interested in order to the seven so it makes a lot of sense thank you Mr Roberts any other comments all right and I would like to Second Mr Robert's thoughts on that um with everything that's going on with the uh the full Financial disclosure it's getting harder and harder to find candidates we were already too big and now we're going to be too big with a city that is not interested in running uh so really it's in our best interest to reduce the council from seven to five and I believe that once this goes to ballot the citizens will agree all right on that note Mr Mayor Mr Roberts I believe this I believe Mr Moore maybe can uh verify this I believe this this state has given us a caveat if the city cannot produce enough people they will come in and give us people or appoint people I'm not totally sure I understand the statement you're making if the city cannot produce enough council members uh or to have enough people to run for the office there that not a provision I believe in it it might not be in the Constitution but it's a statute that the governor can appoint people I want to be cautious as I say this um the governor is certainly the chief um executive and chief administrative officer there he may have some statutory Authority to make appointments I think the the broader point you get is you have to have qualified and rolling electors um to serve there's no there's no statement in absent um volunteers that the um you know Governor will by Fiat or the legislature otherwise um that said there is also the reason I was I was cautious in wanting to understand your question is um there are some indications of the legislature looking at beach communities on peninsulas like this and elsewhere and and opining that there's that the existence of these communities is a redundancy that should be Consolidated and so you're seeing um similar efforts and that's something that on a home rule basis I think local jurisdictions would want to resist um but I I just wanted to make sure I understood your question okay I'm not even gonna touch that one anyone else to say about that I'll just speak up just for a second is that just reiterating why we need to reduce the the number of of people on Council or why we should allow the citizens to make that decision because the last thing I think I want is someone from the at the state level running our local city city and that is uh what we're trying to avoid I agree 100% And if we're not able to successfully Implement our Charter um who knows what could happen uh I I don't even want think about it I want to keep belir Beach the way that it is I want I want to uh keep our city attractive what brought each of you here is what I want belir Beach to to be uh and the way things are going um there are forces against us all the time so this community is near and dear to my heart and I I truly believe that this is the right direction for our city any other comments all right Patty would you please call the role council member bankard no council member Chester yes council member Noto yes council member Roberts I vice mayor Shirley I mayor Godus I and again we're not changing anything we're just merely giving the citizens the right to vote on this topic second reading of ordinance 23-7 is approved by this Council now we are on to item number 18 consideration of ordinance 23-8 this also is the second reading Mr MOA thank you Mr Mayor this is city of Beller Beach ordinance number 23- 08 through amendment number three an ordinance of the city council of the city of Belair Beach Florida submitting to the city electors a referendum question question on the amendment of sections 2.02 2.04 and 5.05 of the charter to increase the term of office for individual council members including the mayor from three years to four years and to amend the regular election schedule to accommodate such terms identifying the issue to appeal and said ballot providing for the adoption of ballot Language by resolution providing for publication in accordance with the law and providing for an effective date this has been a second and final reading of ordinance number 23-8 by title only thank you Mr MOA let's go to the citizens for comments on ordinance 23-8 would anyone like to speak all right citizen comments are now closed uh gonna need a motion to approve Ordinance 23-8 do I have a motion so moved motion made by Lloyd Roberts do I have a second second second by Leslie NATO Mr Roberts you have the floor thank thank you one of the main one of the things we want to try to get done by Council and of course as we've said multiple times it will be wrote it on by the citizens we would like at the end of the day and that's something to talk about in a later amendment to have our voting take place the same time the general election when the president is selected as well as the midterms more people statistically turn out for those votes by far so the fact that we have ours um in odd years doesn't fit into that square peg so that's one of the main reason I think we're trying to get this part it's on it's four years which are even number years three years will'll never achieve that but it's an odd number so it's just a MTH thing thank you Mr Roberts I will add that aligning the elections everyone votes for the president um there are other election where there's very little turnout sometimes in the teens um this is going to be the best way to hear the voice of Belair Beach citizens by aligning with the presidential and midterm elections other council members anyone like to speak yes Mr bankard yeah um I'm finding these things contradictory uh from past comments on the past ordinances were proposed to be passed if it's going to be so hard to find people to run for this Council why would we be increasing the number of years that just doesn't make any sense people want to be getting off sooner the terms wouldn't be who would want to run for three years if it's going to be so you know egregious to uh be a council member so none of this make sense in my view so yes Mr Chester I I can address that I don't I think just serving period regardless of how long is takes a lot of thoughtfulness because there's a very invasive um Financial disclosure that you have to put forth now and I think it's going to be get getting harder to get people to serve and if you can get people to serve I think it would be better to try to get them to serve longer if they're willing to do it so I think that's I think that's the reason behind that in my view thank you Mr Chester Mr Banker I see you over there itching to say something well absolute power absolutely corrupt so the longer you stay in usually get more corrupt in government and that's why we have 535 people in Congress that nobody likes except for our own electors is that uh your final word yes uh would anyone else like to speak yeah I'd like to add that um by aligning with the national elections then we also uh save the city quite a bit of money uh so we're not adding elections and extra work for the clerk um which is a huge benefit to the city and uh the corruption comment is just ridiculous in the city we have no authority to do anything without city manager city manager has all the authority we just advise and help him through the process so this is uh that's just a ridiculous statement I'm sorry thank you vice mayor Shirley any other comments all right Pat would you please call the role council member Banker BR that's four notes broke council member Chester yes council member Notaro yes council member Roberts I vice mayor Shirley I mayor goddess I so once again the citizens will get the opportunity to uh tell us what they would like to have the second reading of ordinance 23-8 is approved now we are on to item number 19 we're getting close to the end of these ordinances this is uh for consideration of ordinance 23-9 again a second reading City attorney MOA you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor city of b beach ordinance number 23-9 Charter amendment number four an ordinance of the city council of the city of B Beach Florida submitting to the city electors a referendum question on the amendment of section 5.05 of the charter to adjust the regular election cycle from March to November contingent on the passage of a separate ballot measure governing the duration of council member terms identifying the issue to appear on said ballot providing for the adoption of battle Language by resolution providing for publication in accordance with the law and providing for an effective date this has been the second and final reading of ordinance number 23-9 by title only thank thank you Mr MOA let's go to the citizens for comments would anyone like to speak on ordinance 23-9 seeing that we have none I will bring it back to the council and close citizen comments before we continue I'm going to need a motion to approve ordinance 23-9 so Mo motion made by Lloyd Roberts do I have a second second second by vice mayor Shirley Mr Roberts you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor um it's basically what I said earlier and a couple of other members expressed as well we want to move it from March to November so that we'll be tied in with the uh general election as well as the midterms I actually was watching television maybe a month or so ago and it was either the city of Tampa or Hillsboro County as we all know when turn on spectum that goes immediately to Bay's 9 typically and they were they were doing the same thing and they discussed items like our vice mayor just brought up how much money it was going to save them by moving to the November election time period And they also gave out the statistics of when they do have dating that takes place on the November elections um the percentage of of people that turned out was like in the high 60s and any other time it was in the teens so pretty dramatic difference thank you Mr Robert would anyone else like to speak yeah uh question um how many Beach communities have their elections in November for uh city council towns does anyone know that because my recollection is most of more and March I'm not sure I can tell you that I've spoken to the elections board and they have uh they've confirmed that we would reduce the cost of our elections well I understand that but I'm just wondering um I don't know any other Beach communities that have the elections in March or you're in luck because whenever we have elections in March we don't vote for any of those communities so that yeah yeah I understand it but what I'm saying is each Community runs their elections in March on the beach so I'm just wondering how many have it in November because I don't know any so Mr Robert there's a pretty easy answer to that we're just smarter than they are or Dumber any other comments no all right let's take it to a vote py would you please call a roll council member Banker no council member Chester yes council member Noto yes council member Roberts hi vice mayor Shirley hi mayor us hi so the second reading of ordinance 23-9 is approved and we will take it to the citizens for a vote all right now we're on to item number 20 consideration of ordinance 23-10 this is also a second reading City attorney Mor you have the floor thank you Mr ma this is ordinance 23- 010 I mean J10 an ordinance of the city council of the city of B Beach Florida amending section 38- 87 of the city's code of ordinances governing the permitting process for special events Associated cost and fees and potential penalties for unpermitted or non-compliant special events providing for the implementation of administrative actions providing for codification providing for severability and providing for an effective date this has been a first reading of ordinance 23-10 by title only was it a first reading I thought sorry um second reading of ordinance 2310 by title only thank you Mr Mayor all right let's go to the citizens for comments any citizen like to speak nope all right citizen comments are now closed before we continue on the second reading of this one I'm going to need a motion from the council anyone like to make a motion so moved vice mayor Shirley second second second by Floyd Roberts vice mayor you have the floor this is something that has been brought up in front of us um I think actually uh City attorney Moore um brought it to our attention that there was a potential problem with the ordinance that needed to be modified and uh so this is the second time we're we're looking at it so there um you know I think I'd defer to Mo if there's attorney Mo if there's anything to add add to it um nothing to add again this is the ordinance and and thank you again for the reminder that we're on second reading this is the ordinance that was the outgrowth of some um um community outreach we receive from an activist organization um having reviewed the ordinance independent of their concerns I I reach similar conclusions about our the history of our um ordinance its language it's its vagaries frankly and and how it aligned with certain constitutional principles this is a robust um ordinance that addresses those concerns and is the product of a collaborative effort between us and that organization um to uh address this issue um I will add uh as a matter of pra pragmatism or practicality this is not an issue that has come up a great deal in the past um the fact that it's not a frequent problem doesn't mean it's a problem not worth addressing um and so we have the ordinance before you as a as an attempt to rectify those issues I guess I was just say and we've talked about it it's been talked about yeah this this began in April uh discussion about this and for various reasons um we're here now but we are here with the revised ordinance to resolve that as much as I hate when um b beach is picked on uh which doesn't happen a a whole lot by outside organizations I actually am glad they did because this organization was civil enough to work through it with us come up with a mutual solution and rather than taking it to a lawsuit they we got it worked out so I'm I'm happy any other comments from the council no all right Patty let's take it to a vote please call the roll council member Banker yes [Laughter] pardon nice job yes yes council member Chester yes council member Noto yes council member Roberts I vice mayor Shirley I mayor gallis I so ordinance 23-10 is approved unanimously okay uh now we are on to the regular agenda and as promised uh by an amended agenda we move right over to item number 30 uh this is a request to the city of Belair Beach from Indian Rocks Beach property owner for a letter of no objection to set piling and construct an 11 by 12 dock extension on the front of the existing dock install a new 13,000 PB capacity Bo lift to the right of the dock and a 1500b capacity personal watercraft lift on the left side adjacent to Belair Beach South Park Park uh this is placed on the agenda by city manager reefer so Mr reefer you have the floor thank you mayor so this request came in uh via email for the ASA city manager through the website and um this is for uh property in Indian Rocks Beach it's address is 300 Harbor Drive Indian Rocks Beach and the owner uh of record is Bert Noir and Mr no has uh asked as part of his variant application uh for the city being the owner of the property which is South Park um at the very Southern edge of b beach where it borders Indian Rocks Beach um to get consent from the city being the property owner um as a requirement for their variance um application each side of the property owner requesting the variance needs to give consent um to the request and the um being that the city is the owner the city council represents the ownership of the property and I put it on the agenda so that it can be considered by city council the uh there is an existing doc on the property at 300 Harbor Drive Indian Rocks Beast um that dock has been there for quite some time closer to the uh early 2000s um I included an aerial image uh from the property of Appraiser's website that shows uh the existing Dock and shows uh where South Park's property line uh extends out into the Waterway and currently the uh existing dock is right up on the uh the South Park property line the projection of the property line and then I requested the the Mr no's um company of choice for the dock construction which was uh spieler uh to present the doc plan the drawing uh showing the uh projection of the Beller Beach property line um with the design that he selected so that you can see um how the dock will encroach into the projection of the property line so those are both attached to this and um I'd like to present this to the council for consideration and I believe the uh property owner uh Mr noera is is here tonight thank you Mr reefer uh now we will go to the citizens for comments would anyone like to speak on this topic no all all right and that includes the property [Music] owner a citizen there Beach so I didn't know please give us your name and your address 300 Harbor Drive Indian Rocks Beach were your neighbors to the South we have we we've recently purchased your name oh my name Bert no Sarah my wife Joe noar uh we recently purchased 300 Harbor Drive uh lived in Indian Rock since 2008 and uh the current dot uh is 24 feet out as the city manager explained but we're wanting to add a boat lift and the water uh is very shallow and so we're trying to get the the dock out far enough to be able to include the boat lift on there so that that's the purpose of the extension and uh as as was explained it encroaches on the property line of the belir we've gotten approval of the Southside owners and you are are North Side owners so we would humbly request your approval you have anything you want to add um just that when we purchased the property um we were not aware of how sharp that uh property line went out into the water and so it is sort of an unusual situation um being that it gets it makes it very narrow for us to try to put any kind of extension on again uh because we were trying to get to deeper water so that we can have a boat LIF your your property angles to our property so that's what causes that that angle in there if that makes sense yes any other comments nope all right thank you so much for speaking would any other citizens like to address the council right citizen comments are now closed uh before we continue this discussion I'm going to need a motion to approve a letter of no objection to build a dock extension that crosses Municipal boundaries and enters Belair Beach public property do I have a motion it's all moved motion made by Leslie NATO do I have a second second second by Mr Roberts Miss NATO you have the floor I think the um the last page in the book of the drawing of where it goes over the B Beach property line it's it's a very minimal extent um inclusion whatever you want to call it um and I think it makes sense to allow him to do this allow them to do this excuse me other comments I I'm concerned because all I'm seeing is a I'm seeing something from the property tax appraiser site that appears a lot different than the doc drawing the draw doc drawing is not necessarily a survey so I don't know that I don't know which one's correct I'm not going to say that the property tax appraiser site is correct either because those lines kind of float a bit so I think before we could even consider it we'd need to see a survey if the if the property tax appraiser site is correct you would really encroach into the Park Waterfront and as a representative representative of the city of b beach I think we need to protect our assets and I would be reluctant to approve something like this with without proper information and I don't think we have the right information here thank you vice mayor do we have other comments yes Mr Roberts I did have a conversation with with Kyle earlier today because I just wanted to verify similar things that Vice me just said so Kyle between those two drawings what what is your take on which one you feel is either more accurate or is accurate ver versus the um basic the the picture from above well Vice Manor Shirley is correct with the property appraisers lines do float a bit they're just overlays um on GIS database so that's not exactly accurate um I did provide uh the design um engineer at at spieler with a plan from the uh first and second Street storm water project um to give them a little bit more accurate uh survey of the property lines um so they use that to give this rendering um it's not you know certified drawing so I I still think it's not completely you know it's not it'd be better to have a survey if if we're looking for exact measurements okay property lines so if I could address the the property the owner real quick does he need to come back up up front Okay uh sure please come back up yes sir so hi again Mr Mrs Mah so um the drawing that you provided to us is that and I think I know the answer already based on the city manager comment is this a um Survey Company provided this or was this a a picture a design a drawing that the engineering firm put together it it came from spieler the engineering firm that would be doing the work okay so what what data and information did they use to provide the location of the property lines and and that type of information was it A current survey or some other source I think the city what the city manager was able to provide them but but I'm I'm sure they had other information I'm not 100% sure what they Ed to okay to come up with the drawing one of the things that I see on it is that there's an easement between our lot and where Beller Beach's lot uh starts so that could be the confusion there I don't know that's an Indian Rocks right away that's gap between the two property lines so that 20 foot easement is is Indian Rocks beaches easement 28th Avenue North right away extends all the way out our property but it's an easement that they would be allowed to our property okay so the the two property lines are identified there and like you expressed earlier they kind of come to a wedge yes eventually out there and hit yeah okay so right now the pretty much the entirety of the existing dock is in the easement area it is okay I think that depends on what you're looking at right so when I'm looking at aial photo corner of their dock goes into South Park correct correct and that was just an overlay Kyle who who put that together that's right off of this right County's website okay I've looked at the pinelis County website as well I also own another property n off speech and those lines are that was my point yeah they're U they're not to be used but unless we have a certified survey it's hard to know what we're really doing because this looks a lot different than what was presented so you know I mean considerably different if we provided you a survey of our property it does it doesn't have your line that goes out in the water but that is just an extension of the property line would that be adequate I believe the doc company is going to need to do provide us a better drawing that they can Ser a survey or can certify it is what I'm think would be what I would I would want to look at I can't speak for anyone else on the council but I would just want to be sure that because we we are giving up our water rights by allowing you to build over them right so I need to make sure I know what what I'm approving thank you vice mayor Mr Banker first uh the reason I didn't vote to amend the agenda keep your last is because when citizens get up on non agenda items they always have to wait for the end of the meeting for Council to comment that said um has letters been sent out to like First Street Second Street Third Street Fourth Street people that use this Doc in this park um notifying them of your request because is this going to infringe on their the site VI um people going to the park because I think the citizens that use this park that live in them areas like any type of a variance request you'd have to notify them yeah there is no dock on that on that Park well yeah but I'm just saying what they're trying to put in there is that going to encroach now the view it would just be that small corner and it wouldn't be like we would have any structure on it the the lift is on the complete opposite side so basically you would have something level with the seaw wall it would where level with where they were standing so that wouldn't so there's not gonna be any encroachment on vision from the people in this park that use the park and and the dock that goes out in that Park no no they'd be able to see the the dock which is level with the SE Mr Chester would you do you have anything you'd like to say yeah the the only thing um there there is looks like a discrepancy between the drawings um it looks like the overhead view it's right on the edge of the existing and on the rendering from spieler you're not quite there um I I will tell you I'm I'm a boat owner I I want to help you but um you know I'm with Frank you want to make sure that the people that use this we don't have something that's going to even though you're going to have a flat thing there if you had a 43 foot boat lifted up you're putting up on a lift you're going to block the view of a lot of people I don't think again saying that that's it's happened to me right the boat lift is on the right side I understand that but you can be on the left side and trying to look out and if there's a huge boat on a lift there well you can't see there is also I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to we generally don't have a lot of back and forth and I don't want to get into this I'm the only one who's not spoken yet so bear with me Council um I do feel their pain however that does not mean that I give them a pass and and I'll tell you why I bought a pie-shaped lot I I bought one of the smallest seaw walls in this community and I thought just like you I'm gonna put a nice big boat out back and it didn't work out so what I had to do was a lot of research on how to go as minimalistic as I possibly could I can tell everyone here the last thing that would ever happen in any Board of adjustments meeting would be to allow a structure to span across into someone else's property anything that you add onto your existing doc that goes out or to the left is going to as far as I can tell from all drawings that you've given us um it's going to come not only it's not only going to encroach it's going to invade into Bor Beach property once that happens now you've created a liability to our city and I know many people could say one way or the other that no that never happen but we've seen all sorts of things happen um our I would never give permission to someone in another Community to do something in our city that are on own City would not do there are variances we we are are we try to work with people uh to a minimum uh so that they're not taking advantage of us uh and in this case I I see no way possible that I could approve this I and I'm very sorry um and and that's that's just where I'm going to stand on this any other questions or comments from the council yes just looking for um the possibility of of amending the request to where their dock extension in fact would not cross into our property instead of having like a rectangular shape it would effectively be a a trapezoid back from my geometry days so it would the left hand side of the dock would now run effectively parallel to the property line and then come over and then and then back down again so you're you're cutting off that triangle if you can Envision that on the left hand side again Mr Roberts if you did that you are zero you are right on our property line correct we don't do that for anyone well the existing dock is already there yes that would that's I we have no idea how that happened right and we weren't involved in that decision but um it did not involve the board of adjustments and never will go in front of the board of adjustments correct so I not our prior my vote is is definitely no on this project Mr may this go in front of the board of adjustments at all or is this it will not it's not seeking relief from this city right the only relief they're seeking from the city of Beller Beach because this is Indian Rocks Beach property is that the Indian Rocks Beach uh process calls for them to get the input on what the neighbor's position on the issue is and in this unique case the city is the neighboring property owner and so that's why this is before you in the first instance so they can fill out the forms being asked of them in the adjacent jurisdiction to say what do the neighbors say normally the neighbor is you know two private property owners here the neighbor happens to be uh a local government and that's why it's before you folks at all but you're not passing judgment on the variance as it relates to the you know modification of the relief the relief request ad here is in tandem with an application in another jurisdiction so um they're not really in a position to do that as they're here tonight can Council direct this to the board of adjustments for their opinion no I mean not really because it's not it's not really a we're not regulating the matter at all it's really more of just a policy decision what what's your position I will also add that um because of my design decision uh I currently am limited to a 26 foot boat all right 242 ft I realize you could say we could buy a different boat down the road but [Music] just any other questions or comments I think spieler could get pretty creative and come up with some other designs too that can help you all I I will I'm gonna go ahead and add one more thing if if this was a resident on the other side of that park there is no way that they would be allowed to do what you're asking for I'm just saying and and we are you saying we're not even allowed to go up to that line in Belair Beach we're not allowed to go up to that line and so I'm I'm I mean I can't do anything about the the existing dock uh but I can certainly stand up and say I don't agree with uh with making it even worse and it looks to me like you're going to cross right over into B P can we take a vote now thank you for your consideration I suggest an amendment if the owners are okay with that based on what I said previously to where it would not cross excuse me cross the line so it would be parallel with the property line now granted it's going to be close I I appreciate the council member's effort to to try to develop some kind of compromise my my concern as your advisor here is you're being asked based on a form that's been submitted or is in the process of being submitted to another jurisdiction without giving any legal advice to the property owner and the other jurisdiction they are coming to you for based on the relief they've sought elsewhere so if they've already I don't know where they are in that process if they've already made that submission to the other community they would have to modify those submissions and it's not just as simple as the mother mayi in that in that instance yeah so I just want to make sure that's clear in the process um you folks can proceed as you wish can I ask a quick question what is our current setbacks on a for a doc I should know this but I don't 12 12 feet 12 feet okay so that's what we need 12 feet right from the from our property line too and I do know that there have been exceptions but um not to the point of zero maybe down to yeah there may be an opportunity to tweak that a little bit but not much is that what I hear you saying my recommendation would be to tear down that Dock and start over are we ready to take a vote on this thank you thank you any other questions or comments all right can we just do this by a uh let's just uh do a Voice vote All In favor of um let's see approval approving the dock plan yeah yeah I'm looking for the best way to okay um this is to approve a letter of no objection to build a dock extension that crosses Municipal boundaries and enters Belair Beach public property all in favor to approve it to approve it any opposed yeah I opposed all right I I'm sorry I'm sorry it's it's just uh too much all right now we are back in the natural order of things which is uh agenda item number 21 in the regular agenda this is for consideration of resolution 20231 11 Mr Mora you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor this is resolution [Music] 2023-24 calling for a special election of the city electors to be held on March 19th 2024 for the purpose of submitting to the city electors a referendum question on an amendment to the Charter of the city of b beach to propose increasing the number of permissible consecutive terms for a city council member from two terms to three authorizing the penal County supervisor supervisor of elections to appoint poll workers authorizing the assignment of polling place and establishing an effective date um I I do want to take an opportunity to speak here mayor if I may um this has been a first reading of resolution 2023 by-1 by title only first and final reading the diff what we've done already you've already called for the election the ordinance contemplated that the ballot language would be done by resolution corre and so what this does is specifically identify what the ballot language will be for that measure the ordinance contains all the other detail but when you submit a ballot question you have to provide the language you have to provide the title um which is limited to a certain number of words and also the ballot language which is limited to a certain number of words by Statute to the supervisor of election so for clarity and with with this um resolution the title is Charter amendment number one referendum increasing limit on consecutive terms the question that will be submitted should you approve this resolution in its current form is shall the city amend the charter to prohibit council members including the mayor from serving more than three consecutive terms as opposed to the existing limitation prohibiting a council member from serving more than two consecutive terms yes to amend the charter provision no to retain the existing Charter provision and that's what's being proposed here everything else is the standard exori on the day of the election and all that stuff but that's really that section one is the meat of this and you'll see that with with each of these resolutions thank you Mr Mora let's go to the citizens for comments on resolution 2023-the resolution 2023-the Shirley Miss Naro you have the floor well as um attorney MOA just said this was simply putting the specific language out there we've already approved the underlying issue so I think this is just sort of a technicality if you will if absolutely any other comments or questions all right

resolution 2023-24 all right now we are on to item number 22 consideration of resolution you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor this is city of Beller Beach resolution number 2023-24 calling for a

charter of the city of Belair Beach to propose reducing the number of council members on the city council from Seven members to five members authorizing the pelis County Supervisor of Elections to to

existing three-year term beginning with the officials elected in 2024 and amend the regular election cycle to accommodate the longer election terms I want to be clear here just so that there's no misunderstanding because the issues have been um I would say combined in some of the discourse when we're talking about amending the election cycle here we're not talking about moving to November we're talking about adjusting the terms of office to account for these new longer terms and when will the when will that phase in and phase out based on the various seats on the council that's what that language is referring to thank you Mr MOA let's go to the citizens for comments seeing that we have none citizen comments are now closed I'm going to need a motion to approve resolution 2023 d113

resolution deing El um this is City of Bell Beach resolution number 2023-24 calling for a special election of the city electors to be held on March 19th 2024 for the purpose of submitting to the city electors a referendum question on an amendment to the Charter of the city of b beach to propose adjusting the city's regular election cycle from March to November in general alignment with the federal election cycle contingent on the passage of a separate ballot measure con cons governing the duration of the council member terms authorizing the pelis County Supervisor of Elections to appoint poll workers authorizing the assignment of polling place and establishing an effective date this has been a first and final reading of resolution number 20234 by title only this contemplates a a charter Amendment uh proposed Charter Amendment with the title Charter amendment number four conditionally aligning local election cycle with federal election cycle in November the question being posed if a majority of the city's electors approve an amendment extending council member terms to four years that was number three um shall the city also amend the charter to provide that its regular local elections for Council Members shall be held in November in general alignment with federal election Cycles as opposed to the existing requirement that regular local elections occur in March yes to amend the charter provision no to retain the existing Charter provision for clarity um for your purposes and for the public should this be reviewed later f Amendment number four can only pass if number three passes um if number three fails and four somehow passes it will not become effective um this was that's why the language in the title is very specifically says conditionally I know we've sort of referred to these as as as sort of housekeeping or administrative or technical ballot language and ballot titles are are very critical when you're putting things to the electorate a lot of care was put into making sure we're capturing what's being done here so that's why it reads the way it reads thank you Mr MOA for explaining that let's go to the citizens for comments all right citizen comments are closed going to need a motion to approve resolution 2023 D14 some Move Motion made by Leslie NATO do I have a second second second by Lloyd Roberts Mr Naro you have the floor nothing to add any other comments no all right Patty would you please call the roll council member Banker he council member Chester yes council member Noto yes council member Robert I vice mayor Shirley I mayor GIS I resolution 2023-24 to one all right now we are on to item number 25 this is consideration of resolution 2023-24 d17 a resolution of the city council of the City of Bell Beach Florida calling for a general election to be held on March 19 2024 for the purpose of electing three city council members for a full term of office and a fourth seat for the remaining tenure of a recently vacated council member position to establish the qualifying date in process for person seeking elective office for the 2024 municipal election authorizing the city manager to enter into an agreement with the supervisor of elections establishing a polling place for the March 2024 election authorizing the pelis county supervis Z of election to verify candidate petition cards and facilitate the election process and establishing an effective date this has been the first and final reading of resolution 20237 by title only um Council you saw a version of this resolution almost identical last month and it was approved this resolution is intended to supersede that one for because during that during the adoption process it occurred to me that there wasn't Clarity on what would happen because there are four vacancies and one of them is for less time than the other three and there was not Clarity on what would happen if you had less than five people run um and so what this resolution does is specifically address that situation uh what it the way it addresses it is first it retains the language from the previous um this is all set forth in section four of the resolution on pages two and three of four for this or page 93 and 94 of the PDF materials but what it says is in the event of an election where five or more people qualify the top three people get the full term fourth place gets the shorten term for the and this is for the remainder of Mr Z's seat um M member Livingstone you may recall filled member gun seat so that term is already up um that's not an issue in this election this is for the seat vacated by Mr Z and now occupied by Mr Chester um and so that's how that will work fourth place gets the short- term if four people qualify I tried to harmonize uh the the guidance given by this Council and provide that when they qualify they have the opportunity to volunteer to fill the shortened term the first person to do so will get the shortened term and that's how that will work absent a volunteer if they all say listen I just I'm I'm applying and I'd rather I just want to get in and I I don't want to sign up for the short term the way this will work is that pursuant to your Charter and general election principles each member will have been deemed to have voted for thems resulting in a four-way tie your Charter contemplates any tie will be resolved by drawing of lots and so we will have a drawing of lots to determine who would get the shorten term of those four qualifying members I looked at it a few ways but this is the way that I think is most consistent with the language in your Charter and otherwise um absent of direct volunteer saying I I do want to be that one uh and then finally if there are three or fewer um people who qualify those people will have been deemed to vote for themselves they will fill the the full terms any remaining vacancies let's say one person runs or three people run any remaining vacancies will be filled in the manner that you already fill vacancies which would be by this commission after the election so once those two people let's say three people qualify and that fourth seat remains empty once those three people are sworn in this Council will then seek applicants to fill that position and fill whatever vacancies remain perfect so it's the the whole Choose Your Own Adventure of it is set out here so that there's no confusion for the public and for this Council on how the seats will be filled going forward uh just as candidly an oversight as I as I wrote it in something that I think especially given where your community is right now that warrants detail Mr MOA um thank you for explaining that to us let's uh let's go to the council for comments I'm sorry let's go to the citizens for comments nope okay oh we already did a motion didn't we we've done so many of these sorry I got caught up in the moment thinking how many nights you kept me from being awake because you were up all night figuring this out all right so we went to the citizens for comments no one wanted to speak so citizen comments are now closed uh I'm going to need a motion to approve resolution Mark oh Frank Frank all right Mr Roberts you have the floor yes I think Mr Mo did a job of explaining that and it sounds to me like all verses and combinations and permutations are covered um I think it's great thank you Mr Roberts any other comments no read this all right again I would like to thank you for uh well he's not listening cross talk hey hey hey you don't make me split you I'm sorry just trying to make the meeting go smooth no I was about to sing your Praises but never mind all right uh Patty would you please call the rooll council member Banker yes council member Chester yes council member notara yes council member Robert I vice mayor Shirley hi mayor Gus I so resolution 2023-the number 26 this is for consideration of resolution 2023 D16 uh City attorney MOA you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor this is resolution 20236 a resolution of the city council the city of B Beach Florida providing for an increase in solid waste collection and Disposal rates and establishing an effective date this has been a first and final reading of resolution 20236 by title only Mr Mayor thank you Mr Moore let's go to Citizens for comments all right the floor is closed I'm going to need a motion to approve resolution 2023 D16 do I have a motion move is that you yes all right Mr Roberts uh do I have a second yes I second second by Mark Chester Mr Roberts you have the floor yeah I think um you obiously discussed this we put it out the bed um we put the monies in in our budget so I think uh this is the next step to make that happen by the way gave um R Pro I think has already done a pretty nice job out there I thought one of the things which seems like a minor change but I appreciate it when they come down the street they come down my street one time which also helps to protect the asphalt roads because the garbage trucks are one of the heavier pieces of equipment that drives down the roads and can mess with the asphalt over time uh the previous Group which did a great job they came down one side went down and turned around somewhere and came back to the other side the current group is coming down one time and crossing the street and picking up the carpage which makes a lot of sense to me in my neighborhood they have to do that they have to this one time or two times two times they have to go by twice because they have to turn around oh anyway Waste Management used to do that too when they first started do which one Waste Management used to come down and collect it one on both sides of the street and then they found out it was easier to do the one side and then flip around the other side okay yeah which is less um less tearing of the roads if they can we can reduce that so effectively he's cutting it in half on my street so just a good thing okay well they uh they took my garbage off today for the first time and Hey whenever I pulled the can in it was empty so looks like they got it right that's good all right any other questions or comments well Lloyd you must have your wife must take the trash out because the best thing is that the recycling has wheels instead of having to toad it out recycling now has wheels that's the best thing does everyone like that big container unless unless like I think you're habitual alcoholic and thr bottles I mean who's filling up a container that size in one week that's a little judgy isn't it you know occasionally we would we would run into overflow with our existing one yeah and then right before this happen happens our 19-year-old son moves out and now we put nothing in there I f up my container from and take it down in the uh recycling but that big container takes up space in the garage council member nario you had a comment yes um I noticed that the first where ass Clause makes reference to the waste management contract and no we're in here does it reference Waste Pro believe that was amended in the final form that was in the packet that went out that was caught earlier today and amended um we are we are aware of that and have amended it it's not in the materials you have that were circulated on Friday but it was caught and addressed today thank you for that put ass catch any other comments all right since we're uh uh I think on this one we're still GNA call roll Pat council member B yes council member Chester yes council member Notaro yes council member Robert I and if I missed vice mayor Shirley hi mayor gavis hi so resolution on to item number 27 and believe it or not it's not a resolution uh this is for consideration of the first addendum to employment agreement for the services of Kyle reefer as city manager of the city of Belair Beach this was placed on the agenda by City attorney MOA Mr MOA sure uh thank you Mr Mayor during a recent Workshop um I I believe it was the September meeting uh there was some discussion about member uh reer leave a cruel and the way that it works based on his incredible Devotion to this community uh and and seeming inability to get to just take some time away absence does make the heart gr fer however um with that he has he's acred more time than the Personnel manual contemplates that he should be able to do and this is directly um a function of him being a past employee before becoming city manager and the ACR that we've made vision for in his contract when he was hired and so what I've after listening to your discussion and this is again for your consideration you don't have to accept this if you if this isn't a proposal you like I tried to take your language or your discussion and turn it into something you can act upon um so what I what I've proposed here for your consideration is an amendment to his an to his agreement um there's a this is a two-page document found on pages 98 and 99 of the PDF if you're working digitally and at the bottom of the first page it's adding language to his um employment agreement governing leave that says notwithstanding any provision in the city's Personnel policies to the contrary the manager May at any time between November and December of each year surrender and receive the full cash value of any leave time accured in excess of the 40 days he is otherwise permitted to accumulate and this was the the the way this proposal would work is as it states in November December he could cash out if he's over budget in terms of his leave this I I've written it this way to balance the equities of him not being deprived of the value of the benefit that he's acred while also preserving as this Council made very clear the desire to encourage him to use that time and so it's not you can't use your leave time some places people use their leave time as a piggy bank at the end of the year and say okay I'm going to sell off 25 hours or 40 hours um this year because I I need that money or for whatever reason um this encourages him this allows him to only cash out any excess and then he's left back at 40 and then again it holds the policy that he um that he used the time that's accured up to his limit the other part of this that you avoid is and I've seen this in other communities where you don't where you fail to address this is when an applo Le say oh my gosh I had 85 hours nobody was really tracking it except me because I'm the chief administrator I need to be paid out on this and then we take some larger Financial hit at a later date that we weren't anticipating so that's why this is structured this way it's a proposal of course if um I have just of course I've discussed this with Mr reefer it's my though he can speak for himself it's my understanding he's amenable to this otherwise I doubt it would have found its way into the materials uh but with that in mind that's the proposal for your consideration thank you Mr MOA would any citizens like to comment on this topic all right citizen comments are now closed do I have a motion to approve this addendum so moved motion made by vice mayor Shirley do I have a second second second by Lloyd Roberts vice mayor Shirley you have the floor um I think this memorializes what we talked about in that work session and uh again uh to Kyle I encourage you to take time off there's nothing more important than spending time with your family and getting some RNR so um although I'm in support of this policy I still think you need to take a vacation I second that any other comments are you happy with this Mr city manager yes I approved this okay anyone else Mr Robert so just a snapshot where are you now with respect to um days I'm at about 46 46 days yeah okay on the annual annivers the anniversary of being official I'll get another 15 so it'll put me at 60 is that before this year ends or after before this year end anniversary dates in November I believe it actually says in nove yeah in November 2023 okay and I have vacation planned um December 29th through January 7th all right that's you're right it's not very long but he's got to come back any other comments nope all right um can we do this with just a Voice vote that's fine all right all in favor I I I any opposed all right the addendum passage use some of that extra money while you're on vacation right okay uh so now we are up to item number 28 this is for author this is to authorize the city manager to begin negotiations with uh candidate for the city clerk position uh city manager reefer thank you mayor uh just for some background um after p uh sorry city clerk uh Gentry uh made an announcement of her retirement date uh we agreed to uh advertise the the opening and we got that out on our webs site and message board on October 4th and uh city clerk Gentry also emailed the vacant position uh to the pels County Municipal clerks Association and the uh Florida Association for City Clerks um so that it was posted on their websites as well and during that open period we received four applications and I went through uh the four applications which I included um as part of this as an attachment to this item and um I I reviewed the education the employment history specifically uh city clerk experience but also um experience with municipal government um and uh just the time in position um positions Health in their employment history and I found that one candidate uh stood out above the others um that is uh Miss Sharon Renee Rose um I set up a zoom interview she currently lives in the state of Kansas um so we inter interviewed her via zoom and um talked for just under an hour and uh the city clerk Gentry was also part of that interview and we were both very impressed um with how she answered her interview questions um and at that point I'd like to that's why I got on the agenda to recommend it to city council uh for you to meet her she's here tonight I'd like to say that I reached out um to her on the following week and um asked if it was possible for her to attend this meeting and uh with the understanding that you know it's it's coming up quickly and we'd understand she couldn't and she got back within two hours um and had it all worked out so she's here tonight um Mr Rose um please come to the podium and uh like you to meet her good evening mayor and Council good evening I'm just here to introduce myself um I have 18 years of Municipal experience uh with the last five being at the city clerk's position of the city of Garder uh during that time that I have worked with the city of Garder we have grown exponentially I believe when I first first started my position in public works we had around 10,000 uh citizens we are now approaching 25,000 and will become a city of the first class in the next year uh through that time I've I've worked with the finance department I worked there for two years and then I was promoted up to the city clerk position like I said about five years ago Council would you like to ask any questions yes right ahead hi thank you first of making the trip down here uh we really really appreciate that so what did you prefer we call you during this process I go by Renee Renee okay perfect Rene so looking over your application res experience it's impeccable it's right on target who looking for so um what did you say what you like most about living Kansas I've lived there all of my life um I can tell you one thing I dislike are the Midwest Winters so Midwest Midwest Winters okay I'm not a fan of the Midwest Winters uh my fiance and I have spoken for many years about trying to move further south uh wanting to live near water wanting to live near a beach he actually came down earlier this uh summer I think he took his job in March and so now it's time for me to come join him excellent so you spent much time in Florida around State we've actually come over to the Tampa area quite a bit and enjoy the communities and enjoy the the atmosphere that you have here excellent thank you I have a question I'm just looking at your application you have um listed a residence in Summerfield which is the Okala area yes is that where your fiance lives and you're in plan to move there is that he actually lives there currently but he's planning to move here okay so your intent would be to live in penel County somewhere yes absolutely okay and I agree with what Lori said you're it's nice to see you're well rounded you have a little bit you know because we're a really small City and we don't have a lot of staff so I I you know I I know you're being hired as a clerk but I think your knowledge could be helpful to some of the other departments and that sort of thing so I appreciate you taking the time to come meet with us absolutely Mr Banker I think you're gon to get hired welcome aboard thank I appreciate you coming wonderful and I've driven through Kansas but it's never been a destination for me but uh welcome to Florida thank you Miss NATO um having read through your resume and everything i' very impressed and I think you'd be a wonderful addition to the city of Beller Beach thank you I'm very much looking forward to it I read uh read through your application and your resume and uh uh it's it is definitely impressive you've um you've got a lot of experience with municipal government local government um I will add that uh just out of fairness um that I'm going to bring in another person and let them speak also because uh there was another candidate who did apply and is here tonight um but um at this point I'm leaning in your direction uh based upon uh the feedback that I've received from Patty Gentry and from city manager reefer Mr Roberts so when would you be available to start I would probably be looking at a month I would like to give my current employer as I am a member of leadership at my current city I would like to give them at least three notice and then another week to relocate to Florida perfect so so fin could you rank in order of quality how you think the council members did tonight not going to touch that one I'm not touching that one okay any other questions or comments no thank you very much thank you thank you all right uh asra would you like to come up and introduce yourself and uh and hi my name's asra packles and uh I've been coming here all my life and uh I was here when they first started the walls for the and all the land was empty so I've seen a big changes that have occurred I'm a dentist and I practiced for over 20 years and also an insurance agent uh for many companies and I on the.gov site so but I haven't done any work on any committees like uh she has but uh I'd be willing to start right away and I live a couple of streets down and I'm very interested in this uh in b beach obviously all my life and I've seen it grow and uh with all the roads that were redone by Larry it was it's really an incredible change and I'd be um I'd be very happy to take on the job I know how to run a practice and uh I also consult My Sister's medical practice on a non call basis in California uh at the moment so like I said I'd be able to start right away and uh I'd be interested in what you think thank you very much Miss pacle uh do we have any questions or comments for Miss Pack do we have any information from her I know she recently her resume is in in the agenda okay I see it right there perfect genten council members if we could avoid any sidebar comments please yeah I have a couple question question Miss packles um so you're a dentist by trade why are you are you not did you just close your practice or sell it or you not practicing well my mother uh she took ill and I had to sell my dental practice and I was involved in some core trials for many years and uh I won all my core trials in Illinois and they said that I'd have to work on for like V a veterans if I wanted to get a job working here in Florida they don't have any positions open and uh otherwise work underneath another uh dentist to change my license down here to Florida and uh other than that I've I like I said I consult My Sister's medical practice as a dentist on an on call basis and I sell insurance even on the D site so Health life longterm care fixed annuities Medicare supplements it's a lot of CE so I'm very familiar with the laws that govern different uh structures and people who need financial help and uh I think i''d be very good uh I was also looking at other positions like uh maybe like a um you know that that are close by and this is just down the street it's so perfect I can't even imagine uh other than working a little bit over the bridge so your goal is to be close to home is that what I he and I live here permanently now so it's been very nice in fact across the street from the mayor nice well nice to meet you very nice to meet you and um if there are any other questions i' be yeah you're my neighbor as well yes so would you consider um just doing this or would you keep on selling insurance as well what would you be doing well I'm on the D upsite I'd be probably selling it on the weekends maybe because this is a a big job and Patty's been doing a real lot of work so I'd be willing to probably not do that maybe at all and I definitely my sister wants to retire in her medical practice so this would be a permanent job for me thanks Mr Banker do you have any questions I just as Mr Chester say Patty's like a 20 Patty's overworked underpaid in my opinion I mean she's like a 247 right he's is there more hours in 24 that Kyle puts in I don't know but um I don't think you'd have any free time what I'm saying right that's there wouldn't be any free time to do anything else you know mun code too or pardon me do you know the mun code of the city the ordinances how to load it and how to interpret it no I'd have to talk to Patty on how to do it but I'm very good at the computer I'm on it all day usually and I'm also a freelance writer so I was also thinking of paralal job but that's over 10 hours a day like Mr Moos Miss Noto do you have any questions no I don't all right well I like b beach and I I love the people here and I think it would be a good a good fit we'll see what you say thank you Miss Pack it was very nice to meet you and I know that I I know you already and U and council member Chester does but um since you were here you could at least introduce yourself give us your history thank you thank you okay uh now that we've we have met Miss Rose we've also met Miss pacle um Miss Rose was the candidate that was recommended by city manager reefer uh Mr reefer do you have anything you'd like to add uh just like to reiterate that I was highly impressed with uh her uh experience in government uh the fact that she was working for the city in Kansas for over 19 years and progressed uh from Works Administration uh up to uh finance and then into a deputy clerk position to and then four years as a city clerk um in talking to her um she's very educated has a lot of background I think she could bring uh a lot of her experience into this city and it would be a benefit thank you Mr reefer let's go to the citizens for comments would anyone like to speak oh citizen comments are now closed before we go any further going to need a motion to authorize the city manager to begin the negotiations with Renee Rose if you I'm sorry one just hold that for one second um you are not obligated to vote uh yes um you can vote no and if there's a majority of no then uh the city manager will have to dig deeper uh I just wanted to make that clear so the motion is made by Frank Banker do I have a second second second by Lloyd Roberts Mr Banker do you have the floor I think we've seen both candidates um I think it's pretty clear of a selection I think we should go to a vote you calling the question yeah all right um so this is this is to author the city manager to begin negotiations with Renee Rose all in favor I I I any opposed all right I thank you both very much for applying as well as the other two candidates um Miss Rose I look forward to working with you if it works out and Miss Pack thank you so much for coming tonight and introducing yourself to the council Mr Mayor if I may just for clarity in the record you have authorized the manager to enter into negotiations with the candidate um at a later date would be the formal appointment um establishing the the date um of service salary Etc um so we will appoint at a subsequent meeting um but thank you for your authorization so we can move forward with the negotiations process M Mr Mayor I have question since she'll take at least a month uh from the time I guess she accepts her contract who's going to be filling in for Patty if she's lead even in a couple weeks KY Kyle and Laura and and your U your new administrative assistant too right yes so it'll be myself Laura matalone and Jen Jennifer and uh Patty before she leaves is going to kind of lay everything out that we uh need to get through and I'm confident that we can do it and you really think three or four of you can replace one p really but I think we can stay tell you what and with that in we also move with all deliberate speed on in the process this is if a special meeting is appropriate or necessary we will we will schedule one um if we can come to terms sooner than later um this is not something we'll just sit on until we can WR since you brought that up we don't need a special meeting if the two of them can come to terms correct Council needs to aill it is a charter position the council needs to to fill it you've authorized him to negotiate I would strongly recommend a formal appointment of the position not simply an authorization to negotiate Absolut like when you say you authorize him to negotiate an RFP but then ultimately you bless the RFP I think it would be similar to that the uh resolu or the uh question was to begin negotiations not finalize negotiations um and um the City attorney and I have already discussed a special meeting possibility of special meeting if uh if we can come to terms now the only reason I bring this up is because she wants three weeks notice to her employer plus a week to move in which is agreeable but is it going to be two more is it going to be five weeks that we're talking about six weeks you know what I'm saying until this process is hammered out because she's I'm sure you're not going to give notice until you reach a settlement with this I think you're asking for an unknown variable right now it's it's something that they're going to have to work out and make sure that everybody's on the same page but I can assure you uh as soon as we get the word we will move as quickly as we can and as we as we talk procedure with the understanding you may have um loved ones or or family in the area there would not be a need for the candidate to return um for the purpose of the appointment we can do that in absentia if you will um that won't be a hurdle to the process and I don't want you to worry um ma'am about you know cost some other wise but um as far as that process again we will moove with all speed I've been in communities where we were without a manager and a and a clerk at the same time trust and believe I do not wish to be there or put my team in that position either thank you Mr MOA all right we are moving oh we said how long do you plan on staying now before you head back to Kansas I actually have a plane out tomorrow morning at 6:00 am okay so you have until then pal it don't change thank you thank you all right now we're on to item number 29 this is to authorize the city manager to put uh the storm water project out for bid take it away Mr reer thank you mayor uh so this is uh the combined storm water project just to take it back um this is what we did a capital Improvement Revenue note for in April um we've been working with femini engineering and Sciences specifically Larry fluty PE and uh he's been designing the project to cover the areas uh of the remaining uh bmps of our storm water update that was done in 2016 and uh through uh some work sessions um we've uh come up with the bid documents the uh technical specifications and the finalized plan and uh with city council approval we'd like to advertise this uh to this project to go out to bid on uh November 8th uh Wednesday and I'm going to put that on uh the online bid system demand star which I believe will re reach be far-reaching um as as opposed to the way in the past where we stuck it in the newspaper and on the website I believe we're going to get a lot more um just by the nature of how demand star works it blasts it out and any contractor that does these type of construction projects are going to be notified so I'm confident that we we should get some more bids than we're used to thank you Mr Rafer let's go to Citizens for comments anyone like to speak yes we have a citizen who wants to speak good evening everyone my name is Kim Shaw Elliott I live at 1219 Street I had the opportunity to talk to you guys of some months ago when I was very pleased to support the bond issue for this storm Improvement system um and at that time I'd recommended that uh we take this as an opportunity to really study the needs here and to make sure that we're not rebuilding what we currently have which may or may not be adequate um and that we can really plan for the future in terms of looking at um all the climate changes that we're experiencing and and being safe in in future years so since then we've had a few opportunities for learning uh we've been through our storm season it's not quite finished but uh we did have a hurricane and from the vantage point of my evacuated safe place um I watched as water came up 9th Street I my street uh we did have some damage um I luckily was fine so that was good but um I'm certainly concerned about neighbors and a street is a street that had gone through the current improvements um and did experience some damage to the properties there I also watched as literally one of our former council members kayaked down his street so we we know we're in the face of some extreme weather ahead so with this project which is a wonderful project um I have some questions and one is is how does this differ from what we currently have so that we're not just be rebuilding something that we know isn't sufficient for current uh climate conditions so how does this differ the second question is um if so then what are the improvements what are we doing now under this plan that we don't currently have and the last and most important one is are those changes adequate are we are we properly providing for our futures and thanks very much thank you Michelle um we have another guest here uh who may be interested in coming up to the podium and maybe answering some of those questions well good evening mayor and councel and uh thank you for allowing me to be here and I believe you know the answers uh the questions that she has know we do address uh a lot of those questions and U in the way that we're uh developing this project is to make sure that we're not coming back in five years or eight years that we are building a sustainable project that's being from the use of the uh top Road material the asphalt the uh the storm system the curbs and Nick andure that you know what we put in is going to be in for a a good good lifetime so that's you know that's how we look at each each one of these from a storm water system uh you know the existing coverts are there and we make sure that they drain and they don't bleak and that water goes downhill so we we make sure that we we got that and make it to work uh I guess is anything else you know you might have as sest the project be glad to answer some questions well now you came in for the work session and I really appreciate your cander and everything like that um we talked about Ninth Street and you said you were going to add in another drain and I said said what's that going to do when it fills up so the other drain would carry maybe another 100 gallons of water okay and you admitted without once the water comes above the outlet okay it's not going to drain right so at the end of the day we're going to be getting the same results in a heavy storm that we have now um and I know MWI pumps contacted you yes and the only the only solution here is and we one of our the prayer tonight was for wisdom and I hate seeing our money being spent on something that's not going to work not one person on this Council would surely have a contractor come in and have a problem in their house and the contractor says yes I can repair this but you're going to get the same results okay not one person would spend their own money on this I think you've done a marvelous job in everything you've done but the only way to alleviate this water is to pump it out and I've had council members saying well once it breaches the seaw wall it bre you know it's you're you're done you're inundated with water true but not true okay that last storm there was two to three feet of water in the streets at midnight water never breached the seaw wall till about 8 o'l in the morning then it was too late if the pumps if we had pumps working in there them streets would have been dry when those that would breached the seaw wall meaning you would have gotten water in your driveway I wouldn't have gotten water in my driveway all right we need to put this plan and I want to go forward with the plan we need to put this plan at Bay right now nwa's coming in I'm not saying they're the ones that are going to cause the solution here but this is foolish money being spent at this time because you're going to get the same results as you have right now at the end of the day yeah now I I agree and I've looked over to MWI and I'm familiar with those kind of pumps and have designed those down in South Florida so I'm familiar with the materials and and what they've done and and they're a good outfit for sure the uh the type of uh you know I think one of the others underground Vault or maybe something underground that we could do and I looked at that and how to design that and there's you know the size of it and the volume to make sure that that it would even work we have a lot of utilities underneath the street you know we got Force man we've got water mains and other typ so the underground utilities made a underground Vault other than digging up the road uh very difficult uh to you know to try to fit in there make that work the pump idea we looked at and I think in my discussions with MWI of what you're doing that's that's a feasible solution you know there's you can place one of those in an area where we won't have utility conflicts and then it would operate kind of like a sanitary sewer a LIF station this essentially what we're doing and something like that can can be uh Place uh in the area on 9th Street down at the lowend and and have it pump out north to the creek out to the out to the Bay so that's something we'd looked at and I understand MWI is coming here so I S them information on on Ninth Street be glad to work with them or if they have any questions I'd be glad to answer any questions they might have to give them so much information that they would need to give what they would recommend yeah what I'm saying is City Hall is located right off of nin Street and this this could be the jewel or Diamond of getting showing how we can get rid of flood water okay and we have that opportunity we have that money right now that we could just spend and solve the problem not saying it's going to solve a problem under a cat five okay right but it would probably solve a problem up to a cat three well it to solve the problem as far as uh when you have enough water coming in and can't get out we had a high tide a few weeks ago sir and um it was in all over the driveways in Ninth Street 88th Street 7eventh Street all the way down up to up to 12th Street where we just repaired right it because it just can't get out yeah no that's it it just can't get out so that pump is is is a solution that will work Mr Roberts um a quick question for you and of course I could do the math but approximately what percentage of our overall costs are actually being used for the the road improvements and the gutters as compared to the dollars that are being spent to replace the limited linear feed of pipes on our project well I don't have the exact did you say it's a significant majority yes okay significant majority now Frank you keep referring to this as a waste of money the majority of this project is for Road improvements and gutter improvements there are many many many roads out there that are in dire need of work but the majority of this particular project is in fact the roads and the gutters we live on a Barrier Island the we've said this from the beginning that we don't even need a storm we just need big Lanes big LS in a high time are going to result in flooding every time period under a 70y old plan you are absolutely correct sir right but this is 2023 okay the roads that you're talking about why would you want to repave these roads when you possibly might have to dig them up to put in a system that will work correctly gentl at a time the r right now that you're talking about that need replacing they do have cracks in them but they're crack they're heat cracks from stress okay they're going to crack you can go down E Street there cracks and it just was repaved a few years ago okay you're talking about what's what's the uh binding you're going to be putting down like one inch one and a half inches of it's one inch the one so when you put that in one inch it's going to crack I mean I don't care how much of a tack coat you put down underneath that it's going to crack with the heat so why why don't we do this correctly we're taking a big bond out we have a storm surge tax we pay every month let's do it correctly so what is the definition of correctly get rid of the water as he agreed the pumps will get rid of the water Mr reer you shake your head okay because you don't have problem hold on Mr reefer I'd like to hear your opinion on this well I'd like to bring up that we are um installing a 24 inch uh one-way valve on the Swale system at uh Bayside Park so that is going to be a change that's going to affect um this Elliot Elliot Street um it won't prevent everything because eventually um if you hold the water back it'll go right over the crowd of the road and eventually make it to n9th street but that did contribute because as the water rose up it went right through the 24 inch pipe into the uh drainage retention area and then as that filled it went to that backyard property um that's to the south of it and kind of made its way around um so that is one change and it's a it's a it's a economically feasible change um my concern with the pump system I like the idea and I think that it can take it to a whole new level but I I believe that the cost that we're going to look at to put these pump systems in place is going to be cons considerably more than our average storm water project we do in b beach um and I think our our storm water project that we are doing is significant because it is reinforcing and um refurbishing our our existing system as well as um reshaping the curves we have a lot of issues throughout the city where we have water um holding in the curves a lot of residents do not like that and there's a lot of streets that are in terrible condition so we are taking care of issues in b beach um I I would really like to try that the idea of pumping out the water I think it couldn't solv especially certain areas yours being the extreme ones in the city um but at this point I don't believe that we when we did the uh bond issue we set aside um and did estimations on that type of system um I think that would be something that we'd look at in the future to solve this problem um and I would like to entertain Mi MWI pumps um to see what they have so we can kind of get a a understanding of what kind of cost we'd be looking at Mr reefer um whether you added pumps or not would you still require the same infrastructure to successfully drain water throughout our city yes um our existing infrastructure I it's I think it's a it's a good design um that works most days of the year um but but as their tidal water does come up and we get heavy rains it doesn't always work the water has nowhere to go I think when we uh went through and added the check valve systems they work to an extent um and I think that's a very important problem we did solve is you know staying on top of them maintaining them because when that water was coming up when you have a sunny day there's there's no real reason we should have that right that that last event we had where everything was underwater for a little while um that was high tide and a rain event is that correct yeah it was a increased high tide um we actually got a weather notification that it was going to be a foot higher than normal and then we got all the rain okay so if if if you don't have pumps if pumps are the only thing that you could change Beyond this project then it's something we would look into but um under no circumstances once a check valve closes and you have an extreme rain event are you not going to get flooding is that correct well if you don't have a pump if you don't have a pump you're gonna have okay so even if if Frank got his way and got pumps in we would still be doing this infrastructure project exactly as described is that correct I don't yes because I don't think the design of this project um is any kind of spending money where we don't need to uh take care of issues with the existing infrastructure and like I said we need to redo the Curbing and the pavement as well all these areas are due um per the the index that we've been using over the last four years now and you feel that the uh the extra valve you're it's an extra valve you're putting in it' be an additional valve okay and where is that valve located again it's going to go on the Swale at Bayside Park which is I believe just north of 9007 Harbor okay all right Mr bankard you have the floor well can someone else talk oh sure I'm sorry everybody from him I just want to say Mr fluty thank you for all your hard work don't forget the reason we've hired this firm is because we need an engineer to figure this out none of us up here are Engineers his firm has I know Mr fluty has done nothing but storm management design for years I've known him for many years and does a great job we have a 55 to 60-year-old system that has never been repaired never before has the city put money into infrastructure so we're making up for those shortfalls for all these many years that we've done no work to infrastructure I commend you forever you've done you guys are doing a great job I think pumping water from a street into a swell and moving it from one place to the other is still going to flow to the low end doesn't matter that water flows downhill no matter where you're at we can't change the elevations of these older homes and unless they're knocked down there's no way we we have to manage expectations and that's one thing I think where we're may be falling short we're not conveying to Residents we're not going to fix the problem we're trying to alleviate some of the issues but by no means this def this deferred maintenance does not fix the problem it helps some of it but we're going to continue to have some flooding issues we live on a Barrier Island when tides are high we're going to have issues there's no way we can fix that unless we scrape the whole town and start over that's the only way we can fix it and so you know I commend everything you guys have done this is great I you know I'm so thankful that we're moving forward with all of this and I am in total support of your designs thank you thank you thank you vice mayor Shirley and well spoken um Miss nataro you've not said any anything would you like to add to this I would agree with what um the vice mayor has said um you know we can't we can't stop the rain we can't there's some things we just can't control um and this alleviates a lot of the problems thank you Mark Chester uh I agree I we need to do everything we can it's reasonable but when we moved here we realize what we're moving in to and when we purchased the home that we did we made sure we got something that was as high as we can you know within the parameters of what we have I I plus I like having an a nice smooth street that uh you know and that the water runs out better we also discussed I think it's a good idea to get to people to where we're not blocking the um the drains by putting things out that I mean we're doing that to ourselves so there's there's often times where I mean I we had it with construction on our street where because there's so much debris that the construction brings that it it um inhibits the ability for you know water to drain like it should but I don't think one is exclusive of the other I think I like the idea of moving forward and getting something done thank you Mr Chester I I would like to thank you sir also for being very patient with this Council I know it's a uh it probably takes a lot out of you every time you come here but uh I appreciate uh your perseverance and uh and hanging in there with us and and I think we're almost done with this I just want to add Mr bankard I'm going to give you the last word thank you go right ahead well earlier we were one of the council members said because we're smarter smarter doing it 65 years the same way with the technology we have today that doesn't seem too smart to me I come from the heavy Highway infrastructure business storm order all right this is ridiculous what we're doing all right true okay streets need to be repaved okay but when you have technology in front of you you shouldn't go forward and until you have the other company come in and explain what they can do now as he said you could put a catch Basin in or a vault all right they're very hard to put in in places I agree with you with underground wiring everything like that nin straight to park you could put an underground vault in there all right easily all right and that would really reduce flooding in a bunch of areas all right but this Council who says they're smarter I think will vote to go ahead with something that will not work and you agreed with me sir without getting the pumps to move the water heavy rain storm surge we're going to have the same effect so I don't how know how how we're smarter than the other communities thank you Mr Banker I'm going to close the floor I'm sorry just take 10 seconds just to clear the record U my feelings are hurt from vice mayor saying there's no Engineers I am a professional engineer in the State of Florida and a class a certified contractor so just one that be well now I have to give Frank the last word storm water management yeah civil engineering which does inol storm water and I worked with swift for 20 years as well what storm water management did you do with pumps or or oh can you give me one so I can look it up did it for the whole all of our sites that's Swift Mud own all right gentlemen all right gentlemen that's enough ask it full all right so uh I think what we're going to do just for the record we're going to take this to a roll call vote yeah if everyone's ready we shall begin Patty would you please call the roll council member Banker no council member Chester yes council member Noto yes council member Robert I vice mayor Shirley I mayor Gus I so uh Mr reer you are authorized to proceed it was a 5 to one thank you mayor all right and 30 is already complete so now we are on item number 31 thank you very much sir I appreciate it this is for consideration of approval of a piggyback agreement with Calvin Gordo and Associates for Land Development code revision this was put on the agenda by city manager reefer okay thank you mayor this um this is an agreement uh we discovered as we talked about in the um budget planning process uh we'd like to do a code uh review uh primarily the uh the Land Development code sections of our code with some other sections incorporated as well so um in that process process uh before um what we were planning the budget I've I reached out to some firms to get an idea of um kind of the the costs we would be looking at to do uh such a venture and um we budgeted the uh amount of $330,000 um for code review in our contractual Services of our operating budget and uh so um in the process of trying to uh find a agreement an existing agreement that we could piggy back um I was working with City attorney ashenfelder Randy's sorry City attorney moa's uh colleague and uh he pointed out um that Reading Town of Ron Shores did a uh very similar uh project and they went out to an RFQ and uh It produced um uh Mr Cerna who's a planning director with um Kelvin uh gardano and Associates and they're out of clear water so uh when I looked at the the uh agreement that town of R Shores had in place um I noticed that he has a lot of experience in this area he's local and the nice part about it is is um he has a very good per hourly rate um so um after discussion uh attorney asfeld there we reached out uh Mr CA um and he got the approval uh from his uh Executives to piggyback that contract for our project um so we'd be working at the the 156 per hour rate um I worked um through the agreement and the existing project scope that town of Readington Shores had and um set it up for our purposes and um I included that here my intention is uh if we approve this piggybacking contract to authorize to give a work authorization to Mr Cerna um with this project scope and I've already passed this uh for review and he's agreed that um this is an well put together scope that um it includes um if you read through it it includes you know the task of uh reaching out to the community and finding out um getting input um as far as the uh you know parts of our code that need to be reviewed need to be updated um I've already put together my own list um by base the scope um and the sections the code a lot to do with what I've seen in in the past year um just by reviewing the code and variance process and all that um and then he's going to provide a first deliverable um where he's going to review all the sections of the code and he's going to um give an analysis and write recommendations of how to change the code and why um then prepare a draft strike through which uh we would present to the um to the Planning and Zoning Board which would be the Land Development board um first um where they would give their input at that point um come out with a recommendation to come to city council um where we would provide where he would develop the ordinances that would be necessary for changing the code um in this process mind you with the Senate bill um 250 um which we cannot increase uh make code more restrictive until October October 1 2024 um so with the timeline being we take care of all this um uh discussion and and drafting of the ordinances which he's also included the now necessary um impact economic impact studies that have to go along with it but we get this all uh reviewed in place to um bring these ordinances to reading um once we get to that deadline from the Senate bill so that's kind of the the gist of the whole plan um and again uh this contract or Piggyback in this contract and using this scope um at the qued hourly cost um he has a not to exceed the 23,000 140 based on the hours he feels uh would be necessary to accomplish our project um and I just want to point out that's under our budget because we did um put funding to in our general budget for 30,000 so I think we're looking to stay under it um with a very qualified firm he also included his resume and all his work experience so feel confident about this thank you than you Mr reefer I don't think we have any citizens to comment but I'm going to call anyway would anyone like to comment on this topic um Mr MOA would you like to give any feedback on this topic before we begin debating uh just to add as as uh manager rler alluded to my colleague uh Robin Felder who worked with Mr cernon in other community and is also um very familiar with the procurement processes red this um as far as a code rewrite I do want to be clear um one that we we'd offer to do a version of this um but what you're looking at here are your Land Development regulations and while I can provide you proposed Land Development regulations that are legal um that's very different than looking at them from a planner's perspective and harmonizing those with a with a planning a planner's vision and and a community's vision that's not always a lawyer strong suit in that's in that regard in capturing you know vision and Mission versus yes you can do this uh and so of course I will be reviewing and and working with Mr Cera and manager reer as we navigate this process um as manager reer alluded to with Senate Bill 250 um and it's and its limitation on adopting anything that is more burdensome or restrictive there may be some that are placed into the hopper for adoption at a later date or are we determined do we need to make it this way to accomplish the community's aim um so that's that's my commentary but I'm happy to answer any questions thank you Mr MOA um we need to go to the council uh for a motion do I have a motion to approve uh approve the piggyback agreement that motion was made by Frank Banker do I have a second second second by vice mayor Shirley Mr Banker do you have the floor I think Mr re and Mr Moore has explained it pretty well other comments or questions from the council I would just like to comment that this is is something that's much needed we've always gone to Citizens for review of code and as a result we have uh a lot of issues with our code that um loopholes that probably need to be closed up and um maybe some things that don't um meet what we're trying to achieve and um you know with as it relates to code and bu building code that sort of thing clearly we're not doing a whole lot to change the land use but we're getting a professional involved to help us with the process of cleaning up the code other questions or comments from the council okay I i' yes sir I just love to point out there are some sections of code that have come up to the board of adjustment um variance after variance having to do with pool elevation things like that that would actually be less restrictive but would take care of something that we keep on granting variances for so some things we could take care of sooner rather than later now obviously we're we're in a moratorium right now to where we cannot make anything more restrictive but already some things have cropped up that we want to visit yes so are you going to make sure that these items are brought up and there uh so we have instructions for the future once the moratorium is lifted because obviously we're going to be cleaning up code like crazy for a little while but eventually it'll settle down and then the moratorium will be lifted and we're going to want to go go back but I don't want to feel like we've wasted our money and now we don't know what we're doing again um so what what's the plan for handling that I mean the plan for that is is just um kind of the scope description of the project it's going to be uh as we move through the process um especially first and foremost I mean I have my list I know what are like they have been uh an issue um for the city and in some some areas that we that people are not actually following code because they're just maybe need to be changed are adjusted so that they can be enforced um but I think most important it's it's the very start of it is conducting it says conduct a workshop with the Planning and Zoning Board Andor city council introduce project take input I think I would like to do like an open Forum to the whole Community um so that it is public um but also we hear from every Source possible just see if there's anything we are missing um that we can look at and then moving forward from that um you know that's where the professional the planner comes in and he looks at this these problems and he comes up with by his experience with other communities what what he thinks would work best best for us and then gives recommendations that we that we discuss and work through all right but I don't think any of this would be lost um because we'd be going through the process and we' be we would have um you know these documents and deliverables that we would keep um with the play to to create ordinances JS okay other questions or comments from the council all right well in that case this is kind of a big deal so I'm py I'm going to do a roll call vote on this one because uh um it's always serious stuff whenever we're dealing with our Municipal Code so Patty would you please call the rooll council member Banker yes council member fer yes council member Noto yes council member Robert I vice mayor Shirley I mayor gatis I the motion carries unanimously and Mr reer you are authorized to proceed thank you all right now we are up to item [Music] 32 where's Mike Z when you need him this all right uh this is for consideration of Marina slip weight list policy and Marina license and use agreement city manager please take it away okay so these are um two documents uh the main document is the one we've been discussing um over several work sessions I believe it's coming up on a year if not more um but it is to revise the which is admin policy number 12 which is the Marino slip waiting list policy um you know it was put into place back um originally issued in or the existing version was issued in 2010 and um sort of a lot of things have changed in the city since the original weight list policy was put into place um and it's been brought to our attention but from residents that are on that waiting list um that we we should look it um changing how it works to better uh serve the residents of the community um we've done a lot of uh analysis and uh different members of council have taken it and come up with some ideas and looked at other examples and and we're at the point now where I think we've kind of looked at everything considered what we want uh the marina to be and uh what our goal we're trying to get to is and we've um came up with a policy that will get us to our goal and provide a more fair process to the residents so that um if they get on the list they feel like they can eventually get a boat in the marina um and then along with this document is the agreement the licensing agreement um for an actual slip and our City attorney MOA went through it uh with legal review changed some wording I'm added some wording and the main thing I wanted to change in this was the section 3E which was the late payment charge because the old version was set at a late payment charge of $15 per month and I thought that was extremely low um given what the average slip cost is per month um I worked with the attorney and we agreed that $100 per month is more realistic to try to motivate somebody to not be late with their payment um so that's really the only major major change of that document so um again this is to uh approve the waiting list policy um I did I think I did Issue it before the work session mentioned um between uh that work session and now um if there were any additional comments I haven't heard any additional comments but um I would like to yeah finalize a policy and then work to um put it into effect and um you know we have an existing list uh we have we know all the time the timeline of when each resident got on that list um so I think the fa most Fair Way um to to Institute this new policy would be to reach out to the person who's been on the list who is a resident based on all the ranking we Define in our policy and then go one by one and let them choose which list they want to be on and then establish a new list and then moving forward from there set up the website forms all to be constructed to for this new policy um one other thing um this policy clearly defines that uh nobody in the same um nuclear family or household can have um can have a more than one more than one slip and we um we do have one name that came up there is a uh was once a resident no longer resident but she has two slip agreements in her name um so by our new policy she would have to relinquish one of the slips to uh be following the policy um it was brought to our attention that that we were looking at this instituting this policy and she reached out to me um and went over the history of how she got those two slips um long story short she got her first slip in 2002 it was slip 10 um in 2008 another slip was open um it was not I guess she was told that if she put the slip in her name um that it would allow her to have a cheaper rate but the since 2008 which is slip 17 um it was always for a another Resident well not a resident but a a a boat owner at the time um Mr balanca who's still has a boat in that slip it's just um from that time period on her name has been on both slips it's caused issues for the city because when people look at the records they see that somebody in the city has their name on Two slips so why do they have two slips um but she is adamant in telling me that the only reason that it was in her name is because she had a resident um I guess res established residency and that it would have it got a cheaper rate at the time since then we've raised the fees um when we did the resolution both these slip uh renters pay the non-resident fee to date um she insists that they do not share household and they are not family in anyway she is respectfully requested that um it be considered by Council in this one circumstance to let Mr balanca um sign an agreement for his sub 17 under his name continue the use um with the boat he has in it um and again they both have taking these slips and installed their own lifts um so they've invested um in using the marina for quite some time her over 20 years him over 15 so I would request Council consideration to in this one circumstance put the Mr Ban's name on the agreement for sub 17 with Miss Zimmerman remaining on sub 15 TMI let's go to the citizens for comments before we keep this conversation going would anyone like to speak all right uh say comments are now closed I'm going to need a motion to approve the updated Marina slip weight list policy motion motion made by Frank Banker do I have a second second second by vice mayor Shirley Mr Banker do you have the floor Mr reefer well explained it that's all I have to say all right and I'll explain my comment is that um that's another issue entirely um right now we just need to we need to get the um this motion out of the way for the uh updated Marina slip weight list policy and uh and then we'll see what happens after that any comments Mr Roberts none Mr Mato Mr Chester we have anybody that's habitually late on WE we've had somebody like that and um when I looked at the policy or the agreement I was like well I wouldn't be motivated to pay either um right we he sends cop back up because we you know we do reserve the right to um to cancel or terminate their lease um so we did get it back but I still think it would be better to have something that like someone would not want to pay oh I agree I think I'm for going up exponentially absolutely especially if we have a wait list other comments um I'm okay with the weit list you know I would love to not have to address the marina again um we keep rehashing this I just going through the licensing agreement I'm not maybe I'm overlooking it but we don't require the Boat Owners to have insurance or it's on the form we do okay it just doesn't I guess I didn't see it spelled out in here yeah we we keep track of the expiration date on the current policy it also helps us um make sure the same vessels in the slip but we go through I created an Excel spreadsheet that goes red when they're coming up on their expiration then we get the new copy a lot of them set it up so that the insurance copy automatically notice um does that have pollution coverage on it too do we know I mean I'm just kind of curious like when we're looking is it just I've never seen anything call out we don't have anything on our I don't I'm not seeing it in our agreement what our limits are what our requirements are we they indemnify the city not that I know a whole lot about insurance but I'm just saying I don't know uh attorney MOA have you looked at this and with regards to that that those are my only comments is going making sure we have proper Insurance in place and you know the marina box up to Residential Properties and you know is it necessary NE to have something if there's an oil Spiller fuel Spiller or boat sinks because I'm seeing a lot of boat sinking nearby and I'm really getting sensitive to that I I did review the agreement I I did not specifically look at insurance coverage and writers relative to those issues I note that in the um on the agreement on page two it has language specifically stating that um the lensey shall that no rubbish gear tackle or obstruction shall be placed in or around the slip or any other part of the marina and no trash garbage oil gasline untreated to fluent or other pollutants shall be discharged into the Waters of the marina so we we you know we could recognize that as a breach terminate um where we were we to find somebody in violation of that we reserve the right to terminate for cause or without um as as far as the insurance there is provision on the form for the insurance there is not a um as I'm as I'm reviewing it now there's not a specific um Insurance Quantum or specific coverage um fields for lack of a term writers um that's that's addressed in the agreement no I don't I don't know does it need to be I guess that's a question for you should it be we can certainly do that I mean it does say emergency movement boat and insurance on page five of the agreement it says in the event of emergency I'm trying to find the language um the the leny is solely responsible for liability connected with the boat liy agrees that at all times during the period um they will maintain general liability and prop property damage insurance on the boat accessories and contents in amounts acceptable to the city so it's it's not a stated amount um that is where the languag is it's paragraph 10 um and so we can we can state by policy you know if you come to us and you report to Mr reer I've got my insurance here it is I got $500 of coverage that's not in a Quantum that's except able to the city and he can State you know what the either the me mean median remote is of our of our um other registered boat owners and what what is cons customary if we wish to State it we should we probably should have a minimum if we wish to make a minimum we can set that and then we can EV and this isn't being done by resolution or ordinance that's that's a an administrative policy so if you direct the manager to to amend we can amend in that fashion without the need to have another you know 30 or 40 minute discussion about the Marine no I agree I no I agree I think that would be my biggest uh my only U comment so I Kyle if you can address that then I'm fine with it so my recommendation would be since we have I'm I'm assuming everyone here is in agreement with the weight list policy everybody okay with it um that we go ahead and approve this make the Amendments and then um uh vote to approve the license agreement at a later date I mean we we've got a temporary one and it's just a matter of voting on the updates or the changes if I'm not mistaken though I think attorney moris said we can approve and then Kyle just make that administrative change okay yeah I thought that's what you yeah we don't need this to come back as long as you know in generally speaking the manager had the authority to do this without all of without necessarily another hearing on it but given the commission or council's um stated interest and and extensive discussion on the matter he and I agreed it would be best to bring it before you just say hey here's what I'm going out with since we've talked about it so much but if if you're generally amendable to this he can make those amendments or we can make those amendments without the need to have hearings this isn't an ordinance it's not a resolution it's really administrative policy and legal agreement we don't we wanted your general blessing before we move forward with this if we need to make line edits we can make those without further hearings I there any other comments from the council no let's uh let's let's do a roll call again Patty council member Banker yes council member
