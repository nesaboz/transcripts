    "transcript": "all right everyone good afternoon oh i guess i don't need this everyone says oh yeah perfect i forgot to okay i'd like to call toward the meeting of the park and recreation board of the city of bellevue beach uh wednesday no this isn't meeting us um sorry february 10th at 3 o'clock um so our secretary called off today so kelly's going to be so kind as to take the minutes today do you mind calling um tammy here debra here i know your name i know his name kyle and george welcome back george we missed you well i don't know it's not going to be a long meeting so no i meant how many times i'm trying to get my vaccination it's hard that's something we should organize here yeah it's i am having an attempt for my dad so it's like it's just difficult and you need so much personal information it would be hard to organize but anyway okay so we have a forum so we can move forward with the meeting um first order business day could i please have um approval of agenda make a motion make a motion yes can i make a motion to approve the agenda please yeah yes dad i have a second please second all right so agenda for today has been approved um can i please help someone approve the minutes from the last meeting january 6th i have a motion put dead first second seconded all in favor everyone sorry i'm a little out of it today yes thank you george you should run the meeting today because my head is somewhere else um item number three on the agenda is there any citizen comments for today anyone there was some conversation going around i know there's a pavilion set up for here and i we always thought that a pavilion at the 16th street park and belle isle park would be something that would be nice to put on the agenda for the future so this way the people in those two areas i mean we've got some pocket parks between um what the other one's on 19th right around there and the other one up around 25th but it would be nice for the people in between 13th and 18th to have a park in pavilion and again belle isle has no pocket parks or anything so the largest area for them and just to go there and sit relax and whatever is there a big pardon is there space for it yes the parks are big enough to have a pavilion put in maybe not as big as this one but smaller just to place you know a couple of seats kind of put in the ground pavilion but with a cover over right here on the beach so just an idea for the future well that's something that you'd have to vote on and bring it up and then present it present it to the council and maybe um in the future we're gonna have our budget meetings coming up so when they want to address things to put on the budget that would be something to present to the council or suggest to put it in on the budget for the future and other any other project you might think of that's all you're mark ben mark mark mark sorry now that's a great idea i don't know the exact process of how because i know he's got like four or five projects going right now and i don't know if like there's a list in queue but like it would be a great one to put it in front of you well you know when you do your presentation at a council and that would be good and if you have anybody that lives in those areas that you could contact that would maybe support your your ideas and then the budget would say you know the council would say during the budget meetings that they're going to be having okay we're going to put this on the budget and then every year we'll put a little money aside and then lynn or kyle every once in a while they'll run across a good grant and it may relate to something like that that they can you put the grant toward the park and then if there's something in the budget that we've already started then that money could be used for for those things so how much of it something like that cost definitely wise than 50. um well this is a large one so i don't know yeah we we figured if you get a matching i would have figured what 50 for a large gazebo um for just a shelter i'm thinking like more around 20 to 30. like if you're talking like morgan park right something like that it's not a big one yeah and one of most of the girls if you can get them they're 50 matching so if you've got a grant is half and half so you know if you get the money from the state so half of that money so it wouldn't take that long to put the money aside to do that they take a couple years but you have got to plan for it then they can start looking for the grants that would help pay for that right it would be a great thing to put on the survey once they get everybody used right you can be right and then whatever response you get from a survey would just document what you want to do and that would uh you know the city manager and the council would look at this during their budget budget hearing meetings and say hey we've got some interest from the community the park board has suggested it it's been talked about and see where it goes just an idea is that something that people that live in that street it's about 16th street in bellew 16 is that something that people want i have no idea that's why we need a survey i really don't know anybody that i mean maybe one person i know that lives down that way one or two it seems to me with a really early process really early in the process and um to sign just one street 15th street maybe other streets there are more people that live in that area want something in other areas don't want something and so we have to find that feedback from the community that's why i said survey as opposed to asking people that we know that live on that street because one like we may or may not know people until we get everybody's tent put so it would be good to get it on something where we get more than one yeah and more than one park site yeah out of 13 parks there was another idea i'm sorry i shut down but for the counting fence ends over here if you brought a fence to the corner of city hall with a gate in it and that would keep a lot of dogs or people with walking dogs away from the park and again if you have any affair out here like a small wedding it would keep people from getting into the wedding or mingling or walking through an affair if you had anything here and if any children are playing in the park it would prevent them from running on the causeway boulevard it's just a thought has that ever been discussed in the past there were some minor discussions on it that i had with the other board but i didn't know if it would be like a visual like you know kind of like like right there along the street well be diagonal you know however it would work arch diagonal zigzag just if somebody thought there was any validity to it fine you know you want to prevent people and dogs well you got a lot of walkers that go through here with dogs and there's been a lot of you know occasionally residue left on the on the park but mainly it's for safety for kids if there's any kids or if you've got a wedding out here it keeps people away from the wedding party as well if there's any children playing in here it keeps them from running or guarding out into the causeway i mean if it's an important thing or somebody says forget it well that's another story yeah no it's definitely something to put up here and see how much interest there is okay thank you thank you i appreciate your input okay so agenda item number four so the bellar beach we love our city donation program lynn was able to get me this isn't really anything like bellaire specific but he was able to get me two different forms of documentation on how you form a non-profit in florida so i'm going to do a little bit more research on this and because it's going to be anything we're going to kick off until possibly like may so just does anybody have anything you want to contribute to this um because what then suggested was i talked to maybe the chairperson of the one in bel air because they do a lot of things in bel air similar to what we've talked about and so just maybe a little input on how they did it because just basically we would have to set up a new committee and there would have to be members and you have to file it with the state and there's like a 50 fee to file it and maybe like 150 free to form your non-profit and so there's a number of steps that you have to follow it's not painful by any means it's kind of like setting up an llc for a business but it's just you have to follow it step by step so we um just need to make sure that we want to move forward with this project that we have people it could be us or it could be other people in the community that might be interested in being on this committee they can do different types of things if we do want to move forward i know nora was a big component for this program so i was hoping she'd be here today but they were exposed yesterday so maybe not so is there any anybody any input anybody wants to throw into this program for today all right um agenda item number five okay so last news last monday presented to the city council so our four events that we as a group voted on the preview of january so they i don't want to say they tentatively passed it we only voted on the may 15th jazz in the park like slash picnic but to be covered friendly obviously everybody would be spread apart um the band would be here the jazz band would be set up here like it would be kind of set up like a wedding and everyone would be kind of spread out everywhere so even if they want to sit down on the beach they can still hear the music they just want to be around people so it's they bring all their own food i didn't actually have some input calls from some citizens suggesting that that were at the meeting so they heard the presentation that we don't bother with even providing desserts or beverages because we talked about maybe having like a beverage area where we gave out like bottles individual bottles of water and tea and pop or whatever and then had individually wrapped desserts she was kind of like that's a waste of time money resources everybody can bring their own desserts in their picnic basket they'll bring it in any way they can bring what they like um my only thought was to maybe set up like like a hydration station so it's like someone didn't bring enough water and they started you know like just so they had water if they needed it maybe you like with a little first aid station nothing elaborate like the kid fell and cut their knee we had a band-aid and see the exploring so to not deal with those two at all so i wanted to hear maybe have some conversation around that it made sense to me honestly because like um my first you know like i know you two weren't at the last meeting right so okay so may 15th you voted on because the biggest thing like is that everyone yeah it's a great date it's a great day but is everyone going to be available that day to be here for like the whole time you know we'll have set up and like the event which is going to be three hours and then the tear down we may get some help from like the employees with the tables and the coolers and stuff like that but just like to be here and go okay the coolers go there the tables go there like there'll be a schematic drawn up but it's a lot of crap and it's going to be a lot of work for like a brief period of time but we want to make sure that everybody is one available that day because it's it's kind of like a true commitment like we can't have everybody calling last minute and say i can't come um i'm not available and then there's two of us to run a picnic because that long we met it'll have to be cancelled last minute which means we'll lose a bunch of money and it'll be not good so like that was my first order was i know we set a date and we approved it but i needed like heart commitments from everybody that they could be here that they could work and i don't think anybody should have to work the whole picnic you should be able to come with your families and sit on a blanket and listen to the music but when you shift it out and um and just so everyone can work a little bit and enjoy it but we kind of need all hands on deck to get this done as opposed to like two or three people like working their butts off i i agree and absolutely and i think that we should use our social media to say we're looking for 10 volunteers on may 15 and then sign up sheet bob and joe are from 11 to 1 or whatever break it up into two hour early months or whatever it is and then that way the pressure's off of not just one person like you no i agree and um well so and then like you know deb has a couple things to say and so it's like if you're out and about because obviously we're still trying to figure out a way to get input from residents on what they want and what they don't want and like the city council was honestly more concerned with like not like that he would have no one show up because of copay but they were more concerned with a couple of them with it being bombarded with people that were not citizens and they didn't want to put another sign because they didn't want everyone to drove over so it's kind of like the uh you know opposite of certain other feedback where people are like oh if you we don't have a science we can't advertise it and then someone else will say well i don't want another sign because i don't want to advertise so you have both sides of that you know like i'm thinking if we get a good 30 40 families of all the people that live in bellar beach we're still going to have like a crowded it's still going to look like a party does that make sense if we have two or three families here if it's just us then i consider that a fail like that's you know well as soon as the music starts playing anybody walking the bridge which is a ton of people see that that was city council's like they wanted an id for cookies like id for water which is another reason why i don't want to pass out like you know if someone's dying to thirst i don't care if they live in two books too i'm gonna give them a bottle of water but i understand that we don't want to spend you know a thousand dollars on fancy cupcakes and then give them to everyone that walks into the bridge that may or may not be from here which is another reason why i'm kind of thinking the whole dessert yeah the food thing is fine yeah they get to do the recycling of the bottles and where is that right bring your own food and then bring it back out bring your trash with you yeah so i mean i really um there was two sides of it from them the input was that it was going to be too crowded and they don't want anybody that doesn't live here that doesn't have the sticker on their car and have a bellaring residence on there you know if your brother's visiting from texas then you should bring him what's the input that i gave like if you have like family members in town or whatever but i just wanted to get some discussion as we're doing around that because um i don't know there's one side that says that no one will come because of covid and then another side of it that says we're gonna you know it's gonna be so crowded and we're not gonna be able to maintain it so what what let's see we did a get together last fall out here there was a big concern about parking yes and that was brought up and so it was mentioned that like um you know we're gonna do a postcard mailer and it'll give some details and it'll say if you're able you know if you are trying to park in the parking lot you have to make sure you have your sticker or you have to pay to park or if you live close enough to either walk or ride your bike or you know get dropped off and a lot of people still aren't taking ubers but obviously parking is limited so if you can get here by another way like you know someone on 9th street shouldn't drive over here what number of cars do you consider having to have a partner i remember last fall we had a big plan where they could park and had cones out and parked on this street but not on the street i was trying to think of how many spots are in that lot i'm thinking like between 30 and 40. so anything over that you're gonna have some kind of plan if people are driving and um did you think about are we like shutting the meter down that day and you know is it residents only yeah for the purpose okay yes that was the thought that it's you know residents only have your parking sticker the leaders are you know we shouldn't need the leaders of the speller right you won't need residents yeah it should matter but like you know really shouldn't be able to park in the lot that day if you are if you don't live here and once all the cars are full then good that's enough people anyways yeah i mean so like the parking is what it is there is going to be no parking on the street because that will cause people to scream loudly so nowhere camp street um even if it's for the three hours i i mean the second i proposed to city council my phone started because i put my phone number on the website which you know it's like they keep asking for a way for people to give input and a way for people to get their requests and honestly that was the only thing i could think of with what we have to work with at this point and i honestly don't mind because i like when people give me their input especially if they don't want to come and sit in the meetings and you know and i'll sit and listen and i took notes and it was suggested that we kind of documented even if they don't want to give their names or their address that you know we have this many people but you know immediately just based on a lot of last year's events and issues that came up so i was asked from the city council after we went through so they before events just for you george because i don't know if you can solve this but it's just the the floor that we narrowed it down to was the um the jazz in the park or the picnic and then um a dog parade for halloween dogs and kids you know all of these are family events so when i say dog parade you know like kids are obviously welcome and like everyone can wear costumes and whatever but it's a dog parade in october and then there were two events in december one was the um the one that lynn wanted to have last year which is the holiday social and christmas tree lighting which would be in the beginning of december the other one that was voted on was um the vote parade and so i guess obviously that's come up in the past and there's lots of logistical issues and finding a captain that knows what he's doing to honestly safely get a bunch of drunk people through these narrows in the dark and it's i'm over my skis with that so like i do know a couple of boat captains i don't know if they've ever let a boat parade so i mean i could do some phone calls but like i guess they tried to team up with indian rock's beach on the same day in years past and indian rock stage was like no because of parking you know because i mean if you live on the water great but if you don't live on the water and you want to drive to the park again people are screaming about the parking on the streets and you kind of have to like walk down to the park closest to your street and bring chairs or you know like your friends at the end of the blocks and a lot of people have parties that night so they get you know people in their house and whatever i mean covered aside the one i went to this last year to be box beach was probably 25 people and everybody was outside very spread apart so like it didn't feel unsafe and he knows where we're gonna be december but that's the only one like in theory it sounds like a great idea to me but in my heart i kind of have a few reservations like in regards to safety and knowledge but i'm more than happy to hand over the reins to someone that says oh my gosh i know exactly how this works i know exactly how we do it because i've been in the clearwater one and i've been at the indian rock speechless a couple times and i would just i think a lot of what they're just doing here and praying that people like do what they're supposed to be doing because people jump in that because i know like clearwater beach like you have the the captain has a need you have to fill out all these forms you have to show your insurance you have to do all this stuff and then they have a safety meeting with all boat captains and then they're like this is the route this is the time this is where you start this is the way we go the people just like go jump in their boats and jump right in the middle of the people that officially signed up so you have a mixture of people that know what they're doing and a mixture of you know a bunch of people that don't know what they're doing so um indian rocks beach ends right in front of my house they literally tend to turn around and go back the other way so i don't even know like you know i know it's deep right here but i know you also have to turn around you can't go under um because of the tides and then you would have to go so it would have to be pretty much down on the other end of beller beach um they didn't have to coordinate with any rocks right well they said athena rock said no we don't want it it's like they obviously can't tell us to not have it on same night but they don't want to do it with us right they don't want a coordinated effort which i don't know how you coordinate that anyway we would do it on our side and then you do it on there so i think it the right well and the other thing i thought of was like obviously everybody knows how busy the holidays are you have a ton of things going on and we've already got one event in december i don't know if like we as a committee want to commit to another because that's a full day because you know we talked about judging and prizes and you know that is a that is a huge commitment less than a week before christmas that i really think that we have to think about again in theory like you said it sounds like a great idea i love that but we haven't been dealing for 20 years we don't know like i said i i shouldn't say we i don't know so like if you know someone was like no i know exactly how this is supposed to work i'm willing to hand over the reins that help as much as i can help but you know i for one will admit that i totally overlook myself during christmas like i'll i'll say i'll be listening this help me if i'll crash and burn and then i'll be like i can't go to one more thing i'm done i can't you know whatever so and a lot of people travel for the holidays um even with coped i mean it was so good so i think that one is one that maybe we should i don't know like have a little bit more discussion on i think that because this is our first year as parks and rec with these people that we should take on picnics see how it goes work in the communication i think taking on a boat rate is just too much at that point especially again adding to the holidays we already have the holiday lighting thing that's a lot going on and it it sounds like it's going to be really hard to coordinate this with such a big another big event um let's i think that we should table it until maybe next year just just a thought what if you did a kayak and paddle board i'm sorry kayak and paddle board parade that's cute i mean it's still full parade but it'd be easier you could go underneath under this bridge you don't have to worry about deep water you wouldn't have to worry about a boat captain it's a lot easier to decorate for kayaking there's enough kayakers and boaters out here i mean and paddle boarders yeah it would be cold you know and if the wind picks up you've got safe haven south of 22nd street bridge if the wind comes from the other way that bay that's up north of the 22nd street bridge is usually calm depending on the south wind right so it's an option you know instead of power boats you have yeah canoes canoes row boats paddle boards right that's true i love to kayak and i love to paddleboard but i yeah it's just i didn't kayak once in december january and i have it in february like today i thought about it because the tide was perfect and it was sunny at like two o'clock but like i haven't been in my kayak for months because it's been so cold it's amazing how many people are out there i mean they got their wetsuits on and they're yeah and some of them don't you know they're just they can withstand the cold maybe they're from canada i don't know yeah or they're on vacation and they could be from chicago take place at night right yeah yeah that well i mean so you're just that one would have to be during the day yeah okay couldn't happen at night yeah so it was like five thirty years in december right it was earlier yeah so it would be like your tech more like a daytime event well it's the only way you could really do it i mean you couldn't do it saturday or sunday you know of the interest in the parade of ships or boats is that people will decorate their boat right and then in the evenings you see these decorated boats go by and it's kind of neat well that's the whole drive and yeah so i'm not sure that would work with a kayak rick was one that had contacts with the coast guard it seemed like he had a lot of input on that he just cancel it without having right here to talk with him about it so i i don't know i agree that december is a really rough time here another event yeah that's my whole thing too like if we were to do it um because you can't decorate the kayaks maybe we would do it a different time of year where it is pile on in december just because everybody is so booked and so busy um yeah one time if that becomes a survey i'm getting people i need some questions about what they would legislate i still do the golf cart thing decorate your golf cart i don't know they do that too in irony they don't either but they're cute i like when i see people decorate their golf carts okay so like um i guess i don't think i have to make a motion for this we could just take a bow like for maybe to table it to have more discussion until we get a full group here is that okay with everybody yeah because i would love like because nora was a big component of the um the bow craze i i don't want to cut it out without her input and and steve hasn't been he wasn't here to vote on it last month so he doesn't really have a lot of the details on what the final list was other than reading it so would that be okay with everybody just tablet tablet to next month until we have everybody here so essentially [Music] and then one of the bullet points beneath it it would obviously be the date and the time and that would be bring your own picnic or bring your own beverages whatever code and friendly because everything would have to be individually wrapped it would be a whole different set of so you're thinking about providing food i don't know she said visit iraq no i said if we did provide it it would have been people and julie wrapped it up like it would be our whole year's budget um and you know honestly like i would bring my picnic and i would probably bring my own problem anyway so we might end up with a bunch of leftover stuff and wasted so yeah i would just say like a hydration station and first aid a couple of the things that she mentioned and i sent it on like an excel spreadsheet to kyle because um i don't know they asked for something when somebody didn't have to provide it so i'm still kind of in the middle we'll still have it for us but it's just like you can do it anyway it's a spreadsheet everything that we need how many we need what we think what it actually costs and you know so we have a good idea of our budget so um the entertainment if like you did it here or whatever so for the five piece jazz band for three hours is 625 so it's basically 125 per person for three hours and they do the costumes they sing i saw them in terms of they're really good um they're called jazz bowls p-h-o-l-s so you can go on the internet you can go on youtube you can list you know they have tons of performances on youtube that you can kind of listen to that perform so that's who we're looking at they are available that day um another would be like decor and linens we wouldn't do a ton um like with the jazz theme like just maybe up here by the musicians we continue like you know i've seen like me look at any like jazz in the park or jazz party jazz decorations but like there's a couple of balloons with like music notes or you kind of think mardi gras theme but we would literally keep it just up and around the position so the cost would be minimal on that just so it looked kind of festive and like hey this is where the musicians are um so i know we're going to use tables so we need to get a couple tablecloths so with the water i wouldn't think we would need some ice um we have coolers here piles that make floors that we could use tables that we can use um honestly the bigger costs than even the music from my understanding is the postcards and the postage i mean that's going to be like 6 7 800 bucks is my understanding that sounds right are you sending it to every every resident yeah okay yeah i mean you might be able to cut off some of them based on our uh our email list that we put together you know that we want to do that for everyone yeah that's fine uh yeah we were just thinking we would mail it to everyone and on once i have like the jazz jazz in the park and all the information pertinent to that day and then on the back of it have the coming events like um you know the october dog and kid you know costume parade um you know prizes whatever refreshments whatever we decide to do as that gets closer and then the holiday christmas tree lighting event on december 7th so we they would already have those that they can pencil them in on their calendar and we would only have to do one mailer for the year so that was kind of the thought but whatever we end up putting on there it's a bigger expense than or at least equal to music and then the other thing um are the you know if we do games and wreck activities i sent a picture to kyle like we don't sneaking city of belarus we don't have like back sets or cornhole whatever you call it i did find custom ones they're the same prices like if you kind of bought them that are decent quality and they they're white and they have palm trees on them and they say city of bellar beach and they're really nice and so it would be something that we could you know when we have everybody here we can vote on if we want to order you can get them in five to seven days and then we would just leave them with the city you know for people to use for future you know endeavors or whatever events um so we can talk about literally if we want to do the bags or some other games for kids you know that's just a detail and you know kind of go with depending on what we pick it could cost nothing or like you can go with the back sets two-pack sets or four-minute books so if we can decide if we want to do that right now the people that i've been around well see that's the other thing like if we truly don't think anybody's gonna come then we should just tickle this whole thing until like everybody's had their shots and the numbers look better and it's not because we don't want to do all of this and then cancel it like a week before i think we should just keep it simple band a little decorations mail postcards people show up but that's still that's still a couple of thousands of security is still you know two three thousand dollars i still think that there will be people like did you see the tampa bay today pack i know city of ballet or something super bowl but i'm just saying language i think there will be people i think people especially since you could just put they bring your own blanket and that is your spa like go to your spot and stay there and listen to music security is not required i don't think unless you're selling alcohol i don't think you need the deputy you know paying for a deputy per hour unless you're actually you know selling the alcohol okay you know i i wasn't sure because like at a wedding require a security guard they're not selling up well i guess if you're or you're giving out alcohol because they're letting you know okay so if people bring their own wine you don't have to have security i don't think so we'll check okay but i don't think yeah i was just thinking even if he does nothing but direct people in the parking lot and tell people where to go for 75 or you know i guess it's 75 times three but like um i would feel safer if there was somebody here i think for sure if we don't well we always have a deputy on duty if there was an emergency or anything i mean i think volunteers could do the you know checking the parking yeah and then you get the assistance of the deputy if there was an issue so you don't think anybody would play well like so no games either that because no one's going to play back no one's going to nurse really what i mean you know when you walk in the beach though you guys see people i guess you could welcome you know people bring games if they have them play your own games or you know that way you would be investing into games that may not be used so no organized games yeah yeah okay frisbees whatever their kids like they're going to bring pads yeah i'm totally fine with that um and i think we'll get some feedback from us can we do a survey with the email list about if you'll be will you be attending the picnic in may like well right now they have a hundred times on it so what i was gonna ask for rsvp on the postcard and then the other thing that we talked about is that we could get help from like the city employees not you but you know like the maintenance people setting up the tables and tearing it down doing the garbage dude recycle because that would be a cost too yeah that is lynn's decision so we gotta i haven't had a chance to talk to him about that okay but yeah okay so how about like this is great discussion and i'm glad because it's like i um a couple things that we just not that we didn't think through but like you're always i don't know for my whole life any time you throw a party you're always afraid no one's gonna show up and then ends up packed and you're like yay but like with cope it's a different thing but we're not throwing a party in this room for 200 people we're doing something outside where everybody can be six feet apart with their own family inside their household and sit outside in like nice weather and listen to music and have a picnic and that's really and like maybe you know just you know if you could meet somebody new or whatever in the neighborhood great but you know i don't know how we could be more code friendly than we are with this event well the strawberry festival is still happening things are still happening people are still going to go to those things and i think that's a good indication that there will be people there yeah don't forget all the things discussed with the t-shirts in the sale and the sale i you know what i'm still getting their comment list okay okay sorry i got you so um so the first date in the water the hydration station wouldn't you know be any money really so the other thing is like if we're gonna spend some money on some signage so again like city council was like you know i don't even want to uh some of them i don't want another sign because it's going to attract everybody that drives by then on the other hand how do we let people know when we're spending the money on the mailers so like they're going to get it in their mailbox mailed legally so we're not like you know doing something like we're not supposed to be doing and then you know we'll ask for rsvp's call i'll put my number down i don't know maybe you can ask if you know they can call laura then we can combine it but really rsvp's if we're not providing food or beverages you know what i mean it doesn't really other than just to have an idea of the number there's really nothing that we're providing for because 10 people can come listen to the music or you know 200 unless i'm missing something so and then the other thing is like we would have a table set up so a couple things so at the last metric i don't think you saw them so here's um we thought about maybe selling like t-shirts and tank tops because we don't find a lot of stuff with bell or beach on it so i did find these um what i asked the owner of the shop was because you know he obviously made up this established in 1887 or 97 or whatever he wrote so initially they told me they could fix the date and put 1950 on there but he can't he can't get it in but what he could do is just cut that part out of the decal so it would be more like this so they have some guys like with the jeep and the surfboard you can get rid of the flowers um so this is be more like one would look like um took the date off completely and this would just be like another design so there's a couple with palm trees there's a couple with surfboards and then what i talk to them about is maybe we can discuss the number and we would get them so like say this one i want to say he charged me ten dollars for this one i think he charged me eight dollars for so he's giving us a break on them and i would say we pass the break well whatever we pay this isn't a fundraiser whatever we pay we pass on to the residents because i know a lot of people um this lady in my book club she actually went and had t-shirts made from her whole family that say bella beach and i showed her these and she goes oh my god those are so much cuter than the ones that i had made and she sent me a picture and she's like where did you find those so i think like you know people saw these like you know you see stuff for you know clearwater beach and indian rocks beach everywhere but i like up until i found this guy i didn't really see a lot with bellar beach people were kind of making their own um so he's got like five or six styles so we kind of talked about maybe having him pre-make up like say maybe 30 of them like maybe a small medium large in each color or each design however it's laid out and then we can sell what we have and then if you know we run out or if they need more or different size or a different color then i would have like a sign-up sheet they could fill it out and then they could go have it made it's two miles up the road and he would give it to me for the same price based on our wall if that makes sense and then um so i did like pass out if you were here like the little like the little stickers sorry i just turn your ending rock's feet around um but they do have the bigger ones for your car they say bellar beach and they also have the magnets so they have the stickers and then he did um make up this for me which i thought would be cute because at all the indian rocks festivals they hand these out to people for for free it would be it's kind of like your thank you for coming gift and if they're like 50 cents a piece and there's tons of designs so like they could be palm trees or sunshines or whatever so i asked him for a cost on um [Music] it's just a matter of like you know that would be the one station that set up that day that like someone would have to literally stand there we would have to have change it would be you know obviously no credit cards it would be cash only and we would put that on the invite you know selling t-shirt bella beach t-shirts and stickers and blah blah if you're interested please bring cash so um and then if we spent 300 and then we sold them we obviously would be even and then i would talk to like maybe lynn or kyle or about if like say we had say it was a flop and we only sold 10 t-shirts then the other 20 could go like behind like with the hats and we would sell them eventually as people come in here and get their stickers or whatever i think they can sell them so what do you guys think about that i love it i'm good with that yeah and i would get guys like t-shirts so these are obviously women's tank tops but like you know i would get guys t-shirts so get some masc just like different styles and different sizes hopefully that will go but that one we should just break even on whatever we spend right here and then i think that would be it so we don't i'm i was just trying to wit the band is that going under the pavilion i'm sorry i'm trying to envision the setup is that the band the jazz band is that going to be under the pavilion yeah so like i was going to come up here and ask for someone to give me a tour i was told there was electricity right up under the is there electricity up under here um yeah yeah yeah we got we got electricity here that we can get to yeah so they would be kind of set up under the overhang whatever okay um it'll be right here and then everybody would bring their own uh blanket or chair or whatever like they were just having a picnic on their own in the park we're just providing the music okay and then we probably also set up like you know say if the bands in the middle um like maybe the t-shirts off to one side and hydration station off to the other side so everything us related would be confined into like not a small area but like you know they mean like a more concise area i mean there would be no reason to have you know t-shirts way down there like you know so we would set it up however the layout worked and then you know people would just be spread out all over the place and then um they would you just use that lot and this lot yeah yeah and then no street parking no street park so maybe if you're definitely not doing street parking maybe like signs saying that people are aware the science is a private event it's a private community event or something like that and then what when you say science signs about parking well maybe just something that reinforced the people that show you know when everything's full then people just start deciding to make up parking spots wherever they want right you know so just something out so that it's a little cl it's clear to people that don't park on the street right yeah so did you like when i was driving through bel air they had they had a community like a chili cook-off and some like a cornhole competition so other people are doing that they don't mind touching the bags but they had that last weekend and so it's like literally you're driving past their park down um indian rocks road there was sign after sign after sign it was just like you know two-sided so you saw it it was cardboard with a little stick that they had stuck in the ground is that what you're kind of thinking like the corrugated sides yeah yeah like the corrugated sides so like there was no way you were missing that they were having a chili cacao from the side so yeah we would get signage for um private events for parking um i think we got i want to say 50 totals 52 with the handicap over here okay and then maybe 12 actual parking spots in the you know gravel area over the bayside so i mean you know hopefully families would come together and yeah they would bring in two cars or three cars a family just pile in um but we would put on the invite parking is limited please or go to the community center and get your parking sticker so you're able to park at these beaches oh yeah what is the sixth street yeah should stay on that park at the sixth or twelfth um beach access but you have to have your beach sticker in each party have a face mask to use the bathroom so that's a good point if you're coming into the building i mean make it optional huh make it optional face master optional outside must be worn into the restrooms yes exactly you can't really enforce it because it's outside but to come inside so a lot of people can outside just walk right up to another person and start talking to them the county put out like a new perming process for outdoor gatherings and things like that that you have to get approved say that over time the county they i saw something recently that they did um a permitting process for outdoor events where you have to have a design plan that they approve okay and i think that would apply in this situation so we're going to look at that yeah you're the first person to mention this yeah no they just put it out yeah it's a criteria based on how many people entrances and exits the mass requirements okay i'll look into that yeah i'll send you the email do you remember the number of people i don't um because it would be one of those things like where they're limiting like the number of people to 200 i don't remember a limit i think it's just the you know their requirements will change based on the estimated and it can also change right it could yeah i mean the way things are looking you might be in the same well i think february 12th the governor's something ends february 12th so it's going to be great until he until he extends it because yeah he keeps extending it like right there okay so now this is all good um and we have time um to work on all this what i'm gonna have patty do is i'm gonna have paddy send out a separate email getting everyone's um like you know 100 commitment unless obviously there's an absolute emergency that you cannot attend this day and then we'll definitely ask for volunteers to see if anybody wants to help out just to make sure that we even have enough people to move forward with this because this is like i said it's a lot of work that you know we're either going to do it and put the time into it or you know we if we don't have a group of people that have the time to do it then we're going to have to um post on it until there's a time where we have other people to work on that so i'm going to have paddy send out previous to the next meeting um just getting everyone's feedback individually so it's private like if you can't come you can't come i mean obviously nothing can come and that's totally fine i mean you can't come you can't do it but i would rather go february like 15th or whatever than march 10 or may 10th because then everything's already quoted everything's like ready to go and then you know we're kind of stuck so i'm gonna have her send that out and then hopefully next meeting they wanted i mean there was mention that they wanted the plan for the october and the december event as soon as possible but i'm kind of thinking like i would like to get through there's a lot of things to do if we have to file some nellis county we have to work with signs um and really honestly that's it oh the invitations those are the three things that are going to take some time and support but everything else is easy it's an easy setup um you know we have a table with a tablecloth and some changes t-shirts coolers with some ice it is not a big project it's just the logistics of getting it set up legally and making sure everyone knows about it and how to like save protocol and where to park and where you can't park and don't park on the street because we don't want a million people calling the police that day because we're listening to some music in the park it's supposed to be like a happy thing to bring people together and just even if you can't like sit on your neighbor's blanket whatever you can [Music] if that makes sense so you're with people even though you're not sitting on top so i'll have paddy send up an email and just make sure that we have enough people that are able to work that day to like move forward with the event and then um the budget slash schematic that the city council kind of asks for i'll talk a little more about that and it may not even do so much as a presentation as opposed to just like a handout yeah from what i understood is that the money's been budgeted um so right so that's because the mayor said something about what you submitted your budget will approve it but lyndon already told us that we already have an approved budget and yes and as we vote and choose to do so then after the meeting would say no no the budget's been approved you guys can divvy it out as you want because we don't use it we lose it it's not like it rolls over to next year where we can have a bigger event when coping is over it's probably still the same budget um so i don't know are there any other thoughts on every world i mean good discussion today like we've been proud of some good things but like i would love to get like used everybody's and then just make oh and the sure thing i was thinking do we are we putting together like a like a rain contingency i was gonna have that or if it's like if it rains and it's rained out and no one comes it's just done well if you put a rain date on there like for the following saturday or something like that i don't know whatever it would be and i would obviously have to talk to the the guest to the band but i wanted to bring that up because obviously brings here a lot yeah you can do it yeah see to see the bands available later and then we can well they said most of their gigs are at night so he's like i'm available in the afternoon 12 to 3 almost any day of the week so i don't think like scheduling the band is going to be an issue because they're more you know they do the sunday brunch that i've gone to once a month in tarpon what's the name of that new restaurant yeah i saw that hours yes what do you think i wonder if i was there the same day as you but i thought no i thought they were great but i was really yeah with them i think it was it was they do it once a month and i think it was it was okay i was at the jai anywhere yeah it's called hours yes yeah but yeah that's what he said he was really nice and they have like anywhere from like a three-piece jazz band so like a ten piece with like a female singer and i didn't really think he needed that because i thought the five piece that they had in the restaurant not the end but outside on the deck or whatever they're you know they were on this little area but they still were able like you know they weren't too loud they weren't too you know they didn't interfere with like your lunch your conversation so i thought they were great for like what we were talking about doing so okay so that sounds good um we could do a few more details and i'll have paddy send out that email and we'll scratch like the games and then we'll get like uh what i'll do is i'll i'll do like a mock-up invite from everything that we talked about today and i'll have her shoot it out to each of you because i don't want to call another meeting to do an invite we can do that on email shoot it out to everybody everybody can do their you know suggestions edits whatever until you come up with one that um everybody is good with and it was kind of unclear to me because at the city council meeting like the tentative approval like i'm not spending a dollar on printing until i have an absolute approval that we can go forward and we are good but it kind of sounded like they wanted to approve the budget and see the whatever so i need to maybe get with lynn and kyle and see if that could be something that is emailed or passed out and maybe get some clarity on the fact that we already have the budget to do it and to just i guess it was to ensure them that we know what we're doing like we have a plan we have planned for parking we have a plan for set up a breakdown for garbage um i don't really want to id everybody that walks in here like because it's i just think that that'll be a um but we're not handing out anything unless we decide to do these but we're not going to decide to do these until the shoots we back the price um does anybody have a thought on like a limit i mean i don't know really like i said they usually just hand these out so i think that they can't be very much and he gave me that one so like i don't even know how much you can charge retail but i'm thinking they can't be a whole lot but i thought it would be nice for everybody to walk away with a little cha chi especially if you're not doing anything else really a t-shirt done just see if it's the t-shirt yeah that's not really true what's your what would you would you consider like a good attendance like a what's your estimated successful attendance um household-wise i would say if you want householder people uh total people here i would say if we had 50 to 75 people here i would consider that yeah [Music] no but we don't want it to be crowded i mean we don't want it to be blanket to like it so i don't um i don't know what do you think i think like with the parking if it's like two to three people for a car if it was to be completely at capacity as far as parking and some walking then you're looking at like 100 150 i don't do you remember what the attendance was for the september festival well we think it was around that park but a lot more you know that was different so i think it boosted a little bit but if you consider the parking capacity that cuts the overall amount down maybe 100 at the max with the parking limited to what we have right yeah i don't i mean i know we can't park upstream because there are people screaming but i don't i think that this is a good idea because you're only looking at parking here and not six or 12 street are you counting those the wood that the 6th and 12th check with lynn did he did you run that by him as far as the auxiliary part just wonder with everything going on between the two cities you know event parking so like if we just park so the parking lots aren't allowed to be full no i mean i don't know i guess you know anyone with a pass can park there yeah and you know what it says is like for you know the privilege of using the beach um but i wonder now if if you're using that for event parking just something to think about yeah let's see what his opinion so do you i mean i don't want to like say we have a great turnout and people show up and we have nowhere to put them like i i almost feel like that would put a worse taste in people's mouth but i don't know what do you think it's sorry you said on the thing it says parking is limited get there early for your spa once it's full i'm sorry um that's what's your warning yeah like i will i will i will drive here i will ride my bike like you know it's i'm not going to take a parking space my husband can ride his bike like people that like you know oh i noticed i'm saying like should we like can people bring their dogs on leashes i mean we can't tell people that i mean it's what they do here it's park so i'm thinking like if you bring your dog your dog's gotta be on a leash just like in every other party when you see people who let the dogs loose all the time but like for this event if you're gonna ring your dog it has to be on a leash and i would think that you know i don't know most people would do that yeah it should the county is just the ordinance it should be yeah yeah anywhere so i don't know if we need to put that on the invite and it is summer you know and a lot of people a lot of the snowboards have gone back up north so that eases your mind as far as overcrowding it's not september september a lot of people are here so i don't know you know may not be so many people here these are all these houses are empty this summer um i consider i mean if we filled the parking lot i would be happy yeah because you know obviously we're doing mailers but like no sign and really no survey and no you know it's it's the same 10 people that give the input and it's hard to like make a decision for a whole city on the i mean even just talking to people about it speaking of which like if you guys we have um two events coming up when i'll let kelly talk about it but um the sunsets with the twist the painting on the beach is february 23rd there's a link to sign up on the bellar beach website or you can go to his website and sign up and it's literally says beller beach private party morgan park so you can just sign up there pay and then you have to have your parking passed you know apart and go to the event but that's coming up in a couple of weeks so like i don't we need 12 people minimum to do it and then if there's a rain day or if it gets canceled because we only have eight people then he does it every wednesday and every saturday at indian rocks beach at 21st street so he would just say oh i'm gonna roll it over here there is no bathroom at 21st street so if you're sitting there for three hours he said he's had women absolutely miserable because they're sitting there you know whatever are having you know they drink three bottles of water and they have to go to the bathroom there's nowhere to go and they don't want to jump in because you're not there to swim you're not invading so you're literally sitting in one of his painting chairs with the canvas and your paints and it's a pretty you know it's a pretty professional setup i've seen it a couple times from his class so i think it's great that we can have an important part where there is a bathroom and there's you know parking it's only for bellar beach residents but we've got to get the minimum number of 12 people sign up so and then also kelly's going to talk about something else also on the 23rd during the day from nine to two i'm going to get the big red bus in our parking lot and her goal is minimum 10 people that's about 18 people to donate blood and you will receive a one blood long sleeve t-shirt a ten dollar e gift card plus a wellness checkup including a coven 19 antibody test blood pressure temperature iron count and pulse and cholesterol screening and you could enter to win a 25 acropolis gift card so i have all these posters we're gonna put up um i would like patty to or i don't know who's in charge of that information form but someone i could do it just let me know um promote it that way how do we put those up in those little boxes with the keys always just give them the patty and yeah we'll get them parts and beaches like sure yeah you can make an appointment and by signing up for a time which is going to get kind of hard um because here's the sign-up sheet in my hand you know um but you can also she sent me a link that i forward to patty which will bring you to the website where you can sign up for a time so you could do it that way or um obviously walk into welcome as well i felt like i had so much more to say about this but that's it it's pretty simple it's pretty simple bring your blood yeah does anybody have any questions about that or any even food i mean it's 10 people 12 people and i'm assuming if someone's walking over the bridge and they see big red bugs they're going to win and they want to donate so that's why they're not going to be turned down um or id i'm just being like no no no no no i mean you have to bring your daughter's license anyways but it's not not going to turn you away from belly or bluffs okay and are we i'm okay with that is everybody okay with that like i'll check with the city i don't hear anything wrong with it yeah like i just don't i mean so it's just it is what it is i like i need can i sign up with you today okay because i eat 1 30. thank you because that's the only last appointment time um maybe i'll do it right okay um is there anything else in regards to um the activities or hopefully now it's getting warmed up that we can actually do speech yoga because that really hasn't been happening it's crazy um we literally have people going up and down the beach like cheering us on it's really cute so the only thing that bothers me is smoking on the beach the um walk during the day um you know it's if you didn't know that like miller beach organized it you could just look at a bunch of friends walking the bridge yeah with all the other infrastructures because that's what she yeah vice chairs so next eating time you know we're kind of still shooting around the 10th of the month it's kind of hard when you have the council meeting on monday and then our meeting on wednesday so i'm going to try to stagger them like one week i don't know if you go to the meetings so just always like you'll always kind of know before patty sends she'll send out the date that doesn't work for people then we'll set it up um it's fun saying it yeah i second that george all right i know you're all new basically the three of you i don't know if you're aware of what kyle and lynn and the council had done earlier this year or late last well the 19 and a 20 20. there was a uh grant that was available and it was for the park yes you're aware of it did you ever see the plans um yeah yes i have a copy of it and then this is the one that the city council voted against matching yeah we kind of knocked it down because of funds and uh whatever else happened but you really ought to take a good look at it because of its parking issues i mean there was a lot of other parking places that were going to be put out here on the side of the road and there's one other topic we talked about but it all depends on how much room is between the tennis court and the verizon building what i was thinking and the other park board was thinking is to run a roadway between the parking lot tennis court and the verizon building to access parking back here when you have an event to eliminate all the complaints that were coming from 9th street so you'd chain off the access from ninth which would keep the residents happy over there and then you'll be able to access this parking through our existing lot you might lose two spaces or three but you gain four to five down here with a redesigned parking okay i you know i thought it was a city ordinance that if you had an event like save a man or a birthday party in my house you can call the city in advance and get free of approval to park on the street on this date from this time to this time my neighbor down the street did it like last month for a birthday party i thought that was already a city ordinance that was voted on and allowed for a special circumstance like obviously you can't park on the street all day every day you know right now i thought that it was already an ordinance that you were allowed to do that well there was a lot of pushback from the residents on ninth no no i understand that so i'm surprised that the ordinance isn't being changed because it's like you're allowed to do it on our streets and say hey i'm having a doings and the only thing they're going to say and maybe they won't but you have to remember our streets are narrow so whenever you're having a party just make sure that they're parked on one side of the street and not boat because you'd never get a fire truck or an ambulance down the roadway that's one of the biggest issues we have and it's been discussed at work sessions but we haven't come to a resolution on it yet whether to put signage on the street you know tuesday wednesday thursday or tuesday wednesday friday park on the left and the other days park on this and then alternate you know there's all the time well what do you do you know you've got two people on a block that are having a party that's a lot of cars and that's happened on my block because there's you know you people are in business they're going to have a house party what happens you got 30 cars where are you going to put them right so you know they're parked around the neighborhood and that's fine the police know it but you can't park on both sides because you if you did have an emergency you'd never be able to get an anchor that stopped the streets the yard sales i mean even down on my street you know having that or you know you can't get through okay no it's been i mean like all the maintenance people are you know like if you're getting work done your house the painters the you know tree guys it's like they park on the street and it's obviously they're you know and it's only a couple hours and then they're gonna be gone and again the landscape is the same issue you know on thursday on my street my gosh they are parked on both sides right so and that was another thing we discussed in a work session you know was what are you going to do with the landscapers what are you going to do with the contractor as well we didn't come to any decision that made sense that everybody would agree on to how to handle it so it's still up in here because everybody uses them and you know i mean it's i know i guess they can't say somebody might put um so anyway that was something that was talked about you know if the if the city keeps doing events would that be a weight we had we never got to the point where we called verizon to find out if we could do that but that was one of the issues that come up over the last couple years okay so well you know what honestly if we have a blowout jazz in the park events then that would be a great push to like revisit that you put you know all this stuff you put together you put a case together and if the interest keeps growing then you put pressure on the concept say hey guys you got to help us out here you know we can't keep the community happy unless you do something that's interesting because that was if that grant would have been true it would have been phenomenal yeah the only thing that wasn't in that grant was the access that i talked about and the fence you know you know you want to have activities in the park like you're saying then that fence would keep meandering people away and keep it separate right so it's what it you know if it keeps going and the momentum keeps going that's something to think about yeah because all three of the events that we have planned and passed are right here so like the dog parade where we have it with the kids and the costumes the little you know we would go around here to keep it safe it's not like we're gonna be crossing busy streets um and you know the prizes will be set up right in here so it could be the same setup kind of for all three um other than the christmas tree lighting which is closer to the road so like what you're talking about it makes sense for defense just because we'll have people who are prop up so yeah this year will be a good um you know give us some good examples or good um events to show to say these are actually needed to get some documentation and to show the people that are like upset and like don't want these things that one that doesn't infringe upon their you know liberties to a quiet like lifestyle or whatever that these events can happen and they know about them but if they didn't see it on a postcard they wouldn't know they were happening like there isn't a mess or garbage or you know whatever the other thing with the postcards is the way they sent out the survey they sent the survey to every house um but only you don't get so many replies so i think we're close to 200 over 200 now most of them i think the majority of them all people want to be contacted by email but i guess if if you think about it if they didn't reply to the community survey saying we wanted to be we want to be mailed information i mean is it even worth sending invitations to people who didn't reply to the community survey um i would say yes so yeah yeah okay i was just something to think about because i mean you know so many people there's only there's only a certain amount of people that want to be contacted so i guess you know if they didn't reply to one in community information i don't know just i mean they if they responded back and said no i don't want it i mean i guess we could not mail it to them i mean you're saying yeah if you sent that to a company it was all it was all the properties always forget the numbers oh no it's like it's slower it's like just over i think 1200 as far as actual residents it's the population 1600 populated total population okay so you sent it out to 1200 households and you only heard back from 200. well right now we're yeah we're at about around the corner yeah about 200 so you're suggesting to not send it to the 2017. i was just i was just bringing up the point you know if you sent out a community servant and you know all these people didn't reply or didn't i don't know i'm just as far as budgeting what you want to send out and what's actually effective does it make sense to send it back to people didn't even reply to the community survey i don't know i'm just asking i think any point i think that's a good way to save money like i send a postcard to the house on the corner right here that's been vacant for ever it's a waste of money so i think we should only do the whoever responded to the survey even if it is 250 people they still haven't amazing people do not have their email to send them a survey you mean you mailed this oh yeah the series was mailed out everyone did yeah i didn't get one oh i got one did you reply to the email okay so originally they they put the community survey on the website so anybody who did the survey before they didn't send the mail until after so they weren't going to double yeah that's what i thought you did um i don't know there's so many different ways to just email like you hope it wouldn't go to their junk mail i've missed emails if i get like 200 in a day sometimes i miss an email sometimes if i see survey sometimes i get 15 surveys a day and i'm like like i don't want to do another survey like every time i go to the grocery store or place of order i get like a 20 question survey like i sometimes just get sick surveys and i don't want to do a survey but like i know i would be upset like if there was a party and then i found out like everybody in my blog get an invite but i didn't get an invite so i don't know i mean and then plus we're we're doing it one time for the whole year and we're doing all three events on the same on the same card and you know it's um we're not asking for anybody's email our phone number we're just saying you know welcome beller beach you know come join us enjoy some music it's kind of like non i don't want to say non-threatening it's just not um it's like a feel-good thing and they're invited and if they don't want to come that's their choice is kind of how i look at it for all three events it's too expensive and then we can maybe put even something on there like if you want information for more events like this please give city hall your email address or something maybe you'll get a few more responses or i don't know yeah that's possible um i just like i don't know even when like you know things have been mailed out and you ask people it's like oh did you get that no you know i didn't get that kind of copy of yours or you know sometimes for whatever reason people just don't get everything it gets lost i mean i feel three checks that never made it to the recipients there i don't know it's like crazy like somehow the mail just gets eaten so i don't know if it's like a lost or and some people are ignoring it and they don't want it they don't want to be bothered and i understand that you know like if the house is closed and we know no one's like people aren't here because they're so birds or they're only here like two or three months out of the year then they have their mail forwarded so then it'll go to their other house and at least they'll know that their city's having events because i know when we were at our other house and there was like a luau or something here my neighbor next door went and she met a couple people that lived down that way and she still hangs out with them she loved them she loved the event but she said it was a flyer on her door and because i wasn't here i never knew about it i never knew what happened uh so and then there's been a couple beach parties that i know that they've had that like i don't i mean i've never had you know any like i was talking to the lady that called me last week and she said oh yeah there's a group of like 30 women and we used to meet in people's houses i had 30 women at my house now we needed the beach and i said well i was told that was a private event she said absolutely not she goes that is open to everyone i said well how do you plan on everyone knowing about that now with code you can't have it in your house that's a different set of circumstances i'm just repeating what she told me so um because i said you know it's um i've heard of these things but like you know people just assume that they're private i don't want anyone to think that anything that you're doing is an invite only private like you can only come if you know somebody i want everyone to know that this is open for everybody um because it is it's cool every resident yeah resident yeah yeah so i don't know i mean i hear you know i don't want to waste money by any stretch that was just something to consider on the same one right there maybe if you literally got back no i don't want you no we haven't seen that i don't want you to contact me leave me alone stop yeah yeah so i think your personal networking is going to be the most effective tool to getting people at these events right more so than anything coming from the city yeah and i love like you know people asking questions people talking about it but it's like you know we need to be unbiased like it's not your personal opinion of what you think you know to get people's feedback you know because you're like leading them i think it's more like you know if they if they don't feel safe coming to an event because they feel like they're you know worried about kobet and they're you know even if it's outside and whatever then you know everybody has their own like feelings about the way this is going right now we just have to respect that i think like it's you know hopefully everyone gets their shots and they feel better and then this turns into the right direction yeah and then a lot of these conversations you know and i agree with you a lot of people are doing but i don't feel safe going to those those things they just don't um you know if the park board could belair beach civic association something like that you know if you could incorporate that name with it maybe because that's what the old civic assay association did it was a network of people that had high interest in the city they worked with the park board to plan all different things santa claus at christmas and all this is the way it was done years ago they handled a phone book which fell apart when he retired but they kept in contact they were the the nucleus for hey anybody moved out of the city they knew about it they worked with the city so there was kind of collection of information yeah that went through them and um and no sunshine no sunshine at that time either so you could do it well still now as long as it was specific right as long as it's separate from but yeah it was totally separate but you know if you were able to to get a network of people not as you started this and you know who it is in the city then they talk back and forth the network amongst your group and then make it expand you know before it was a kind of an intermingling between the city and the civic association at one time it was part of the city but because the legal things changed over the years they had to separate it so but it still was going on in a different form there was still a little back and forth but not not like it was originally like i know i heard you mention the sunshine laws is there like i mean obviously i know we can't but like if it's something that's not sanctioned and it's more social like are they allowed to call and talk to each other because i mean obviously i think for another like committee that's not allowed to talk to each other unless it's being recorded it's only like the ones that are sanctioned by the station by the city yes yeah that'd be that was that was totally separate now what about like for this non-profit because it would be something like the other speech whatever right it would be whatever that's all it was yeah it was non-profit um you know you charged so much for the phone book or you wanted to donate to the organization they brought this could be what you're talking about that would be great and then you could do that anyway and that would just and and that's great input because i mean i don't know when that dissolved but i didn't know oh my god you could also get those donations to the funding yeah it was outside years ago budget uh george do you remember when that was when shipment left before my time that's how it worked before your time it's got to be 2008 somewhere in there when he retired then it was kind of disappeared into thin air all righty so i know we already actually adjourned the association yeah we still got to adjourn officially because i still got the discussion still part of the meeting so now we're adjourned i'm sorry yeah make a motion again to adjourn the meeting um yeah and i have a promotion okay so we got first we have a second okay so the meeting is officially insured all right"
