topic not already on the agenda yes ma'am please come up to the podium and give us your name and address good afternoon my name is Iris Muka I'm the resident of the uh H 10 First Street b beach since 2016 we used to live in Virginia a retired lieutenant for Air Force served for US Army and Air Force in Italy Greece and Albania my husband is an active member I have two girls we moved from Virginia last year because this house used to be our vacation house and we since we V I'm I'm a business woman as well an entrepreneur in a real estate so I have a lot of real estate properties and business in Largo so I employee more than 10 employees every month I do pay them which is good for the city to grow the revenue and it's better for the town so we decided with my husband is still commuting I'm going to be moving here work for pinelas County public school last year as a language Hearts teacher in oon in Palm Harbor and I have two teenagers a 17 and 15 and Marcy which is my youngest one uh all e students a freshman in medical team at bhu she's going to have her ride if you don't mind after I finish this well so why I'm here today first of all I know it's only 3 minutes I'm going to I hope I'm going get everything together but um it's um there is a situation with my property my property is the only property got flooded in August last year and I reported that but I got punished for that because I reported to Mr kin his attorney the real numbers and I got punished for them because I I overhead it 50 50% of the Fem regulation and it's only $14,000 difference not only that the story starts here since December I don't have a house I got a denied letter telling me I need to demo that everything that I've done and raise the property up so my question to the city manager and his attorney I understand they referring to FEMA regulations but the FEMA regulation has unit a substantial Improvement and substantial damage they are exceptional because my daughter over there is suffering from mold is suffering from the illnesses and this city manager over there never cared to come and see the condition I'm going to have to interrupt you uh you are not allowed to go okay that's fine because you made me last month to not speak about that and I don't have a house you sir have a house correct you have your kids under the roof I don't have a house right now so I need you to understand because we start this meeting with a pray to God but I don't think so we're talking about God here we are not caring about our citizen I pay taxes on time I am an entrepreneur I have opened several business from Virginia over here so why have to be treated differently did the city manager came to see this condition of the houses never never I just got to deny a letter so now what I'm doing is of course I'm going to apply with the compliance get their drawings and I want hopefully this city manager to approve my the new house when I'm going to get there I don't know there are a lot to tell the governor is involved the the house representative is involved I'm here today because Mr nadala told me to come and complain which Mr nadala is the commissioner of pinelis County and the last resource will be the social media thank you I know I passed my time I apologize but I'm a mom I'm very irritated and I just it's just in my opinion it's completely unethical it's not a human being to to to to to let the family without the house in the street it's just unbelievable thank you thank you any other citizen like to comment here at this time yes sir you said there's 3 minutes there's be 12 minutes I've got three people who are going to give me three minutes each raise your hands please rck shop Jolo Bob Angelo 12 minutes mad CL please I can only do 12 thank you okay I've got it you want me to time it start good evening everyone it's been a while since I've been here exuse me can you give us your name Joseph Manzo Beller Beach 7th Street for mayor you all know him so it's been a while since I've been here August of 2022 some of you have heard that I had some medical issues but GL I'm standing in front of you I'm healthy and I feel good and I thank some of you for the prayers you offered really appreciate that so why am I here I'm here cuz I was at B Shore a little while ago this letter addressed to Randall Mora dated March 21st 2024 how many of you have it oh you don't show me your hands I'll bet none of you have it why don't you have it I want to know I sat at their meeting and they said that they held this letter and Mr Mora knew about it until after our election because they didn't want that to interfere with the results of the election let's unpack that for a second B A Shore told our City attorney about a letter and it was Kept Secret from the citizens from the voters from potential people who might want to run for office or you afraid I was going to come back I'm not coming back cuz there's many many ways I can deal with stuff like this what's in that letter well the first thing that's in that letter and I'm going to go in backward order here they take issue with our city manager because accidentally he issued a pass a parking pass to one of the parking lots to someone who is not a b beach resident you can't do that his predecessor didn't lot I got them but worse than that you talk about the pot calling the kettle black these are the same people who right now fill up Sixth Street Lot with construction workers who filled up lot after lot with personal business parties open houses auctions one of my favorites they decided that NFL films could use two of our parking lots and what did this city do not a damn thing we did nothing they have no right to use those Lots at all it's in their ordinances and Fred Riley when I was mayor wrote a letter to them explaining that and they deemed that letter not worthy of response and they have the nerve to jump on Kyle here because he issued one parking pass please don't do it again but when they can park 60 ton construction cranes in a handicapped spot for two or 3 days and don't give a damn about the people with disabilities I find it hard to get behind this letter but it's even worse what they seek in this letter and I think why they kept this a big secret they want $23,750 for legal fees for Regina Kardash that's their City attorney for the work she did on my lawsuit against them and on top of that they got a $40,000 increase in their property insurance or their liability insurance well boohoo they had the opportunity on July 21st 2020 when I walked across the street actually it was virtual we had Co at the time and I gave them the opportunity give us back the umbrellas no lawsuit they said no then they got sued and despite the lies that were told by people in this city there was no deal in the a thing that was complete nonsense and some of you perpetrated that lie no there was no deal and I've got Robert Schmidt their former mayor and Steve Bloom their former vice mayor who's now mayor under oath on deposition saying there was no deal you li to the citizens congratulations maybe it helped you get elected but it didn't help support our cause and I warned you that if you didn't support these Beach rights they were going to come and take more of them now let's talk about these requests for money Regina Kardash is Bill Regina Kardash did not put an appearance in that case so don't spin it and don't get any garbage cuz I was there it was my case Regina Kardash never put in an appearance she came to a deposition she opened her mouth and I jumped down it because she had no right to speak they had not one but two very competent attorneys Tom scarrett and Martin Champagne they were paid for by the Florida leue cities they didn't need Regina Kardash and if they chose to have her you shouldn't be paying for it the only other thing Regina did was prosecute a action against Peter rero and Bob Angela who's in attendance tonight are having an umbrella on the beach the first people in the country to get a summons for that well I defended him that both of them and both of those cases were dismissed and you don't pay for them to go and prosecute cases that takes care of Regina now has talk about insurance their insurance went up well when Frank bangard asked the city manager here about our insurance going up he was told that prices went up this year hey welcome to Bon onics prices are up on everything Insurance included but undoubtedly some of it is due to this lawsuit but understand the lawsuit for any of you who didn't bother to read it it's not just about the beach rights because of the umbrella it dealt with their mismanagement of the Lots as trustee it dealt with a public trust Doctrine which is the wet sand that everyone in Florida is entitled to dealt with a lot of things and if they are paying extra insurance because of what I will say is their reluctance to do the right thing that's too bad you don't pay for it they're holding up the interlocal agreement what I said as a mayor was one of the worst agreements I had ever seen signed by Mike Kelly negotiated by that group back them and it's a terrible agreement and it's vague as to whether we owe them or not owe them but I seem to think that our city didn't agree to pay for people to violate constitutional rights and put babies out in the sun so they can get skin cancer and for those of you who think skin cancer is a game come to MAF with me one Thursday we'll talk to some of the pat we'll see what a game it is this city didn't support me at all Dave gtis went and made a motion a resolution that the city wasn't involved that's the support we' got and I warned you they weren't going to stop so now I'll tell you what's not in your letter cardash said basically we'll opt out of the inter local agreement for some of the people in this city you think that that may mean you don't have Beach rights rest assured I know the law is we have deed Perpetual Beach rights they can burn the interlocal agreement and we're still allowed to go to the beach the interlocal agreement deals with how the lots are managed basically says b beach is going to maintain them issue parking passes and I believe we're uh responsible we were responsible for patrol well they hit they got on something here and they've been talking about this for a long time by the way they were talking about this when I was mayor difference is I let my Council know about it what are they talking about doing talking about apping out of that interlocal agreement they're talking about cutting off your parking so you won't be able to park there anymore so in other words pay them their money or we cut off your parking I live 150 ft from the beach I can give a damn if they cut off the parking personally don't look for me to find it for you we had plenty of lawyers and wannabe lawyers in this city who knew everything about this so get ready to fight it yourself but here's my problem if you send them this money okay we're not at in a position where this is the end of this this insurance bill has went up permanently it's not going down and they're made very wellbe more litigation I'm not too thrilled with their new law and there's a bunch of citizens some of whom have retain me that are not that thrilled about it so if you're going to pay for this you're going to be paying for a lot more I'm going to tell you the words when I brought this up with our former City Attorney Fred Riley Fred rley looked at it he heard what I had to say and he said hell no that's what you have to do folks you need to go back to B our beach the people that you told you loved the people that want to trample our beach rights and you need to tell them hell no we're not paying this and you want to opt out of the interlocal agreement good you maintain the lots and you do everything else and if it means they shut off parking then maybe somebody will defend that maybe they can do it and maybe they can't do it this is never going to end and I'm getting sick and tired of comeing here begging this Council so you look at this and you say we'll do whatever we want that's what I heard last time we won the election we'll do whatever you want well just remember I can do whatever I want to I urge you to to tell them not just no you tell them hell no thank you

Marc Mala and the address is 110 First Street and I'm daughter of Iris Mala that just came up here a few people ago and I was just here to um share my thoughts we moved here around 2 years ago from Virginia and we were living in 110 bir Street and I would wake up with runny nose every single day a sore throat every day I could barely get out of bed it felt like my muscles wouldn't work I just had terrible pain all over my body and I would get sick every few weeks with the sinus infection and I wouldn't go to school because I couldn't get out of bed so I missed so much school and we were trying to figure out why so we took a test and the test found out I was very allergic to mold so we did a mold analysis on the house and it was very dangerous so we couldn't live there and then um so that was a big reason that we had to renovate and then the hurricane came so that flooded the house as well and there was no other option cuz that made it even worse with the mold and I haven't had a stable place to live since August I've been moving house to house every month even a few times a month there was a period where I moved times in one month because I haven't had a stable household to stay at and I just I just want my house back cuz you guys have a home to go back to and I don't and it's hurting my studies cuz I'm at Palm Harvard University and I'm studying medicine and it's a lot to study and I have to stay focused and try my best and it's taking up my time cuz all my stuff isn't even out of boxes most of my clothes are in boxes I also have a dog so we have to move with the dog as well and me and my sister sister we're just packing unpacking packing unpacking the same thing over and over again and I just I just need the house to be done and to go forward with the renovations so that I could actually have a stable house to live in and focus on my school like I'm supposed to thank you thank you any other citizen comments all right citizen comments are now closed all right we're up to to item number four which is a presentation from the pels county sheriff's office beginning with a monthly law enforcement report from Corporal Council I apologize the Corporal had to step out for stabbing that stunning into a homicide uh so I forgive please forgive him for that uh statistically uh you can only go with what I was able to populate or that was passed along to meet uh for calls for service as the actual uh calls for service were not complete at this time just early this meeting in the city last month between March 1st and April 1st there were a total 873 calls for service there was notably a crash with injuries on March 27th uh the fire department extricated a trauma alert patient to Bayfront uh which closed the road for a a fair amount of time in addition to that there were 152 traffic citations 109 traffic warnings 25 events reports pulled 299 directed patrols 60 house checks 177 illegally parked vehicles and 105 traffic stops I previously mentioned uh this past month obviously we dealt with spring break so there was an increased presence uh of traffic enforcement uh and also Beach enforcement Beach patrols um there were no no noted incidents on the beach uh that would have carried over uh and then obviously we increased the parking that this problem and again I apologize for having what I have understand thanks Council any questions yes Mr uh you're not going to be code enforcement officers are going to be pres tonight uh I have not seen him it' be Deputy Trump and I've have not seen him here at all and I don't have that before I apologize well maybe you can ask answer me a general question um the is from First Street to 19th Street uh which were Valar Shores um I've got B two complaints from residents sitting on the beach uh one was lying on a towel was told to move by a deputy uh another one was sitting on a chair and told him move by a deputy because they said they were I guess encroaching on the high means Watermark where is that high means watermark more residents so they know where where they can sit not uh so my best understanding forgive me for not knowing the specific incident you're talking about uh it would be to that wet line uh that mean high water so where the continuous uh high tide comes up to as my understanding is from Bel Shore's meetings each resident may have a difference in footage but that is the again I apologize for using the word that is the mean point in which their property line extends too okay I wasn't I'm not I don't know exactly because I was actually dumbfounded on the first report of the chair incident but on this incident I looked into a little bit further there was a 2.8t tide that day so if you go down that beach from 19th Street to First Street when that tide comes in some of the areas it actually comes right up to the Sea so are you saying uh that's the wet wet line no because that wouldn't be the mean average mean would be the average so that's not the mean just because it's high that day for a sea swell or another issue you know if you have a storm coming through I did a beach Patrol the other night and I could barely get the side by side through the beach just with how high it was with that storm set that had come through so it's just an average based on full data I don't want to speak to the actual numbers um but it would be the collection and the total averages that come through they do their calculations well about my pay rade of course that's up to the surveyors and people who get paid the money for it uh but they're the ones who would determine that mean high water line uh so again just because it's past that point at one point doesn't necessarily mean that's their the total amount okay so it would be an average Mark and we've lost so much Beach over the last five years that's another unclear correct you know what I'm saying I I completely understand that and the other point I want to make it's been discussed here on the record that these are supposed to be complaint driven and both the times I don't think it was Point driven I'm saying and again without knowing the specific instances I can't speak to that often times when the deput is out on control or they're made aware of an instance they're not going to let that person know that this is a complaint driven matter they may just have the information about it they see said events right if I was got a complaint that there's a dog on the beach or on the B uh short side that there's a bicycle on the beach I mean I let somebody know Hey listen we re the complaint I'm just going to address the matter with them because it would be the same enforcement type of action and and to conclude I think you were the deputy uh I was closing the gate one night you on the gator probably if it was night time yep uh thank that man right there for fixing the wheels I was going to say I've noticed a stark Improvement on at least two of those Gates okay thank you thank you sir any other questions or comments uh Miss ell do you have any questions no thank you all right thank you Deputy uh Mr Reaper would you mind giving the U code enforcement report please yes sir uh since step Trump was UN aable to make it today he just came back from vacation he did not he was unaware of schedu the meeting but uh just a quick overview um we're still uh most of our code cases are dealing with the U unper permanent remodels and other other uh construction work without the per but recently uh with the warm weather coming in the uh growing season has started to pick up and we've been focusing on getting the NES out for the uh the properties with the weeds and the high grass so so far I think we've done about five notices of violation and uh to this point they've all came into compliance but we're inting on that yes Mr robt um so Kyle on the very last page it talks about the plan overgrowth of structing which is on 107 on 21st Street so I I have seen that house before is there anybody living there currently if there isn't anyone living there um the owner is unable to get to the residents uh we do have obviously fines in place um we were hoping that would move things along to get the property taken care of right now they're just ulating is there anything um and maybe Mr Moore that's been fall into your your area can the city actually go in and do the cleaning and back build that to the owner as opposed to just letting it stay in the state in which is hor without knowing more of the particular property in each instance cities do have the ability to evate certain kinds of nuisances or overgrowth and things like that but but the the entry on private property is not a remedy we exercise quickly um we wish to First SE compliance through the owner whatever property owners that issue okay very good thanks any other questions thank you Mr I appreciate it thank you all right now we're up to item number five which is a presentation from the Pella Sun Coast fire and rescue district is Chief Davidson here tonight he is not but he was supposed to send someone in his place okay uh and who would that be they I don't see all right well we will move on then now we're up to item six this is a presentation uh concerning female look back period uh it's presented by Sean who was a student at St uh St Petersburg College um did he make it y there he is how you doing Sean uh doing well thank you nice to see you again um hello my name is Sean haen I'm a bachelor student at stb College um my program is post Administration um and for my cap Zone I came to work on a um pros and cons for B beaches by backyard and I first want to thank um R Rose um Kyer and mayor David gtis for the interviews and the the help doing this project I wouldn't been able to do it without the um communication support I sponser um I think the first thing that I I first had to discover was why what topic should I choose and why and I found that um the look back period is a widespread issue a lot of Beach Community space um especially Val Beach their 5year look back periods is coming to discuss and and understand that and I think it was a good topic to choose timing wise and hopefully it's it's helpful to the city um I find this this topic to be important U mainly because uh risk ring 2.0 thema coming out has changed a lot of the landscape behind flood insurance and the way that people deal with um the flood rules in cities and the current codes and enforcement in b beach are a little outdated and so it's a good time to revise and look into that with these new understandings and reappraise what currently exists and maybe make different choices depending if they are threat on I uh when I initially did my paper I did a survey into the uh residence uh over 400 res I around 40 to 40 more responses with around 60% that wanted uh less back period or a lot less compared to the 17.5% who wanted more or a lot more in between would be those who had no indifference in like it as it was um the look back period specifically is officially term they substantial Improvement and is the period of time in which a substantial Improvement can be held so for 5 years currently as long as you've done one project on hook for 5 years until that resets the main purpose behind this lip back period is bema to deter facing um the whole reason why substantial Improvement substantial damage exists because Fe does not want people to phas Properties by having separate projects to avoid the 50% rule um the look back period itself is just a way to maintain those permits to prent people from having too many permits open and put undue burden on the city I think think that the language currently as it sits with substantial uh Improvement is only within the definitions under certain subsection so I believe this language there needs to change and have something under the flood Administration documents uh which already I do believe exists but it doesn't have it under the exact period just has the language of substantial proof for damage so I believe that that should change um also based off of the way that the current crss accounts are applied there is not as much benefit currently to to maintain a 5ar look back period for the CRS benefit um so it makes sense to reduce the current look back period and give residents more options to improve their homes more frequently but still to maintain some degree so the city's not overwhelmed by permits um the current cost of reducing the look back period to one year seems to really be the increase in work for the city and that potential 20 points of the S discount but as the S discount is not applying as much that is um potentially less currently um so my recommendation would be that the city reduce the currently back period to a one year and to reevaluate their current post or that thank you thank you Sean Council any questions Mr first of all can we get a copy of your report yes I will be emailing my report to the city manager after this meeting tonight and he can distribute however he wishes um and I'm not sure you remember not when the resident got up and spoke about substantial damage to proper her catastrophe of $14,000 being told to tear house down yes so that does not have anything to do with the city unfortunately not the city is not I'm not bringing the city into this at all this is a that 50% Rule and um a lot of people are are under the assumption that um well my house is worth a million dollar okay that's not the way being calculates structure of the house okay so you're going be worth $200 $300,000 you have $150,000 worth of damage or as you noted windows in last year the year before you put theof for you may have already exceeded $100,000 yes um often times with the human substantial Improvement um people are unaware of the lookback period as it is exactly what it is and the terms behind it um when I spoke to the city manager he uh talked about the process about there's different forms and things that present by the city try and make that awareness more widespread but even from my understanding it's a complicated topic and so I I can understand from residents um Viewpoint how they can confuse that there are often times um improvements or if you buy a home because it continues for ownership where people end up with um holding the bag so to speak where they they don't have as much improvement to their property so that that can be an issue yes and um where this Council I was hoping it was going to be on this agenda we're going to expedite at the last work session because we're redoing all our code but we're coming into a storm season right now so it's important that we reduce that from 5 years to one year or even less and I've been believe all council's in agreement with that right now I really appreciate the looking into this and you understand FEA 2.0 nfip is under suit by about 14 States right now yeah is it is very confusing and a lot of people are coming to discover different issues interactions with it because they uh I find a lot of cities don't fully understand because uh until they they've gotten into the issues they discover a problem and they say okay let's work through this and it it requires a lot of effort to get the the full picture I spent about three or four months working on my project and even now I still I don't fully understand the picture I have what best I can to represent b beach and the city Comm surround it and for the topic specifically but even uh speaking with the flood manager um it's it's not as easy and clearcut as it is it takes a lot of research understanding to come to a proper understanding of the topic and I've uh gone from Washington all these Underwriters to show me supposed discounts because 2.0 States clearly take your elevation standard subor grade you're supposed to get a discount from every foot over that and no one can show anybody where there's discounts even even the city discount yes sir um I've also heard from when interview um there is a thema document that references how over a certain amount of risk you get diminishing returns to your CRS discount it's in the wording under FEA documents so I i' I've heard a lot of different interpretations I heard from from one source that it applies you just don't see it I've heard somebody say that I've seen them documents that I've looked into the the coordinator manual into the the the code itself and it's it seems to me and from what I can gather from the research that I've looked into that the CRS discount is for people who are at flood risk at least are not getting the full benefit yeah absolutely yeah thank you so much anyone else any other questions yes yes sir have you completed the project uh yes I completed the paper okay have you submitted it I have submitted my paper did you receive a grade not yet part of part of my grade is is submitting to the city council so uh by the end of this week I'll be presenting to my school board and then I will find out whether I pass or not I think they give me a week or two before I get the official grad the best of us thank you Sean I'd like to thank you for coming out and speaking tonight I'd also like to thank you for um for Distributing the survey whenever I saw it I wasn't really sure what I was looking at and and so I started completing it and then I stopped and I started doing my own homework and that's whenever I realized you know not everybody's like we are we uh Treasure Island doesn't even have a work back um Indian Rocks has a onee look back and uh and then you and I met and and we both kind of had similar questions and eventually I I brought it back to the council and said why are we doing this I asked city manager why are we doing this and uh no one really knew and um maybe in the past it made sense but now I agree with you 100% I think um a zero look back may not be in our best interest but I certainly agree with one year and I believe the rest of the council members agree also so uh I would like to uh applaud you for for your efforts and your project I hope you get Miss Elliot before sea leaves do you have any questions or comments just a comment I wanted to thank Sean for his report I look forward to reading it and just as a reassurance to the community that um because this issue has been raised we are looking at it very seriously and if you have any views we welcome hearing from you thank you man' thank you for time thank you all right we are now up to the quarterly board reports uh I should actually just say report because the only board that's presenting this quarter is uh Park and Recreation okay my name is Patty Roberts and I live at 102 20th Street and my two close you're perfect far from that okay um first of all I'd like to say um thank you to Tammy who resigned from the Parkson red board and then um the Parkson red board chose me as the new chair so I'm very honored to not replace her because I can never do that but following her footsteps we also have new co-chair John Wagner our secretary is Michael leaks and members Debbie Theo and Alternate Susan KY um so in the last several months um in October we had a Pets and Pals out here on the patio which was very successful lots of cute kids and even more cuter animals so December we had a holiday social and tree lighting out here in the lobby which was very well attended January we had health and wellness Fair it was nice had about 20 to 25 vendors but not enough people maybe only I think it was about 50 45 to 50 showed up so we will if you want us to continue doing this you will need to give us better attendance um we have blood drive in January and March again not very much attendance but it was successful in their eyes cuz I talk to them in mark and we are selling lots of merchandise we have beach towels baseball caps Koozies water bottles um the most um po popular items are usually the baseball caps and the beach towels which we have an abundance of right now and we' sold several this week according to Renee um ongoing events are the yoga that's on Monday and Wednesday and salsa classes that started I think about 2 weeks ago and they go for 6 weeks some of the main things that are happening right now with us are our monthly Beach cleanups we just had one this Saturday which was so successful I think we had 12 people was it 12 John 12 people and for the past three months we've had four maybe five so we were really excited this past Saturday with our beach clean up please continue to do that it's the first Saturday of every month our Park surveys was our next biggie event um between the five of us we divided up the 18 to 20 parts or places here in the in our beautiful little town and we go out with a form that has about six categories on it and we look look at walk through touch field um all throughout the parts and make our recommendations or our positive comments about our parts so we had some really really positive comments this time because we did it a less little less than a year ago and there were several things that needed to be looked at and maybe repaired and I'd say 90% of them have been taken care of and the parts looked beautiful if you haven't been to Morgan Park lately you should go you should go they've done a lot of changes there it's really pretty um added a grill added more trash cans which we always need um rearranged the benches and the picnic tables and the biggie they painted the bathroom okay it looks really nice inside and out special I call it concrete paint on the flooring that makes it look splattered um and new toilets it just looks really nice excuse me um so Aaron or Mr Glenn's and his crew have been doing a fabulous job so if you see them out on the road please tell them thank you and that they're doing a good job what's up oh the last thing would be new ideas that we're considering considering them so we would like to maybe add some plant flowers to the medians there's just two of them or maybe some places around um City Hall maybe annuals or perennials but we would take care of them as parks and wck and um the biggie is a mural on the bathroom wall in Morgan Park we're thinking of something very simple like um maybe a turtle or a pum tree or you know with the beach at the bottom of something pretty simple starting with one side and maybe going all the way around at least three sides so um we're talking to a couple of muralists in the area that have given us um some some of their ideas so my big question to you important people up there would be when we get our sketches for real would you like to see them first and you guys make the choice or as a committee would parts of wck make the choice where would the mural be I'm sorry where would this mural be it's on the bathroom wall at Morgan Park and we would start with a wall that faces the street okay I would be to allowing Park and W to make a recommendation okay pick pick your favor and present it to the council and if we don't like it then I'm sure that somebody will say something about it okay that's the deal we hope we hope we'll have some sketches next month for your meeting next month okay um the other thing is a suggestion to make our signs around the city like at the park areas more positive wording than so many circles with the big X on them that just are not very friendly and have more instead of um you know no trash no this no that um please help us keep our city beautiful type things so that's just another suggestion from Parks and wck trying to keep us from looking like those guys I got you all right any questions for M Ro yes sir I appreciate get the blood dries back and uh I did I did back okay um and I did visit Morgan Parks this has been reopen and uh I brought up to this already a couple times about so dispensers which they are now in place that was a complaint yeah they have a couple more things to do there wasn't in either yeah but that was a complaint from a couple Beach CS like why can't we get some soap and we're in parking thank you anyone else Miss ell uh one thing that we might consider is uh having the pet bags in all the parts rather than just the one I believe it's just in the Bayside part I'm sorry pet I'm sorry um the pet weighs a doggy doggy at Bayside car perhaps they could be of the parts okay thank you any other questions or comments all right thank you Miss Roberts thank you okay item eight the City attorney report Mr Mor you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor um first I'd like to mention again the legislative session ended March 8th um so ago today we've provided you some legal updates on some of the more significant changes that we're monitoring I say monitoring because the governor has not yet received um some of the more significant legislation such as the uh building permitting some of the building permitting timeline changes and um some other some other relevant changes that still sit before or await getting before the governor uh for final execution we will of course keep you apprised of that you should have also received a legal memo providing you some analysis concerning recent Supreme Court jurist Prudence on the use of social media by public officials um as far as um I had intended to speak to you tonight um concerning the correspondence from Val Shore I wish to um correct or address some of the statements made um the letter referenced is dated um March 21st it's St after your election date your election here was March 19th um so the letter was dated March 21st I did not receive it March 21st I that was a Thursday um I received it on um in my office on Monday March 25th um I contacted their Town attorney to discuss the matter uh and in trying to reach her I learned Miss Kardash is actually no longer the town attorney in bore she's separated or or left her employment with that firm um so I I actually spoke with their the the um acting Town attorney through the person cone wall firm this morning uh precisely about this issue uh the letter as phrase seeks two raises two primary concerns the first is a indemnification demand for the $ 23,753 related to their quote unquote out of pocket 20 fees litigating Belair Beach residents um I not of the opinion that that is a responsibility of the city and I've communicated that um to their to their current legal councel um the second issue raised was one of parking um that is um I would say a secondary and possibly even tertiary issues you look at this letter one in terms of the frequency with which that's used into to the imminent ability of the parties to readily address that um the broader concern the way the letter actually terminates it says that if the city is not willing to honor the agreement as written then perhaps the time has come to renegotiate the interlocal agreement I think any attorney who has reviewed this including an attorney who spoke earlier this evening agrees it could benefit from a rewrite um obviously the the it is not the most detailed um interlocal agreements memorialized such um what what residents I think from both communities consider uh very significant rights duties obligations and privileges and I think in in navigating that it can it would benefit from more detailed text of course the challenge with any rewrite or exchange of any document or contract is the devil is in the you know the details if you will and what that looks like and what both parties might want want from that so that is the the not quite the penultimate sentence the second to last sentence then it says if the parties will not abide by the terms as written then the intended efficacy of agreement is no longer serving the public purpose the town looks forward to the city's responses to these matters and a beneficial solution for both jurisdictions my advice as your legal councel is if both parties agree that the real problem here is the interlocal agreement then what we should do first is see if we can achieve a rewrite revision uh modification of that agreement on terms that are beneficial to both parties and more explicitly memorialize the party's terms the con the the letter that was sent um does not threaten litigation um at least not at this stage I talked to their um Council that's not posture at this time there are very specific parameters for how jurisdictions go about that we're not there yet I believe that this is a situation it is conflict and my role my goal with any conflict is to end it um and to find a resolution the benefits my f and that's what we're working to do I have been in contact with the city manager about this we've talked about this at length both when immediately when I received it and in the days following I had contacted it it was in fact in reaching out to their Council um attorney Kardash to discuss this that I learned that she was not with the firm um and so that's uh obviously when you've had that kind of somewhat abrupt turnover the priorities in the community flipped for a moment and that wasn't the highest priority last week and I was traveling last week as well um and so with that this is it was the first call I made this morning um especially knowing I was coming and planning to speak to you this evening I had intended originally to speak to you about this last Monday when our meeting was was unexpectedly cancelled and then I left the very next day left town that was the reason why it was not presented to you in that time um so that was uh the that was a posture there but it was not held um from you to achieve any other end than to allow for me to provide you with the full context of its uh parameters and and and to seek to address and see what resolutions could be reached and get a better understanding from their Council what that party's position is at least at this time understanding either party's positions may change uh depending on the posture of um there was some discussion tonight about the u mean high water line and I would just for the benefit of member Banker is I know you like to to research these things and sometimes SE this the the coastal mapping section of the Florida statute Florida statute 17725 sorry no problem I'll provide this but Florida Statutes 1 7725 through 17740 provides definitions um delineates that the Department of Environmental Protection is responsible for establishing the mean high water line how that is done on what intervals and and what the significance of those terms as they are traditionally used um that's where that where that par Lance comes from of the mean high water the mean high water line which are two different things me high water at least as statute by Statute is generally defined as that average over a 19-year period the mean high water line indicates where that average hits that that dry ground and then how that's administered um suffice to say there's not a fixed uniform point that sits exactly X in or feet off of every single property in the State of Florida um so that's um some context that doesn't solve the answer now that I can show you here it is on a map but just providing um some some guidance and insight uh on that issue um and those definitions are in 17 7.27 sub4 and 15 for mean high water and mean high water line um I want to thank and commend the SBC student if you're still here sir fantastic presentation earlier um fantastic attention to detail it is never easy or enjoyable uh to navigate such dense regulations and try and provide some context and Clarity especially where they are in consistent Community to community and you try to figure out how did we get here um I've learned often in my career not it's not always clear how we got here we don't always make them sometimes we just fly them um so I'd like to commend that student for their really diligent work and reaching out to public officials to get more insight that that's commendable not a lot of people um do that level of diligence I think that should be commended um as I review my notes I believe those were the most significant things I wish to address in my report but as always I'm happy to answer any questions or address any issues you'd like me to council any questions for the City attorney Mr why wer we given that letter I like to get a copy you certainly will get a copy of it the why of it was simply I received it and intended to provide you the context uh immediately at that meeting last Monday um when I traveled I just I didn't want to give you something and then make myself unavailable to discuss it uh it warrants discussion uh also given the attention that the um that to the extent there's been conflicts between the two jurisdictions I thought it warranted addressing openly so that there would not be some um perception that I was telling you and only you um I was I was planning to present it in a public forum for your knowledge and consumption and also I wanted the opportunity to discuss it with you um to contextualize it rather than say hey here's a letter I've got call me if you want this because I it is the knee-jerk reaction is of course what are you what is this about why are we fighting about this the city wasn't a party to this what are you doing and I think that rather than jump immediately to a fighting posture there is a solution here based on the way that it's written that the solution is a renegotiation of the agreement and I think all parties involved agree no pun intended that the agreement could have done better so maybe that's the near-term solution and seeing if that can be done before everybody simply retreats to um you know points of conflict and and and their fighting rosters well they have in my opinion is doesn't nothing I don't believe they file the uh inter local agreement they took away our barking violations and I said trustee I don't think you can make money all you as a trustee I don't think you can profit all the trust in the state of cor and I don't know where that uh revenue is going when they're cing people party tickets and that's not your not not at this stage and perhaps those are the sorts of things that that warrant to addressing in the process and that's because my client is not one person I have I I serve a board I I would not want to go to them having spoken individually to each of you without you also having the benefit of that discourse with each other which is the other reason I wanted to present it publicly because if any one of you simply told me your position and said well you know what of it said well I work for the majority of this of this body and and forgive me member Shaw Elliot as I'm not making eye contact with you through this uh platform but I work for all of you and I wanted to make sure all of you had the opportunity to receive the information discuss it with each other if you desired but at this stage my intention in is to um make contact with their current attorney um and I've already done that today and I committed to him that once I'd spoke with my client this evening I'd be in a better position to see if my suggested course of action is what my client wanted so that we could explore solutions from there who's your current um Dan I'm sorry sorry I'm going to let me just pull up the letter head so I can say Daniel there it is um Daniel Lewis is the attorney from the person in law firm who is presently um filling in I will say just as a professional courtesy to Mr Lewis as you might imagine when one of your colleague suddenly departs who's serving multiple Municipal clients he is drinking from several fire hoses um but was kind enough to make time for me both last week I contacted him the Monday that our meeting was cancelled um and he was not in a position to substantively discussed if we committed to speak a week from that day and then we spoke this morning um we're talking about the high me right about the 19 year average yes in the fre Beach go I know at least twice I've been told four times I see him right after and guys go out and Survey but this last time I've actually seen guys who survey going one the properties about for better readings I go and talk I said what are you doing you know I know they survey the way out we do with the data we give it to the count all right and that's all I again but they always say you're losing more and more and more each time so I wrote to the I wrote to all the County Commissioners today about this problem and give me kind of a definition where this high in 19e Sur because where do we sit and lie on the beach anymore you live between first and 19th Street and b beach um I go down the highway I cross the yellow line I get excited for that but I know there's a line there telling me to stay here all right so this is a real Mr B if you need that answer you should call Kelly Le she's gotten back to me there and I to her about it and the commission not they're not going to answer your questions because they don'ts well and they get using the Kelly I really don't get an answer from her either yes Direct in addition to the county it may be that the en Department of Environmental Protection or its Regional Outpost here locally might be in a position as well I'm happy to look into the issue in a broader sense to see if there's just un half but the the the fact is that it is because it is a point based on an average over time it is it is a fixed point that can and does change um and so that I I can understand the challenge and frustration there um I don't administer it I'm just explaining it you'll probably get a copy from actually contact office uh actually I I spoke with the Attorney General's office and they will not be um engaging in that because they don't give legal advice to individual elected officials thank you Mr um what do you think the um the direction of their new attorney do you think that they're as far as renegotiating the U the current agreement do you think that that's something that they suest that the attorney suggested or do you think it's coming from their their I'm not going to speculate because I simply don't know and I don't know that it will be fruitful or or constructive for me to do so what I will say is whomever it's coming from the letter as could have ended a lot of different ways it ended with perhaps we need to renegotiate this agreement um there was a a member of the public spoke at link tonight said this is a poorly written agreement paraphrase um and so I think if if multiple people can look at this and say this can be better that to me seems like well there's a lowest common denominator here among the cited problems and so I know that in my view that I think that's the best course of action speaking with the attorney who's presently um serving as a town Atty I get the impression as well that if an amicable solution can be reached that's the preference at this stage absolutely um and and also you know it in as much as there is a financial demand in here the second issue is sort of as to the parking is resolved by addressing the interlocal agreement um and again the dispute there is that according to the interlocal agreement in in in its vagaries um it says that the parking shall be for the use and benefit of the residents and and Property Owners east of G Boulevard you know in Beller Beach I think the letter of the law on that there's an argument to be made that even as our temporary permit program exists though it is not often used it is always for the benefit of a resident right it is Jo can't walk off the street John do can't walk in and say I want one of these you have to establish that you're a property owner I think there's well that's not quite the spirit of that or perhaps how it's written from their view but regardless an interlocal agreement revision May well address that so the only real dispute here is the funds that I I again my my position is I don't believe they're legally entitled to them um I think it's used as a it maybe used as an incentive to come to the negotiating table but I don't think based on my experience with you as a client that there's some great reluctance in this community to renegotiate I think there's a desire and and renegotiate doesn't necessarily just mean come to New terms come to better clearer terms um and again the challenge will be as in any negotiation or renegotiation that was in the details it's not clear what either party wants from that they didn't say we want to renegotiate the interal agreement and here's our List of Demands it said we need something better than this cuz this keeps causing problems and that seems to be true it is true um so you know when and that came up when we talked about Towing that came up when we talked about gate accesses and things that this Council has discussed or versions of it over the past 3 years anytime we've talked about those Becks as it comes out to well the agreement doesn't quite say this so we got to find out what their position is is we can memorialize and address a lot of those potentially and again I think that there's value in seeing if an amicable resolution can be reached in terms of just get reaching a better work product Mr Roberts do you have any questions or comments no I've actually contacted thep probably a couple years ago and obviously that 19-year average is an elevation so it's an elevation I'm assuming I haven't seen the report that's takes into account sea level so it might be - 2.5 ft below sea level so it is an elevation and when you get that most current 19-year average you can simply go out there on the beach set up a a survey instrument and anywhere that that level is is where that line would be and it's going to vary just like we've talked about from house to house because the sand levels could vary a lot somewhat or none at all so that line isn't going to be a straight line from 1st to 19th it's going to be based on the elevation of the sand levels there and that's where it is and they probably update I'm guessing maybe monthly over that 19-year average or it could be annually over that 19e average and I I do wish to address one issue as it relates to that in as much as where that line is is affecting where Beach showers can enjoy the the beach um without being moved or disturbed in as much as that's being started as has a function of a code violation if you will code enforcement um under chapter 162 of fora statutes provides that if a complaint is made that it cannot be anonymous absent certain exent circumstances but it doesn't prevent proactive policing of your codes um you're you're not limited to enforcing your codes only when a complaint is made um you can proactively uh go through your community and say we didn't receive a complaint this was done on a proactive basis and that's whether it's tall grass for those things so I just in as much as that's a concern I do want to make sure that's clear council member Elliot do you have any comments or questions yes one of each um and I just wanted to thank our City attorney MOA for his professionalism throughout this whole process and we know that you uh represent us very diligently and in a very respectful way and so um I for one remain very very confident in in your representation of us and look forward to hearing more about these issues I do have a question about the result of the election and that concerns uh the section 2.07 regarding um meetings um know that that provision passed and that the quum for a meeting um is based on the majority of the council uh and we know also that the the membership of the council has been reduced to five but it's for a period in the future so what is the effective date of the the Quorum provision that takes effect immediately the Quorum language was part of the um the Corum language was not contingent on um another date it is um as it reads it's a majority of the council constitutive Forum if the council was composed of five members six members or seven members at any given time then that's the council I would interpret that as the council as seated um and so a majority of the council otherwi and so in that context um as I interpret that it's accept as provided the language now says accept as provided in 2.06 C which is your provision governing vacancies a majority of the council shall constitute a quorum so a majority of the five six or seven or four as it is now three of you is a majority that's a quum right now that's all we need and then it says no action of the council shall be valid unless adopted by an affirmative vote of a majority of the council the same language so at least if only three of you show up all three of you are going to need to approve a measure because that's a majority of the council so it's the same par land so it should it should yield the same result the same math uh so that's that's how that needs so March 19th when the voters V full Charter yes sir and I and I fail to mention that in my report thank you for reminding me that what I'm saying is that we went to a uh three person call 2019 based on your present composition of four yes so and why was the meeting canceled last week the meeting was canceled last week at the request of the presiding officer based on a we had well the charter clearly says the senior council member will run that was not that was not a a legal interpretation I provideed on that the meeting was cancel but our Charter is our legal interpretation of how we run the city and if and if we had three people for quum that meeting should have never been cancelled this okay I don't know why we have Charter if we're not going to file the charter then might have the other question I have is What's the statute limitations on filing an appeal on any Charter amendments that because I can't find it in our ordinances and I can't find it in our Charter and I think if it's vague or missing is it statute I I don't provide legal advice to people on how to challenge the ordinances I'm just asking is there a statute file because people ask uh people are are free to pursue their own legal remedy if they feel that something should be challenged um that's not that comes statute of limitations as you stated comes from Florida Statutes and that is not a me matter of the city's ordinance or Charter as to when a legal challenge can be commenced I'm just asking is there is it in our ordance that you know that you can is there a time it is in Florida Statutes I believe there is there's one period based on based on how soon you do it changes the standard of review for the challenge I have handled such challenges in the past for other communities there is in fact a statute imp limitations I don't have an encyclopedic knowledge of all of them I believe it's somewhere between four and 5 years and then after like six years then it's more differential or something of the sort I I may be off on my numbers but yes there's a statute governing a statute of limitations for legal challenges of ordinances um and I don't know what it is specific to Charter amendments when you have a ballot measure that might be in more restrictive statute of limitations as opposed to a legislative enactment of the council and and and the other reason I asked is I went to the Florida Le cities about this I hope people can't hear me and they told me it goes to your ordinances as City attorney okay well so well be that as it may I I not everybody in the Florida League of cities is a litigator that's why they say go city attorne right not everybody's a litigator with the Florida Lea cities I would tell you as a litigator again generally speaking your legislative enactments your ordinances and resolutions are subject to those statutory schemes I've not had occasion to handle a legislative uh or a legal challenge to a um ballot measure I I know of them being litigated I've not had one where I've had to specifically defend it so I just don't I can't answer that here was the question I was supposed to be before this moment thank you any other questions no and Miss Elliot I appreciate your comments U your appreciation for Mr Mo I uh I will agree with that 100% all right thank you very much Mr Mora and appreciate the detail report now we are on to item number nine city manager report Mr Freer thank you mayor so this reports slightly dated because we have the postponement of the meeting but the uh we actually do have the amendment to the an rocks uh piggyback agreement for uh the underr project and that is later on the agenda so we'll discuss that um we we get to it the uh star water Improvement project I just made a move that uh Mar Mar 19th the city passed out the door hangers um notifying residents of the corresponding streets of the project that project was taking place and that there would be future notifications coming directly from the contractor but um giving them contact information with the city um if any problems do arise and if you haven't seen it already um the contractor has started uh cutting away the curve and moving it um already get dried they have started on the North End of the the project um but they still maintain that they will uh move to the southern end if we feel like uh we've come to a decision point on that um so that we can take care of some of the uh areas of the city have uh the flooding for soon before huran season comes around um they've also had the C contractor who's been cleaning out the oysters and marles and the pipes they they actually starting that process um and and then once they get the cleaning done they should move forward to the uh cure and place uh pipe um which I think is important to get done because it's to fix the pipes that we know that have weaknesses and uh infiltration and the code project for our next work session which is going to be on April 22nd um we are going to cover the remaining remaining chapters um so that's going be 70 74 788 86 and 90 um we're actually going to incorporate the uh the infu sign ordinance in that uh work session as well so um Mr sh is prepared for that and we will be passing out the outlines and um full chapters for your review and lastly um the RFP for AUD Audi Services I have on here April 4th that the AUD committee was going to meet U that got delayed to the appointment of the committee members um so our new date is set for April 16th next week and at that meeting we will be uh reviewing the uh RFP that's going to go out shortly after and um a review of the audit itself and it will be presented in Maye um and then just as a note I am going to be out of the office April 23rd through the 26th go the FL flood plane management conference I will be be email cell phone and working that's all I have I do have a just a question right quick concerning the documentation we s b um I believe the results of the survey concerning pumps and storm water drainage would you like to just kind of briefly so I've been um kind of queuing uh the C city engineer Larry floody to get um us the report that we've been asking for um a recommendation of the pump manufacturer they came up with a double pump design so we started um with a design that incorporate two pumps in case one pump um is not working correctly the system still works um based on the numbers it's it it you know it's a price here project for that reason um and it also involves uh where you have to use structures um that are cast in place concrete because they have to be designed to fit the pumps uh one of the options in talking to the engineer was you know I'm asking is is there way we can run up a one pump system and um try to reduce the cost of the project and that is in his memo that I sent as well what he was explaining so he gave us a the cost estimates for this two pump system um for two locations which is 9th street and then um the sou Street area and both those projects can be done independent but I just wanted to make sure we incorporated both areas but what he is going to do now is try to fit a one pump into a pre-cast um structure um to make the project simpler to try to reduce that cost so that is waiting before but I wanted to get the report out that he that he has currently just he had some numbers and St to look at um and also you know just send me questions so I can get that information back and forth as much as possible because we we do have a lot of resid that could start about when we're going to make this decision and they want to have the storm water project improvements from currently on nin Street Cedar it is all right questions from the council yes sir um KY on this that's great news the storm water Improvement projects has started baring any Act of gods the God is there any U Tim table the contractor has estimated and know we're not going to go to be to the car from the start finish I mean there's optimistic talk of six months but I can't commit I Anything Can Happen correct correct thank you any other questions or comments for the city manager just yes I I have several um thank you uh Mr manager for confirming that uh the contractor is prepared to move South um when conditions require that um obviously those of us that are south of the causeway have a great deal of concern about the impending storm season and we want to be prepared for that as as as quickly as possible um I wasn't clear on when we will be receiving a final report do we have a date for that I don't have an exact dat um I will push for it to get done this week so that you guys have the report Look at um and then he has already committed to representing um you know his firm and answering questions at the next work session on the 22nd okay I'm 22nd Bard me but what about the working meeting will we have something to discuss at the working meeting the second is the work session oh I'm sorry all right forgive me all right good all right that's that's good news appreciate that um and then with regard to the Cod review I just wanted to emphasize chapter 86 regarding signs is the one where I think we had a lot of concern um which is interesting because we don't have a lot of sence here in our town but um we had talked about it before and at least my comment before was that let's look for ways that we can simplify it so that we have something that is um easily communicated should someone come to the front desk and say I'd like to get permit for a sign we have something that's easy to communicate to them for what those rules are so that would be my comment about that as we ready for that meeting and I think we we looked at it before we talked about getting some revisions to that um to that ordinance rather than the one that was most recently proposed does our City attorney have any view on that thank you member shot uh I will uh first address the point you weren't asking me that I failed to address in my report which is to say there was some discussion about the one-year look back period being prioritized I advised you at our last meeting that that would be put before the Planning and Zoning Board before it went to you that already has been that board is meeting on Wednesday and we have um subject to the body appointing uh members tonight um and that ordinance is one of the things they'll be looking at at Wednesday's meeting uh to your question concerning the sign code um we've had discussions about that in the past um both when you were a member of the uh of the Planning and Zoning Board and also um as part of this Council um as far as simplifying that that can be done I in in each instance I've asked for um specific guidance Beyond I just want it clear um and I only say that because while it may seem simple to some the this change is being made in response to Supreme Court jurist Prudence um that Supreme Court opinion does not have a majority opinion has series of plurality opinions it's proy since then has made some clarity but what we're trying what we've provided you the simple um instruction was we need to fix our sign code um what my firm drafted and provided was ad L the most robust approach if you want something more stripped down we can do that I just want to make sure I understand uh from a client need standpoint on what you consider essential what you consider Superfluous so I can better um provide you a work product that better meets your expectations to dat the the instruction has simply been I something else um and I'm happy to provide that but I don't want to work in um futility and so any if you have if any of you having reviewed it wish to speak to me in individually to give me your thoughts Reflections and we can recirculate what was the previous draft as we as we approach that but that's um that's where that stands thank you Mr Baker uh Kyle Val shes reaches out to you about that letter and says hey we're going to reduce our fees to $9,900 you have way to pay 10 grand would you notify us that before attempt to pay that of course thank you any other questions or comments for the city manager thank you Mr reer thank you mayor next up City cler cour how you Rene good how are you my report was

life and career experiences have provided me with the qualifications necessary to contribute to uh realizing all five of the goals outlined in the plan um so regarding goal number one Public Safety and Health uh I uh taught at two uh high schools in my teaching career uh both schools I was on the school Improvement team on the safety committees I also uh sponsored a student youth crime watch group at one of the schools and I did share the uh Safety and Security security uh community at boale High School uh with Goal number two tax dollar value uh I have a lot of experience um working within a budget I was a long-term uh social studies department shair at St Petersburg High School where I supervised over 20 teachers and and had to manage that budget each year uh I um also was a head coach for 11 years and had a budget to work with uh there as well as the uh cook at our household my wife and I also have to budget our uh grocery bill at public if you've seen the places there lately you know that's no easy to task either uh my wife by the way is a small business administration uh portfolio manager at a local bank so we definitely as a household understand uh the value of keeping one's finances in order uh regarding rule number three communication and Community uh I as a you know teacher and Coach that goes with the the the territory I was a number a member of numerous

directors I was was also a supervisor and site based Mentor for uh developing teachers who wanted to go into the profession uh I also uh through coaching uh served on a uh board of directors was a partnership between youth soccer programs in the area and our Tampa Bay Mutiny which some of you may remember was our professional team from 1996 to 2001 uh goal number for Aesthetics I might not have as much to offer there although I do like working in my garden and uh growing my own cooking herbs and actually today I planted uh some more milked for my marks which I've been raising uh goal number five Beach and Waterfront I think this is where I would truly shine uh I was born and raised here I grew up on these beaches I see that 73% of bell beaches water I think if you ask my wife she would spend that I she would probably say that I spend about 73% of my time on the water fishing and kaying and just enjoying our Peach uh I'm an outdoor Enthusiast I'm an environmentalist I'm a member of CCA the coastal Conservation Association I'm also a member of captains for clean water uh not too many people care more about the health of our beach and our Waterfront than I do it's truly a passion of mine I also have a great deal of knowledge about working in uh government I've taught courses in uh well courses I've taught include American government law studies uh court procedures legal systems and Concepts and my favorite course that I've ever taught uh the philosophy of government uh as a teacher I also sponsored um Team Court which was a partnership with rosbro County Court System where my students got to actually litigate juvenile misdemeanor cases and I also sponsored our Mark trial teams uh in 2005 I was awarded the Carol Bellamy Fellowship in constitutional studies which granted me a full scholarship to earn my master's degree in educational leadership at University of South Florida I am a stomp supporter of our constitutional rights and the concept of federalism I believe that local government is best left to local leaders we don't need people in Tallahassee or DC telling us how things should be on b beach as far as my desire to serve I want to preserve the unique beauty and safety of our city I try not to leave the beach when I don't have to but every time I do when I come to the hump on that bridge right over there I see the Gulf of Mexico I see our city I I can feel the weight lift off my shoulders I feel peace and I feel at home I always want to feel that way I'm will to work for all of us here so we'll always feel that way thank you thank you Mr Kon um do we have questions I like your comment when you go over the bridge going over that bridge forever 10 years and we say a prayer thanking the Lord that I'm granted to live here under his grace and uh help keep the city safe and the people of need everyone I'm talk to says the same thing my wife and I it doesn't matter where we go uh it could be to clear water or Lardo it could be somewhere beautiful in the Caribbean when we get home we just feel at home first I just want to thank all three applicants for uh having the desire and taking the time to submit the application and be interested in helping her City I did reach out to all three candidates I had an opportunity to sit down with David my personal opinion I think he checks all the boxes one that he didn't mention I was

for that thank you Mr Roberts by the way you can read that story at floridasportsman.com he told me you put them both back in the water so I did I did SM fish okay thank you council member Elliot do

my hobbies include sailing I'm an avid environmentalist I you know being a sailor I'm out in the water all the time always pick up trash along the way I love traveling I play soccer tennis and I love to Babys at my grandchildren I was educated as a mechanical and aerospace engineer at the University of Delaware I've worked in the medical device field for almost 40 years with deont and Baxter Healthcare as a mechanical engineer a program manager and a chief systems engineer for one I like to serve for Bell Beach I want to do my part to help serve our community and I feel now is the time our town is in need of more folks to serve I'm also planning to retire in this coming January so I feel like I have some more time if I don't get this position uh I'll continue to look for other opportunities to serve this community I work well in teams both as a contributor and a leader I participated collaborated and LED major medical device Pro medical device programs throughout my 40-year career I enjoy trying to understand root cause of issues and bring new ideas to address them I'm a good listener I have demonstrated ability to sexly manage conflict and have a balanced view on when to Stand My Ground and when to compromise for the good of the community I'm an optimistic person who is also very practical and Hands-On I like to make decisions based on evidence I'm more extroverted than say most many Engineers you met my wife says I like to talk to a wall talk to a w matter what conclusion I'm friendly trustworthy fair-minded and would love the opportunity to serve this community thank you very much thank you Mr willings we have questions from the council yeah just a comment I did have an opportunity to speak with Andre as well he was uh when he answered the phone he was in uh he West West yeah I was sailing back from for Lauderdale on his boat and he was hoping to make it back for last Monday um he did make it back but we changed the meeting so he had plenty of time so we I've sailed like 36 hours streight so he would have been exhausting to show up at that meeting but either way we're glad you're here today Mr B do you have any questions I want to just thank all three of you for uh one of the questions about why we had Charter changes was we didn't find enough Cates you guys will proove this WR well I agree thank you Miss OT do you have a question um Anders you've heard tonight some of the issues that we're looking at as a council uh including the storm water project signage uh neighborhood issues uh um what in your background would give you specific um skill to bring to resolution of those shes I certainly feel like you know I'm a mechanical engineer I've done fluidics a long long time dealing with fluid flowing through PES and like that so I I think I can bring a very practical approach to that I I definitely like to definitely an have a reader I will read deep into the topics I definitely like to um I won't say understand all the topics that are on the table right now and so but I do need I have the time I will have the time to get up speed on all the topics and uh I definitely like to thoroughly research things before I wake up I have a question uh if there was something uh uh if you could change immediately correct or make better in b beach what would be the first thing of your rad um I think uh I'm very I'm on 8th Street right there so I'm very familiar with some of the flooding issues so I think that would be top of mine for me e and nth streets any other questions I do have one statement to make sometimes when we're making these decisions we have very good qualified candidates which is the case again so I don't think there's any losers here sometimes we have to look at little tiny things one of the things that we don't often think about is the actual physical location of our council members because we represent the whole city but it goes without saying that when we're close to certain streets that it's easier for us to stay in contact with them find out what how they feel about issues that we're going on things like that so um just something to consider I know we have a couple of people in in the south south of of cway um I'm on I'm on 20th Dave is further to the north and I know David is 15th Street so we're kind of getting spread out there which I think is a nice thing just my op yeah and the fact that I'm on the south south of beach I think wouldn't bias me how it I definitely want to review all parts of our community that be fair minded of where the resources are needed any other questions just to note our Charter clearly says council at L so it doesn't say we can all live on one street we we want to put WS in it let's put WS in it that's all right so I have to ask you the uh the final questions uh which is are you a qualifying registered voter yes uh qualifying physical resident yes and qualifying permanent resident yes and qualified by civil rights yes thank you very much thank you okay we still uh have the opportunity if you have any other questions for prior uh candidates if if you would like to ask them any more questions before uh we end this portion of it good council member Elliot no thank you okay great all right so now what we're going to do is we're going to uh vote by paper ballot um actually we're not going to do that just yet hold on one second now it's time for the council to or the public to speak would anyone like to address the councel uh with these three candidates yes sir please come right on that give us your name and address I'm done CR out see here and uh I just want to add one more thing he did bring up his grandfather served for city council here and myself I served 20 years ago so he''s been here since he was Bor I've been here since' 65 so we got a little long history in the city and we really really care about it and so he's very interested I don't think he really need to bring up his whole we came up here so they said quite as much as we should have but there's a lot of history here thank you Mr Prescott any other citizen comments yes we were wondering where you were Joy Shirley 207 Harrison Avenue I want to thank all three candidates I think they're all great but I do want to go to um just quickly say Doug I've known Doug all his life he's been a great kid it's nice to see the younger generation get involved his son my son and him are the same age and it's just nice to see getting um some some young folks involved so I know there may be some opportunity I don't I don't know I mean I thought I had heard that maybe we were adding three members tonight am I miss this understand something there we still have to make a motion on that and uh but my proposal was one because of the fact that uh majority large majority of the community said five is uh is what we'd like to have and we are not uh required to fill all seats so that was that was my goal okay just saying if we did have to fill all seats I think that we have three great candidates so thank you guys for considering them all thank you I take offense to the young to by the all right uh so now it's time to vote uh basically uh with the way that this is working I guess what you would do is one two three you think that that would be the appropriate way to handle this okay and then after we take the vote uh Renee will present the the count and then someone will make a motion to move forward sorry I guess you'll have to do stand Miss Elliot I believe you'll have to vote my voice did we lose her it's not connected any try call going to have to take for it as number one they are ranking them one okay thank you she's back and I'm back there is no Clear Window the results um sorry madam clerk um we need to read the results as to how each member voted okay okay so miss Elliott uh ranked them Anders Wellings first David tenan second dou press Scott thir and then council member Banker voted them all equally as one mayor gtis chose Doug Prescott as one Anders Wellings as two and David tenan as three council member Roberts chose David tenan as one Anders Wellings as two and Doug Prescott as three going to interpret this well there's a few ways that if you wanted to go the way to GPA one there's one way I would suggest instead that however many people you're going to appoint you have to start with one right you're you're filling at least one vacancy tonight um you've not necessarily reached a conclusion on that so it may be beneficial to all pick one member on another ballot rather than do the rank to Choice since you're not filling multiple seats and see if that yields any clear majority decision um in light of that uh if you wish to do a separate second round of voting that way do it that way um ultimately the stewards of this process for the charter part the commission is the council Council fills the vacancies so it's ultimately your decision on how to proceed but given that you're at least filling the first vacancy um it may be the ranked voting approach is um not most suitable at this time um noting one member chose not to use that approach either so um it may it may be best to take a different approach to you with different results let's do another round of ballot and we start with just the first it's I she she and I'm on council member Elliot would you like to vote by voice yes if that's the process uh I love her honors well okay so in this round council member Elliot selected Anders Wellings council member Lloyd Roberts selected David tenan mayor gtis selected Doug Prescott and council member Banker selected them all so just for clarity sayate section 2.06 C of the charter sets a vacancy on the council shall be filled by a majority vote of the remaining members of the council we have four members of the council so majority vote would be three of you um any person appointed by Council fill a vacancy will hold office and we've already discussed all that so at this stage um it is um ultimately again your process it sounds to me based on the way that the Voting is working that there may be some value before you go back to the ballots and having a discussion as a body on what your goal is here tonight and how you intend to proceed Council well we have an open suggestion one person on but it's not been moot it hasn't been motioned or it hasn't been approved so right now our Charter clearly says seven members um so I don't know how we can vote for one I don't know how we can vote for two um again we have three people that want to serve counsil Charter says we can put them on why would we want to tell them not to serve on Counsel I I don't understand it I mean I don't think the voters have a pro the voters said we can reduce it to five voters didn't say we have to reduce it to five their terms going to be up at the end of this session so just put them on Mr robt well I think it does make sense to listen to the citizens I realize Mr Banger that we don't have to do this until the next election 26 November 26 but my perspective the way I look at it is the citizens voted by a pretty big margin that they wanted to go to Five understanding that we don't have to it still makes the most sense to me to listen to the voters six six council members is not an option in my opinion we can't have an even number of council members so by definition it's one or three and I think because of what the citizens said I support the one thank you council member Elliot would you like to weigh in on this um this is this is a con room is it not um um there's certainly is no requirement that we fulfill pull all positions um but Mr Banger makes a good point in that they are there uh we have people that are willing to serve um at the same time uh it also relieves some of the pressure on the voting issues to the extent that we have more at least during this inter room process um I can probably be I'm having difficulty coming down on a particular position on this one um but um I can support you the way we've got we've got good people willing to serve I'm sorry I say that last sentence we have good people willing to serve amen all right and uh I am aligned with with Mr Roberts this is was my my attempt was to go ahead and bring us forward so that it looks like the future of our Council what the citizens voted for uh I don't know how many out in this audience but it was around 80 I think 82% something like that um the city has spoken uh so I uh am going to stand behind uh what I'm I'm trying to make happen tonight which is to go to a fin councel uh I'm I'm grateful for all three candidates being here um but I I don't think that seven is the direction that uh that this Council needs to be going any any further so um what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to select one any other comments what's that arm wrestle arm wrestle right I'll go for that but what we uh what we need to do is vote again and uh yes in the past our provisions and our Charter allows for draw a STW and you may have to come to that no one's willing to give you may have to do that thank you let's do one more you know it's we're really Beyond it but I'm going to she came up so let's uh let's here let's start with with Joe Man 3 minutes I will take 12 I promise you so so first off there's no motion on the floor mayor gtis if you want to make the motion you can make it you need to yield the floor to the most senior member because you don't have a vice mayor that would be frank Banker okay in terms of whether you put one two or three on I agree with Mr Robert you can't have an even number so it's either one or it's three but what I find somewhat ironic is that this whole vote was sold to the voters on the idea that we can't get seven good people to run well three good people just stepped forward tonight so you've got seven and I'm with Frank bankard take them the way people have dropped off this Council for a variety of reasons you can't have too many people on here and the extra debate is fine to Mr moa's point maybe this has changed since I was mayor but your Charter changes didn't become effective until they were filed with the secretary of state and if that is the case still that's what I was told because if you remember we changed the charter one time where the mayor was allowed to bring a motion and I was told we had to wait until the Secretary of State accepted it well either I was lied to which is a problem a civil rights problem so I hope I wasn't Li to or new CH changes aren't effective yet you have seven member Council so clarify it because the worst thing you could do is put people on this Council and find out that he did something wrong and everything you did is void please check this through and if you need to call a special session and do this on another night this can wait one more night you do have enough for and you can run the city business thank you Mr I'm not immediately aware of that I'm not saying that there's no such requirement I'm also not aware of what's been sent to at this stage administratively um so ultimately again I would I would defer uh to how you're proceeding I will continue to look into that concern as that's the first has been raised would someone like to table this uh this particular there's there's been no motion yet I'm sorry we had others yes Tammy lenda 97 Harper Drive for what it's worth um I did vote to um decrease the council member down to five people and I know your your point saying this is what the citizens voted for but like the main reason was because no one was running and it was a great fear that was kind of going around that you know tallah has would take over our city council would be diminished you know it would be taken out of our our hands locally so I I voted for it but I by no means have like issu with seven people on the council and and no one was running for so long and no one was stepping up so just for what it's worth um maybe people voted for different reasons voted down to five people but I just wanted to reiterate that thank you yes sir Mr McIntyre thanks har McIntyre 340 High distri Drive um you know clearly the people did vote and said let's get get this to five but I think we need to look Beyond just tonight just beyond the next year this is more of a long-term situation and when you compare this beautiful city you look at the number of of council members that have been on the board or on the council it's greater than communities much much larger than us having seven has prevented us from getting business done here we can get good business done five and the votes were supportive of having five council members I think every council member should pick one and not try to muddy this up people have asked for five and I'd encourage Council to stick to that thank you Mr rinty Mayor if I may interrupt your Charter in section 9.01 States upon adoption of the charter amendment by majority vote of the El Council shall have the amendment incorporated into the charter the revised Charter shall then be followed with the Flor Department of State and it will then be in effect that is how it reads in your chart um the chat the language from the for Statute in 16631 says adoption upon adoption of an amendment to the Charter of the municipality by a majority vote of the electors voting in a referendum upon such Amendment the governing body of said municipality shall have the amendment incorporated into the Charter and shall file the revised Charter with the Department of State all such amendments are effective on the dates specified therein or as provided in the charter the date specified therein was immediately effective upon adoption however with the language in your Charter stating that all proposed amendments um shall then be filed with the Department of State and then be in effect um that would U militate that the Department of State must have it transmitted to them um I'm not clear whether or not that has happened as Mr Mayor that in light of that and in light of the stalemate that we've been in for the past U few minutes here uh it may warrant tabling this matter to ensure that there's no issue thank you very much would someone like to table this particular agenda item I just one quick question if we didn't do that from what you stated earlier of the four we would still have to have three for one person um well uh that amendment was also part of the charter Amendment so I would recommend that you table this to well any concern on what is and is not effect based on the effective Amendment and we can ensure that all this is promply and diligently transmitted to the Department of State po so my recommendation would be we have a special council meeting uh prior to our work session on the 22nd that may well be soon with that Mr Banker no I think we should proceed as the agenda still States um and follow the charter as the charter so States I mean let me read to you what you guys voted on shall the city amend the charter to provide for a council composited of five at large council members including the mayor comma as opposed to existing language providing for a city council composite of seven at large council members including them May adjust the corresponding voting requirements for the council to take action question mark okay so it doesn't say we have to put this into effect today tomorrow next year we should have another meeting put this on the agenda to say that the five council members as the city electric voted should go into effect on a certain date that would be filing our Charter that would be following amendment to and the language in the amendment does provide the name which is again because there were four separate amendments all of which were functionally interated um and in my following the um following the election I did attempt to provide you with um not just the legal ease of it but a exposition of how it could how this process more my legal advice has been nothing in the charter mandated that you only fill a single position uh the that is ultimately at the discretion of this Council as the council is the lone body responsible for filling vacancies so when I when asked in my FAQ phrase the electorate approved a council of five members right I said yes but not right away there there shall be a city council and then I I referenced the language and explained that the transition is Complicated by the fact that you presently have the three vacancies if the council presently had all seven positions filled the council would transition to a five member Council during the November 2026 election had there not been any form six vacancies you would have transitioned at the November 2026 election and you can still transition at the November 2026 election if that is the desire of the council um you can conversely and and I said you can fill one 2 three and Sensibility being what it is um to fill with the even number um you you have that option my advice at this stage given that much of this is contingent on Charter amendments taking effect that we prompt we address the issue with the Department of State so there can be no question no challenge um you You' suggested tabling it to the 22nd I think mayor member bankard your statement of we have another meeting I think is consistent with what the mayor has recommended it's simply in dispute as to what we'll be doing on that day whether you're filling one two or three which I think this body will have the opportunity to not just go by the Mandate of the election but as you talk to your constituents and time maybe perhaps gain some clarity on where you think this may need to go but I I at this stage my advice to you would be to um to set this to a later date whether it be the 22nd or otherwise to avoid any issue um as um even a member of the council suggest that there may be legal challenges directed to these trer amendments well for clarity reasons putting three people on at night not would not be violating anything question at hand that voters voted on gave exclusive rights for the council to choose a time place and date to7 I'm not I'm sure that I agree with how that was phrased but correct that if you filled all three positions tonight that would not present an issue thank all right would someone if you like to table this I would if that's the case I would suggest making a motion I move that we table this until some day in the future I have a second are we going to do we want to make it a specific date it would be preferable to if given that we know we're convenient to read it may be preferable to state that and if we need to we can provide notice as appropriate so yes I think it would be my recommendation would be that we know we're already convening in two weeks perhaps setting that date to provide reasonable expectations and if we if we can't do it then then we can notice as appr did you get that I did and subject to that Envision then I would second that motion will is the maker of the motion willing to amend the motion to table it to the 22nd I am there a second on the floor all in favor no I I I all right let's take I don't think it is it is because it's not unanimous it's not oh you're just Ling it AR you I'm not loving it I'm loving what we presented to the people that we couldn't fill s spxs we have let's put people on at want to serve like why cast these people there's three great candidates were out there why did I I'm not trying to push you guys back on all I'm here is to give advice decisions we have three great people here let's put them on we would have had these problems for the record if you would have took my suggestion in December and put two people on instead of one even though we knew the vice mayor was leaving within two weeks so this councils put themselves in a Qui Mark not F Bank all I've done is follow the chart forgive me when we were discussing this also as somebody pointed out earlier very very very large majority of the other towns similar to us as well as larger towns and cities have five Commissioners or council members we were one of the few that had seven but nobody knows the real reason why it ever started with seven but clearly the majority of the towns and cities in pelis County at least have correct um I guess we're just stuck here until the 27 so we certainly do not have to stay stay here in a state of quantum indecision um if there is no clear majority there is no appointment made tonight and but a majority in this case actually is all four MERS if there's no if all four of you cannot come to an agreement then the matter simply fails and we can see if the matter can be Revisited as we we need not sit in scalemate if there's no U compromise or solution to be have between the parties okay well uh would you mind passing out the ballots and uh let's vote for three candidates and um see what happens miror I'm not clear on what the instruction is just so I know we can't um we cannot table because it requires a unanimous vote so we're still voting for one two and one two and three you just yes or no on all three candidates one two just yes or no council member Elliot would you like to weigh in she not she's not connected okay so from Lloyd Roberts selected David tenan yes Doug Prescott no and Anders W no mayor gtis selected no on all three council member Banker select gave them all one rating and I don't have council member Elliott's vote at this time and by defa just because of my no votes we'll still need member Elliot's votes reported as she has otherwise generally been present for this meeting she's intending to remain present we should have vort but I agree with the conclusion are you calling can you hear me now yes I do apologize for that but uh and I I must also apologize I miss what before the board the each council member has been directed to vote yes or no on the three candidates um you can vote Yes or No in any combination you so desire but uh the other members have voted and we need your vote for the record and what were the other votes everybody else voted on on a blind ballot it would be best if you stay just read your Rec your vote into the record oh I'm sorry um I apologize I thought the uh it had been discussed so um I would vote for one and Mr Wellings so that's a yes as to unders Wellings and no as to the other two is that correct yes and I don't really see that as no in terms of understood within the within the Paradigm within we that we're working in In This Moment understood with that mayor the matter fails at this point you have no clear we get we get the read of sure you read the last Doug Prescott no David tenan yes Andre Wells no from council member Roberts May gtis selected no on all three council member Banker selected one on all three and council member Shaw selected yes for Anders Wells and no for David tenan and D all right item 16 nomination and election of vice mayor by bot before we open this to the council let's go to the citizens for comments who would like to speak yes 12 8 Street Florida I would like to encourage this Council to nominate council member Roy robberts for vice mayor and to vote for L Roberts for vice mayor he's very highly respected in this community and is definitely an asset and that's what I hope the council does thank you thank you other citizens you like to speak yes sir J ver history I'd like to actually out for myself uh he is well respected he has the expertise he knows how to run the city and it's one others yes 111 his um I would like to also recommend Roberts to vote into the ice mayor position he does listen to Residents and concerns that they have to council and I feel he is the best candidate to provide support to the mayor and the citizens of Val Beach thank you other citizen comments yes Mr someone's not even close there's one person who works for the citizens in this adds up for this nomination there's one person who went and reached out to the attorney general when the beach umbrellas and shade was taken away from all of our citizens was one person who busted his back and took nothing but grief when he tried to protect the citizens of this city from motor boter and other motorized vehicles in the swim zones he was bifi I know the feeling but it doesn't stop him he performs every time he's prepared every time we just saw it tonight he knew the charter where's the rest of the people who supposed to know the charter where's the rest of the people that are supposed to be reading the ordinances there's one person who deserves to be the vice mayor he proven it time and time again the big Law Firm has the thing for the people there's one person for the people here Frank bankard is that person and you know what your vote for Frank bankard says a lot about you not about Frank because those of us who know what Frank does for the people we know that he's a fighter and whether he's vice mayor or he's the newest council member he's always going to be there for the citizens I holy endorse you Frank I hope that this Council does too it would be a great Buzz there thank you yes sir can St be 121 12 Street um I've never met Frank um he clearly knows um B um Beach the charter and he's a Frank outspoken paron the P person who says what it means that's what I like so we got my endorsement thank you yes ma'am um I strongly recommend Mr Benard because seen how he loves his job what he's doing with the situation of my house he came to me in that morning 7:00 in the house and said I'm going to look around and see where you leave let me take a look on the situation even he said Iris I can sit here with you and draft the lard and even he did not stop there he called pel's county is that correct Mr vaner and trying to resolve the matter he tried to hit the walls from me and for my family so you deserve that position and even better thank you for what you do I appreciate that God bless you thank you other comments all right citizen comments are closed all right um I'm going to need a motion from the council to nominate an elect a vice mayor someone like to make a motion motion motion made by Frank Banker uh do I have a second second second by Roberts Mr B you have the floor yes first of all um I really want to thank all the people that wrote in today yesterday um supporting me believe I'm over 40 residents and sent in emails um I didn't know there was a letter writing campaign told my neighor notified uh the city Friday um I got a bad foot I would have not um but uh I love this city right and I guess the mayor thinks I'm sticking it to him by not proceeding unlawfully this is this is the whole problem go read the newspapers and I'm not going to mention anybody's name but there's a guy that's sued done eating there's a guy that sued in madira Beach because they did it wrong some of this lawsuits were over $150,000 in Awards and damages I caught five airs actually six three just tonight on Charter Provisions that we were going to go now I think we should have a vice mayor that's loves the city not saying Roy doesn't he's a great man all right but someone that really wants to Serve the People lawfully and wants to get into what the city and Charter is all about if you don't want the charter I don't think you can remove it but you need to follow it we we have all these ordinances and the charter is for the council to follow like the Constitution of the United States so in in the State of Florida I mean I really it doesn't well I really would like to be vice mayor okay but it's just a title doesn't give me any more count but I think I deserve it I'm a senior council member here I volunteered 10 for 10 years at every event I've been asked for I've never I've missed one beach clean up since since the existence I mean sandbagging on there every year helping the residents out it has nothing to do with the vice mayorip it just shows that I am in tune with this city and love the city even though there's some people that hate me because I made alliances with some people they don't like what God told me to do that all right so if you have a problem with that go talk to Jesus Christ and God all right right I am glad I made alliances with people that uh other people don't like and I'm glad I can call other people residents friends whatever that is a great thing I think is Con like that's all I say council member ell do you have any comments um I do um uh I I want to say that um I will be voting for Mr Roberts but for uh several reasons one is part of this rule is to be able to assist the mayor and I think that that would be a good working relationship there the other side of it is that U I truly appreciate respect and encourage Mr Bard's Independence his diligence his expertise um there's no question in terms of his commitment and his his interest in doing the right thing um I think uh we can preserve that Independence and he can continue to be that voice that that um brings out the issues and um I just want to encourage that as well as the fact that I just want to get something resolved so that will be my vote thank you for your L comments um I um I won't say that I was on the fence but I was actually I up until today I wouldn't have had a problem with either person being the vice mayor um because I know the two gentleman on each side of you I know that they're going to go to back for the city they're going to do what they can for the city um and then I got a copy of an email where Frank Banker was asking for people to write in letters and he gave all the reasons why uh they should support it and get behind it and I was a little taken back with uh one of the sentences right in the middle of this huge look at me and all I've done paragraph um which was uh I further was able to move a change in our ordinance of the 5year look back rule by FEA until one year regarding cost of modification and damage to HS um what I realized was that I I don't see Mr Banker as a team player I see Mr Banker as someone who um it's his way or no way and um and it's this this letter made it all about him there was no team it wasn't the council did this it wasn't it wasn't about what a a great job this Council has done in the last few years and uh and how well we've worked together it was all about FR and it really uh it bothers me so unfortunately Brank after reading this I I will not be able to support you I realize we're not uh we're not going to reach a unanimous vote and um and respect everything that you do except for uh your your tactics of of dealing with this Council well I'm sorry but I've been researching the ordinances and Charter and I can't find the word teing um we voted we vote for seven people when I know okay with individual thoughts and damn me for having an individual thought okay um if you want a team let's reduce it to just a kingdom all right and then you can just get everything pasted okay but yes I did get counseling like I said to the person to move on that one year set setback and um we were we were going to wait until uh probably October November finally gets passed and I brought up at the last meeting it's on the audio that I did this and it we know exactly what you did and and that's fine I agree with you on it however um it's you have led everyone in this to believe that every one of these accomplishments on here is all about you tell me one which one is it I wrot no I wrote the letter I know tell me this is the one that that uh also you didn't know that there was an email campaign going on and right there it is I said I thank my neighbor for informing me there was going to be an email campaign Friday night I got an email from the city clerk I sent an email out uh Saturday okay all right well um and I think I think the emails clearly says over 40 to what seven or eight I mean but hey don't do what the voters want do what you want D that's right and I'm going to do what the voters want okay for that for now okay do we have any other comments coun I'm I appreciate the support that I got earlier tonight um I for one never send an email to anyone so I really feel good about the fact that people were writing to the city unsolicited so thank you to whoever did those I appreciate um as the mayor said he feels comfortable that both of us have the skill sets the knowledge the capability to do this job um I I know I can and and would love to have the opportunity there was and I wasn't going to really delve into this email cuz I got the same email as the mayor did but the final sentence is the one that made me very not happy which said that he was the only council member that did not say that we view this as a thankless job I have never said that in my life nor would I ever but the most important thing that I feel the best about regarding what I was able to achieve here at the city was the fact that when I was elected and I I just kind of wondered why in our meeting that we did not open the meeting with a prayer of invocation and when I brought it up other people supported it Frank supported it but that that just needed to happen because when we had this meetings I I'm confident that when we open it with a prayer he's listening and he's happy that we're involving him in this meeting and we're asking for his help and direction so that was a huge thing and it makes me feel fulfilled that we were able to do that thank you any other comments from the council no all right uh let's take it to a vote for council member Elliot would you like to record your vote for the record Mr Roberts council member bankard voted for bankard mayor gtis voted for Roberts and council member Roberts voted for Roberts thank you all right so we're obviously not getting anywhere on this uh I would say that we need to add this agenda item to uh the 22nd meeting also Mr MOA are you uh are you sure that uh the data will have been transmitted from our election results we will make every effort to see that that is done if there's any reason that can't be done in that timeline we will leave that all right thank you very much all right now we'll move over to item 17 I SPL two council members for

an amendment to pity Bank agreement for Consulting Services related to utility undergrounding and approval to execute purchase order Mr reer thank you mayor so this um this is an amendment to the pig agreement that we signed in September of 2022 um which allowed us to be the IND each contract with uh utility Consultants of Florida um at the pricing that um they submitted to Indian Rocks um um you UCF is the agation so UCF has done our conduit for um for Duke Energy phases one and they're also charged to do the cond installation for Phase 2 um this um they've volunteered to give us a price after seeing The Binding cost agreement from Spectrum um to do the which would be north of cosmic Boulevard east side of GF Boulevard with the remaining segment of spectrum communication that needs to be undergrounded they came in um Spectrum offered to do it with their um subcontractors for about 90,000 and uh UCF came in below that but in order to honor um the very great pricing that they provided um we had to do an amendment to the to the piggyback agreement um the benefit to them though is they're already out there they're already mobilized they are doing the condo for Dukey or P so so then they um they feel that um you they've worked with the city for a long time and also their benefit to make sure that no other subcontractors out there installing the conduit they can possibly hit their Duke Energy conduit um so this is just an amendment to that agreement which again allows us to use the pricing um and then the following agenda item is the actual Spectrum approval for once um UCF puts the conduit in the ground then the remaining devices first PVE on their wires and connect them all which you see if can't do it the utility company need to do that so um I included the original payback agreement and then the estimate um for installation from Spectrum are are the the estimate for a UCF and um for your review and then the amendment was directed by our City attorney thank you let's go to the citizens for comment anyone like to speak on this topic citizen comments are closed uh I need a motion from the council to authorize the city manager to amend the piggyback agreement and to execute the purchase order so Mo motion made by Lloyd Roberts second by Frank Banker Mr Roberts you have the floor yeah I mean it's obviously a significant cost savings to me it's no rer this V council member Elliott um I could use a little more information so we know that Spectrum bid 90,000 then the UCF came in at $1600 less than that so I understand those numbers the total request is for almost $150,000 so uh explain to me what the difference is are you looking at um which item are you looking at cuz if you look at the first item that we were just discussing um yeah they came in below what spectrums um sub contractors quoted um so the piece that UCF would be doing would be the 88358803 the next item that that is the remainder of the cost so um so as opposed to paying Spectrum which I believe they a WR for their quote to install and wire um was 23658 so it's 90 90,000 even so we still that second item is just a remainder of the cost to actually wire once the conduit installed is this the project that we received a grant for we get reimbursement from penny for pillas okay so it's not exactly a grant but it's dedicated funds and it was dedicated for beautification projects so a lot all right thank you any other questions no all right let's vote all in favor I any oppos Miss Elliot I didn't hear your vote five okay motion passes Mr reer you made rece all right uh number 23 consider author authorizing the execution of a purchase order the Charter Communications Mr Reaper I think you just covered this but this is just um per our purchasing um requirements you know over a certain amount needs to be approved by city council this is a a a purchase order that only uh Charter Communications can actually offer for the service so it's just the official approval to execute the pur order to get the all right thank you very much citizen anyone like to speak on this topic says the comments are closed I need a motion from the council to authorize city manager to execute this purchase order Roberts in favor Mr Roberts comments um is this Mark Mark Porter with the utility Consultants of Florida right and then spectum communication um I'm his name right now but yeah um they're this is to finish up their job right side I had met with him before um very skilled understands what we need to do Mr I'm suppor any other comments I just want to mention also when we did the South um of C Boulevard section and we used the Spectrum subcontractor we did end up in a lot of delay things left open for very long submission submiss okay council member Elliott do you have any comments no thank you all right let's take it to a vote all in favor I I all right the motion passes Mr Reaper thank you 24 unfinished business do we have any unfinished business all right seeing as we have no unfinished business let's go to council comments I'm GNA start off with um council member Banker thank you Mr Mayor tonight I was accused of not being a team member guilty is charged I play Junior Hockey in Canada in my youth along with baseball they're team sports I further served administrations of business the word team can resonate there too team again I don't see it in our Charter ordinances Actually I don't even see it in the Constitution of the United States or Florida more importantly we all ran here nonp party we don't even have a party to associate ourselves with we in hell is team driven in this city so what will votee my conscience going forward as I've done in the past and I will do the best of my ability to follow the laws of this city and our Charter but more importantly the oath I took office tonight I will follow to the letter of the law and just for the record I didn't say anything about honoring a team under my oath thank you let's go to council member Roberts yes sir um I think teamwork is very very important I don't think it necessarily has to be written anywhere it's an understood benefit to the city and we should always try to work in that format a little while ago uh when we were still in this four person uh Council we we were confronted with a challenge that um I really felt for our mayor because I know this isn't something that he wanted to do but at that time it was really the only way to move things forward and we actually negotiated for lack of a better term in the world we live in we should never be negotiating we should be voting just like Frank is saying you vote your heart you vote your mind and we move forward I I know there were citizens in our city that expressed concern over that and I'm confident that once we get our Council set with whatever the correct number is we I don't believe we'll ever be confronted with that situation again and that will be a wonderful time thank you thank you Mr Roberts council member Elliott I would just say briefly that we are a team in the sense that we're all equally committed um to pursuing the best interests of this community acting as fiduciaries um to work on behalf of our citizens and uh at the same time we are independent in the sense that we do have a responsibility to vote our own voice and I respect Mr Banker's uh Independence and uh pursuit of what he believes to be right thank you Miss ellot now I'll call on vice mayor oh yeah we don't have one uh so uh just like to thank everyone for coming out and making it through this I know it was painful tonight and uh I apologize uh hopefully we'll get some things resolved on the 22nd whenever our Charter is officially um changed until then we'll see you on the 22nd do I have a motion to adjourn how about a second second oh yeah all in favor I I good night everyone n"
