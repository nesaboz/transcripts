    "transcript": "all right we're going to move right home into the next meeting the work session so it's now 5 17 P.M I think September 19 2022 this is DC Council work session please rise in the morning the United States of America and to the Republic of which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice thank you anyway would you please call council member Frank Banker president council member Leslie Notaro here council member Lloyd Roberts here council member Jody Shirley your council member Mike zabel your vice mayor Glenn Gunn present mayor Dave Gattis interim city manager Kyle riefler and City attorney Randy Mora president tonight discuss the reviews and this was introduced by interim city manager so uh would you like to uh thank you so this is the ordinance that uh Workshop through here the council's opinions on how it's set up and say Republic Greece do it and hopefully have a first reading in the October city councilman all right um did you know yeah that's right absolutely I can provide a little more detail we last met substantively on this topic on August 15th there was a significant discussion where we were joined by staff from FWC to discuss this matter and work through your auctions at the time the general consensus says I understood it from this body understanding that doesn't represent every individual member's view was to establish a vessel exclusion Zone that would be restricted to manually powered vessels only there was a balance between not just restricting to motor but if somebody had a wind power vessel operating under power when that was the desire was impossible to regulate them looking at the interplay of the Florida Statutes at 33 27 46 with the Florida Administrative Code it is my legal opinion that you do have the ability to regulate in that fashion and that you do have the ability to regulate in that fashion under you may recall that there were two separate dichotomies it was 1v3 where you would a 327 46 1v3 where you could regulate based on your own discretionary ability to regulate versus um one excuse me one C which is where you would have a quasi-judicial showing of some kind of competent substantial evidence to justify we're operating in the first area where it's your discretion has structure and and the way that works out is in 1B it said it provides that a community can establish an ordinance establishing a vessel exclusion Zone if the area is designated as a public bathing Beach or Swim Area Public bathing beaches is not a defined term in the statute and we do enjoy humble powers and it's been for this purpose to stop defined as a vessel exclusion Zone limited to vessels under power unmanually power and that's all set forth in the various whereas or exordial plazas of the ordinance as drafted so this tries to capture that it provides some of the there was some good language in your private work it's about exceptions for emergencies preventing more into any any buoys or regulatory markers made to establish this area and so we've kept what was desirable about them this ordinance aims to fulfill the desires of this body to balance the interests of the beach going and recreating public with those uh the boaters and other vessels on your Waters and so that's what this does less anybody be thinking well this is hastily prepared this is again just for for your reminder the third go at an ordinance to regulate this and reconcile the city's code with these the existing statutory and Regulatory frame and so that's and this approach is based on the direct input of the council as it received the feedback of its residents and articulated what it believed to be consensus thank you Mr Laura I don't have any comments from the council uh yes again this has been going on for quite a while and what we have done here is listen to the citizens to experts to various parties and it resulted in a balanced product you may not all like where this went but we believe that it gives a good balance between number one safety and Paramount to the ability to play with your grandkids in the surf with a floating or you know show them how to paddle a kayak but remember in the end this was done by the liberative body this is not a rubber stamp this is not a knee-jerk response this is a give and take between adults being voted for we had varying opinions we've worked through them we agreed to frankly disagree but in the end it came down to this and frankly I believe in this plan and I'm going to vote that being proceed with it other comments all right I uh I only have one and uh I don't know if everyone else received this or not I a letter that I received from Cliff Gibbons this is not necessarily reflect my opinion but I thought and I will bring it up okay what I see is instead of every 100 yards it's every 280 yards personally I think that's that's too little I mean it's a hard part I think that it would be confusing but I want to refer this out to the council and see what I've made it off just to uh see if we were on the same page about it or not the earth I may as I understand the proposed revision you've received that deals with the particular placement of the buoys in relative to one another there's nothing in this ordinance that specifically addresses one buoys distance from the other the 100 yards is in section c says C sub 1 and it says this area shall extend a hundred yards from the city Shoreline into the Gulf of Mexico says now this portion of the ordinance doesn't address the number or precise placement of the buoys just that they will be at a range of 100 yards from the shoreline and then otherwise would be in compliance with whatever the regulatory scheme that is permissible so the precise placement of movies one relative to the other is not addressing so it's not an arrest at all so the extent 100 yards is used to establish what zone from roughly the shoreline we were talking about to give a general expectation how they will be marked placed and appear as part of the administrative process so thereafter and what he's asking is to answer at 250 yards north and right now we're at 100 yards is that right Mr Reaper that's great question you say does any state is that an FWC um 100 yards and it seems like the spacing at least some feedback when you get um it is correct that that would ultimately be based on administrative input again as it was not part of the precise charge with this ordinance item specifically addressed that I have that they see in front of me most of it is we will see a plan review a plan and enter into an internet dialogue if there is a specific there's a specification it's a specifications for markers some of the specifications include that they must not be less than 36 inches above the water a sign suspended above the water must have been a minimum of 25 foot clearance from the main high water mark none of this goes to I'm not saying a precise yard marker Yardley marker but of course we would work through that process with the permitting quality just as when you talk about events you say I generally want it on this line not necessarily how far each ghost would be for each of us okay all right so the way I see it and this this ties our hands and we insert this language whereas if we leave it the way that you've written it and in this direction my recommendation is to pass this one over this one a recommendation and there was another I mean amendment number two which was to know that says provide however the watercraft intending to Anchor at a location within the defined safety area May proceed in Iowa speed or Anchorage or that I don't think as possible possible at all so that one is a no-go also does everyone agree I agree all right Frank actually I think section 30-144 prohibits any votes to Anchor near the beach and as people think we'll check in for two decades now this one this would be a language inserted I see what he was trying to do he looks to me like he's trying to do a deal where if we put in less buoys and we insert this language to allow for us to come up to the shore but I don't think that that's possible well right now section 30-144 of iodine 3 motorized watercraft shall not be prepared to be launched and treated more Underdog and beach at any kind except for authorized Coast Guard police fought our rescue um this is 30-141 yes member member Banker is pointing to another section of code so that would be another area that would have to be modified and at National in the book for two decades I believe Mr Mayor okay all right thank you very much one other thing Mr Mayor the curved abilities right now I believe were 100 yards in the low means tie Mark so they wouldn't have to be changed and moved they would only have to be uh stickered properly with the correct Verge correct okay provided that their current construct is sufficient that a sticker is all that is needed make sure because if we find that some for some reason their designer or structure is no longer a permissible design structure you may have to replace that but if there are existing structure is sufficient then yes a state or more for me like this right cool um Lloyd Roberts um just a clarification so that some of those buoys may have moved over time and when we use the reference they're about 100 yards on the shoreline a little bit earlier you mentioned the main type ymr interesting measurement but uh so I'm assuming it doesn't have to be exact when we say 100 yards is approximately 100 yards was completely the shoreline moves your mind size low tide correct so correct and no structure in the water unless it is absolutely cement is static right and so it's not precise but it is to establish a reasonable expectation by the Beachbody public of what to exists yes um I'm looking at um 3144 so three motorized watercraft this is nothing in the subsection shall prohibit the temporary launching or Mooring of any water bath exclusively by human power or the wind we need to modify that um since we're talking in subsection 3 B3 on here vessels are good for sales they entered the marked area only if the sales are mechanical needs of propulsion is not in use we need to do this so so we can before I I did sort of a and this is the global effect of all of this I wanted to make sure this if you will as a direction we wanted to go one thing you custom may customarily see and in ordinances like this is that it supersedes any provision and conflict here with while we're in section 30 it may be worthwhile to amend this ordinance to remove anything in a subsequent section like the section that member Notaro and earlier member Banker pointed to is still within section 30 of your code and it's entitled prohibited activities and it has a series of prohibited activities on your beaches and Waters like open fires or grills possession of consumption of alcohol whatever it is one of which concerns motorized vehicles and Improvement while we do this to in the first reading habit how to expanded slightly to include harmonizing those prohibited activities with how this changes I just didn't want to have a series of global edits that we would do if this if this did not gain traction at this stage but that is uh that feedback is well placed and appreciated and mayor just so you know I think the member baker has his entries together all right I'm sorry about that uh okay thank you any other Council comments nope vice mayor God no I have no copies I think we've got to beat this one in death and I'm all formed when we've already discussed I agree uh the general consensus is that what I'm here foreign ers [Music] first thing that I noticed um yesterday price we had two potential applicants and just just contacted us so I asked her to as resumes and applications come in to more information about an application but resumes come in he just passed them off to the council and everyone knows how to discuss with each other I think it's a good idea to always keep our eyes open if direction we're heading because you never know the right person may just accidentally land in our lab so the what we're trying to do now is here what's the what's the path what do we how do we want to approach this and we'll start this up again we want to wait a while uh thoughts all right um I'll tell you up front I was the deliver point for 140 000 salary because you know after hiring people it wouldn't work it out there is a like and to get some of these bad Calgary yeah you're going to have to pay that much second one is the approach it he canceled thinking that if we hire this person then we demand or we want to see metrics how much money did you bring in there's frankly you really can't um you just can't expect somebody you know I want to hire you a city manager but I want you to bring in at least fifty thousand dollars a year a gram I'm not saying the council said but I'm saying that's our example but my primary thought is this right now stop and search now we have completed the service or committees and council with all the due diligence nobody can ever accuse us a slacking interactive some called for an executive Search company my take is that would take at least twenty thousand dollars with no guaranteed outcome and it passed would already consider candidates we previously discarded and potentially a high salary like the last official now if you've noticed over the past three months that despite Nature's most viewed efforts the city has not burnt down flooded nor you know disappeared into a giant camera the existing team is doing its job but Kyle needs a constructive way ahead everybody talked about mentoring well it's there here's what it proposed I can contact Ms Lynn Tipton under Florida League of cities and the icma they have a group of experienced former city managers that can work with Kyle bus mentors and basically the free cost they can establish a training plan and offer mentoring now the Florida Legal cities obviously could reach back I don't know have you ever completed email one email two no no I think we need to get you to those courses uh they're outside okay um I'm just saying we saw saying managers but we can look at efforts other errors kind of thing outside of the box with this one now the next one is you know many comments were made about distinct you know his record from others but one thing that at least was pointed out was the lack of a master's degree they're available out there and we have the city council at a minimum people that are leaders in our respective Fields our recommendations can go a long way toward getting them accepted into a program tuition assistance look I need a bigger event and obviously the goal to him kind of saying that you know if you leave within four years after the completing the degree you know obviously you have to pay back of most of the fees even though we put out but it would strengthen the path forward and accounts would have a very firm idea how we're moving again you know don't bring us problems we're trying to bring a solution in this case um but that's what I want to bring across uh so right now I am definitely voting you know not to continue with the city manager search but to a program to move Kyle forward in that direction thank you thank you other council members mayor Frank Baker um since before we even started the search for uh city manager I recommended that we move Kyle right into the position when we discuss it mentoring I believe mentor and Hunter been reads for at least two or three years um one council member said that last meeting said he didn't burn down and it hasn't burned down he's done an excellent job he's he's provided uh insight and magistrative hearings and he's done his homework on that he spent all the qualifications that we put on the website to fulfill our board that we send for investigation of these applicants came back I think he was a number three or four for the candidacy uh does he have a master's degree no it is the words of Elon Musk have made a couple of dollars in this country when he say a few months ago there's too many mbas running companies in the uh America that are running them into the ground I don't think you need a master's degree and I don't know what you get a master's degree in I mean the last guy we were thinking about hiring we need to have a message agreement philosophy what's that going to do for the city of Delaware Beach I think we should stop the search right now I don't have a problem with with continuing education put something together and give Kyle a job this is an apple musician he doesn't fulfill it because there's problems we can always replace them I'm not trying to be disrespectful Kyle I'm 100 for you but um I think we spent enough time enough money in this thank you thank you very much any other comments Roy Roberts I did take the opportunity early on I talked to a friend of mine who has a big little league together and he was the city manager for a town in Texas for 36 years which is almost unheard of anybody that's familiar with that world to the town of Bernie Texas one of the so I asked them I said you know what what options would you take I gave them all the background data and I said so in your opinion what are some different ways we could receive one of the ways that he recommended which would actually protect Kyle if that's the direction we as the council decided to go which was a formalized six-month period of time in this case for Kyle to be the city manager at which time we as a council would actually vote on as to whether or not [Music] um he did or he was able to obtain the things that we thought you should do so that's what we basically based on however it protects them from you know Frank was saying it's a position of Will and we don't like what he does and he's fired but then he's on the street which is not any fun for anybody however with this option at the end of six months we would either formalize that he is the city manager or not and that the answer was not he would go back to the official interim position we would go out and look again and at that time Kyle would have the option of going back to his previous position instead of not being employed so I think that is a is a softer approach again if he counts of the sides to go that route with final I think Mr Mora you know gave us some great ideas and options I guess a few or several weeks ago from the Florida Legal cities with people that were experienced city managers and are potentially looking for other opportunities so that is an area I think we could pursue as well so just some thoughts Lincoln my recommendation is the data braver in the city manager of Journal search that doesn't necessarily mean that we have to choose a path right now it's just take a breather maintain spins boom one of the issues you have here right now is Kyle's working he's the other city manager and he's still holding the public works he's a stakeholder in his decision as the New York City Manager to all the discussions we're having right now and we need to bring him into the circle because the question is if we try to give a probation Ary period he got this guy tried to hold two jobs down right now and while he's he's doing it well right now the question is is how long can he maintain that pace okay so if we talk in a probationary period he needs some options here if if at the end of the probationary period you decide that you want to choose another path and put this back out on the street well if Kyle has a backfilled Public Works position all of a sudden he doesn't have any place to move back to so we need to bring him in here as a stakeholder and start getting his opinion on this thing but that's that's the issue as I see it right now is just like uh Mike zabel has stating that the world hasn't been flooded my recommendations would just take a breather right now maintain status quo we don't need to choose a path let's think about this let's bring Kyle into the circle and figure out what his needs are and what his recommendations are thanks all right thank you very Shirley yeah so um all great conversation you know thank you for that was great but I do I do fall back on the latest cities the icma senior advisors not in a they're not um they would be someone to come alongside us to help us determine what the next best path these are retired City officials that have experience back building positions like this they are not necessarily going to be the people who hire but more so an advisor to come in advisory verb to come in and assist us as council members on how to move forward so I don't think we should rush over that thought process in the end you still have one position open whether it is a city manager position Forum tiles existing conditions the needs of the systems the right person back for those positions and I think it's something we we should reach out to senior advisor advisor group and find some support in making decisions thank you we've been through this we went through 30 whatever resumes applications and we came up with the top four we offered one kind of the job he that didn't work out one guy I just took another job so he was we still got two other people we had said that all four of those were acceptable we've got Kyle he's been on what you want to say of practice run being interrupting manager he's done a great job I don't see why we need to go back to Ground Zero I think we should offer them anyone else all right my thoughts are first off I am impressed so far however they know that I can't speak for the entire city and I have had a lot of input from people around the city or as some people say I want a man as the city manager and either way the longer this goes on the more unfair it is we're going to have to figure something out of sales so quickly Mr River how's your workloaded at this time I'm getting it done I'm putting some extra time here wherever I can both responsibilities of the jobs and you're aware of the risk that we would be taking if you need a higher someone for power works for that side of things yes that that is a risk I assumed when I first put my application in I feel that a business and the fact that as a city manager I need that position I can hold out I can do both jobs but I would if I was on a probationary period I would like have that weighted in that I am no right-handed person she delegated for in that position scale and what is your thoughts about bringing in as as early said bringing in advisory to someone to sort of help guide us in the correct direction I'm all for that thank you Council um my priority here obviously for the city but again bringing somebody along first responsibility is not to Kyle but to us to make sure that he does not feel that we give him every possible tool that we know of to help them succeed Congressman Shirley's idea about the answer to be absolutely that's another tool that can be used to either assist us or assist him we can also go back to them and we have questions before about Brands and stuff and so there's no reason that we can't use that as well but again I want to make sure you succeed regardless of what step will likely to me this master's degree I know so many people put that down but you know frankly um I've gotten to where I am in life you know two master's degrees because that's actually experience that has talked with Professionals in their field the give and take of the atmosphere where you actually do learn not everybody's neon musk I'll be the first to admit that but frankly the majority of successful people in the world have gone through with the process and that's where they pick up the additional connections the education that will take them much farther in life and that's what I want to see Kyle I want to see the success at the end of his career when he looks back and goes I made the right path I protected my family my city and myself Roberts again early on I did talk with Lynn Reeves about because he had told me previously that he was in a similar scenario I believe he took the city manager job but it took and he said six months prior to his his position which is your current position feel so I asked him I said well how did that go I said well you know just just like I said I made it through it so I asked Kyle actually early on because he had um a fair amount of time in his current position as her life was a better title of Public Works director I said could you actually do both positions and we didn't backfill your current position and he said well if you pay me more salaries you'll get two in this case he said he said actually he said you know I would love to think I could but it's just too big of a task he said I could do it for a short period of time which is what he's been doing now he's been doing it really well I believe as well the only thing in the back of my mind and again nothing against at all I agree he's doing a great job if we put it off a little bit when my thought was what if you know a couple of really really again micro better term walk on water type candidates send some information in but we've decided to not to pursue anything at this time and then those type of people then move on to something else you know we miss out on the opportunity to thought so that's that's the kind of thing that went through my head I did see a couple of those resumes I didn't actually open them up yet where people would act unsolicited applying for the position they didn't really know whether or not we're pursuing it at this time but that was one of my thoughts when Glenn was talking about respect his opinion a lot that if you know some people were out here thinking man I'd love to have that job and again if they were just like well from a lawyer type of candidates and we miss out on that opportunity that may not be in the best interest of the city thank you when I asked my wife to marry me I was very concrete this is what we're going to do I wasn't Holding Out for a better off right good decision exactly the key here is the whole approach about oh my God what if what if what if what maybe construct the decision we're getting Kyle the keys in the city right now but I'm not going to have second dance without our decision we've got due diligence I'm not worried about something better maybe down the road if I worried that it wouldn't divorce day one [Music] so that's where I kind of stand on this I mean you go this direction we provide all the tools needed to ensure a success moving forward wind gun look what I said maintain the students quote it doesn't mean that if an opportunity to fell on your laps and wouldn't count on us because flexibility is the key to a decision in many cases so if if a golden opportunity to go forward our labs certainly come up with some sort of action I I don't mean to rule out any possible action I'm just saying okay stay a breather there's no Russians I am in favor of Judy Shirley's recommendation the icma has those people who are willing to step forward and assist us in any way possible we're not capitalize on that as well at the same time Frank Baker I really believe we are on a very very slowly smoke right here we have an internal city manager to bring two jobs for four months and be doing them well if I was him I'd be throwing my resume out to everyone that's looking for a city manager right now and giving two weeks notice when I get hired because everyone on this Council except Leslie and Mike right now seem to have a possibility but let's see if somebody better comes along hey call Kyle doesn't have any nail holes in his hands I'm sure he's not Jesus Christ okay he's a human being is is the more expressive asset you can counsel me when I ask him how he's doing his job um but yeah this is I'll tell you we could end up with nobody uh and if I was Mr if I was with the Raceway are we looking for a job right now outside the city the way I've been treated and Kyle I hope you don't I can do the best with the county for you I received one email negative email about you because you were too young I think there's I don't know how old you are but uh you have one of the greatest governors in the state he was 39 years old when he was elected still believe it's been a long time since I had ninth grade civics we don't have to be 35 to be the president of the United States uh I'm all for continuing education I think tonight we should sit down work out and deal with Kyle and keep them here under a contract [Music] recommendation to contact a senior advisor with the icma was multi-purpose that person might just advise us and meet with Kyle and give and be an advisor to Kyle the choices to use to hire Kyle as the student manager but I don't believe any of us have seen management experience don't think that we're the best choice to Mentor Kyle maybe that's what that senior advisor does but we don't know we don't know what we don't know and I think it would be very beneficial to have a couple a team of senior advisors that have experience that can help us through this we'll add to that word is out communicate with it would be irresponsible of us to ignore the president answers that come in I think I would like to see his resumes passed off into each of us as they do come in because there may be somebody even if we decide that Kyle is the right person for city manager he may be the right that this candidate may be the right person for Public Works we just don't know so so I'm I'm going to ask all council members University look at every resume that comes in and if you feel that there's someone that is very strong and you want to have a conversation please contact Kyle pay and ask for a special meeting if before you do it then we have a special meeting that's kind of the way it works I'm not saying that that's going to happen but again I think it would be irresponsible for us to ignore any resumes that come in from here out in the meantime my recommendation would also to be to move forward with the icma and ask for help we have an original deadline to get resumes in a date and if so why are we getting these resumes in now they know we didn't hire D in the first match I think the one individual that indicates that he saw that and then maybe we didn't hire the last hire us and there was some correspondence yes I I already I just think of those as unsolicited things we had an RFP put out and with the deadline and these are just basically have some listening so I think can I translate that it's request for proposal that's what we're looking forward to being done and uh no we stopped it but companies think hey I got a great idea so they submit what's called an unsolicited RFP in hopes that uh the company the aggressive team will look at it and hire him for work adults anyone else it's the general consensus here my CMH reach out to the icma what's your thoughts on continuing to receive our oral planning to pass off resumes as they come in you'd like to see them I would I would like to see them yes okay for going your hands raised no I agree with what you just suggested proceed with the icma and disseminate any unsolicited resumes that come in all right let's move on to item number three it's just for clarification I will contact you will contact us today oh uh yeah actually any of us could reach out to the nicely but uh um as I have established relationships with the senior advisor program and others that way to avoid any suggestion or application that if you are unduly influencing the process but I reach out to say I've received direction from my client that they wish to Major advisory Services both to evaluate where they are and advise what directions in any patient consider going would that be a fair representation of his life yes that's why we keep you around I'm happy yes thank you very much all right now let's move on to item number three this is Express guidelines for our residents regarding handyman work and licensed contract to work I added this on to the agenda because we received a brief presentation or explanation from Debbie clinic on what we could and what we couldn't do and in some cases I think we all agree in other cases we [Music] small jobs some of these small jobs are the only thing that to make it's what makes living here for some people for if we have to hire a licensed contractor for every little job at Stephanie class and um many people live here because to get that licensed contractor out here I job you're willing to pay three or four times the amount that you should be paying for that job because he's just going to take a bigger job to make the same amount of money and that's my thoughts on it I'm not even a real sure how we address this but I think that to start to start out with maybe we should establish some directors he wants to do thoughts absolutely um I'd like to reach back a little bit further frankly where he's falling down is the condition of the various properties in this city some areas Property Owners I say that property owners now Rebels a property owners that failed to take care of your property when you leave your trash out all the way you leave refuge in your front yard when you fail to paint pressure treated lumber on stairs or your front fascia these are the problems that dramatically hit our property nice and these are the items that we should be conscientiously following up on and making sure that well we don't require a gold-plated dolphin I think we all know where that is I'm Gulf Boulevard after that we do want to make sure that we have private ownership one of the first things my dad ever told me I mean I grew up in a trailer but he said when he decide to move somewhere always look at the conditions of the property of people that will be your neighbors if they're not taken care of get the hell out of Dodge if they have private ownership that's the neighborhood you want to be a part of and it tends to increase it everybody takes care of the property is equals but again that's reaching back I want to make sure he does more of that instead of kind of interfering in the property owners basic right to repair their items not everybody is like Mr Baker myself I mean we can you know wire outlets do pretty much anything around the house but there are those small things that are not code related they are not touching and being pounded okay they found yes but apparently look people bang their door you open this door too much all sudden you've got a big hole in your drywall and you really don't want to put one of those little rubber stoppers that kind of grew over if you want it just done nicely and that's the niche that these people work with them they're amazing they do a work and value work for a good value and everybody's happy thank you thank you Frank maker well said Mr Sable um I I really you know I help my neighbors out from anywhere from Plumbing to some expenses and what I'm hearing um that's not allowed because I'm a hanging man like some other people in McAlester maybe uh and I agree with Mikey we want to be looking at series construction work or I mean a guy coming out charging an air conditioning unit because it's a pound loan and a Freon I don't think we need a license he had well first of all yesterday what I'm saying is uh Mike said it well best uh I think we should latch somebody's code enforces I've got complaints I know a few Mr Mayor try to complaints with just putting down some Italian group work floors in a little shed I think that's a little bit ridiculous to have our president ever had thank you thank you so part of the problem is that we have a sheriff doing code enforcement he's John he's done with the job of enforcing the law these are all construction logs and you know the gentleman with the Italian group floor um he was breaking the law I mean look I'm very sympathetic to what happened there and an officer encounters a his job is enforced the law so he was in it he reported it to CL bank which is the licensing board for construction and lived in Pinellas County and there was a fine given to the gentleman and a citation it's difficult this is not this is beyond Bel Air Beach right so maybe you have some of our ordinances might interfere but this is uh this is Pinellas County Licensing Board it hasn't these these tough decisions that you have to have a licensed contractor are not our code it is the licensing board and look some of the things that are coming out I'm guilty of you know of course I can say they're working under my license but still I'm guilty of having someone out there fixing grout on the back pool deck or whatever that wasn't a license that was just doing the handyman work you know there are a lot of handyman and you work on next door they're you know Pages up on looking for work clearly everyone's guilty of this um I don't know how we solve it I'm glad you brought it up because it is a problem I don't know how we solve it but I think that as long as you have a deputy doing code enforcement it's always going to be a conference right are we going to turn you know a blind eye to to this issue it's an issue the city's done and I've just figured out but I don't know how we do that and I'm not saying Turn blind I've witnessed firsthand the entire homes inside and out being a completely remodeled with no permitting whatsoever walls formed all the way down to the frame new electricity okay so that's not what I'm talking about I'm not talking about major construction projects I'm I'm talking about a little job the Deuce's job you want to you want to track open a couple of chance of pain and paint your living room but you have three or four holes in your wall that need to be repaired and you're not you're not a drywall guy so what do you do are you supposed to uh you've got to hire a licensed contractor to fulfill those holes or or are we I'll give you another example I had some work done and there's a hole in my wall and I had to have it patched and had an artist come back and do the finish work because the type of paint kind of didn't come out probably she shouldn't been there based on what I'm finding out she was paying the ball but it was according to what our employment the last week she shouldn't have been there without a license as an artist which kind of ridiculous she's laying down to hand his friends [Music] I actually did have a conversation with Kyle not too long ago and I was trying to find it here real quick but I think there were fours four or five specific um tasks that are actually identified that said these four do not require for me and I think Floyd was actually one of the non-statement yes so flooring does not require the permit so I don't know what happened with that one issue that it was time it was actually okay yeah but you know there's only four things that were identified I think there's an opportunity there and I was happy to see um that Mr Moore is going to go through our both code and ordinance um document because it really is one way to help that would be I'm kidding we listed 127 different items that we feel did not require a permit unless of course um as Jody said earlier if if the county requires it we cannot we cannot go over power them on that one they're the ones that dictate it so we said yeah no no programming required for this and the county said yes there is a permanent choir we can't say there's not I don't even think it's permeating so much that we're referring to because it works we know what that is right okay it's the those are critical items like what I'm saying in advance we set a club in our code document that this is okay but the county said not okay that they could say based on their rules but anyway I think you know we could list sometimes more information is better so if we had a longer list of City approved tasks that could be done either by the homeowner or a friend or anyone whoever yeah then they can be done I still think it's a great idea that each and every time citizens understand that they need to come to the city first just to find out if it's a yes or no because it's only there to protect them they saw this particular tense was okay to just doing their own and Kyle knew well actually that has to be approved by the county so you do need to come with us through us first and then we have to contact the County you need to contact the County to let them know what you're going to do I'm going to assure you they're never going to make that call is that anyone that is afraid that they may accidentally trigger yeah you've got the contact if you do it if you don't come and check with us first and then there's a problem later on that's far worse and some of them to get far worse yeah but again as long as you can come oh yeah but again those issues are arising the matters of code that are basically kind of understandable person they'll shot it not put in a main panel I don't see you know bringing down the street going you know I'm at Lowe's see the main panels over there if I had one of those suckers I could put Outlets everywhere these are the we just looked at those as simple jumps and we can be specific in the code if you're doing limited drywall Hatchery models um you know create a new piece of fascia to replace the water you know these are the things that fall under the homeowners it was exceptional but you know called the Lowe's Home Depot Etc that people can do with an adequate regime if they can come in and do the work I work you know your neighbor hold on one second I'm going to call and playing gun again I've lost our clarify something almost go ahead of Mr gun yeah indeed the council is starting to get a little too prescriptive in this thing you're starting to manage Botox again and you need to back up because I've said before that code enforcement is a one process that splices through all of the city's currently safety and health and standards Community all of it and as as to invest my knobs we don't have any structure or guidelines you've got a guy with dags running around and forcing coding forcing but I don't think he's got the oversight the direction of their guidance as necessary for this program it's a very important program that touches everybody and is very very important but there's there's no structure to them right now and rather than starting to get too prescriptive about tongue and groove or drywall or place an electrical subject I think it's time to back up and start figuring out you know who provides the oversight one of the priorities and provide some written guidelines and direction for your person who's going to be out on the screen before it's against Trump because in the bit in that back you would lack of or any guy's correction it's being made up as it goes along and it's going to change every day us do we as a city do we want to allow unlicensed handyman to do work in this community or did we walk down how long that's really that's that's what I'm up against right now to see which direction we should be going or at least trying to if that's even possible and I would like to hear Mr Griefers have been on this because he probably gets a lot of the phone calls and been asked many questions here in this time so listen to all your thoughts about we're meeting tomorrow this is primarily where we're going to be discussing focus of what will be dwell in and what could be enforced what our main focuses are as a community For What the residents want and I don't know if it is so much changing way the code is written more so giving the directives to the officer and to be doing in-house code enforcement of what our focuses are and because you can't enforce every single thing you know given the time it's really what what is most important and uh you know who's going to do it and how we can do it so I think that would be the focus on laying out in the meantime I've spoken with our code enforcement officer and I've told them in the interim period to not focus on so many small things to be focused more on the major departmenting issues if you see the major role model he sees a lot of construction degree going on in houses and did he paying attention to something some of the empty lots that were having done you know progress problems and the things that really stand out so that's kind of where we're at right now and at any point um that Sheriff officer can be given Direction and it's true because the sheriff's department he actually works for us right yeah Lloyd Rose and the Mike you did mention the main panel a couple times and just interesting enough when I bought on 20th Street one of the requirements was to change out the panel because there's like four or five different panels that aren't accepted anymore that particular house had one of those I actually went to I went to the city first they said Pinellas County when Pinellas County and I actually got a homeowner's apartment they said Mr Roberts you get to take it out and put a new one in and say yes I am wow no question about a possible that I'm Christian nobody knew how to turn on the light switch requirements so there's a reason why they sell them at Home Depot yeah yeah now they said I could get help you know I could ask a friend I could ask a neighbor we could do it together you could do that yeah and I went to YouTube and I followed YouTube for everything and showed me exactly how to do it and I'm still alone so it's all good well I'll bring you to my place after we leave the office so there's no such you know the definition of a handyman I think that's something we can check with the county you know oftentimes they'll say well you know handyman can't change that amount because they don't have an electrical license yeah a homeowner can they apply for a homeowner's apartment so there's a lot of little items that are in there that you know you need to be careful of that they can be done but if somebody says I'm a handyman and they come in and say well I'm not really a licensed for this but I'm a handyman and I can take up this light switch and put in this fan and confident the answer that is known they have to be a licensed electrician but yeah as long as you apply the homeowner's current I think the uh I also recall a family plan because saying that the county was not recognized but there's no definition I think changing out like there's your fans exactly what I handled it right right okay so Mr Roberts are you your home there I am okay but I did one uh after the next item here which talks about Mr Moore going through the entire thing a big question well we'll get to that but my question is would it be better to wait if we decide to go to that direction have this tomorrow go through the entire going through the entire code book because he may be changing things that needed to be changed legally that we may waste time on because it's not even going to be an existence anymore so that was my thought when I saw the email it was more we could talk about that as we get to that but I think it may be more effective to disregard at the end of the day it's the responsibility of the home but we're the problem right I mean it's it's up to that home or to determine whether or not the person is going to assist them in a project is licensed and bonded in short and he's got the skill setting capabilities to do it whether or not there's a the work Rises to a level in the permit whether or not there isn't going to follow on inspection at the end of the day it's the whole modern property owner who has to make those decisions so are we just kind of overreaching here and saying you know we're taking that out of the homeowners discretion to figure out what days will be done and what skill set he needs and what level of confidence tonight I I just feel that if we start getting down to that level it's a kind of a blurry line between what the responsibility is of the city or versus the county I think Jody discussed that quite a bit but I think just going down that road because it's just we're starting to overreach this thing and really take take personal responsibility here in the equation against my yes I don't see it that way at all Mr God I what I say is is right now we have probably the most restricted racism in this community because we've got an overachiever who is really being I'm not going to say he's doing a bad job at all I think that the case he's going after everything deems as a Bible and I guess my question is is that really what we want or do we want to focus on the big problems and that's that's really the direction that you know some of this conversation together and I guess just to Enlighten I don't know if everyone is aware of a resident had someone working on his property that the gentleman had was clearly doing some framing had wood saws and so forth set up the driveway driving a work truck with no markings that says that he's licensed he said I was licensed number on the exterior work truck and when he approached a gentleman he was told there was a permit turns out there wasn't a permanent he was told that homeowner was a contractor he's working for the contractor for the contractor that wasn't the case either the gentleman was not a licensed the homeowner the five percent uh reported it to the licensing board the homeowner received a citation with a 500 fine and so there's a whole series of events that happen this I guess was after he was born the homeowner was warned about having a Doc Bill without having a licensed contractor on site for that too so there was multiple events at this home and the problem rises again you know we have a deputy doing code enforcement he's got to follow the law and he was following the law and what I call eccle about the citation they said we can't do anything about it it was called in by the sheriff's department and we have to enforce it so because I try to deal with the citation and they wouldn't allow me to get involved was the homeowner or general contractor so I think that that's a lot of where this is stemming from and you know talking with code enforcement is that I've got the extreme where I've got a resident who had it unlicensed contractor on site and they lost all their money and didn't get the work done and then I've got you know someone who seasoned and has them and they're upset because I'm enforcing the wall so it's a he's hot in the middle and I'm sympathetic to the officer um if I may um the only time I've really ever had a problem in workmanship delivery and reach a contract with with a licensed contractor when we move down here we saw various licensed contractors who went through their resumes we talked to their recommendations you know people that provide these growing recommendations and evaluations and it ended up in court where we had both arbitration because frankly the person that was doing no work because we were out of town they didn't really know work on the property and that was a license well license is not a guarantee of inequality in work period don't accept that oh you got to be licensed that's not the cold statement it's helpful but back to your point I want to bring the conversation right on them yes I agree that we should start looking at allowing the handyman level to work that to the code enforcement we really got to dial that so that we basically Maybe by hour so if your direction you're going to get five hours a week and you're only going to look frankly at those hardcore options or five hours a week will be devoted toward the uh permit tape things but the other 10 hours I want to see you looking at yards maintenance painting that pressure treated wood you know bringing our city back up because that's a major sort of responses can do right across the street one of the worst properties I've ever seen that's counting them County rules I'll talk about that later do we have any other comments on this topic that we feel like that we've at least given Mr Roberts some information of what we're thinking and different topics to bring up and tomorrow's conversations everybody good Mr Speaker [Music] and you said you were assisting someone in Stall events assuming you had a permit for that I'm assuming the defense was already there and the offense came down and so development yeah all right thank you Mr Sable I'll be calling you this we could eat some help too thank you very much I got a nice hole digger anytime okay well you're you're maybe one of five all right so now we're moving on to number four which actually I want to say that this is a carryover from a prior work session I I don't know how this actually well went wrong here but this is exactly the same as the handyman and license contract for work so we're going to strike number four and then let's move on to number five uh this is to discuss proposed walking easement path and was uh interim a city manager thank you mayor the reason I brought this up is we've been hearing uh it's from the public about this proposed warranty easement paid to have I want to bring up what the actual plan is that was proposed within the last year year and a half and um kind of discuss it to see if it's something that we the direction we really want to go in because I have not heard public out cry for said for this ad I've heard a lot against that so before we kind of keep going on this road I'm calling up on this project on 12 13s just where we wanted to ask the contractor for a price to do some of that behaving so again I included in the agenda or in the packet a plan but the last plan that we had and I'll try to put it on the screen as well okay so hopefully everyone can see it but this you know it's a pretty simple plan but just so everybody knows where the actual easements were on um we start down here at the city border and you know where South Park is and the first walking easement is between 2nd Street and 3rd Street and it's at 10 foot wide East that in this plan we're proposing that we which is currently grass we we clearly grow it and put down a base and engage enough of asphalt and that would be the asphalt would be in the all the yellow areas moving up through the city the blue areas are the road connectors that exist so it comes all the way up you got it between second and third between fourth and fifth between six and seven and then between the eighth and even not and then it brings you up the uh Harbor Drive that's the bark there there would be no crosswalking if it's not a Causeway but we proposed uh get in agreement with the county to have it to have a paid path in the accounting common property and then moving up to 12th and 13th where this is the easement I'm talking about now the project we would be asking to pay this section between 13th and 14th um and then it contains all the way up in each of these cul-de-sacs between each little road until you get to 18th Street where it ends so as part of this plan we got a quote which was probably about two years ago from Ajax Paving which we based our budget uh catalog project planning numbers off of and um the only other thing is if we propose to throw into some some later so starting this year in the 2023 budget we are setting aside 20 000 in the capital projects for this proposed Trail and since well this year we're talking about the budget and it's come up that there's been some opinion against gave this Trail for various reasons so I just wanted to kind of bring it up for Council discussion to make sure this is a directional Home Improvement thank you very much Mr Reaper I am a little curious why that trail across its across it right here but there's no way to actually Cross Fitness kind of bizarre is it because there used to be a crosswalk there until they redid the roads or no way it's just that there was uh it's just to connect the North and South parts of the city if that's possible but there is no actual traffic control device for pedestrian Crossing there yeah I don't think it would be something to move on there if I was a runner and started on the north end of town I wanted to do this path I would have to I would have to cross the hospital in a non-crossing so I had to go down to the causeway called Boulevard right yeah but well I think when this pound was put in too there's only two lanes out here and the bridge was a genre so we had a and I I believe most residents use it as a means to get the cosmic ballpark now um my understanding that some of this Trail has suddenly or over time become much natural yes um I think about two years ago when we had it surveyed memories made some notified some of the residents that have some things moved where they've gotten out of the easement itself where they were as advances so they have a yes sense in account and then what are you doing today how do you differentiate the Border would only be the asphalt itself versus the grass so what's the idea of the asphalt or the territory marker would actually to to offer to give someone a better Trail for walking I think the idea started it was a proposed shell Trail and I think that was to make more of a uniform surface as you walk through there you find some different grades you find some treatments it was just to probably make Uniform service at the same time an identifier of where the easement was because they're at this point right now it's just you have a sign saying blocking these kind of motorized vehicles and you know in some spots you end up ends at a fence so it's kind of obvious but in others you know yeah what we want so it's it's just kind of like eyesight to the next security should we Shirley but you you were involved in this parking yeah this place that I explained yeah I was going to say this choice this dates back to um so a few years ago uh really pushed Lynn to re-establish the walking easement which has been there for the life of the city but for many reasons um because people can move their fences over and were using the easiness their property it's really city property probably to make sure we have it maintained I brought it a couple of times there's some pretty low spot standing water and things like that we're not maintaining it it's it's uh you know kind of a a hazard because it's just breeding mosquitoes which is huge issue around here right now but so we were the that Council was was very interested in getting this walking path clear and putting some sort of material down so it was clear where the path was and could be utilized by citizens especially as we start doing more Parks events and that sort of thing making the city more walkable to come you know this it's a North access for City Hall there is an area that for some reason it ends and if you live your position you can't exactly get on the petroleum as you cut through someone's driveway so there's some question what happened there not sure that we really know I take it by myself and come through the driveway I'm sure I'll get shot one day for doing that stuff but yeah so you know for for us on the North End we have to actually come down to 18 to get to if we can take the direct access um like everyone else did but you know I I think it's a great to build a community a great idea to have it in place I don't know if it needs to be  or shell maybe when we first talked about it it was a shell-based um that's indifferent I'm indifferent with that but I do believe that um we should look at getting it operable and making it usable for residents I know there's been some residents that aren't interested in having it as you can see it's very it's a very small section that needs to be connected most of it's already paid it's just those stretches between the streets I think the vice mayor gun all right you've got your hand raised yeah Judy touched on the history of this thing is it it goes back to several councils and at the time the emphasis was to follow through on this thing and make it a little easier to navigate if there's some tripping hazards in some areas there was some positive water in some areas there's concerns about encroachment on the engagements so the goal was to move forward when raised it's investigating to look at the different alternatives for Shell base concrete asphalt basically it came back and said with recurring Claws and upkeep and maintainability the best decision was to go with an asphalt surface and at the time the decision was made because we were thinking about doing all the storm water and repainting the streets for economies of scale and globalization purposes we were going to pave the East that there is plenty adjacent streets were being renovating from storm of water in the street being and that was the original plan and that's how all of that was going to be integrated well as the cost for the spark Waters started escalate as well as the year the painting of the streets Lynn Reeves came back and finally said no let's go ahead and break this out of the storm water and Screen Paving program and it's just time to just go ahead and proceed with this thing and break down each individual one not Titans creeping and just getting done if you go back and you look at the objectives list for like the last three five years you'll see that that the street Eastern program is nearly or whether it was obtaining these beds moving stuff around or deciding on what's the best way to perceiving this and the very last iteration of the state was liberated before they were later break it out and just start paying so it improves the usability of the surface eliminate some of the hazards to people riding bicycles or walking or running and also identifies the easements for the students and it's kind of the background on that I'm in favor of let's get this thing going it's been on on the workplace for a long time and let's go ahead and do it thank you thank you Mr Doug who else anyone else like to speak with us Frank Baker yeah and then lastly um I accept nothing but negative feedback that's from 9th Street to First Street about this I can see there's twenty thousand dollars bucketed each year for this project I believe Kyle he told me that an easement would be 10 which is paid to be 10 foot wide um so I remember twenty thousand dollars is going to come in coming to compensate any of this project because you're going to put one and a half inches of asphalt down as possible sit in base you're going to need about four to six inches if you need to crushed concrete or three-quarter modified and underneath that laptop so it stays without cracking and breaking up if you put shells down there loose granule it um you're going to have enough to put bleach um Kyle who Moe's he said now does the city up Mom or through the residence okay so um I think it's going to cost nothing but Havoc there and sort of create more trash people were gonna leave right if there's minimal minimal trash now with bottles and cigarette butts and everything else some engagements um I think it in today's the privacy of these people that live there um I think it's a bad idea more sorry to say vice mayor gone yeah I'll hold on one second Mr good uh Leslie um talking about what we discussed this several years ago I thought we had a problem with Paving it and it was just issue that the county had we recall what I remember was that it was also there was an idea to do along the sea wall on well and there were too many roots and it was home unwell and crazy and so I think the club was full on that one a vice mayor gun well all I asked for is I just heard a state of about negative feedback on this thing we're slipping into the anecdotal thing again how many people are we talking about who are they we're talking about First Street to 8th Street I think that was the only substance that I took out of that because discussion and are they people who are adjacent to these easements because I I guess that would kind of kind of qualify the Kingdom so you know this has been around for a long time additional feedback was very positive important and and there's a lot to qualified what is this negative feedback from here or not thank you Floyd Roberts Kyle so the blue the blue line is that going to remain [Music] okay so the um yeah I can pretty much guarantee you if you put a impervious material 10 feet wide the county is going to do calculations and determine the runoff and you're going to be challenged with where you get a hold of that water first either a retention Pond or a detention pond so that is going to be a challenge if you want to actually there are options out there that you can put down 10 feet wide um it's kind of like a geocell type material that can go through there that will provide long-term structural support and you can even put like grass on top of that that again will keep them structurally sound and it will prevent it from sinking over a period of time it doesn't look like a lot of that's going to be required that might be an option to consider because again aesthetically it's still grass you're still going to see grass it's just going to hold up for a longer period of time but my maintenance standpoint and it's not going to be sinking especially if you have some low water traces through there so if you put in verbias Asphalt on there there is pervious asphalt but it's not wonderful but if you use these geocell type materials through there that by definition allows the water to go through and the county will not challenge you on that with grass on top of it it's nice material [Music] s you know if that's not necessary I don't think but um yeah because then you run the risk out a scooter or something you know I think if it's a sidewalk would it would be better then the other thing I just want to say is there is a benefit to having the city walkable when in future Kyle is applying for Grants there are several things they look at and that's one of them they look at walkability and um there's huge benefit plus we even talked about there may be a grant available for that because it does create what everyone's looking for kind of that green approach to walkability so the or the majority of people that have completely said we don't want this they live along that path something I've talked to and unsolicited they came to me and said we've heard that the council is considering this we would prefer you know lessening of asphalt basically you know we've got too much Asphalt in the city as it is and that does create more monologue issues and things like that so to answer your question thinking back I think most of the people do live very close to this walkway area so they use it knowledge not to eliminate the goal is to actually use it but not go crazy is that what I'm hearing they're all done remember I mean honestly um I want to watch it and that is a relatively good approach you don't have to pay for everything you see to me and I understand that what 18th Street there's a family that I purchased some of these men I don't know they got a hold of that one that kind of that's one of the reasons why it doesn't extend much further so yeah that was a block but again I'd like to dig over it and reputably talks or we're just talking about truths if you've got a tree route you got a problem it's either going to break up the asphalt or you're going to take the tree down so you know I always look at secondary Church very well that's one of the secondary events something to keep in mind either or even a natural to keep the tree I don't know I'd like to walk it though it's a sounds like a very nice place to take a walk I have had one of the families that approach me their concern is the amount of traffic it will create that is payment and creating the thoroughfare to the neighboring town well that makes sense especially if you live on that Jason probably I think we go along is we don't want the adjacent property to become the owner of the cases that that was happening and maybe create some confusion and also I've tried to walk this path end to end and currently it does get confusing everything's rain recently you could very well be standing at six inches so I feel like something needs to be done to what extent I'm not sure where do we go could we authorize Kyle to look at some alternative paying methods and possibly so um um one of the questions was you know a lot of arrests at the belonging agents they are very concerned about the in their tax paying arrests and they have a voice sound here if it's one two or 50 of them um and they should be they should be addressed uh the other thing is there is no drainage in a like which the robber to put out and I see into the plan so um you're also if you look like you said there's some guys if you walk the eastmans are thinking about a year or two ago the city went around spray painting roots that are sticking up um there's an abundance this this is like room to say anymore when you when you come into Florida you put a shovel on the ground you did nothing but approach um and that's trees shrubbery and if you don't do this thing right it's going to bust the asphalt up within two years so I think it's just foolish migration no I I think the uh maybe there needs to be a real evaluation to the thickness in terms of the durable foot trucker for less than a truck if it's two people complaining that's different than 50 people complaining their marriage nobody that I've had basically had the background or experience when it came to floodplained management and liberators the road off issue with this thing he would have been the first one to have raised that flag I'm I'm certainly thinking back to all of them yeah the sidewalks we have running out the door got me as soon Hardware of what exactly the runoff requirements who was the act and I don't see the irrigation ditches or holding ponds for the sidewalk we have foreign the residents and see what the general consensus is I was you're always going to get complaints but you rarely hear that I love for you to do this I'm wondering again maybe it's not a bad idea to get Parks and Rec involved and let them do some dealers I I concur with that I would also like to bring them to the City camping obviously more of a meeting because we do need the input and rather than and I understand the need for you know put real fast but again when we cite a bunch of residents talk to me if you understand that they say well you know we have a lot of confidence to get well from counselors like it's so out of the court of course let's get down let's relook it give it to the right committee they're going to be able to due diligence but on an RV yeah just go out there and talk too I mean I just said at office hours here once a week on Wednesdays where people come in so we get information and hopefully it doesn't break my head I love it but you know might be a good idea but here's my suggestions for amen supposed to so let's go to citizens the other thing that we need to look into is how much of an easement do we have and we're talking about 10 foot wide easement I can't imagine that there's a chance of easily behind all these properties yeah it is 10 things where where it was not 10 feet yeah wow intelligence residents you do have a utility poles in some areas you have utility poles in some areas and you do have a large oak tree so there are a lot of rooms Mr Banker what's your hand raised yeah um when you're talking about water runoff we all received pictures in the last two weeks of the high tide we were experiencing and first that 9th Street or even 12 13th Street there was a ton of water and some of that water running editions so all we're doing is you know asking for Less drainage by paying in it I I just don't I don't understand why you want to fix something that isn't broken that's it thank you very much um what's the general consensus of this Council the recommendations as to what we should do recommend you take it back to the committee and give them the charge to basically look at the information again we're going to talk to people around invite public comments to find out you know where we're maybe going through this Parks and Rec very Shirley um yeah I mean I think it's great to get Parks and Rec involved with the project I'm certain there's a problem with many people in the city that don't even know that we have they walk in town I you know I know that here's the thing is so we're talking about this right again after we're talking about it and several other councils and my concern is we we can talk about it for the next until the next Council comes in and now he never gets done so I just want to make sure that in doing so we put some deadlines on it that it doesn't just keep getting kicked down the road which is what's happened I would say uh getting the general public's opinion that's something that whole thing could be done you give him the assignment again the next meeting and then give us the results who followed me vice mayor Gunn what do you think well I'm going to show you sorry to take this can down the road to say she's been around for at least three councils and I think there's some issues that Kyle can resolve with regards to the width of this thing and and how durable the base needs to be that sort of thing I'm not asking uh Council but okay what I'm asking is probably this appears to be a Parks and Rec uh utility I would like Parks and Rec or to Reach Out our neighbors and whatever and give us some feedback of what the general consensus is the one asphalt one channel do you want rocks do you want nothing do you want grass you just want the low spots raised up a little bit before let's just make sure that what we're doing is and the majority of the public increase so do you want the parks and rec board to come up with a device to call the residents well I'm just thinking this is Parks and right we often various topics and different boards or communities and I think that this is a part of the parks and rec conscience uh see if they can reach out to the public what they think come back to us because they they probably aren't going to go out and walk the trails look around maybe even make some of their own recommendations and they come back to us I don't want this to last forever but I I think just speak the amount what you haven't had which I'm not going to say it's a huge amount but there have been a few that we don't need to immediately move but we definitely want to move forward very soon also I would use the thrill and I know many others that would also but right now you can't so it's either you get in a wild animal or anything to where it's reusable shade from okay so we're um they're going to kind of reach out and give General feedback from the residents yes I don't think that's fair and then just report back to counselors right foreign feedback yeah we have a quarterly report coming up this October meeting as far as timeline we'll be looking at uh we do not have a meeting scheduled for the month of October besides the pre-event set up for Halloween we're here um I have to work within their time okay okay I'm sure we can so by the next quarterly report January that's the next time that we will be able to get a report from Parks you could have we could have one outside of the schedule well I think I mean this is where we want to go we want our parking right to take a look at it um I would like for you to reach out to their chair and um see if she is able to accommodate the council with some some type of report and what time frame she thinks that that would be okay it's only we have two weeks and then we have another meeting and so you can give us an ability to see a managers or you can just email accounts with once you have cancer okay I remember don't reply at all any other comments on this topic all right uh now we're on topic six discuss regulation of data decaying trees in the city code I added this because we have a piece of property with a very large tree that is dangerous well thank you a lot by itself and there's three at least three homes that are right next to where if something is Flowing certainly and break homes cars or bodies so excuse me I have a development of current system and I'd like to be able to read it to you just take a couple but normally they don't take certain Comics but I'll I'll let you be heard would you please come up to the podium say afternoon like a contest sir could you state the name of that question is this first this is okay yes sir your name and address please yeah I'm sorry my name is Alan Mintz I live at 125 8th Street in Bel Air Bridge this afternoon I got a call from Duke Energy on the topic of the Norfolk pine that you're you've described for us so here I was unaware but on August 31st Duke Energy received a call to complain about this tree and they put it on their to-do list today I talked to them again on another topic and asked and they asked me if I knew anything about this and I said yes I do I gave them the information and they said well we were given us to work on on August 31st because it takes 10 days the most two weeks to have this happen but because of the timing of everything I asked them well when do you think it'll be done now and she said well really it's already been done and they're usually just in the process of writing up the report and then she said to me well in this situation you can expect some action to be taken and that translates into having Duke Energy would take over the project of getting rid of hopefully the trade Emily related situations have been surrounded and how would Duke Energy have more rights to control a dietary on someone's private property right I had no idea and if you have any idea of what their action is that they plan to take no they're gonna this is this should be sometime this week that they're going to announce this or not announce that this about this particular problem yeah I was just happy to have something so much okay I understand and that's why it's on the uh the agenda as we discussed um I appreciate that very much I appreciate the update and we'll continue thank you very much thank you so anyway the tree uh it is a giant spot on the face of the road to Trump and it looks like maybe sometimes he was going to start my life or something happened to the root system on it and it started dying as a city we are not allowed to inspect the tree we contacted uh problem s clearly see from the street that there was a there's a tree it's in bad shape and if it falls it's going to hurt somebody so the question is is um why is it this way and what can we do about it yes sir um I think there's a fear issue in place a few issues at play here and I I want to give a slightly more nuanced explanation it is not that the city cannot inspect property for code enforcement violations they certainly can but when you're entering onto private property without the consent of the private property owner that can raise constitutional concerns I it was my understanding that we did not necessarily have consent with the property owner to go onto their property to conduct an inspection beyond what we can see from the street because there was no As I understood it through obstruction between the street and what could be plainly observed that my advice was to avoid perfecting a claim that may not presently exist to avoid going on to private property without the consent of a private property owner as it relates to your code I'm fully aware of your code and its provisions describing a hazardous tree as a public nuisance your ability to cite a property owner for maintaining a hazardous tree a violation of the code there is also it is not totally accurate to say that you cannot obey a hazard as your code remains Provisions Within it's 2238 or 2239 of your code as it relates to the abatement of public nuisances my concern is having seen how code enforcement plays out in other communities litigating these things on appeal and and in direct Sue trying to limit your exposure my advice to the manager at the end of last week was if it is the desire of the administration to if the administration and it's and more specifically it's code inspector determines that there is in fact a violation of the property owner decided with an opportunity to go through the process for an independent fact finder to determine that the tree is in fact a hazard or a dead and disease tree or a dying tree or an unacceptable risk is that term is used in Florida statute then then we may be able to then cite them and then potentially if found in violation and failing the carrier then the city can explore whether it wishes to Abate the issue I think the other issue that we're having here is one of separation of powers and I wish to advise this body in the future to recognize whereas legislative role ends in the administrative or executive role begins it is not customary for our community to have its Council independently deliberate code Bible issues you have a special magistrate you have a code inspector or the manager and whomever he should he or she should deputize and you have pcso performing code enforcement services for you that's where that determination is made it is certainly appropriate for the council to say hey I have received word of potential violation pass it on to Administration and then that's where this council's role ends this Council should not engage in the process of determining as a legislative body that there is or is not a code violation on the property that is better placed in the capable hands of your Administration and members deputized for vote for to to conduct code enforcement and pursuant to chapter 162 of the Florida statute so in part because this is a work session I thought this might be a productive place to have this discourse and I don't I don't do so in with any intention of being disrespectful of you as my boss but also as my colleagues and peers but it's an important distinction and one that will protect both this community and to a greater extent you as individuals so that you are not accused leader in some context of targeting or something of A Sort or exceeding your Authority and and putting under pressure on the people who actually have that power under chapter 162 in your code and so at this in my my advice to the mayor not going on there was one again to to to remove you from that process and to the manager was with the with an eye towards potential legal concerns to to incubate this process so that if we do have a violation we can proceed and there's minimal challenges to that so as to the question of what what powers do you have I don't know I'm not a Duke's lawyer and I don't know on what basis if they can claim if they have the ability under either some statutory Authority through the Public Service Commission or other regulatory Authority Public Service Commission or otherwise to make an independent that some kind of Flora or fauna poses an inherent risk to its infrastructure and they may separately have the ability to Abate where they determine a triox elevation may affect why infrastructure that they may have the ability to obey upon some kind of notice to the property owner and that I'm not saying that's what it is I anticipate that that's what it likely that I've not had occasion to advise duke or progress on that sort of thing but that may be the case I would I don't think it's accurate to say that the utility has more power than the community it maybe you have the ability to move more expeditiously but concepts of due process and private property rights to Prevail and my advice is aimed at achieving the needs of this community while also remembering that my role is to advise and to mitigate your exposure I'm advising that can be disregarded and that's totally fine but I I'm trying to balance the equities of your code with the rights of your of your citizens and achieve a result that ultimately is most Equitable in that regard less I understand and again this is more of a high defense conversation the reason why it came to life absolutely moving forward in the future we would like to know the best the best route to address these issues and what I'm hearing is if you're standing in the street and it looks like you've got a tree it's a hazard and it's you can see that it has a problem now I can go on the property the best thing to do is allow code enforcement to do their job go ahead and write the ticket and then see allow the property owner to to fantastic and I'll let one step that I'm sure is inherently frustrating is that first step where you see it let's say you're on your morning walk with your dog or what have you and you observe that make Administration aware of that but also understand that the administrator or inspector whoever goes out and is deputized the task of doing that may reach a different conclusion whereas you you as the um as the public official may look at that and say hey I think that's got two weeks they could look at it and say I've seen it I see the problem I don't think it's a two-week problem I think we can afford to go though it may not be desirable and if I live next to it it wouldn't be my ideal result I think we can go through the two-month process this isn't quite as exigent as it may seem to others and in my estimation we're going to notice this go through that war I'm not going to write a violation at all and I see what you're saying and I respect the lead is free and as the code enforcement official I'm not willing to cite that property and that can happen um and so it doesn't mean that they're ignoring you as much as reasonable Minds do disagree on realities online right and uh the cases and I just feel that Maybe I'm just not just not accomplish here I don't know where to go from here can I ask this code enforcement looked at this have they reached out to the homeowner or anything or are they the property owner I know it's not a property owner well can you give us an update it's a history this tree was cited at a previous city manager as an Australian pine fired and leader and when I came in and investigated after a violation was an issue I discovered it was not an Australian time so the fact that violation was then correct so at that point you know I told him you know this is not accurate and it's not enough you don't have to worry about this violation since then the the idea that the tree is a hazard has been brought up and my initial take when I when I was looking at it you know I actually was leading but from the from the road I couldn't really be able to tell and when my my experience to be able to say that that was a hazardous treated to me was the event it was falling anytime soon um discussing on different codes that we have are those that other cities have and and looking at some of the processes that other cities use to determine that there's trees I as I gain knowledge in this topic I would like to ensure that the street is not in danger so I think given the process of looking at this tree and and giving the I'd like to give the property owner an opportunity to the threat on their side of being able to prove the industry isn't a hazard so back to my question has the code enforcement officer looked at it and determine whether or not the issue a citation [Music] The Code Enforcement office area I initially looked at it um he didn't feel like the background to issue a violation and had the answers and this is where we kind of run into how can I qualified person at the Olympics thank you Frank Baker yeah I brought this up at the last Council work session last month and I got totally shut down on this and then I wrote a letter to a gentleman resident that was just a woman Podium about this and it wasn't going to just back off when I just I started thinking well you we Property Owners do have rights okay uh and I don't want to violate that in any way but then when I looked at the property you know it's no longer a residence it's an LLC um but we were just talking about easements and this tree has a very visible look at the breakage of the trunk the root structure it's within 20 feet probably like 15 feet of our East anyone can see this so I don't know why I feel like sometimes I'm in Twilight Zone on this Council I mean I bring stuff up I get shot down and I find out you know we can go on a property and mow it because they violate the code all right and we want to kind of build for all like that but when this tree which is probably 85 feet high and as you said Mr Mayor couldn't pack at least three homes it has impact one home already it's caused a couple thousand dollars worth of damage I sent a letter last week to Patty Kyle and Randy a strong letter should go out to the LLC saying you have a problem here you're in violation of our code will be and before we recite you um we want you to fix it and I think that might be the most expeditious thing to do thank you thank you um yeah the first thing to do obviously is to you know with your permission is you have title contacts Duke you can find out the definitely what you're doing you know what is this thing they're going to do the time frame um and basically figure out the references you know underwater authorization they're allowed to do that um unfortunately I'm not an arborist I could have tell you if a tree is going to die or anything and that's where we just we agree to disagree that a reasonable person can have differing our aspects it's time to generate any way of the plane but brought back to Mr Moore of that we're separate we're a legislative body um the management they're actually on the ground they're running it trying not to interfere with them but it sounds like they have contacted the owner that at one point there was a citation made but it was for a different type of plant and then my understanding is that the code enforcement officer went out there and said they don't have enough experience to judge this so I'm not feeling good I definitely want that one step done contact Duke Energy because they're coming in and I think with some sort of action yeah and at the end of the day it's it's it may very well be Optimus and we have a bad tree and we don't know that's the licensed her first it was a true license right exactly uh any any comment frankly in England break your beauty okay I had Patty send an uh email out from a licensed Harvest that looked at that trade I believe you grabbed her to understand and what was his comments uh as far as the way this tree is to be at high risk to fail it's not a question of if but when um it's a public safety issue to Progressive decay in the trunk go back to 22s and what is it 22 33 section it completely violates um our organs number eight so let's authorize our City attorney to send out a letter to this LLC see if they see if they respond or if not then flower code I think that our City attorney has already advised us against doing that this is an administrative function and I'll let us later function let's be clear that doesn't mean that no letter would ever go out or no action will be taken it is just that we do not need the administration doesn't need the authorization of the council to enforce this council's code you've already given us that authorization by passing your code while from time to time individual members or body May disagree with how that code is administered that doesn't mean we are without the ability to administer and enforce it thus far I have hope I have consistently advised that we can't enforce the code if somebody has reached a factual conclusion that the code has been lied saying that the code has been violent um I I'm familiar with the arborist report sir and that's certainly something the city would consider um it may well be that the when brought to the attention of the property owner they will find a licensed individual who may reach a uh a conflicting opinion and in writing and at that point I don't do that is what I'm saying I I yes sir and and my advice to the manager has been if the city and if if those persons tasked with conducting code enforcement on the strength of that or other information believe there's a violation they should let they should bring it before the command straight and the Mastery can determine whether that person has a defense or not so I I don't think we're saying anything different in that regard sir at no point have I said that the city is with you without the ability to enforce its code my concern is that if we do enforce our code we do so in a manner that gives the any property owner regardless of the nature of violation uh notice and an opportunity to be heard such that the dictates of due process or satisfy and I think this conversation is satisfying what we're what we're uh we're trying to achieve here is whose responsibility is it and how should it be addressed vice mayor God I was going to say along the same lines as if is it time to contract The Experience license arborist to survey the entire city and there's some mature vegetation in trees Alliance on the court streets and we have a bad issues with invasive species and some questions about what what is and what is it and maybe it's time to just surveying the entire city question mark are there trees that oppose a danger to residents and are there invasive species that we haven't identified that we need to think about I would agree with that would you like me to get votes complete City assessment vice versa to be only Case by case or should it be just a one-time survey Council I would hire somebody to look at this specific tree and then depending on how that works out maybe give them a contract for the whole city my recommendation at this point I feel comfortable with him buying my own independent arborist to take a look at it and give an opinion I think that's a good idea I like I like Mr guns idea and the whole story down in the city I was just gonna say if you do it City Line no concerns about hey we're targeting one specific person we're still survey the entire city and it also gives the arborist a chance to look and compare to what else is in Maryland maybe he's got they'll come up with a different opinion can I reach a compromise here let's just ask the current city manager contact the arborist give us a prize for one and get a surprise for all and then allow the city council to decide based on the effects we like to see in the cops what's affordable what's the best interest if we can balance it at that point but we can't do that unless we have both points the single tree and the multi-tree thank you Glenn yeah let me just throw this in Kyle and make the decision right just do we need to wait you know if the city manager thinks it's a value to the city to get done is let him give him some decisions with the outcome how it works out everybody good with that Frank yes all right we are moving right along um code review changes from City attorney more let me speak only Larry sent out today thank you Mr Mayor for benefit Mr tar since you mentioned earlier you didn't cancel hearing that as an alarm in front of you in the last few meetings uh there's been a general consensus or expressed desire to revisit the city's code having done a more detailed review your code's in better shape than some and that has been Revisited in the last 20 years some codes we've encountered have not been Revisited in 30 and 40. you have a series of amendments made in 2007 2010 but as a whole the general um upon the review I think that your code could benefit from a comprehensive review to determine where it is in line or requires updating with federal and state law or federal and state jurisprudence as it may apply being what the courts have said about the law as that may sometimes change the law what I'm proposing is a complete review and potential revision of subpart a of your code that's your code of ordinances in most communities your general governing documents are as follows your Charter which is the Constitution for your community's existence your comp plan which is the comp your comprehensive plan which is sort of the Constitution for all Land Development then from that flows subpart a of most codes subpart a is the code of ordinances the list of things you can't do or how the city shall function chapter 2 Administration what is an election all those things and then sub Part B is typically if you're laying development this is not a Land Development code review it is a subpart a coordinates interview with One LBC Land Development code component being your sign code and speaking about this with the with the intermanager I confirmed you know a lot of people keep bringing up the site but this just come up between May and you know basically when I got here now I've heard it a lot um no it's my understanding this has been an issue that has been stayed um for some time in owing you a number of factors but as it relates to you folks I want to make sure you understand the reason that the sign code is particularly set out here is in 2015 there was a supreme court of the United States opinion Reed B Gilbert um or Gilbert we read in in uh in Arizona and what that case did in Cliff note version and was make it so that all temporary signs uh temporary sign restrictions had to be content neutral most codes had different rules for political signs versus Real Estate signs versus you know Coleman for the 5K and the Boy Scouts popcorn sale and what the what the uh what the Supreme Court said is those are content specific restrictions and it has to be done temporary signage has to be granulated in a in a Content neutral way so if you're going to say you can have up to three three temporary signs on the property that that's the same as whether you're having an open house or whether you're saying vote council members ABC and president so and so into office that's where a lot of deliberative bodies come up a little bit on their sign codes your sign code admittedly might be slightly easier than some because you do not have a commercial District that you're balancing the oh do we want sandwich boards do we want neon signage and some of the things that can trip up communities as they start evaluating how do our businesses coexist with our residential districts so that is something separate but the Land Development code is part of the estimate I've given you uh what I've what I've estimated and this is this is I would say conservatively at 180 hours at our 210 per hour rate and overall estimated project budget of 37 800. that would happen over the course of the next year that is an estimate it is not an absolute we will do this because there are some factors that I cannot presently account for one of those is legislative session will start in February during as we were in this process with one Community last year there was a bill pending with some of you may remember 620 and 280 that would have imposed restrictions on what can we can't adopt his communities and then that sort of you know sort of the chess piece clock things had to move faster so that might that may accelerate the process another factor is case if the Supreme Court says something else or the Florida Supreme Court issues a decision that changes the direction we're moving and then the third is your process of course if we're in general meetings and something comes up about code I'm not carving that out from time to time but if you want to have a series of workshops on a specific ordinance let's take the Boating restriction area or booby ordinance as we've been calling it as an example that went from you know okay we're just presenting something to be quickly workshopped and on first reading to now we're having four and five earrings that's materially going to change the code revision processing everything is this this Workshop to that degree and couldn't potentially impact that estimate but in terms of the process we anticipate the the estimate is provided for you there with the repeat time to Gilbert on the sign code this would be a special project under our under our agreement as as framed which specifically calls out otherwise I'm happy to answer any questions so if this context we're doing something very similar in the town of Bel Air at the moment and have gone through more than a dozen ordinances updating various sections of their code it's gone fairly smoothly there again that changes Community by Community Based on the composition of the council or commission and how Keen of an interest they take in individual Provisions but we are equipped to do this I have a colleague in my office Robert Essen Felder who's also Birds board certified specialist in City County local government law we rely a lot on his work products he will be you will see his name on the billing for this invariably he and I would be working together on this I would of course Have Eyes on anything before it goes to you but that's the consequent process thank you very much Council so um yeah by me I mean I agree we have to look at it and I'm just saying okay tonight it's a little bit too early to make approval but um you'll just go forward with you know the process of working at this anyone else um a little over a year ago uh chairman Enfield I mean uh with the board went over all our codes and they spent hours and days on it and I did an excellent job I mean the wages of Warren says it I mean it the law can change Supreme Court could change into the rim um and and then it'll be in violation again I I think I don't think the taxpayers money is well spent by just hiring interns to research our code to find little errors in it which possibly couldn't be errors and it could be errors um again why open the can of worms fluid rubbers of this oh I think it also in addition to the the legal portion of it you're also going to look at operations as well is that correct you know but it was you'll get back in you know some example to change particular operations that may be identified as well nothing is in a vacuum we would absolutely every every community's code should be specific to that Community pursuant to your home rule powers and otherwise and also just the realities on the ground I'm sensitive to Mr Banker's concerns and by no means am I suggesting that we're going to to create main work or build for the sake of moving commas as a substantive example in your code chapter 54 Taxation and Finance you have a section on occupational license taxes that nomenclature hasn't been used in over 14 business tax receipts and it's not just a nomenclature thing it's they they there's other been other measures passes to what how business tax receipt should correlate to administrative processes and otherwise and so those this is not I'm not purely talking about conforming the case law but also just conforming the statute I can't promise you that we will catch every single legal issue an issue spot to high heaven but this is an example doing this exercise may help us to get ahead of situations like what we found presently with the voting restrictions area where we start to realize hey the statutory sites here don't read like they did 15 years ago when this was written and we need to make sure we're still in alignment I'm not in search of nor trying to create problems but I will tell you that as I travel the state and educate on managers of Ethics Sunshine Law public records and Technology the poor piece of advice I give is is to to officials individually in the communities is one don't screw up and two you're human you're going to screw up don't hide it there's nothing to be gained from that and ultimately it will create legal problems on the back end and then the third being that just because someone says you screwed up doesn't mean you did um necessarily and so as as it relates to that second one I'm not keen on just saying if we don't go in search of problems we won't find problems and then no problems will exist um I I don't know that that's necessarily and I'm not suggesting member Banker that's what you're saying but I do want to to say to to explain that I'm not if something's fine if it ain't broke don't fix it but if we're under the hood we might as well fix anything we can within a particular section much like as we talked about the voting restrictions areas and aligning it with your prohibited activity sections things like that are that sort of Harmony and harmonizing is desirable advice from your gun did you have something you wanted to add I I tend to agree with Frank Banker on this issue is is that uh I think that the missing piece of his puzzle is that when we do it internally we give it to our citizens advisory committee and maybe hand him to more residents it adds ownership to the equation and I think that's important because the residents have to own this thing and accept it that hey we reviewed it we chose these two concentrate to focus on because we believe these codes or these issues are most important to our residents who failure so I mean from there you can manage it by Inception we can figure out another way to have a cursory review of all our codes just to flag those things and hey you know the terminology in these are way out of date if we need to update these and maybe Outsource that project to the legal expertise but I think it's very important to put first goal around you got to have the residence ownership sorry I swear gun I agree with you I certain extent what we try to do whenever we review the code is we try to steer the the code in the direction of will of the citizens our streets clean we jump in the front yard but the one element that's missing is the legal perspective so anything that we've if we decide to alter it immediately goes on radar of the City attorney Moore because we're we're challenging the code or trying to alter it but what about the code that we're not we're not wanting to make a change to who's looking at that to make sure that they were deeply entitled to even have that code and I think that's that's where the whole reason why this conversation came up months ago is because we do have old language in our code that probably wouldn't stand up anywhere it could very well be challenged it's not even worse get us into some sort of legal matter litigation and the earth I made at the risk of moving into your folks discussion if there is concern about scope Mission Creek or otherwise we can start with the most urgent issue being the sign code and we don't need to and see how how that process goes and use that as address rehearsal I'm I'm not trying to get rich on your community I'm not saying that I've been accused as much but to the extent that's the perception that's not that's not my aim my aim is to make sure you have sound policy as a community that serves your residence well I will tell you from my interview I remember very vividly the mayor asked me about the sign code and another member of the council asking me what our capacity was and knowledge on that issue was I've had an informed brief informed discussion remember the tarot and provider as an attorney with the case law that that's based on and some more recent developments in that regard so I I think if I had to say you know what's the necessary scope I'd certainly like to start there and if that gives a proof of concept as to how we approach things and what this process could look like that'd be fine by me I just want to make sure that you folks have what it is you're seeking I do know that the sign code particularly has been raised with me frequently both from management and Council and at the very least I would say that that would be to me if you approved any element of this that would be to be the most I'll add one more thing and then I'll call them advice for your gun you do realize you just you handed us a 38 000 quote within hours of finalizing our budget I'm aware of that and and I I wish it could have been different I worry we were it's not for lack of handling other things in the interim but I wish I could I was aware of that as I said that a vice mayor God well we know we're forty eight thousand dollars is very Frank uh that aside I would say it's not at all or nothing approach it doesn't have to go to the the legal expertise it doesn't need to go to to share some advisory I mean they're so hybrid in between maybe the citizens advisory committee goes through and lays down and comes up with a short list of codes they want to focus on and the the City attorney picks up the slacker on the wrist and just does a quick person review okay that language looks good that it still makes sense nope we need to go back and take a look at this I mean there's a hybrid approach here and I think it's it's not right here spiritual I participated on one of those overview committees and there was so much focus on whether a tree was a tree or a Bush was a bush and the height of the bushes and things that there was so little time spent on language whether there are conflicts in the code of things like that I see a value in doing this I don't know that we can find the bullet and do it all at once maybe we take sections and do it uh clearly we need to address a sign ordinance I know that typically when we do those code reviews we're looking at appearance of the neighborhood pretty much is about it how does how does this affect code enforcement issues and that's that's always been the mentality of these these committees so just think keeping that in mind I think we maybe look at how how do we take this project down but not all at one time got an idea also I might say thank you for uh we have an elephant and I want to take the one bite at a time and I agree with Mr Morrow let's do the sign organs that's been on our scope it's an urgent need it let's take care of that first we can evaluate the process and I agree with you councilman surely that yeah you tend to get released some of these ingredients I was on The Interpreter you know sometimes we got the spirit of the correct field but I just want to refer you back to the discussion about the tree what we found out through turn more is that we never really understood the difference between the administrative and the legislative here that's just one catch but I do believe after we did the sign that we did review the code in terms of Citizen May say they want this type of tree but it's up to us in the end to ensure that anything we pass can be easily enforced correctly enforced in this or stalls any potential legal plans down the road you're doing 90 of the work out front and that's this is about 90 percent the same important it's the same coach now Mr Roberts yeah I think tomorrow kind of correctly if I'm wrong I mean we're gonna I think it's going to be the facilitator but Kyle and the uh code enforcement officer is going to be there we're going to have so much into the county as well um and I just want to clarify you think with all those people there but I'm the facilitator I've been asked a lot of questions they'll probably hate you by the end of it but that's we'll have some answers but um I I hope we don't get really down into the nitty-gritty of each one of these ordinances because otherwise we're looking more with regards to the processes and what's the best way to pursue these things and what are the what are the biggest issues and problems and challenges the city and the Florida enforcement officer is having today and how we both address those for the benefit of the citizens so but really going through the actual code itself I think Randy and his team are far better positioned to do um he said something to count my hearing and I don't think we're going down the right route you said that you're going to be in the Solitaire tomorrow I think that's really it doesn't sound kosher in terms of these are items that may come up to the council as a whole uh but that looks later on but as a facilitator you're guiding the conversation about the topics and basically your position to guide an agenda um I I don't know what the legal stand I mean it's not against you I just it's just that when I go facilitator Guy what's the city's attorney thought about that as a facilitator um I think the moniker um is this important than the action whether it's called the facilitator participant Inquirer I think that the council member has communicated is in as much as this Council designated or deputized him to be a part of this discourse that he's there to um simply ask questions and get information he's not articulating any directives or binding decisions of this Council so I I don't have an issue with him participating beyond the broader sense and I've had this discussion with some of you individually that I think do well and this came up in my discussion with a meeting a few months ago and her gum where he's the concern about you know being able to send things to the council and my my sentiment at the time being it's better to left us to ask the manager to have that discussion and report back to you and make known to them what concerns you're going to have you being in the room to make those concerns no it's not when you would solve a problem it's the devil's always in the details and I'm not going to sit here and tell you this is per se a problem it has the potential to be if you do things in a way that you've been advised against doing and saying I have it on good authority that the council's prepared vote for this you need to do it this way you know that I don't think anybody's suggesting that's the way you lieutenant receive in a broader sense I would like to see a council receive I would advise the council received from an active involvement in Code Enforcement priorities Beyond its power of the person and administrative Direction but getting back to this this code revision I'm prepared to to take whatever actions Council things necessary as best I can tell there's certainly a consensus direction to work to receive authorization from the manager or mental subsequent hearing the process of at least beginning the sign code I don't think this is so urgent that it will be decided tonight the mayor places on the agenda I wanted to make sure you had an intelligent response and not an esoteric discussion so you have my information to work with I I'm not advising you that this program right need to has happened yesterday Beyond assignment I think the seinfo is overdue and that's not my read that's the direction I'm basically been receiving time and again as I receive increase from each of you about what about this issue what about that I like to publicly apologize you really have council member Roberts I didn't mean to appear in your voters or anything no you're going to do a great job again I apologize okay so I see uh quote for the sign portion and it's under or around 4 200. yes and I don't know that it'll take that whole but I wanted to get enough questions sign codes tend to get a little more distance understandably so because it is the intersection of legal and the aesthetic what's the general consensus of moving forward on this portion and I know we're not in anything early to afford to be done there's no way we'll have it done before the election but uh hold on one second Mr bankers uh would like to know each person's feelings always I definitely agree we need to go forward with that sign language during the election and not only that but after that election I heard various complaints about uh people putting the Congressional signs that were about six foot by five foot and we came together so I would like to move forward within that section and that gives us a good evaluation moving forward thank you foreign cities um what's your typical how many pages is your typical signing ordinance and your other cities that you represent as a number of pages it's an excellent question I never keep track of the precise number of pages of ordinance that will tell you that that is among the lengthier ordinances we adopt in large part because it is the most susceptible to a legal challenge in what is an at best Dynamic legal landscape and so the sign codes tend to include a grade number of whereas Clauses and legal findings and then again in other communities you know the examples we would take when we've done the city of Dunedin city of Tarpon Springs and leave Holmes Beach but cities where we've submitted to sign codes one of the other issues that this Council may not face is the number of varying uses assignments commercial and residential districts I don't know the number I I can tell you that I believe there's one that was 30 pages I don't know that people need that here I would look at this community and what its needs are it's not done again in the name of doing it for that sake I don't believe in working that way but it will be longer than a three-page ordinance this just doesn't lend itself to that uh okay isn't there a Supreme Court ruling and I can't think would you want to uh the name of it today this residents or citizens political signage really pretty much leeway uh which is on your own personal property they established any length of time and size there is Supreme Court case law where you are able to regulate in a Content neutral manner time place manner restriction size where you can't say is if somebody puts up a sign of special political speeches among the most sacrosanct in this country and it should be and I'm not suggesting anything to the contrary but there is Reid versus Gilbert and I can pull up some of the more recent case law on the the case the case this session relating to prayer and schools and things of the like and how that can be extrapolated to this issue I'm not suggesting that we should in fact where I will what I will put forth for you will make no distinction between a political side or another kind of sign that is exactly what we're no longer allowed to do okay thank you very much Mr Baker I'm going to come back to you on what your thoughts are census if I'm trying to reach moving forward however as Charity surely just reminded me we need to take five minutes all right 751 so we'll resume in at 7.50 okay great yes but right now I'm Frank Baker and I was asking for his opinion whether we should look forward to the assignment well I'm at the opinion either no signs in the city or just leave it the way it is I mean um I again with that Supreme Court ruling um I know a few more says you can regulate uh I think there's the challenges to that uh one of our even residents in the past um I think it's another slippery slope we're touching um I'm sorry was that a yes or no no all right security Shirley yes I believe we should move forward move forward we need some boundaries around this thing the kind of Minds aren't aesthetic so we can discuss a little bit not in your prayer with freedom speech and materialism your Quorum constraints we need to think about that's all move forward yes Wesley [Music] oil move forward also I think we should move forward so that might say that's a consensus all right now let's move on to this year 508. this is continuing services with the videographers and uh advertising for a zoom meeting facilitator let me give some clarification on this advertising for its own meeting facilitator it sounds like looking for a memorable role or another personal payroll actually what I want to make sure that I did advertising for volunteers we have volunteers that do all sorts of consequences I think that there may be someone out there that would be willing to volunteer their time here at our main Council meetings or during our Council meetings to run the zoom meetings same time video that we get a recorded video is is terrible if you are somebody trying to watch one of our meetings on YouTube because it's just a lot of people and especially if you're looking on your phone or something like that it's hard to even tell who it is it's it's speaking so I like to have a hybrid video Services where we continue using Victor but we also look for a volunteer to win the that's where I'd like to begin the conversation any comments from the council yes what was the final number of the budget that we had agreed and debated funds they don't want to reopen that we discussed the budget we ran it through all the various hearings and that number should stand I was a member for medical services foreign baby all right anyone else Frank Baker uh jumping on your suggestion Mr Mayor have you made me addressed by local high schools training schools that are children are involved in this technical project that link you're looking to do something exactly what you want I really haven't um that's my thoughts were that there's some Wranglers that here at every meeting and that someone would maybe step up and actually could be shown how to operate soon while we're doing these meetings at the same time we have a quality videos back here on eBay volunteer give me one of my emails they can get you a name of the person that uh we're just looking for uh right now volunteer work at that maybe in our years um I you know a couple of things you said the video quality we're getting right now is back I'm just when you said that I was looking after that they've done I can't see one person's face and maybe workers but I think just to your point that our existing videos that's the Shadows um you know we have ten thousand in the budget now you see the men now um you know what I know we had a proposal from Victor that was kind of loose and I you know do you mind if we asked more information about that we don't don't have any information here but what Victor's prices to continue to run videos because uh he happens to be here today that's why I asked the question would you want to step up to the podium please and give us your full name and your address good evening Council pleasure to be here Victor burienic don't live in Miller Beach yet but one day I'm in Seminole at 89.63 Crestview so um but basically um I had put a proposal forth for the zoom uh but we um we were talking and I guess we're going to continue the video but I I can do whatever you guys want me to do I can even provide staff sometimes when I'm doing a wedding or something I need additional people on my team to get other shots so I can even help out with the zoom you guys just have to obviously it's going to be hard for me to find volunteers professionally that would show up you know but if you guys come up with a budget I don't want to throw something at you and you guys say oh no that's not what we're looking at I can kind of try and do both or we can just do the video I know when we were working with Indian Rocks during covid I was doing a live Zoom meeting with like a professional setup with my cameras where there was no cameras and it was live according to zoom and then I still had someone on staff doing the normal video that was like extraordinary circumstances and they wanted that as well and it turned out really well it was a lot of setup and tear down because my cameras are on like tripods and wires and stuff so it was additional time maybe you guys could set something like that up permanently here and then we could like intertwine the two but it's really I'm the professional and I can make suggestions but you guys have to tell me what direction you want to go into and it sounds like the mayor was thinking of doing just the video and then separating the two but the proposal that I gave that I spoke about last meeting was me running the zoom so it just depends on what you guys want to do but I think what the mayor was pointing out is that it's difficult to see who's talking in the Audio I always have to edit it afterwards and make sure that everything's sounds good looks good you were talking about editing I don't edit stuff to take stuff out I edit it so that it's good looks good and so the quality is there so I don't know if that answers questions or if there's anything that I should address so you're proposing doing running the zoom but having your cameras do the recording novel we're seeing or at least a camera position so you can see I can do that it's just how you want it done I can bring in cameras and connect it to that computer but then it's like a complicated system that has to be or I can bring in my own computer and then it would be connected to zoom and it would like intertwine the things but then it might be kind of a lot of setup and whatnot but what we're thinking with the mayor was just to separate the two and and have that as a different entity and then you guys still have the quality video so so the zoo would be just a live video sort of thing and then when you record still on YouTube and yes yeah yeah so it's like an archive of what happened and this is just enables people to be in their living room and see it live as it's happening so ultimately I think what would uh we had our way and we could do it take it to the next level is that whoever is speaking they would be on the camera it would be but the problem is is sometimes create more than one person speaks at a time or we're having a back and forth conversation it gets complicated whereas with editing you can actually fix all that because generally you have two cameras back there rolling and then you kind of pick the best view out of the two and uh and I know that that does take some time there is some value to it because it being a product even though it may be three days later is way better did what we can consume unfortunately the camera is not able to follow our voices anyway they could take a massive very expensive upgrade for someone would have to be literally pointing the camera I just don't see any practical failure Beach budget way to have the perfect world [Music] yes sir uh Mr Mayor I did pull up the email um she's looking you know maybe 10-3 hour you know obviously paid position but she also reporting the volunteer might give this technology is another person to maybe as a volunteer than what he's doing oh it's an option that's something she said yes yes no I mean I just like volunteer for anything curious how to approach it I'm the legislative Kyle's running the show I'm just giving him somebody that the name came up and it looks up to him to see how it fits not fits you know Texas a few minutes so so I'm going to show you how to conversion and once you've done it one time it's it's I'm not a cat right now that's correct it's a good start um it's right now what's that so it's a good start right now we have nothing so let's set up great right right um Mr Baker do you have a a comments no Mr Bowen and that is um if we just continued with Victor doing the video as he's always done how much did we spend last year or what or is that something that can be done in the ten thousand dollar budget I I don't know if you're asking me or Kyle I don't have the exact figures I think some of the longer meetings in the com in the contract I billed out per hour for the additional after two hours of editing and you know the time spent here so I'm not sure what the exact figure would be but Kyle would probably have an answer but are summarized actual for the past for the 2020 2021 budget was uh 7155. and that was with last year was extremely long meeting yes last year was uh the adopted budget was 8 000 of these years I would like to get an updated a whole effective for this video services over I would suggest and do that and then look at it next week next week okay it works for me everyone agree yes sir okay thank you thank you thank you all right now we are on to General business okay um before you you know I'm going to turn you at least you know go through this relatively quickly um personal strategic plan everybody talks about a strategic plan nobody's really done anything but I'm proposing because when I already intended Network before us we have a side note there tells us what specific strategic plan item it affects so we know every meeting will work in the Strategic plan at the end of the year personally you listen strategic plan number and then underneath it's the detail on October September month you did four out of five lines here are the items that hit that that gives us a good way and to prove to the Citizens We're working in the Strategic so I'd like to go ahead of that and that's really it's a admin function that the staff and the recommendation for me on that point Council support I think that we probably need a complete review that everyone participates in with the Strategic plan whether it's to be set aside a day and we have some facilitate or how we handle that I'm not sure but now that we approve the budget we ordered this strategic plan before we go into the next budget cycle so that we have detailed we have a clear outline of what we're budget and this sales uh strangely familiar I think this isn't the first time we've had this conversation where okay we we came into an election cycle and all of a sudden we're now talking about it that's over it makes perfect sense okay it may be many many times which is okay yeah yeah but if it does apply to a certificate and I think a facility a facilitator goes a long way because I think a lot of times the stuff gets done behind the scenes you can buy in and be involved in participating in it so um you know I I was in a planning session where we hired someone with safety College facility now in IHOP Center I said they do a great job facilitating such a thing so I don't know just a I think it's a great idea and I think we should get it uh summarized and readable and have it in front of us all the time vice mayor gun oh lord for anything that focuses a little more attention he gives it a little more emphasis three fingers I I I don't know where to go with you I mean governments people have governments and government agencies all have strategic plans and they're all great until they don't have anything until something comes up and they don't they don't want to use it so um I'm not sure no no all right lastly I think for the most part the general consensus is to get to adhere to this and so you every time an item is put on the agenda it needs to be matched up to a strategic plan but it'd be impossible sometimes it's not but it comes to the first time and then if it's in conflict with the Strategic plan that's something that we will discuss also equator we would need to consider offering the Strategic plan slightly to to accommodate this or if the Strategic plan is that sexual strategic plan is no longer valid okay okay all right I like that um now how do we actually do this so everyone that adds an agenda item would need to go find it in the Strategic plan yeah and in a way that affects you free and everybody refreshing I like that okay well let's give it a shot I will no longer be putting anyone and actually I'll do the same yeah yeah thank you you look like you uh would like that so we're going to apply this obviously to the work session for the rack objectives to discuss are we also really nice because it is great so are we are we also applying this to regular Council meetings yes oh yes yes and more accessions as well and there may be times where it doesn't apply anywhere it's just the general housing let's make those things right yep just what we're discussing and uh maybe Whenever there is no uh there's there's no tag to a specific strategic plan line item so this will be interesting 12 hours Victor is going to be free but I think I think this would be pretty straightforward once we've done it a few times I said yes sir okay uh the next time we already talked about really really want but the big concern here is West Nile Virus we talked about the standing little puzzles we got the biggest pullover Hall basically the swamp it's no longer is a swamp toward you know we're drain Swamp Years but I'm recommending is that we do plantings around the fence basically instead of taking Saturday in a bill or a short speech we organize you know the same people over to the pond take the holes find Organ videos you know whatever money lines higher defense I guess Northern about a thousand bucks 20 bucks for buildings um the next part of that would be was in contact with the West Nile Virus we need to get the pound down that's a counting place they need to have a schedule at least twice a month while you're picking up all the following France but may I mean we get that fund there the township working again without it it will reduce mosquito incidents and provide a welcoming sign coming into our city look let's be proud of it I don't want to see the first thing because I see it coming in as a swamp calcium first I don't think we need to imply that with Disney Belair Shores we need to be filler as well you know right oh yeah okay I think when you mentioned that we have some type of a handshake deal with the county that we actually maintain the pond magazine area from my understanding and meeting with the county or the memory Associates here is that we go up and beyond that property because they were charged for just maintaining it like they do every other protection of 100 County it would not be to our standards so I think that we still need to focus our efforts I don't think we're going to get much more out of them right I just thought that I know that I've been studied by recently set out through here because of the higher room mosquitoes they did assure me that there were helping scale fish living in the pond and then it was not a Steel issue over in the county mod um and as far as development I know we've had about the year decision million thousands and I've been soliciting quotes for a fountain replacement from one thing that was brought up in the past is that it you know the death of the actual pond it's pretty shallow so I've been making sure that people reporting a few just about never been awareness because that didn't represent a maintenance issue over time so I just wanted to make sure it was an investment the city was going to make or some other donation something that was realistic and then as far as the fence again I'm going to reach back out I know [Music] any kind of action before the defense whether it needs to stay there because it is called as far as of course I have a question do we get home in advance so if we bury the defense plant life I want to take all right I want to communicate with them to find out what what they're okay with us as far as planning savings um and also the development they would permit another problem [Music] your opinion is there any um Hazard that could be created by foreign I do not think there's a hazard I I believe that um what they said is they have a certain guidelines criteria where they do and do not put offenses and then when they were out here they thought you had that possibly didn't need offense because the slope itself wasn't steep enough because we did ask you know you see self-detection problems you know completely against all the way around foreign across the street I mean it should they they can follow up and they do maintenance reports and they said that it was still functioning in the way that they thought that they did not have to be dredging [Music] and therefore it was a maintenance okay um the actual parking costs we paid maintenance 9 700 a year uh frankly I looked at other cities and they're using Parts mobile you may keep yourself a stamp it doesn't require a machine potentially we can avoid most of that 9700 a year by door Department I'm going to contact them and see about you know a demo on the second part is when you use a charge card people don't understand that somebody has to pay the fee for the charge it's usually retailer in some cases I'm not sure and I don't ask for the answer now but we may be paying that charging instead of um the bank you know we may have to be afraid that permission is charge card so anyway the thought is like to contact well I will contact at Parkway Milford demo and find out what their costs are and it's not that they don't know how to report because now Sheriff's Awards regularly with their order that they use the Department of Health and they know how to enforce those so it's about a way to get 97 release of a large portion of that previous another project like the city that's fine I just bring out the idea yeah just bring it up yeah to the extent of what we we decide how much we want to charge and you know we've done that in the past and uh but as far as how it's all house processed how what you do how the business is ran that's it's not really our community because they're proposing that but I think I ever get kind of a Lincoln talk to them and you'll see about uh putting down some of them mayor yeah as far as the um the sign that is something we've been discussed amongst the staff and it is a good idea it's called considering that he uh the amount of time I have to spend changing out Parts in most of the years to keep on running um as far as you know some extra help I have no issue with some scheduling some meetings it was council members April so I'll tell you one thing about what I'll tell you one thing about the park mode it will actually hurt us we put a three-hour limit on that mayor to make people walk back from the beach but we can't uh make their stuff all the way back to the car maybe the beer again if you did this park move they don't have to do that we may stay all day we don't know that's it everything computer can be adjusted now with our mobile all right all you need is your license plate and you're smoking your number [Music] yeah what's that that extra three hours is also income too yeah that's a good one it's nice to have the money but uh purpose of the three hours it was to make sure that people were staying here all day long using our this parking lot as a beach apartment and I would like to state that yeah I thought about this but kind of already been correct with the staff and that have already been looking at various ways Frank on to those meters Kyle take a regular cash too he has to take uh dollar bills and fives foreign [Music] good for all public debts private um the public so if we eliminate the meters would that put us into a impossible soup by somebody saying I don't have Park Mobile I want to I want to pay in cash and that's why [Music] you just look at the number and you have to use the app responsible no one's challenging that it's what you're saying I would say that it's not been as the person on this Council charged with giving legal advice I've not had occasion to research it previously in another Community we would answer that an informed basis if we moved in that direction that would certainly be something that could be researched thank you this is a question and this came up until we get a train so we have all this but I'm so excited I'm talking about parking should that have its own Fund in our budget and should that money be designated for I mean I know we have the revenue [Music] use that fund for parking lots or anything like that yes and that that is actually in the uh not departmental budget is I mean it's something that we could look into yeah I'm just curious just curious about it because I heard a controversy any other comments on the number yourself okay um this is uh one of the big ones um you obviously know there's two ways to clear water modern foreign [Music] definitely a safety issue about people trying to get in here the rule of thumb in our community is shop during the week and hunker down on the weekends unless you're leaving very early in the day or very late at night it's a pain to give back to your house what I'm requesting and I'm going to look into it is this may be a multi-person task is when we need to approach the city in front of water they're using our roads basically using the trust of our citizens but we need to talk with them about potential use issues second of all actually we talk to people with classes very so tell us a very touchy about this I've got a bad public perceptions talking to individual hotels and their ownership groups about what the situation is in our city and you know seeking a mutual agreed upon solution there's not a lot they can do other than you know offer money autonomy and prayers for parts but we definitely need to look at this I'm going to say multiple task I mean perhaps Americans move and present a briefing and Clearwater or you know I can go to you know check out the race hotels and find out groups and get down on approval letter but we definitely need to take on the look at this all right he should not goth Boulevard or County Road I understand Kelly Road but they're basically Grimlock in this city if there was nobody anywhere would it be gridlocked so we don't have the authority to change that if it's a county where we don't need an authority to talk about to hotels and various public institutions that through their marketing and their practice drives our traffic into gridlock that's not really a kid we're talking about means we're talking about you know fees for uh them you know kind of agreed to anyone the only way you can turn that point if you put a toll for this one no no um we're talking about talking to Clearwater about use of interlocking our public locking them away for the weekend basically driven their economy we don't have hotels we don't have bad tax they love to drive they're traveling and you're in and you're in the belief that they're going to give some of that impact feed to us Yes actually it's been done it's not only here but I mean very similarities have done that they've talked to these corporations and the corporations want to have Goodwill if you've driven Down Golf there's a brand new I guess it's about 11 story hotel that's under construction over there probably running about 400 people into that place and most of those are I can tell you half well gridlock was golf in Causeway going to their you know weekend retreat I don't disagree with what you're saying when I moved here well I started looking here 15 years ago you go into Clearwater there's probably twice as many hotels maybe three or four times many hotels so the city planner isn't cutting back on tax revenue what you're seeing at these hotels bring in and businesses bring in I don't think they're going to give any of it to us here's the key you're never going to get what you don't ask for I don't think a lot of it also has to do with the relationship you have with the neighboring community so I'm going to say it's probably not um this is probably a better conversation a star had it before amazing they're available ones that look at all the roads located how to bring more and more people into the community my thoughts are the same key is a big bridge I think the bridge going across that the intercoastal head right back to Clearwater and that would that and then that way they can come in on one side on the North side and then maybe some outside or vice versa but it takes years and years to make something like that happen right now it's not clear water that's doing this it's waves it's Google Maps it's saying the shortest route is to go through Miller Beach and head north and yes it does in practice but I think you have to start having a nice conversation instead of a we're going to call the bridge and make everybody laugh anyone else having comments on this vice mayor that you've been down this road yeah there were supposed to be some improvements with the traffic control Center looking at the traffic at the intersection on Gulf Boulevard and the causeway and today I'm not quite sure that's been improved I think we probably need to go down as a group and stand in that opposite her and ask somebody to tell them some questions I'm going to take the biggest Improvement has been the tune of Tournaments has spread things up a little bit I know there's been some concerns from some of the residents about safety but I think if you look at traffic backing up to it at first island I think Vince had improved and why there's always a perception that you're waiting there longer than traffic this afternoon you're faster [Music] the political relationship has been tried at the Clearwater Council and Maryland can really get us anywhere so uh yeah I met a loss there right it's a reality that we all need to face I I think try to stress upon them and it seemed like the same plan as a clear water or building more of a hotel without the thoughts of where these people apart can good morning any other comments and then the thing that I heard in my brain was kind of sand always that's what I think the responsibility I'm young I'm naive okay uh move on um we've been working our butts off about the Strategic the long term we've been working in flood plans we've been working the balance the problem is and we know it happens to write them for those regardless of how much we engineer we're going to flow what I noticed Dr Kyle we have one pump in this place we want to requesting and my vision is get it they run 800 piece not only for use would look immediately if you wanted to understand the muscle working but look you throw one of these in a pump it's all about what's called an inductor so you're Now using pressure water to suck even more water cool it out then maybe I'm an expert with you water that's why you keep a ship from sinking when we do this about 6400 total whereas jury rate when we are getting the NASA flooding pump out the streets just get them back down to where people can safely enter exit they're not flooded and it's not only the problem streets but other areas as well occasionally have flooding where you can actually use this to get rid of the water I think that that would be more of a Kyle I would say to start small try and test this idea I think that Lynn and I discussed here in the past on certain days when our check valves working on 7th street and it's we're not getting a low Target cycle where it's evacuating the pipe itself and then we're getting you know reasonable amounts of rain and it's filling up that it would be a time that we would go down there and uh you know check the water level in that pet storm sewer and pump it out yeah you just want to see the water coming up halfway up the street but yeah then you start small and see what the effects are is plan a new check out and then we can go on from there but definitely there we probably needs at least a little more pump in addition to the one we have and enough hose to reach the day I mean I don't know but right now nothing's being done we can't afford no longer kind of hey we know what happens but you know it's not right uh let's at least try to oppose a solution start small see it works Frank it's kind of made in these pumps and roll out the hoses we only have what two or three people on the staff and when the better alternative be what I suggested months ago put a spill plate in to a base and tank and then pump it out once it reaches that certain level because we're not talking about just your screen we're talking about city wide and the pump is I'm talking about every stream that that has flooding potential not just set the street not just a street yeah first and second Street to have problems I used the past couple weeks or Colorado 70s [Music] uh three to five how much volume do you get out of three to five we don't get much are you familiar with an inductor yes okay uh yeah you need to run it too I mean we need to be starting to do something you can't just argue no no no you gotta get proactive and that's what I'm trying to do here well what I'm saying like is you have to have a plan where are you going to put these pumps at where are you going to unroll the hose in and it's like Jody said if it's coming over the sea wall it's coming up and see them okay I understand what you're coming to bed what's that plan look you've got to start somewhere his ideas in our heads and get us thinking uh I I'm not object to it and whether we agree with it or not it's uh it's something to think about uh this was able I'm going to give you the 15-minute warning okay no I'm about to flush this sorry they can be attached to the regular pair of the small Parks nobody's going to come up with a car park it there no because you're not allowed to park in the streets you bring your kayak break it out and build two little wheels get up the floating platform you know you're kind of you know go launch your dolphins inexpensive um if you want to see the emails or more than looking for the city the Florida Monty if I've received good responses on this then again you buy it on Amazon they're about 2 800 bucks for one of these and we only have a little bit of number of parts so I thought that might be a good idea for everybody [Applause] public property however those things are dangerous and I have one and I have a new Neighbor Next Door and he asked me to plan his visiting mother launch their kayaks off of my dog I received number one because I wasn't there to monitor the property and make sure that they don't get hurt and number two because I've busted my rear end multiple times moving from the dog to the floating dog and slip it's not created hurts so whatever we decide to do this at some time in the future I would like to quickly it's a little more public safe I agree with that but it's also just trying to take care at this point it's looking towards the needs of the media and the rest of the community but again we're in a safe manner right yeah as soon as somebody calls we know what happens that's right um so just want to roll it up look at costs strategic plan free um during the swamp idea you know we worked everything about a thousand bucks parkmobile they just potential savings food we'll find out more impact fees you know it's kind of a non-starter here pump sales is an inductor he had 10K but that's if you're getting all eight you get another one it's at the most 800 bucks I suppose um I mean you know we'll look at the floating peers and frankly it's minimal cost and here's where what can be driven we budgeted 148 management we're holding up the search the money is there it's not about owners of providing underground being all the nasty stuff it's okay then once in a while you don't have to feed medicine to the kid that we should also be preparing for making our neighborhood nice as well as safe as well as beautiful that's what I tried on all this uh today and again it's at a reasonable cost so thank you for your attention I appreciate your time thank you I said it's a question from Kyle I'm sure people have asked before about a good place to launch Cayenne do people use like or mine here I'm just curious yes they do they do launch BuyBacks here at um for trailers and a launch of them take it somewhere else so we also have something Patrick just stayed on paddle board that launched us from this area but I have a question about that because I came by the other day and the sign says don't you know it's what's this he called the property or something and sign right up here I'm pretty sure that's what I saw something about don't come maybe it's because of the location the county sign possibly with the right away there's the county side that says private property you know he didn't say private property but it was right out there right on the shore I I side and I thought why would you not want me to land the girls on the water side what's that from the water side from the water side oh look at that I I could never think yeah but uh I think that's what it was saying is is basically stay um unless it's because the future but you and you both yeah next exercise [Music] but that's thank you now can we check that out yeah think about the floating docks of the with the changes in the water level um about an effect we have some kayak watches built on the fishing docks um so I mean yeah again Bring It Forward discussion and I think you guys prior to the pandemic we did a surveyed best practices with the best use of our property planning and design board took a look at the Marina and the pocket part to make some recommendations that discussed in the files somewhere and we kind of basically archived it because of a Veterinary but it may be time to pull those things up and you know I'll take a look at them uh Wednesday thank you I think even part of that was there was a suggestion of having a sort of like kayak and paddleboard lockers on the Parks from each one markets so that would be like you have your spot and you you wouldn't have to carry it every time just walk over there and you know Park Mobility to be able to handle that too it's like Locker land and Universal Studios okay you know that's all I got sir thank you very much for your time all right I appreciate you uh taking so much time uh and thought uh in your time into this um next time we're headed to the agenda and just give us a general summary of what you're going to do and then that way we can allot our time and the old missionary Market does for kids any other General business is everybody ready to go home two good things one is we talked about the icma and the Florida Legal City Senior advisors and I'm not sure we're talking when Apple's capitalism I think the two different programs and I just want to make sure that Jody borderline I've brought up my CMA Randy and the city tournament tomorrow and defaulted to his experience and relationship with the Florida Legal cities senior advisors and I'm thinking of two different groups because you know when he mentions and Egypt didn't mean automatics it's not the same group that I'm familiar with and I think Joey's thinking about their retirement city and county managers working with icma and they have a program the Rangers or whatever it is that is the senior advisor program and the road Rangers program now goes by the moniker of the senior advisor program and that is the group of retired managers that is they they associate with one another through the icma as a resource offered through FLC so it's sort of a you are right that FLC and the iccma are separate entities they're sort of a to use an analogy I've used in the past the Venn diagram where they intersect and that is a place where their resources are pools or the benefit of smaller communities okay thanks for clearing up then we'll be doing second of all the the normal process is that the vice mayor is elected amongst the council members after the election and what I would like to do is submit an agenda item so that of the next council meeting I would like to look for a replacement to take over the vice mayor of duties play Spirit that's correct okay um I believe all we have to do is correctly that aligns with my understanding would you uh please add that to uh any other General business with everyone would you like to go being a motion to return emotional adjourn okay do I have a second all right all in favor"
