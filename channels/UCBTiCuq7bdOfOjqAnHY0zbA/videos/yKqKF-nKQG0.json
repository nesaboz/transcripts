    "transcript": "good evening everyone it is now 6 p.m and welcome to the may 2nd city council meeting of the city of bel air beach with everyone please stand and join me in the pledge of allegiance eddie will you please call the robot councilman refrain banker president council member leslie doterra councilmember roberts here council member [Music] thank you the first item is approval of the agenda do i have a motion motion frank major has made the motion do i have a second second gun maybe all in favor opposed all right let's move right on to number two which is citizens comments here this time citizens will have up to three minutes to discuss any non-agenda topic when called on please come to the podium state your name and address then direct your comments or questions to the council would anyone like to address the council yes my name is cindy peters i live 2500 gulf boulevard bella beach i want to thank you all for giving me the opportunity to speak on beach renourishment i sat at city council in the 1990s and appreciate all the unappreciated work that you do in city council uh in the pinellas county comprehensive plan coastal management goals objectives and policies is a chapter titled beach and dunes in this chapter pinellas county has entered into a 50-year project cooperation agreement with the army carving engineers that's for 50 years in order to qualify for beach the first speech nourishment four properties on gulf boulevard gave county easements based upon this agreement one of the stipulations regarding the easement states that failure of the u.s corps of engineers and or the state of florida and or the county of pinellas to restore and maintain each seaward of the established erosion control line as to provide reasonable protection from storm events these men will cease and revert back to the association i will give you a copy of the eastman resolution passed by the board of directors at tortugues de mont it seems as if the corps of engineers changes the rules each and every time baylor beach and other communities are due for beach renourishment the corps is requiring the county to obtain 100 perpetual easements from property owners and communities south of us most of these parcels of land are located either into the dunes or east as we are aware betray nourishment is done west of these dunes and these easements are completely unnecessary by the corps of engineers constantly upping the rules communities and counties constantly have to jump through hoops to obtain future nourishment is there any reason as to why there is confusion regarding the easements and what the court his ultimate motives are i'm surprised they haven't declared imminent domain without the beach renourished the dunes will be lost all the sand will be gone and heaven forbid if we get a hurricane or a strong tropical storm extensive damage could be done not only to the gulf front condos but to the entire island of baylor beach before the next scheduled renourishment in 2030. thank you for your time and i do have uh the resolution and photos of free literary nourishment thank you miss peters i'd like to see a copy of that after the meeting if that's possible thank you that'll be fine do we have any other citizens that would like to speak tonight all right that being said we move to item three now we have a presentation from pinellas county sheriff's office let's begin with the law enforcement my favorite one good evening everyone start switch north county sheriff's office the statistics i'm going to present this evening are for the month of march 2022 we'll start off with the ucr property and person crimes report happy to report that we have zeros all across the board for arrests for the month of march 2022 we had a total of 12 arrests for deputy activity as you can see on the report traffic stops so traffic enforcement lead that with a total of 194 a month and then direct controls finally for crash and citation analysis data we had one crash in the city which was around the 1800 block of gulf boulevard and then we had a total of 196 citations and warnings issued in the city of which included in that is also going to be voting citations and warnings and looks like we had 158 warnings issued and citations would need 18 citations if i could i'd also like to touch on last month in april of note many residents have approached me and asked about some activity that occurred i forget the exact date what it would have been during my shift there was a lot of police activity a lot of light sirens canine and the eagle our agency helicopter was out and just to put everybody at ease it was a traffic stop in which the driver bailed from the driver's seat and ran and then we immediately set up a perimeter and with the assistance of k9 unfortunately we weren't able to apprehend them but we stayed in the area long enough to make sure that there was no risk of any future involvement with that subject and that's all i have thank you very much does anyone on the council have any questions thank you sergeant thank you all right next up we have code enforcement report good evening mayor council uh staff and citizen steve platka for the record uh just to give you a little update a couple things that we are working on um we're still working on some of these uh individuals out there working without permits or being licensed in pinellas county still working very closely with the building department and uh mr thomas with licensing board and taking care of a lot of those problems the other thing that we're working on with i'm working on with kyle is the reports for the national pollution elimination discharge so i am also doing that so basically what this is if somebody's having a house built silk stream has to be up around the building itself um if somebody's draining for a pool they have to have either hay bales or some type of sock to to trap any of the pollution that's coming out from the ground um so i am working with with kyle on that but other than that it's been a active month but uh again no complaints from anybody and uh um i'm open to any questions council any questions thank you very much debbie i appreciate it yes sir you too okay now we're up to uh agenda item number four when we get to the consent agenda we will be presenting a proclamation designating the month of may as lupus awareness month today we have a represent a a presentation from gina shell who is the southeast region lucas foundation advocacy co-chair and fellow member of leadership analyst class of 2022. michelle you have poor thank you so much hello everybody my name is dr gina um thank you so much for having me i'm here just to share a little bit about lumus which is a systemic disease a lot of people are not aware of this is a disease that affects over 1.5 million americans 90 of whom are child a child bearing age women it is a disease that due to its lack of awareness it takes approximately seven years on average for diagnosis and approximately 50 of these patients end up ultimately on medical disability so obviously has a lot of financial repercussions as well what we're hoping with proclamations such as the ones that you are signing this evening is to help to increase awareness so that patients will result in going to see that their positions and getting diagnoses a little bit earlier and thereby helping to prevent a lot of the complications such as heart disease stroke kidney failure that come part and parcel with this disease so we really appreciate the time to be able to present to you all we'd like to make you all aware that the lucas foundation of america is here to help to support any patients who may be going through the diagnosis phase of lupus or their families we're here to support them with all types of resources and like to sincerely appreciate for you all signing the proclamation this evening thank you thank you okay now we are up to agenda item number five uh in case you didn't know it may the first begins a turtle nesting season here in pinellas county lindsey flynn is the manager of the sea turtle conservation program at the clearwater marine aquarium and has a special presentation for us today ms lynn you have the floor good evening everybody thank you so much for having me and my name is lindsay flynn i'm the manager of sea turtle conservation program at clearwater aquarium and i'm going to be giving you a quick presentation about sea turtle nesting here in pinellas county and i'm going to start by asking you a question all right how many species of sea turtle are there in the world they're out on a number three thousand anybody seven species of sea turtle in the entire world all right how many of those nest in the state of florida oh two uh three nests commonly here in the state of florida so that's the largest species the leatherback the loggerhead and the green sea turtles those are the three species that that's most commonly here um and here in pinellas county uh that is the loggerhead sea turtle that is the species that miss most commonly here in north canal county a little bit more we're going to talk about what the nesting process looks like and it begins with the adult female emerging from the water at night she's going to crawl up the beach somewhere between the high tide line and the primary dune and she said i'm selecting this site you don't really know the careers that they used to select in this site it could be a lot of different things but once they do choose a site they start preparing it by creating something called a body fit the shallow depression in the sand that they create by making um sort of broad movements with their front flippers once that shallow depression is created they're going to create something called an egg chamber so they're going to use their rear flippers like a shovel and they're going to dig a hole in the sand that kind of looks like the upside down light bulb and once they cannot sort of remove any more sand now is the time to start laying eggs a lot of etsy turtles lay somewhere between 80 and 120 eggs per nest on average four to five times in a single season with a lot of eggs they lay in this about every two weeks so she's a very busy turtle during the season when she's done depositing all those eggs she kind of works backwards she covers those eggs with sand using her rear flippers she sort of packs it in tightly and then she's going to camouflage the sight and the scent of that nest by um sort of moving about sand with her front flippers the reason she does that is because she wants to camouflage the sight and the scent in this from land predators like coyotes that we have in the area when she's done with that she's going to simply turn around and crawl back towards the water she doesn't sort of provide any maternal care for her for her clutch she's not going to come back to it and check on it um that nest is going to incubate for about two months and then hopefully those hatchlings will emerge together at night um and make their way towards the water we're going to talk a little bit about why now that you know a little bit more about sea turtles why should we care about them well they're protected under state and federal law at the federal level they're protected by the endangered species act at the state level they're uh protected on the marine turtle protection act we also want to care specifically about the walker at sea turtle because as it turns out florida hosts more than 90 percent of all loggerhead nesting activity in north america and so this is what the state of florida looks like that black line indicates where they nest in the state that's pretty prevalent you don't nest in the big then area of and they florida sandy beaches in order to nest like everywhere else sandy beaches they're nesting there um now internationally florida is one of two primary nesting locations for the loggerhead sea turtle in the entire world um oman is the other location and we don't remember where it's in the arabian peninsula and it's to yemen and saudi arabia so i think it's cool that little florida is one of those two primary locations in the entire world now what's unfortunate is that the missing population in the line has taken um a significant decrease in nesting that's up to 79 so that means it's really important that we do everything that we can to protect our nesting population of long-range sea turtles because as the our population goes so goes the global population of water and sea turtles we also need to care because sea turtles actually help stabilize beach we're talking about beetroot nourishment when they lay their eggs not all of their eggs are going to hatch it's very natural and difficult for that to happen those eggs then provide vitamins nutrients to the beach vegetation to allow them to grow that beach vegetation then stabilizes the sand that builds up the dunes and then by stabilizing the beach over time it maintains that nesting habitat for only for sea turtles but secrets and shoulders as well um and you can help the part of the sea turtles uh by reducing obstacles and reducing light function to prevent disorientations and we're going to talk about what that means in just a minute unfortunately not all of our tourists recognize that sea turtles nest on the beach at night they tend to leave items on the beach toys and chairs and other things and leaving those items creates an obstruction for our nesting turtles so they don't expect to encounter those so they encounter them they're very likely to leave without nesting now it's very possible that they might come up later in the night and end up nesting which is great but if they come up onto the nesting beach and encounter these time after time after time they will not nest and they could release their eggs in the water and they're no longer viable it's really important that we remove our items at the end of the day to prevent that from happening these are just some instances of sea turtles encountering different types of hostiles in our survey area and that goes for holes in sand castles too when they encounter those big mounds of sand they don't expect it and they will leave without messing as well now to talk a little bit about light pollution so um this is what the state florida looks like at night you can see little pinellas county here among very brightly lit places like miami jacksonville [Music] we are the most densely populated county in the entire state we have a lot of people here who like to move about at night we use a lot of light red lights the problem is is that can interfere with sea turtle nesting so uh under natural conditions sea turtles use brightness as a guide to locate the water um the celestial light blue light and starlight are bouncing off of the sea and creating a nice brick horizon and that contrasts the darkness of land so they're able to orient correctly towards the water now if we have artificial lighting on at night unfortunately that artificial light competes with natural light so the turtles are going to follow whatever is brighter so an artificial light or leaves are brighter than the celestial light they are going to go towards that thinking that is where the ocean is and it is not we often find them in places like pools and parking lots and roadways because of that where they can eventually perish now it's important to note here that um the rule of thumb that we use is if you're standing normally on the beach if you can see the light so it can turtle now what does a disorientation event look like hopefully you can see this but here is the crawl track of an adult female way back there was where the nest was so she crawled all the way to the foreground of the image along the beach trying to find the ocean because presidential lady may have confused her or distracted her from fighting water again and that wastes precious energy that she needs in order to continue to lay those clutches of eggs throughout the season now i'm going to warn you that the next few images are a little graphic but this is the result of disorientation events and unfortunately it is adults and hatchlings finding themselves in areas that they should be should not be like roadways where they can get impacted by motor vehicles it's happening with adults that's happened with baby sea turtles um aside from being impacted by motor vehicles they can just wander about the beach just trying to find the water and that wastes precious energy that hatchlings need in order to swim out into the deep water where they find full floating elbow rats to live for the first few years of life they don't have that energy they're not going to make it it also makes them look more vulnerable to land predators like different species of birds and vegans it's just another image of unfortunately it's impacted by more kids um this is what a hatchling a disorientation event looks like that black circle indicates the nest site these red lines indicated where the hatchlings went after they emerged from the nest site so they should be going towards the water unfortunately limitland did and they sort of wandered about the beach wasting energy trying to find the water and these are hatchimals that may not make it out to water because of that but there's good news we can do something about it florida fish and wildlife conservation commission is our governing agency and they have a motto for sea turtle friendly lighting it's called keep it long keep it low shielded you want to keep it a long wavelength light to get a little technical above 560 nanometers um wavelength that means light that is emitted in the amber and red spectrum they are less confused by that they're less likely to be disoriented by that type of light you also want to keep it low to the ground and use the lowest lumens and wattage necessary for the usage and you also want to shield the light source from being seen from the beach all three of those guidelines must be met or can be considered sea turtle friendly and this is what something a sea turtle friendly property looks like so you can see on the under the before image this was a property that another non-profit called sea turtle conservancy retrofitted panhandle before it was a property with lots of white bright light that sea turtles of any size class would be attracted to um and then the after image is what see your friendly light looks like we're not asking people to turn off the light we're not asking people to fear for falling down or anything like that we want to provide plenty of light for safety and security but we also want to provide light that's less distracting or confusing to see turtles under these types of conditions they're allowed to naturally orient towards the water but can they really see a difference well i'm we're going to find out right now so i'm going to do something really quickly with you guys i'm going to give you this special card that sort of lets you see what a sea turtle sees okay so to us those pictures just like two different colored lights right all right well i'm going to show you some lights here uh in the council chambers uh to see what a sea turtle sees so first i want you to look at this light just with your normal eyeballs not directly at the light just be sort of like okay that might be a light that we would normally see at anyone's property at night okay and this is what a sea turtle friendly light looks like so it's emitting that amber color and it's also shielded now you guys can see that all right now i want you to look at the same light with your handy dandy tool can you see that light yeah so you can see that pretty clearly so a sea turtle might be attracted to that if it's brighter than the celestial light right can you see that can you see it now right so it's not that they can't see it at all especially if [Music] now it's important to mention here that there are other types of artificial life that they can get computed by two even flashlights or cell phone lights can confuse um especially hatchling turtles that are trying to make it towards the water um that functions just like any other type of light so they can become confused and follow your cell phone light while you look for ghost crabs that means instead of on celestial light so we always encourage people to um not use white light but if you need a light for safety and security they do offer um red led flashlights and headstamps that you can use alternatively now to report sea turtle sightings so if you see sea turtles this season we'd love to hear about it you can report your sightings anywhere in the state of florida to the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission at the numbers that you see there if you're here in valler beach or anywhere else in northern canals county that's clear water through treasure island um seat um clearwater aquarium does perform seasonal communities in our area and you can call the bus to report that um you'll notice that at every um beach access point in bellaire beach there is a special sign that says help sea turtles that does talk about the do's and don'ts in the nesting season and ways to report you'll also see special signage at each one of our miss sites this season that indicates the same thing so please don't use any lights here don't touch them don't disturb them if you see anything please report so with that i say thank you so much for listening and i'm happy to take any questions you have thank you miss flynn it's a very informative presentation i appreciate you coming and giving us that does anyone on the council have any questions no question so how obvious is it to see the sand after the mother turtle has come and lay her eggs because i have seen some of your staff or some staff out there that are fencing them off which is wonderful i'm just curious is it pretty obvious to them as to where the eggs have been money good question yeah so we go through training through florida fish and wildlife conservation commission every year or every other year for ongoing site training like that but yes everybody receives training so they can easily cite the crawl tracks of the nesting female and the nest site itself okay anyone else on the council yes so you have a good idea when mom comes ashore and plays her clutch she makes so two months go by do you take a proactive role in that instead of a watch so when the babies start going the wrong direction you can kind of urge them in the right direction that's a really good question we did do something similar several years ago because we had such a significant disorientation rate here in the county we placed special pages called restraining cages on those nests instead of volunteer groups to watch them and make sure that they go the correct way florida fish and wildlife conservation commission has since stopped that program only so they can ascertain the true problem associated with disorientations and sort of allowing us to educate our our residents and our beachgoers about sea turtle friendly light and the importance of making change to sea turtle primarily because managing or implementing a night program like that is expensive and difficult to do i mean it seems like there's there's a lot of interest in volunteerism and stuff like that we've seen it in beach cleanup and stuff like that so i mean witnessing that sort of stuff kind of breaks your heart when you see these critters going in the wrong direction stuff in the name of maybe better statistics thank you any other council members i'm sure there's some yes just a follow-up on it so how accurate is the two-month period so if you guys know that on january the 1st the mother laid the eggs how accurate is the 60 days typically it depends on the weather conditions so and where it's laid so it's out in the beach where it's being exposed to sun all the time it might be a little less if it's exposed to rain water or shade conditions it might be a little more anyone else i'm sure we have citizens out there that would like to ask a question any citizens so you're not no longer relocating the nest for the terms that's a good question we do not typically relocate nests um unless it's necessary for a construction project like beach renourishment or there are very specific conditions that are met because ultimately um the sea turtle uh females lay their nests a lot better than we ever could for them so we like to leave them in place and make sure that they incubate naturally as much as possible yes all the way in the back it's not a question i just want to say that could you stand up so we can hear you okay a number of times over the past uh eight years um i've been blessed to help her or encounter her in the beach and she and her team go above beyond and i apologize i've been able to help with my nuts so you would probably say that beach new renourishment is very vital to these turtles to continue to come up on beaches to play their eggs every season correct each nourishment does provide a method for providing centralizing right you have to have sandy beaches in order to nest so if we didn't have those sandy beaches they would go elsewhere all right yes mr loves thank you could you would you mind standing up yeah no problem i uh i agree with colin over here by debbie uh thanks for the great work is it factor fiction that when they are born the mothers come back to the same region to give birth and it does tie to steve's comment about beach if the beach is gone however many years they live however many miles they travel that's disorientation in itself is it if that is a fact that they come back some internal gps system or whatever it is right so it is true that sea turtles tend to come back to their needle beach or the beach that they were born at there is some research to suggest that it is more of a range for certain species there's a lot more research that needs to be done for that for example green sea turtles might be capable of nesting in multiple states in the same season but that may not necessarily be true for locker heads there's a lot more research that needs to be done i don't know that i'm prepared to comment on what do you ever get involved with the re-nourishment activity for this reason oh good question so our last re-nourishment project we've had in this area which was back in 2018 we did provide monitoring services for that project so we were responsible for monitoring at least in north um pinellas county so in this area for all sea turtle missing activity and if it was going to be impacted by the renourishment project we were given special permissions from fwc to relocate them we'd like to see the involvement on the other side to help us get i'm just kidding thank you just like follow a question i don't know about anybody else but i've seen the sea turtle nest before we got future renourishment and i've seen so many eggs the little ping-pong balls out there because there was no nest no place for it to lay it sit right on the tide line and very few of them survived a storm would come in and it would be washed out right so they can be washed over or washed out with major storm activity the good news is that sea turtles do try and hedge their bets in that way in that they lay multiple nests per season with many eggs in those clutches so even if even if we had a zero season for example the population itself would still be okay because there are nesting activities elsewhere obviously that's not what we want we want a successful season every season but they do hedge their bets to sort of make sure that somebody survives thank you very much ms flynn i appreciate your presentation and uh i look forward to welcoming you back next year if it works out thank you so much all right so now we are on to the city attorney report mr sullivan mayor council if you haven't had a chance to see that the u.s supreme court made a very interesting ruling today that ruling will affect all municipalities regarding how you handle your flags and display those particular flags throughout the city i will be meeting with the city manager to discuss the current policy and perhaps bringing forward a policy for council to consider a workshop um regarding this to make sure that you are still in control over who can display flags on the city property so that is it's an interesting opinion without going too much into detail but as long as it is government speech on the flags that you display that's fine if you start allowing a lot of private use to display flags then it becomes a first amendment right so we want to make sure that you all or the city is in control of determining what kind of flags you're going to put out and who can use city property interesting that's all i have here all right thank you very much i look forward to hearing about that and now we are on to the city manager report mr reeves uh mayor console you've got a copy of my report in there a couple items on it we're gonna to discuss later in the agenda the 12th and 13th chance of trainings project the 7th and 16th sweet seawall and uh we've got the city attorney interview scheduled for thursday may 5th at five o'clock and we're doing the first reading tonight on the revised section 94. put at your positions the preliminary budget and during the month of may i would like to meet with each of you individually to kind of go over that so uh we'll lose that and we'll schedule something that we can do through the week the children's playground out here we're going to have to replace or we're going to have to whether we're going to have to take it now because it's deteriorated and just an update i did go back to the county for the beach renourishment the county contract does say 10 years from the time frame and uh the federal pays 60 percent of the state 20 percent of the county 20 percent towards petri nourishment i am going to discuss with them the parking spaces because the contract has a little different number than they've always told us so he sent me the contract so that's kind of my standard so that's all i have unless you have questions any questions for my memories actually now on all these street drainage projects um my street last friday we had less than a half an inch rain at low tide it was a total mess again i don't know if what size conduit i think it was 18 or 20 inch they put in there but i don't know if the baffles aren't working i really think importantly we start spending a lot more money that we look at this i mean uh i think that the water went down as far as like four houses down in the street at that time well we can look at the baffle the baffle on actually eight streets very small because of the uh type line that's flowing between the house at the end of the street has been reduced by sea walls over the years you know where they've built sea walls and they made the type smaller so it's a small but uh we'll check the battles to make sure they're closing especially they should have been wide open because we were probably an hour before low tide and the water was just at least two feet in the middle of the street yeah i mean i know 12th and 13th there wasn't any and they had baffles so there may be an issue with the baffle we'll check on just curious was that whenever we uh what was it we had three inches of rain well friday i think we had a half an inch i mean it came down hard for a good uh half hour 45 minutes away it just you know it just didn't drain okay i guess we need to check into that see what the problem is any other questions for mr reeds all right well let's move on to the city clerk report miss gendry um on my report the main thing was city manager search resumes that we've been receiving we've gotten 18 so far so um just starting working on those a little bit and the deadline is may 23rd and the second thing was the unicode supplement we did get approved copies back so we'll start reviewing those and then the last thing was the city please continue the city board committee appreciation lunch uh that was hosted by uh city council and i think that went very well and everyone seemed to enjoy themselves and i just want to stay for the record that that since i've been here that is the most well attended my counsel and all the board members so i was very happy to see that does anyone have any questions for mr yes thank you did we get our city stance and pull into policy i saw something happen any other questions thank you very much okay so now we are on to agenda item uh 9 10 and 11. uh just for the sake of time i'm asking for approval of the april 4th 2022 city council meeting minutes approval april 11 2022 city council work session minutes approval and april 18th 2022 city council work session and then it's approval do i have a motion motion made by frank banker do i have a second second correct um what i wanted to do was just do these three by themselves and then i was going to do the other ones individually and that would be uh just to speed the meeting along because we're running short on time okay so the second was made by my table all in favor any opposed all right the motion passes and we're finished with the minutes uh now we are on to authorization for the mayor to execute an interlocal agreement for a funding match of a southwest florida water management district cooperative funding initiative grant do i have a motion boy roberts okay all in favor all right any of others motion passes and we'll get that signed and then move forward with it next we're up to item 13. this is for authorization for the mayor to execute the addendum to the city manager employment employment agreement do i have a motion frank baker let's have a second leslie natara all in favor any opposed and the motion passes now we are on to out of 14. this is a proclamation designating the month of may as lupus awareness month proclamation whereas lupus is an unpredictable and misunderstood autoimmune disease it can cause severe damage to the tissue and organs in the body and in some cases death and whereas more than 5 million people worldwide suffer the devastating effects of this cruel and mysterious disease and each year over 100 000 young women men and children around the world are newly diagnosed with lupus the great majority of whom are women of childbearing age and whereas medical research efforts into lupus and the discovery of safer more effective treatments for lupus patients are underfunded in comparison with diseases of comparable magnitude and severity and whereas many physicians worldwide are unaware of symptoms and health effects of lupus causing people with lupus to suffer for many years before they obtain a correct diagnosis and medical treatment and whereas there is a deep unmet need worldwide to educate and support individuals and families affected by lupus and whereas there is an urgent need to increase awareness in communities worldwide of the debilitating impact of lupus now therefore be a result that the month of may is hereby designated as lupus awareness month which lupus organizations call for increases in public and private sector funding for medical research on lupus targeted education programs for health professionals patients and the public and recognition of lupus as a significant public health issue dated the second day of may 2022. do i have a motion ocean motion made by frank banker i got a second any opposed the motion passes thank you very much michelle all right now we are on to item 15 another proclamation uh this is observing the 53rd annual professional municipal clerks week proclamation municipal clerks week may 1st through the 7th 2022 whereas the office of the municipal clerk a time honored and vital part of local government exists throughout the world and whereas the office of the municipal clerk is the oldest among public servants and whereas the office of the municipal clerk provides the professional link between the citizens the local governing bodies and agencies of government at other levels and whereas municipal clerks have pledged to be ever mindful of their neutrality and impartiality rendering equal service to all whereas the municipal clerk serves as the information center on functions of local government and community whereas municipal clerks continually strive to include and improve the administration of the affairs of the office of the municipal clerk through participation in education programs seminars workshops and the annual meetings of their state provincial county and international professional organizations whereas it is the most appropriate that we recognize the accomplishments of the office of the municipal clerk now therefore i dave gatts mayor of the city of bel air beach florida do recognize the week of may 1st through may 7th 2022 as municipal clerks week and recognize that

hopefully it passes and speaks for itself thank you very much any other comments from the council uh i just had uh one question because the there's i see it's uh highlighted in yellow can you give me a quick summary as to why that was dropped off and mayor i believe you're talking about section 20 exception 94 256 correct temporary structures council brought up at the workshop that they did not believe that this section involving moving vans and moving trailers was in the appropriate section so we removed that and pursuant to council's uh feelings at the workshop and obviously subject to your vote tonight and a second reading and we will move that to another section perfect thank you any other council members no let's take it to the citizens can you send us some comments nope all right back to the council with frank baker do you have the last word please take it to a vote all right uh penny would you please call the roll councilman roberts hi councilmember aye councilmember baker aye council member doterra hi six to zero and the uh the first reading of the ordinance passes and we will repeat this this act in a month thank you very much now we move on to item number 19. this is to authorize the city manager to award the 12th and 13th street drainage modification project then b 22-01 uh the request is to award the bid to kaminga you got me ruthless incorporated in the amount of seven hundred and seventeen thousand three hundred forty nine dollars and sixteen cents and approve a budget increase in the stormwater capital projects fund not to exceed two hundred thousand dollars do i have a motion leslie nataro who have a second frank baker all right leslie you have the floor hello mr mayor council this is uh for the 12th and 13th street drainage project includes repaving most streets new curves and remodeling the pipes that are available in our right of way we're not changing anything on outlaws that go to private property and unfortunately the bids are coming in significantly higher than what we had budgeted for in this case 200 000 higher we got two bids uh one for 717 the other one for 827 pounds so tonight uh the engineer uh reviewed the quotes and recommended knrs on twitter and i've given you copies of the documents thank you we have any other council comments yes i do have a question i don't have a problem with the bid itself when the bid that was submitted that we're getting ready to maybe improve when was the ending date that their it would be good there's we haven't we would either have to reject it you mean when would when they submit a bid and they say this bid is good for next days no typically they don't say it's good for x days not not arguments there's nothing in there you know six months as an example to approve it and they would say well that's too long because the prices have gone up et cetera well they haven't indicated the bit end date okay they can remove the bid at any time after after they've submitted right okay but my real my real concern is um know a lot of this happened before we came on board so this is i'm not pointing fingers at anybody but i'm concerned that you know our job is to make sure that whatever we spend money on it's it's for a very very good reason and we're getting the bang for the buck type of thing so i have had the opportunity to review both kyle and lynn were nice enough to give me copies of the master plan and i looked into that again i just want to make sure for example one item would be we're going to put in different size reinforced concrete pipe that's going to cost a fair amount of money to do that but what is the real benefit to that from a stormwater design standpoint so my my gut tells me i would like personally the opportunity and i don't know exactly the right thing to request if we table this and we're able to for example bring both the contractor and the engineer into a workshop and i could ask a lot more questions just so that we can determine and feel comfortable that the portion of the money we're spending to replace bikes is really going to give us something back to the city you know an analogy would be you have an air conditioning system in your house and it's currently cooling to the lowest of 72 degrees and you want to get lower but it won't so you bring somebody in and they say well it's undersized so we're going to give you a bigger unit okay what's going to bring it down to our lowest temperature 70. and how much is it going to cost us 5 000 so then there you are trying to make that decision is it worth it to you to spend five thousand dollars to bring the temperature down two degrees by getting a larger size system so i just want to make sure that we understand what the benefits are by replacing those pipes because my gut tells me we're not really winning a lot there and that's a big part of the cost of this particular contract i know when you and i have talked about it before it's going to give us a little bit more volume like in the system but how many times is that really an issue when we have a rain event and we all know now that when you have a rain event and we have high tide and the water is trying to get out that's a scenario where that body would come into place because it's going to hold a little bit more water in the pipes before it back flows into the streets so how often would that happen and how much of a benefit would it be to have a larger pipe that may prevent that issue so that's what i want to get a better feel for we want to make sure that for example if we quote tabled it and and talk about this in more depth at the workshop and we could have the engineer there in the contract there to discuss some of that just to make sure that it's a good expenditure of money for that particular item i mentioned like large pipes yes awesome that's playing good uh we have another agenda a little further on where we're looking at another price increase of eleven percent now what this one bothered me this is an increase of 38 and that's what that's for the 520 thousand dollar or 13 to 14 going back the original budget way back was like 420 now yes things are changing and things are changing 38 i mean i would i'm with lloyd i'd kind of like to understand the timeline of this thing what the increases are in and whether or not we have some assurances that we're going to need our our specifications and deliverables for that kind of money so uh i'm i'm with you and i would i would motion that we amend this to go ahead and take the issue until we can have you mentioned tabling also who wants to claim the motion the motion every table this is pending inviting in the contract and having a little more definition of what to put the same multiple pricing all right so we we have a motion and tables we have a second second all right lloyd roberts in that case addie you want to take yes councilmember zotero well councilmember roberts yes councilmembers abel yes vice mayor gunn aye mayor goddess hi so the motion to table passes at five to one and we will uh take this back to the work session all right we are on to item number 20. this is to authorize the city manager to award a 7th street seawall slash boat ramp and the 16th street seawall renovation project then b 22-02 the request is to award bid b-22-02 to mid-coast construction enterprises llc in the amount of 225 500 and approve a budget increase in the capital improvement fund not to exceed twenty three thousand two hundred and two dollars do i have a motion ocean frank baker do i have a second second floyd roberts i frank you on the floor long time coming needs to be done both both streets don't have any other council comments citizens citizen comments on this one no all right back to the council with frank baker having the last word no more all right so this is to award bid b22-02 to mid coast construction enterprises llc in the amount of 225 500 and approve a budget increase in the capital improvement fund not to exceed twenty three thousand two hundred and two dollars penny would you please call the roll councilmember aye councilman roberts i'm council member [Music] all right we are on to agenda item number 21 do we have any unfinished business all right as soon as we have no unfinished business we'll move on to council comments last week we started with council member banker so this or not last week but last month this month we will begin with uh council members able yeah i just want to mention the wonderful activity parks where i put on this past weekend really enjoyed it if you had a chance to come out as wonderful music wonderful food wonderful time just to talk and meet other people here so again thank you very much for all you've done for this county well for this city i agree anything else no sir all right and now we move to council member roberts yeah i just want to take an opportunity i had some pretty neat stories i actually told my wife i was going to write a book but since i don't have the time for doing that of different all the citizens that i spoke to when we were going through the running for office scenario so this is going to be like void story time it won't take too long but uh one of the neat scenarios i had i'm not going to go over in one of the condo units and we talked about the typical things about what's best for the city what would you like me to focus on and towards the end there was a couple and the husband said uh lord are you a christian and i said yes i am he said we are as well and if you don't mind we would like to pray over you for your success in running for this position so they did and it still gives me chills today um how good that made me feel what they were doing so again every month i'm going to share a really interesting story with you guys and if you want to take notes and write it down you can and then we learn the book together thank you very much councilmember notoro vice mayor gunn i've got three issues one is along the lines of best practices in managing the agenda a recommendation i would have is that number one [Music] approval of the agenda that's a perfect time if somebody wants to pull an item out of the consent agenda for instance i would like to go ahead and lead the proclamation perfect time so i would pull item 14 and 15 from the consent agenda and move it into regular agenda item you've adjusted the consent agenda once you prove the agenda you just get to consent agenda items one through 15. call for a boat and it's done i like it that's just a recommendation so that's that's one issue is the consent agenda in moving items at the number one approval of the agenda so when you get to the consent agenda it's just a done deal the second is the sea turtle presentation i thought was great and it goes towards engaging our residents and i i've always referred to it as failure beach 101 these are the things how we get a chance to engage the residents and educate them on programs in the community poison control traffic control safety during the holidays that sort of thing it's just 10 or 15 minutes maybe look to add more that stuff into our agenda it's kind of a neat thing and the last thing is it looks like the audio visual is running up and down we've got the visuals in the back i can't see these but it looks to me like the residents can see everything from the powerpoint presentation yeah so who knows to the staff getting that up and running great job and it's really making a huge difference in presentations that's on our head thank you okay uh once again i'd like to thank everyone who attended tonight i encourage you to keep coming back and don't be afraid to contact us with questions and concerns we want to hear this stuff so it's uh it's not it's not a bad thing if you haven't complained did i beat you up i'm so sorry well it's because i mentioned you at the beginning sorry about that right go right ahead just two little things i actually went to mrs petey's house uh earlier this year for the campaign season she was showing me her home and explaining the beach renourishment to me beautiful home and before she got her efforts to get the beach in our especially to explain it would come into the bottom of the conduits i feel for you and i i don't know why the federal government is holding us these standards down here in vanellos county where i sent the council i'm not i said to patty but just up in new jersey they're doing a new need for nourishment next year they're not having any problems i know the federal government gives us the lion's share of the money but our beaches are getting smaller and smaller and i really feel for you um and on the other thing with the night one item number 19 i agree on tabling this because what i brought up about a street and a water problem and i agree with you 100 percent uh it really needs to be looked into maybe we need a catch basin rather than just a bigger plate and maybe eight inch pumps above this workout but that's it that's all you got thank you i apologize okay now back to where i was uh again i'd like to thank everyone for coming tonight and uh please reach out feel free to call us email us come see us and uh and bring your questions and concerns because that's how we know what to do in the work sessions other than that do i have a motion to adjourn so just a quick a quick question just i just looked over and saw mr reeves there so we have something already in place with regards to when he retires who's going to be the interim have you already done that i think you're looking at him right over there we have to do anything all in favor [Music] thank you very much have a good night"
