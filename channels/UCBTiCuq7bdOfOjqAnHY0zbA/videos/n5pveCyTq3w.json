it's actually now item three uh this is a consideration of resolution 23-19 Mr Morrow would you uh please read the resolution happily Mr Mayor this is resolution 20239 a resolution of the city council of the city of Beller Beach Florida extending the pre previously noticed and advertised qualifying period for the March 19 2024 election to run without interruption through noon on December 18 18 2023 providing for the qualifying process and providing an effective date as you reviewed the resolution before you council members you'll note it sets forth the history of the resolutions we've we've adopted relative to this election and what it does is extend we had already noticed the qualifying period to begin on uh 8: a.m. on Friday December 1st it was originally um contemplated to end on Friday of last week and uh on request we are extending this through December 18th noon that is the pretty much last minute that qualifying could conceivably be open we have to report to the supervisor of elections on December 19th with ballot language which would include the name of names of the candidates so this is the longest uh we could have the qualifying period um and of course that has to allow time for anybody who submits a packet Ty the packet verified and reviewed so with that um that is the resolution before you and uh otherwise have to answer any questions thank you Mr MOA before we uh go to the C I need to go to the public would anyone like to speak on this topic seeing as we have no one wanting to speak uh sist and comments are now closed uh before we move forward on this I'm going to need a motion to approve this resolution motion made by Leslie Mato do I have a second second second Roberts uh Mr you have the floor I think um Mr Morrow made it very clear I asked him why it goes through the December 18th as opposed to like maybe going through the end of December and that's because that's there's the date that we have to have the stuff to the supervisor of elections so December 18th is really the last time we can accept qualification papers whatever you want to call them that's a Monday and I believe that's Tuesday we have that's the official day 5 PM Tuesday the 19th is the deadline for theis of Elections and we considered going all the way to the end but um in the event that there's an onslaught of applications um Mr is going to need time to help put all that together so okay any other comments from the council yes sir why are we doing this we are doing this because we have five open seat Well actually now we have uh we have five open seats potentially five or three it depends upon how the election goes currently we have one qualified candidate there are four seats that be subject we had um I thought the last meeting if I'm correct didn't we have three people that acknowledge they picked up their packets and send information that was two no one ter man so I had two additional uh potential candidates pick up iers for the information but they decided not to submit here's a question for [Music] youch feedback from Mr Chester's microphone in the airport you can continue Mr Charles Mitchell won't be reporting that this since we already had a resolution in December 8th my concern is doesn't matter if we have one or 20 people that qualified or submitted what if somebody challenges this now and that one person that qualified or whatever doesn't get one um and we have to re is there I don't know what the filing Fe is three4 $500 I mean could how much cost the the city rerun an election or could they rerun an I guess the bigger question is would this open the door that you could rerun an election because you already had a resolution well we we as a coun you as a council enjoy the ability to to do what you've done here in terms of re noticing something your your election qualifying period had already been noticed if somebody chose anytime you folks take an official act any act you open the door for somebody to challenge it so every Act is another potential and I have to acknowledge that here and always anytime you do something it's one more chance for somebody to challenge it I I think if you're looking at it from a practical policy standpoint you have here the desire to make the election more inclusive rather than less inclusive and less app to a challenge in that sense but of course were something to be challenged we'd be prepared to address that um this was offered as an opportunity or or a a mechanism by which this city could solicit candidates for a longer period of time to ensure as it says in the whereas Clauses to amend and extend the qualifying period to maximize the opportunity for potential candidates to qualify um so it's rather than foreclosing it I would be much more concerned if we were taking a qualifying period that was a week long and making it 3 days long rather than in in and anybody who qualifies would still be subject to all the same requirements um so it's not time to fast pass in the door that somebody else could not have taken advantage of yeah and I understand everything we do be challenge but I mean I think we open the door of P's box a little bit wider when we have a resolution that expired and the results weren't I don't know if the results weren't what we wanted but the results are the results I mean and then you have a charter saying if slots aren't filled then you Council Phil that's my whole question I think I think someone can follow suit against us and we have to Mo this election Mr Banker we we could chase our Tales all day on the hypotheticals but the way that I looked at this whenever I called for this meeting was that if we don't have candidates how are we going to appoint somebody D do you understand what I'm saying it's the same it's the same opportunity I rather that we actually had a real election and had enough candidates rather than having to appoint everybody on the council because that's whenever you're really opening yourself up uh for uh a possible challenge um but this this Council has the opportunity to vote on it and uh do you have any other comments no I'm just saying we've I've been here two and a half years we many positions opened up um and we've always had more than one like to run so I don't know what the problem this is a uh Senate Bill 774 problem is what this is um I think we've all discussed it already many times would anyone else like to comment on this no I'll just say I agree with you when you say sen from yeah exactly okay uh well if there are no other comments then let's take it to a vote Miss Rose would you please call the RO council member bankard no council member Chester oh did we lose it okay council member Notaro yes council member Roberts yes uh council member Shaw Elliot yes Vice May mayor Shirley hi and mayor gtis yes and did we get Mr Chester's vote Yes he voted yes yes okay so one two three four five okay six to one then uh this resolution passes um and that's all we've got I appreciate everything uh you've done for us Mr Moore with putting this together and uh making sure that we're covered and I appre a city manager putting this meeting together and uh if there's nothing else I would like a motion to adjourn motion motion made by Frank maker do I have a second second get that one to time delay Mark CH all in favor I oppos I all right thanks"
