    "transcript": "on the 24th of the agenda [Music] promulgated move approval 94. it is probably lynn maddy's favorite take care of the bushes section quite involved when you read it you right around the city and you look and you think wow there's a ton of bushes and stuff over this city and trees etc let's kind of use the let's do use the format that we used last time and this time we'll start with that again okay okay and section 941 purpose uh there's some good good wording in there about why this section exists i thought it would probably be a good place to make a reference to um striving to achieve and adhere to the city of bel air beach strategic plan i'm not sure anywhere in the code we actually referred to that and i think it's probably not a bad idea if we're going to actually make use of the plan so and so much of what is in here actually goes back to the in the intent of the of the strategic plan so should we make motions to prove those things as we discuss them or wait for the end i think we get lost we know i think last time you were doing them as we went work didn't right so i moved that word [Music] and then on to 94.2 definitions and i think i got this one from from angela to add the definition for modular home because those seem to be evolving there's more and more types of modular homes so probably need to have a definition in there for that one is there any further discussion no comment at all in okay all those in favor and then in 1946 landscaping requirements traffic hazard all landscaping installations must provide an unobstructed view to adjacent property owners or the motoring public and that four feet from the from the street should apply right yeah we have quite a few your candle or your mascara if you wish i think we have quite a few homes where are lots where the landscaping is actually right up to the edge of the curb it doesn't actually interfere with pedestrians but it's coming awfully close and and i do think it could be um could obstruct the view for the for drivers some of them is on curves so and then in section i talks about the mulch mulch in the right of way must be contained within border sufficient to prevent floatation of the mulch into the roadway i think we've seen at least recently on belle isle a yard that was cleaned up very very nicely it looks really good but the mulch comes right up to the edge of the valley curb and i don't see any edge there but it hasn't floated away in the rains occasionally we'll have someone that will call about that what we have to do is go to the property you know they need to put something along the edge to hold down yeah with the hard rains we had a couple of weeks ago we expected to see that stuff flood off and it didn't so and the wind too with the rains and the wind yeah i don't know maybe they cemented it down i don't know no it's mainly the actually it's the uh pine bark stuff that floats more than more than a little fiber mulch it pretty much stays there yeah i'm not sure what this i haven't picked it up to test it but okay in section m the irrigation on existing residential properties avoid rubber runoff overspray and other similar conditions where water flows onto our over the adjacent property into the um didn't the county used to come around and monitor that when they first installed the illegal yeah for like illegal watering and stuff right and in the last code review we i'm trying to remember where it is we did something about the irrigation spray into the stream but it's very hard to of course when you know you can fix your irrigation today like last night it was very windy if your irrigation ran yeah what you really have to catch is when the uh the little nozzle itself turns toward the street right and that happens often but the county used to enforce that i don't know if they still do they they only enforce the water restriction oh okay so i'm not sure if we want you know that that's probably fine as is yeah i i mean we we didn't put that in the last coat change i don't remember exactly where but that you know if we found someone water in the street we would tell them about it marv has a question i think j.c mark has a question i think yes on the landscaping that goes all the way to the curbs on each property and sometimes there's a problem with people there's been a request by some of the people living on the cul-de-sacs they would like to have even though our codes of the national would like to have we need to be sensitive to the homes that are in the cul-de-sac areas on ohio at the end of and harrison and the building which states island just let them run those controversies as long as it's not a traffic hazard i think you know just my opinion i think i can't quite hear you i think you would be uh it would be subject to discretion i guess what i'm saying because that that could create a problem with okay well i'm starting the cul-de-sac so i should get into i think that that would be a concern i know it's been brought up in a couple council meetings about not site patterns and um if we start being more enforcing on those side patterns along the turns or backing out of your driveway then i think you have to be use it no matter where it's at and i think saying okay if you live in a cul-de-sac that doesn't apply to you i think you're kind of the first time there's an accident because they couldn't see you're in trouble yeah so i mean our code says that and i will say we're not we don't strongly enforce it because you know for the most part as long as it's not impeding the roadway or something uh unless we get a complaint then we will enforce it pretty hard of course problems at interceptions and just individual blocks right and at this point you're riding around the city and look the vegetation is so overgrown almost everywhere and it'd be a huge backlash so this would be an individual situation yeah we get a complaint you know like we'll get a complaint you know hey i can't see down you know coming out of my driveway or something because of this person planted this thing and it's hanging out probably the most place we get complaints 21st street this is ask him ask complaints yeah and it's it's a complaint it's on annoying yeah the person there doesn't maintain their landscaping and then we have to go tell them to cut it back away from the curb you know and just because it ends up like this on the road okay thank you let's see in 94 62 under powers and duties d it was talking about um a fee in the amount of 500 and i was wondering if that should be moved to the schedule in case you ever need to change the fees for any reason that that piece changed patty that's the quarter adjustment thousand dollars right so it may not be codified i mean it's not i'm not sure but yeah it it it might it might be in the front they're not codified i just didn't look up there no it's a thousand now and they're refunded uh 500 of it if it's a north adjustment board but if it has to go to the manchester they've paid that for manchester united actually i think that was changed one of you but this one's actually in the the wording there as opposed to being part of a schedule would there be any reason to make it part of the fee schedules that we don't have to change the schedule well then you only have to change it by resolution and then you get into go back go back i guess to a7 a7 okay i've lost that oh oh i'm just i'm adding for power under powers and duties adding that such variance doesn't conflict with the city of bel air beach strategic plan the board of adjustment can adopt rules and procedures to and talking about approving variances and there's the six list of why they approve the variance and i was just adding one more check for approval variance making sure that the variance doesn't conflict with the city of bellar beach strategic plan i guess i need to check the typos every one of them doesn't need to be aware of confidence this is part of their instruction you're calling for a motion yes they did your second any second discussion those in favor opposed and then in 94 65 on time limits any variance on which construction has not begun within six months of the granting date of century shall be invalid i was just thinking maybe because elsewhere you use the term expiration and the wording may be any variance approved shall expire on which construction has not begun within six months of the grinding of such variants that's kind of awkward but it's really just a wording thing using the term experiment expires opposed to becoming invalid do you have that order the way you wanted to no [Laughter] no you'd just be changing the word invalid to just saying that just using the trim exploration parallel with a another another item in here that used the term exploration so a little parallel construction there in a 94-133 [Music] designation of land use categories lynn you had 133 on your list of areas to look at what are the issues there because well this is kind of going to be a mix the the there's been some discussion by the city council that they think we have a commercial area in the city mainly because things like the nautical watch the bellar beach resort and the hotel and we don't get time to taxes for them do we and they are rated as facilities but we have no commercials the tax appraiser taxes them as a commercial discussion but they're not considered commercially so that's something i just put in there to kind of let you know because eventually we're going to have the comp plan come up and we might want to have that discussion in there i was going to say doesn't that really belong in the comp plan maybe comp plan first and then come back and change the ordinances to match the comp plan if if the planning what would be the advantage what would be the pros and cons of adding it or not i mean from what i understand from the tax appraiser it doesn't mean anything because they're collecting taxes as a commercial entity so i mean that's a question yeah and i think that's something we need to talk to the consultant that's moving into the comp plan of course and say hey how is this handle and because for the most part they all started out as condoms okay and then nautical watch became a time share at some point in time the bellar beach resort became is still all condos but there's a an owner that owns half the units that claims he's a timeshare and if you look at our ordinances technically there's a section that talks about you can't have a condo can't have an office okay well the other 21 units of the nautical of the bellar beach resort or condos well they have an office there like a hotel jacket desk one thing is that they can have an office there's a section that code that says you can't have a an office in a condo it's kind of backwards the way it's set up so uh and i don't remember exactly what section that's in but it was something that was that i read and i talked to the city attorney about it he said you know if we wanted to push the issue we could say hey can't have an opposite you know so i think that needs to be a discussion so just basically tabled section 133 until after the comp plan yeah yeah i just wanted to make you aware of what what was what the discussion was the concern a couple of council members felt that and i don't really know how beneficial because and that's up to cancer yeah because the property appraiser says they collect the taxes but would what our other ordinances building ordinances in terms of far and height restrictions everything still apply if they if they're considered commercial i think you'd have to amend something that was commercial because they're designated either presidential medium or uh which means four units an acre or fifteen units in anger the condos are the mediums that are residential that could be a big issue once we get to it then yeah okay and then in 134 interpretation of district boundaries are are the uh the far and isr the are those those are enforced with the site plan those are still in force okay so some of the new construction looks like it's trying to encroach on border to border well you don't you don't count typically you don't count the garage but they're still within the setbacks and the lot size you know the carrier ratio so maybe they built a garage out to the maximum setback but the rest of the house is square footage falls into the we typically don't count the garage or stairs going up into the house we do count balconies and it's complex doesn't it yeah yeah and then under 135 uses uh we're talking about all those different usage under which title does the marina that's recreation so if it's recreation then there is actually some structure in non-permeable landscaping um allowed on the uh the parks and the marines but you but there could be some construction there i mean you could if we needed to construct a bathroom or something there at some point that construction would still be allowed because it still be within the ratio right okay not that it's an issue do we have anything that's considered to be preservation land use district bayside out here a portion of that yeah sorry ah remember mangrove chocolate 94 161 yeah i just i just had a question on the wording there i didn't understand the particular word let me see if i can find that one group home residence consisting of a family not twix seat eight may be constructed four levels or another and have oh i see okay now it makes a little more sense now it just means you can have a garage and build two levels up okay so not bigger not to exceed 35 feet and that's 35 feet from the bmv but realistically all you can build is 34 because there's a one foot one foot one free board now and that's a requirement of the flood insurance actually this year that any new construction has to have vfe plus one foot of freeboard some communities are adopted even three foot or three so as an example if you're uh flood elevation is you just say 11 foot for your lot okay you got to add one more push of that before you start the first floor move when i say the vfb i'm talking if your lot isn't like four then you've got to go up seven feet plus one foot and you can start your first floor but this is desiccated so yeah all right thank you when i first read this i was talking about a group home like you know group home for humanly disabled i mean i'm like but i didn't know where joe because it says there shall be no more than one [Music] so that one group home on 18 is actually a uh rm designation yeah yeah it was put in gosh you know ten years if ten years i'm pretty sure it was after i got here yeah i can't remember how long okay and then further on down it says the first for the building shall be elevated a minimum of 18 inches above the grade line is that compliant with the fema like you were just talking about 18 inches yeah that's the crown of the road this is kind of mixed up and i'm gonna have to do a little more clarification with them to clarify because we say 24 inches for the first floor of the garage and i need to do a little more digging on this side okay excellent okay unnumbered waterf lots you say they can have a single dot but they can have multiple lips two loops and then 209 we're talking about the height your garage floor should be a minimum of 24 inches above the crown of the road and that's what you were just okay so that was you just need to get um 161 in compliance with 209 what you're saying hey that's mine okay thank you very much what is this one padding we got a 30-52 that's that was from correction to the minutes you can't hear that that was it that was a correction to the minute thank you very much landscaping requirements did i miss it or is there something in here with regard to gravel lawns did we take that out the way landscaping material can be put as all of us know there are some people that basically take that i don't have to have any grass and they so uh i don't know how how you control it unless we get a better definition of the landscape yeah well you know it's a previous material because it's listed in here is correct travel or whatever performance or whatever they're not out of compliance there but my objection is when you've got private lunch with a ponderance of weeds going through there needs to be something saying if you're going to have the gravel on you've got to keep it weed for you yes and we have a couple of those we have to go teleport and what they do typically is they just ground up they spread them and the weeds still stick it up you know i can think of so that is covered somewhere and you have that authority yeah okay that's my question and as i read on we talk about parking and traffic hazards and what have you this isn't a code or parking code and i don't know where you're going to put it but i seem to have a lot of issues leaving belle isle on the gulf boulevard where park cars or mostly lawn maintenance people are parking right at belle isle and gulf boulevard leaving just one lane and there's a big hedge there great to see great hedge and cars will come flying around that corner coming onto bella i almost got hit and i'm trying to get past the lawn maintenance guy in that left lane and you got a problem so boiling that all down i think that's probably an issue at any street that comes on the gulf boulevard that if there's somebody parked within 100 foot of gulf boulevard that's going to create a problem and so my suggestion is we install no parking from here to quarter signs 100 foot from gulf boulevard back on any street that connects to gulf boulevard no that's yeah because i i almost almost got that idea there one time some streets yeah they'll you know on some days there could be four or five landscaping trucks with the trailer down the street trying to get out today it's the red cones no no it's just the fact that they pack themselves in and that that's a problem throughout the city yeah sure dish so is that something we should address here or you gotta take that somewhere else no i i think that's probably a good idea to put something in there where would that be under catholic h h we had a sentence no parking only ordering public there will be no parking within one hundred foot of [Music] uh conversation there it says that the top level is in l one glass center is there at the top level and mulch will not exceed pipe immediately by the immediately adjacent ground surface so if you put does that mean you've got to dig a trench three inches deep to put your mulch in or is it really the top of the grass well i would interpret that as time to correct you know i would say you got to dig a hole right and suddenly when you're trying to put it around the base of a tree you don't want to be digging into the roots right too yeah that's how i wouldn't cover that yeah 94-63 routing of variance requests and it says to the building inspector and our building inspector is the county right not the i mean the county doesn't communicate with our board of adjustments should that building respect would be changed to humanity official actually last seat next presentation because what happens to get to that point it's disapproved here disapproved in the county then persons and there's the variance all right in the next section 9464 will begin the last sentence that said the board of adjustment so i'll post notes to the public as well too to the parties of interest um i've been on the board i know that's typically the neighbors around everyone who's asking for variances is that sufficient yeah you're we're also exposed to uh around the scheduled hearing you read the sentence above it talks about we haven't posted notice on the property yeah okay there's 48 hours enough advanced notice for one of those residents who may be out of town the the posting is done 15 days prior to the scheduled meeting so the 48 hours notices the meeting notice yeah and that goes out way before and also the letters to the residents go out and then we don't you aren't doing that more than 48 hours oh yeah does it see anything in here about the letters to the residents is that just policy as opposed to code that's that's i know it's standard policy can do that yeah 200 feet yeah [Music] [Applause] the isr standards i think we should incorporate as we do in 94135 four area ratio in parentheses bar and impervious service ratio in one of these isr just to make it consistent that's the way it's written in 94 135 right before that i know it's in definitions but to me it just should be consistent so it's a matter of housekeeping yes you hang around with yeah make a note that yeah that's just housekeeping okay and 9469 b refers to [Music] water conservation is going to be achieved by the selective appropriate plant materials for removal of nuisance and invasive vegetation but we don't define nutrients and invasive how do you import something that doesn't well that's something that we probably need to add something in here to define the invasive nuisance uh in the last code review and the change we went out brazilian pepper for example right we we determined it was a grass so now our organization cut to seven inches but there's nothing that says how isn't there something in a florida thing that says brazilian peppers new invasive species have to be removed no there's nothing it's just the county that's going on they're invasive but there's nothing that says they got to be removed so how we did with the last coke adjustments the definition of brazilian pepper is it's a grass and our coat says grass can't be oversimulated so we just added that as a definition you know there are other invasive plants and maybe we need to put something in the definition of an invasive plant that meets more uh the epa is where they have that yeah the florida blizzard spices yeah but they define it and yeah in their website right right yeah maybe we could just reference instead of trying to find it as reference the bias list of basic species of blood right in the definition that we don't have on the hedge major section two middle evidence as a hedge may be grown in the 12 set back area of residential property but shall not exceed repeated height and that's that is probably the most confused that i've seen in the city yeah this hedge thing with the last one the last review went around and around there was at least two full sessions that was that was a single topic in at least two sessions because privacy is a big issue for a lot of people and that's what they were right and there are properties that beyond that that you know the hedge issue is eight feet because previously it's only six feet and there are people with edges that are wealthy i mean i could the one on uh it's a wedgwood right at the s there there's one bell aisle i mean it's probably it's 14.6 feet huh if you cut that six feet it'll be a stick but the current coat says eight and there's also in here that if you're on the water your side edges cannot be this is within your side setbacks not corner back side setbacks here on the six feet no they could be eight feet up to five feet from the sea wall and then have to drop to support okay that was a change yeah before it said they could only be to the back of the house and then they the last code would you expanded it to the definition to the sea wall with the exception of my feet back thank you then i go into 94 256 temporary structures and the b1 says somebody wants to put in a portable and then this is the one i mentioned in our first meeting about adding uh moving vans and trailers to that because people do use a u-haul truck and all this delineates is pods you know for something moving in right so now how we uh utilized it for the perfect thing we've allowed the moving vans and trailers to be there but i think at least so this is time to clarify it get rid of okay are you just are you doing that we need to add that to the minute so we make sure you know as long as you guys are fine with that yes and uh 94 257 audience last sentence anointing shall be permitted on the rear of any residential structure without regard to setback limitations as long as the structure is not situated on or adjacent to any body of water what's that all about but it can't be situated on any property the back of any house that has its own water why is that why is that discrimination that's a good question as long as the structure is not situated on why once put an audio in the back of his house and can't do it and it's going to be mad and i know worships so basically what it's saying is you can't have one of those awnings that expands out their latest crop i don't know if you've seen those but they're they're they they go out and then a leg drops down to hold them up on the other end you can have an awning you just can't have those legs and don't cover your boat huh right it's it's well because that would be considered structure like a turtle you you can't put a pergola in your setback well i don't care how you define awning my point is it says it's okay on the rear of any residential structure as long as it's not on the water and i don't think it should be houses on the water should be struck single now just not being able to have arms maybe patty will pull this for the organs pull that ordnance and let's find out if there's any definition in there an awning that goes out from your house as long as it's attached and shoots out i would i don't really get that leather unless it's a thing it has to be inside the setback and can't extend into the setback area that's right it'll be like somebody put a wind sail up put a post out well then that becomes it's in the setback area if they if the if they put a post beyond the setback or something you're talking about a permanent installation yeah yeah i mean a temporary installation story but i think we need to do a little i'm done thank you very much rudy i i know we accept rudy's as i said i know we accept rudy's suggestions here because we didn't do them on each individual one most of them are housekeeping but thank you second it should be for first you should lose i think then i'll second any further discussion all those in favor opposed you're opposed [Applause] when i did the remodeling of my house miami-dade that has to happen on their grandfathered until they had a new construction right so does that come in with any new construction and getting a permit for it right well before we have to permit anything but our code allows 30. right yeah well i need to i guess we need to research that if that is a requirement because we need to be persistent reconstructing the roof of the new roof okay all right the second cut the other leaves off knee walled up five feet and then crossed over the entire house yeah i need to check on that because i that that doesn't sound right will you further check it out yeah we'll leave it up again how do they i was thinking you were talking awnings and you said the new hurricane standards were talking about allowing audience they're already allowed did they have to meet hurricane standards yeah i think i think with the awnings you already have to be retractable don't they yeah so yeah and lin did say it was permanent construction it's construction not temporary well what i'm talking the about that the way that it's interpreted a structure is if it's got post that pullman so you know as an example if you tried to build a porch in your off the back of your house and your house was already set back line you couldn't build a porch to extend because once those posts set back whether you well in our city you need a building committee pretty much for everything okay yes so you're going to say yes yes in your company yeah because it's it says the only thing you don't need a permit for is painting flooring and uh painting drywall landscaping unless it's xxx but you know i've never had anybody coming from last night okay thank you rudy very much angela wanda went over the first one of mine 94-201 when we talked about defining modular housing landscaping is a 94-6 the first one is c just a question if the does it change because it says artificial turf shall not be permitted on any front or side yard and we do have some so i didn't know that we do yeah there's a couple uh and i don't know how you but there are a couple places that is there how did they get by with it well the one i know for sure was a new construction house and it wasn't there initially but over time you know within a year or so after they've built it they added it so it got they got a co because it wasn't there but they put it in later it's it's mainly that turf thing well there's a house of dollar shore that's got it yeah that's tacky well the newer stuff newer stuff is really nice it's not as bad as it used to be the guy there okay he's got a putting room in his front door actually it's pretty nice that's good he invited me over there one time he's got a tt box on the side of his house to hit you know pitching wood so uh could that fall under like water conservation well it's permeable i mean it allows the rain water to flow through doesn't it yeah so i don't know what are your thoughts on it i agree this just started this kind of gets back to the i'm kind of stuck on the strategic plan because i was there when we were developed it you know we wanted we want to be a premier community and that has a lot to do with the aesthetics does artificial turf fit within our aesthetics and our vision of this city's aesthetics we don't have an architectural committee here reviewing stuff like that but personally personally i i i have to see the new stuff i guess but i i know there's lots of and other stuff there on on gulf boulevard particularly in the parking area it's uh i think it's ugly yeah well that that stuff you gotta fill with dirt every so often it's maintenance the guy that built the house that put it in there used to go out there with bags of dirt spread it and then sweep it so you know well you certainly have to set some pretty good standards yeah or you could be [Music] that's good enough for me well let's let's get back to this thing our code right now says it shall not be permitted on any front or side guard but yet it's there right if we're not enforcing it why is it here right i understand that and i have a problem with having a code on the books that we don't enforce and just say oh you know we'll we'll take it as it comes uh that's a problem we we've we almost got a lawsuit one time because somebody wanted to put gravel in their yard and we said the code doesn't allow it so they brought in their lawyers and we backed off oh hey put all the gravel in where you want we don't care yeah because considerable landscaping that's why we changed it yeah because they brought in two lawyers right they wanted to put down gravel and we said our code doesn't allow it basically change your code and we did well then explain to me why you're just bringing in a couple of lawyers made us back down they were gonna file a big lawsuit are we in written in reinventing code why would we back down that's the horse of another caller we just didn't have no idea we just did okay well i've kind of used that the enforcement of that if i get a complaint we'll enforce them but i haven't received a complaint on that house and that's the only one i know of is there another one you know an answer no i just wanted to make sure it's on paris okay so harrison i'll go take a look it's about the third house on the right third or fourth time okay if it's done ugly it'll be okay across the bridge and i know everybody knows frank right you knew who i'm talking right the character yeah it's his sister but not in the same path i will tell you that all right okay let's stick to what we're doing here we're here to answer this deja we've kind of covered dish too as far as we discussed adding invasive trees and trees that and did we just want to add the wording about water conservation but after we started this discussion i was looking back and i think it's covered under 94-69 i okay good eye should they cross-reference then that would be a good idea but you look at it yeah actually the invasive tree is 94-69b nuisance and invasive vegetation yeah i think we just need to put that that's where i would say we would have something to say based on okay okay and then 94-7 it says a permanent shall not be required to be obtained for the following types of building activities and i just didn't know what that would be 94-7 b well it's talking about lance gates okay yeah i just didn't know what it it just any kind of landscaping and stuff or like a driveway or some hard state okay and then my next one is talking again about the modular home that's on the 94 dishes and then 94-207 solar water heating within the residential load district 2 a single-family residence shall not be constructed unless the plumbing is such that the residents have designed to facilitate future and sold water right that's a forward statue so it's it's just a requirement okay so whoever the development folks would know that okay doesn't mean you have to do it it just means that you have to have the capability in the future so when they we have new construction no there's no requirement to you know anything but what it's saying is that a resident has in new construction a resident has to be able to have access to connect to the plumbing to put solar water i said that's good information i mean i so i was thinking about you know there's all this going green initiative and i'm sure that puts i don't know if that's in the master plan for the future as far as i don't think there's anything in the strategic plan that really relates to that but uh green initiative i know there's lots of funding out there now for solar panels and stuff like that not for a city for your house there is really not for i tried to get look for funding for solar street lights i put in the nope nope wow but an individual property we ought to write to charlie about that i don't know it's it's just the way it you know because a lot of those programs are coming from federal and special money yeah like the va got a big grant to do solar panels right but actually you guys looked into that with the solar company actually rudy and i went down and remember we talked to the guy about it but the problem is you can buy it but there's there's not much grant money out there a few years ago there used to be but i still think we all write to charlie about that i'll write to charles about that okay the last one is 94-251 fences walls and hedges i just look i know we just put up a fence and it's that prefabricated wood so i didn't know if we should add that that's like everywhere now that trek lumber because it could it doesn't it says this will unless natural materials of galvanized shall be painted stained or treated and you don't do any of that i think specifications change every week there's a new material made and then the city i mean that's acceptable you could add something like this put back on your bill yeah you could add uh you could add a ton of thing every week there's something changes the new material comes out right but it's a good question but if you keep adding these things then you have to take some off that aren't legal anymore they keep a good idea eye on that angel believe me you can put it they couldn't fall under treatment treated with vinyl it said her fence could be called where it says properly painted stained or treated is treated with vinyl right yeah i just didn't know if we needed to add it because you're right things do change every day there's always some kind of it'll fall into the one category believe me that laura and the group keeps an eye on everything thank you very much angel brenda okay there was this is this you angela had a question about 947 about which one 94 7. you asked what would an example yeah we talked about it i said is that like a driveway well i'm going to give you another example okay just we had an individual you can't put it the right way and it's considered a structure so you can't put it in a setback either in his front yard didn't pay him permit and we found holding he has that's a good example of something that somebody just went ahead and did it you know it looks kind of nice but he stopped him but stop sure and you know we're probably going to have to tell him we told him what the courtesy note is to remove it but we're probably going to have to tell him with a coat of mileage has expired and it's still there he's going to put a big statue i remember that no this oh maybe were you here when that guy came into the picture yeah we're gonna sign marvin to take care of those from now on so right at the end of our last hidden meeting jc had asked us to instead of we were still talking about the trash cans and the uh we had talked on the seat wall about the and that's fine because i mean it was just suggestions but the mandatory seawall inspection after we after we met i i started thinking about i was like wow you know that could have some i know it would be great for it to occur but it could be you could have legal implications if you mandated people to have to have sea wall inspection prior to selling them home and i'm sure when you're going but i did talk to a realtor because i wanted to know if there was any place else that required that and they were like no usually home owners a smart buyer would do it anyway but not every not everybody buying a home on the water for the first time is smart enough to know that they have to do that yeah i don't turn it off your watch is [Music] because we don't really mandate a property they have most of the time when you sell your property they have a homeowner's inspection right but that isn't mandated by the city uh so i don't know if you could mandate that or not well we there was actually some discussion last time and that's why i wanted to find out if you could and they were like well usually the homeowner if they see a dock in disrepair or they're buying on the water they're smart enough to ask for that but you really could i mean to me it seems like there could be some legal issues we'll get into the point of mandating this thing huh if you hire an inspector he he goes through this stuff i know that well i'm not saying that that everybody's a genius i know that a home inspector does that i don't think so not qualified they wouldn't be qualified well they could look and see if something fell out i don't think that's part of the home inspection and i'm going to use the example of the sea wall on bay shore that tell me when the guy that was going to buy it at the time the sea wall was not mentioned until we put a code violation because we felt that the sea wall needed to be inspected because it was bulging he had already had the home inspection and that wasn't even noted on there because i spoke to you a couple times so i don't i don't think they're probably not even qualified to do that no but the other part of that was too we had talked here about how there's only like one or two companies that actually do these inspections and if we as a city say you have to get it inspected what does that look like you're feeding that company business to protect its borders yeah i mean you somebody could say you know hey no sorry they'll say anything agent just watch the six o'clock news oh yeah the point is we need to have that legally researched what we can and can't do because it is important enough city right we should investigate every avenue of being able to use it right these are our recommendations to have an engineer inspect the seawall and the dock a marine engineer so that could be a recommendation as opposed to being a code this must happen but these are recommendations right and i'd like that i think that that nicely wall book that was put together the dog can see well that'd be a perfect place to put it in there that you know sea walls are expensive and ones in disrepair are dangerous to your neighbors or whatever just like we've talked here i've learned so much just from reading that as a point of order i will consider a suggestion from the code committee slash planning and zoning board then we suggest that this be pursued by the appropriate people of the city to require this i agree second do i hear any further discussion i would make that a consideration all those in favor opposed so order i have a couple things i know that this uh changing this notification that i call should have permit i know that not everybody in the city owns a dock but i do and several other people do that are on the board but i know that things have happened after storms and i fixed it myself when boards flew off and stuff busted or something are we talking about permitting a repair like that no it how how it's can't hear you how it's determined is if any of the structural boards are basically what i say structural i'm talking about piloters triggers smiling yeah our code just doesn't clarify you know because and i think putting adding that in there will just kind of clean it up a little bit because there is a requirement to replace a repair and maybe we need to say replace your structurally replaced repair or something or structurally if you take out a stringer because it's damaged you don't put it back then your web and that's what the county water navigation code says if you touch the okay the basically no it's here the floor joists of a dot if you touch them then you've done something structural you know even just at the top now now the only reason the only question i want to do we have anything in here saying that any replacements of those the decking has to be of appropriate materials because we had a neighbor they lost a few and he came in with two by fours just regular untreated two by fours he hired some day laborer to come and put them down it lasted about a year that shouldn't be no there's nothing in the code that says they can't do that that's very true there is nothing in the code that says they can't do that you're just talking about the deck boards that is not a major repair right and there's nothing that says it has to be two before or one treated or or pressure treated or whatever i think for new construction there's some guidelines in here for what it has to be supposed to be trash pressure created or something but if it's just repair and the guy wants to put down plywood i guess we can't stop them carpet let's put down new carpet just trying to get you know you know we can't cover everything [Applause] okay if you look at my god doctor so what's been happening in the last number of years we've had an increase of worms of eating holes in our area so what i have to do is replace the entire superstructure in other words the main beams and the holes and they were put in an 85 and the only way that you can inspect them is have someone go down in the water yeah and check them you'll see most of the new docks or poles that have been put in are wrapped with some type of planet yeah that's just the only way that you can prevent this new warming disaster that has come into our earth and i've even heard that they actually come in through the sand and not through the poles and the right still going to go and even though like that looks good i've got to replace the whole thing let me know what that costs me 30 35 and we made him get out of here right now we have we have to pull this thing together and i know wanda has said she would pull it together for us i'm trying to figure out whether we need another meeting after the preparation i know she kept copious notes would you mind i think it would be beneficial to just have a close-out meeting right i think it would be beneficial for you to collect it all into one document and have it and as far as the concern with the charter that said you know by the person at large i i think you know i don't think the city council is going to get that excited if it takes until april to get the final report because i think they'd rather have a good report well that's that's trying to finish the situation that if you would do that i could do that and then shoot us a copy i'll give it to patty okay that's shoot it any way you want to shoot it patty would send it to us do not reply to all and then we can look at it and if we see any changes that we'd like to do or object to or whatever finalize it get it back to wanda and then we'll have a final product and we'll discuss it then with you and laura and say you know what's this look like and then we'll go from there to present it yeah i i mean i think you know a couple weeks i don't know what one to schedule a couple weeks probably that would be what march 10th yeah well that's the situation here i will i have a trip north not only for social but for that's a familiar situation on the fifth or the sixth of march so let's make it the middle of march if that's acceptable to the city i don't think okay about march 17th 17th that would be great is that saint patrick's day oh god we'll just bring some green beer we'll just break some green beer we'll have a green beer with it ain't too shabby yes let's do a thursday let's do the 18th i can't do it thursday why don't we do it tuesday i can do a tuesday 15th monday the 15th yes is that acceptable yeah uh is that a problem yeah are we we're not closed that day right no no we're not all right just check you might be on yourself we might be all right so monday the 15th at 1 pm that'd be fine all right now we're on our unfinished business don't close your book yet tomorrow i'd like to comment he was i know we said something about following up with uh the garbage collection and trash and etc etc and i know that there was a nice bar foot in the emails that went to the citizens it was quite effective coming out of that laura's office in glenn's office very explicit and very explanatory about garbage collection and trash so we have to recognize that situation that was very neat is there anything else under honor finished business coming on wait the board members i'd like to go did you get a chance to share your comments on today's i've had nothing i'd like to thank patty for all her diligence notifying all of us too okay marvin is there one thing there's a question for you there has been some discussion on the spoil islands that are in our jurisdiction and i just wonder what conversation conceptions of harboring partying that goes on on the south end of the city and the use of the spoiler ends by dalton marine or somebody that comes out and get out there and they go on those islands sometimes partying in the evening going on out there do we have any jurisdiction well like back here those are in our jurisdiction boundary i guess the only two that are protected are the bird islands the other two spoils for any significant size other than teleshare or i guess we'd have to come up with some kind of i said something for our meeting or is that something for later on with the council and the city manager i i think that's probably something that we need to discuss with the sheriff thank you there was also more of and i were talking earlier any any boats that do dock within our waterways should we have the sheriff check with them to make sure that they're properly anchored and insured and all that stuff well that that's that's a discussion that i'm not going to happen to share about that because you know if i go up on the top of the bridge and work that way in that way in the sight line for the most part all those boats that are anchored in they're not in our city limits no no but the ones the ones that are and do should should we be concerned about them the ones that are new that are over there no that are that that anchor within our our well we've got an ordinance that says you can anchor for 72 hours within a 30-day period okay that's in our ordinance uh we have no way to control that other than getting the sheriff's marine unit to go check on them and i will say that's the same situation madeira beach had they have no way to go out they passed an ordinance and said you can't do this and this and this it didn't clean out a few boats they said but they have no way to enforce it because they don't have a boat that they can go out there and say hey been here 72 hours and what fish and wildlife told me was if this boat was here and it moves to here 72 hours starts over well then we got a pandora's box so i think we ought to hire marvin to swim out there he doesn't swim oh my god anything else under citizen's comments our favorite driveways just want to make sure pervious or impervious services pavers favorite driveways appropriate for computers if they're considered purpose or impervious unless it's geo one paper driveway and that's considered purpose when they maybe somebody else remembers the targets that's something about whatever the saying they put between right some of it has an adhesive material right almost and that to me would make it almost important yes it is that's so if you've got none you've got a paper but the paper itself you could say is perfect imperfect what is paper directly as an impervious surface with the with the caveat that it's a geo lot type paper so what i'm seeing is a lot of people who are now starting to pay for their driveways and only one at one point just a driveway that came down from the garage door right are now putting these big drive around u-shaped things in and they're going well past the um i guess i'm they have to get a permit to put them in how's that getting by accountant or getting by our engineer or whoever's looking at them well i i guess in i see what you're talking about is a walkway is not as an example swift mud doesn't consider them a herbies or inverted surface like a walkway that isn't count yeah but i'm not talking about yeah but this big u-shaped thing yeah number one goes out the other i have to have a discussion with the county about that to clarify that what they consider i'm saying the block isn't right because it's considered very private but then there's the definition of i'm glad you do well i didn't know what you're talking about yeah thanks is there anything else under citizen's comment i'll call for an adjournment all those in favor thank you very much for your service to the city of bel air beach thanks for everybody showing up we had 100 attendance and i want that do so noted daddy will do that of one zero it's two zeros"
