thought somebody was supposed to be here tonight if not I would have grabbed the note so I will look into give that report to you as soon as as possible and I apologize for that uh for the uh code enforcement for the month of September um I was mainly busy with all the uh issues with um uh the overgrowth weeds and um grasses in the community which we cleared up a lot of those if you notice on my report that a lot of those cases were open were automatically closed pretty Ser uh soon thereafter because again we're getting a lot of compliance the other is the uh unpermitted um remodels and other type of uh construction nuisances again a lot of these are people again pulling doing work without pulling permits um and I'm happy to say that most of them are in compliance now the other issue I wanted to address is under the categories of uh the boats RVs and cl uh in talking with the city manager what I have been doing now has been issuing ordinance violations to these individuals so uh last month I did Issue four different violations um and again people are now in compliance and that's my report and I'll stand for any questions Council yes sir I'm just curious on the um failure to have the right permits are those typically from a percentage standpoint just a guess are those homeowners that didn't pull the permits or contractors uh majority of them are contractors okay do they normally is because they didn't know they needed to get one or the other option which is they just thought it get slip it by they um I I will be honest with you in my opinion is they know they have to have them they just see if they get do the work without getting the per okay all right any other questions or comments for the day thank you very much thank you sir again I apologize for not we do have the report it's also nice to have extra security yes sir and again I'll the C thank you all right item four presentation for from the penilla Sun Coast fire and rescue District by Chief Davids hello hello good evening everyone the monthly report b beach in course September uh we had our second annual September 11th Memorial walk which was a great success we had about uh 80 participants walking the 3.43 miles it was a great turnout considering it was a Monday um so we're really happy for that uh in September to B air Beach we had 26 emergency calls uh six fire related and 20 emergency medical related and also in the same month we had 683 fire training hours and 110 EMS training hours uh overall for the fiscal year 2023 uh in Valor Bas door 188 calls for service 48 fire and 140 EMS our annual call volume for the fiscal year there were 4,042 emergency calls with 3308 being EMS Emergency Medical Services and 734 being fire related for the year there were 8,479 fire training hours and 132 medical training hours our fire prevention division that does um our life safety inspections conducted for the fiscal year 462 annual inspections with 501 annual reinspection um citing 1,522 violations in the month of October we'll be issuing a request for proposal uh for the building of our fire station 28 and our emergency Operation Center on the mainland we're hoping to be under contract uh hopefully in December um about a 1 and a half year project and that's where we'll run our Emergency Operations and we're still in the works to build an additional fire station here on uh the Northern end of Inox Beach just south of b beach quarter to better service b beach and we're currently working with the county to phase in uh transport rescue uh we're looking at uh Peak unit Staffing beginning in March we're still in talks about that um and then transitioning that into a full-time unit when that fire station is completed we are very happy to say that we were awarded a FEMA safer Grant to Staffing for adequate fire emergency response um just got the award two weeks ago as for a total of a three-year period of $1,140 th000 and that's fully funded by the government um and that's going to have us add three additional four additional firefighters um which is ultimately going to improve our ISO rating to a class one Department which is our our current project that's going to take about another year before we have an evaluation but we're confident we're going to be brought up from a class two to a class one fire department uh very few fire departments in the nation have that so we're very happy about that and we just found out about the braks clean up but we will be there thank you Chief Davidson do we have any questions or comments from the council yes Mr Rob my wife and I were walking the beach about a week or so ago and I think I hope this is under the category of misinformation but a couple of citizens uh stopped me we were having just a chat and they said you know we heard that this large White House house up here on GF Boulevard of the traffic light was going to be the new fire station so I just wanted to take the opportunity so hopefully if there's some people listening out there you could answer that question no that is not going to be the new Fire Station um we what we're looking at is there's a vacant piece of property we've been negotiating with the uh Church um Church in the Isles which is just three blocks south of your border and that's an ideal location uh for response to the area and it's a 2-minute drive so we about a 2-minute response time here um but no that was not a location that's ours perfect yes sir any other questions or comments for chief DAV thank you have a good evening thank you Chief all right we're on to item five which is quarterly board reports uh let's start out Board of adjustments good evening Mr mayor council members I'm Mike Kelly your chair for Board of adjustment to report on the last quarter um although we only had one hearing two weeks ago in the month of September um we had three cases come up which is nice for Chang have just S one and of the three we had a total of six variance requests so you're allowed a maximum of three one particular person did request three separate items one one uh homeowner requested two items and a third was just the one so a busy September we've got another variance meeting coming up in October we also have another variance meeting coming up November so the residents are keeping the board of adjustment busy and the experience is overwhelming so we're glad to see it give us something to do very nice Council any questions or comments I have a question yes Mike are you seeing a um Trend in the variance request or same sort of request yeah it's the big one is still pools yeah I think um one of the September variances was a pool higher than 18 in both CR Ro Crown Road and K and I are pretty sure our November meeting is another poll um it's still you know in the in the application process but he's got a plan when the um New planner comes in after the fiscal year is that right yes to go ahead and incorporate a look at that ordinance causing all these pool variances the other ones we had two this past month that were docks um where there's just not enough water and you're not allowed to dredge so because you can't do private dredging they've come to the city to get at least enough water as some folks have done in the past especially right out here on Harbor Drive south of City Hall where it shs in real bad so two of those were two of our three variance requests for the main for September the one coming up in October Joe is a little interesting it's it's different board hasn't heard it and forever it's regarding the minimum size lots to actually build on in b beach and that particular but that particular applicant has three Varian it's coming up to us in October so it'll be an interesting meeting yeah I think the clearly the pools when I did that was something I done my Fe couldn't get the rest of the team agree with me on that that's a struggle I had no idea that we didn't allow private dring is that a city ordinance from what was explained to us was that the uh the county only allows uh maintenance dredges at this point so if you never had a dredge done on that particular property then they're not going to give you the the the the resident who's just the house south of the park here hired a outside consultant who would we picked his brain for what 20 minutes um because he's so familiar with the West Coast of Florida and explained it pretty objectively that if you've got any kind of SE sea grass or vegetation in the water you will not even be considered for a maintenance dress maintenance dress you got to be clean clean F I'm sorry I would think when you're dring it would be more the alcohol debris know that Al yep y yeah I mean this this guy does a lot of Consulting up and down down the coast and um actually uh presented a lot of information that was good for all of us and we explained to them about the maintenance dreads that we had out here 20 years ago to get rid of this Sandbar but the county did for us because it was clean it was our first initial maintenance dredge we' had been turned down by the um Army Corps of Engineers but we got it approved and the county did it at no expense to BU Beach okay thank you sure any other questions or comments for Mr Kelly it sounds like if we get this pool issue resolved you're not going to have much to do I know we go back to waiting around for another one thank you thank you Mr Kell all right next up uh the citizens advisory Council citizens advisory committee thank you mayor city council this is Ron San with the citizens advisor Council the only meeting we had this p quarter was uh as our second title which is the audit committee and so we reviewed a draft of the budget with the city manager um we were fine it was actually think the second draft and so uh we were supportive of what was being presented for last year's budget which you guys have already approve all right next up is Parks and Recreation board good evening mayor city council hope you're doing well um Tammy lenda Park and Report just have a couple of quick updates um in the last quarter we did have two new members to the park and rec Bo so welcome Susan and Michael we are very happy to have them um we are looking for some new fall items to sell with Beller Beach logo I've mentioned this a couple times if you've had any suggestions on things that you'd like to have that we haven't had in the past please call City Hall or my cell phone number um just a reminder that we did add a third indoor yoga class so if you're looking for that for the fall please check the schedule on the Beller Beach City calendar um the park and Reco for the last quarter has been diligently working on the three fall events that we have um the third annual Halloween event is Saturday October 28th from 10: A.M a. to 12 PS and Pals so please bring your kids your grandkids your your puppers in their costumes Monday DEC December 4th from 5:00 to 6:00 p.m. is the holiday social and Christmas tree lighting and then on Saturday January 13th is the health and wellness fair so we've been working on all of those events already planning um I mentioned this before but we did start welcome bags for new resident so there's a couple goodies in there but more importantly it's all the information that the new residents need um just as they're moving into our community um but we do add information on local businesses so we would like to get some things from some business owners in Beller Beach so if you have any information or um I don't want to say coupons but whatever you want to put in there to let residents know about your business we would like to help promote that for you if you're interested um and then this isn't about the past quarter but this Saturday's Beach cleanup I know there's a race and there's been signs and there's been some postings but I just wanted to mention that um on Saturday which is always the beach cleanup um the race is just in Clear Water the race that will sort of affect Gulf Boulevard and the bridge they won't be closed but that's on Sunday so it shouldn't affect uh Beach cleanup at all so that's all I have thank youa do we have any question uh I will say hand tight we're going to be giving some news about the beaches and uh we may want up having a PO close each Beach the Saturday I will okay awesome thanks yes get about the beach clean up um it's going to be probably high tide around 7 8:00 in the morning too probably very very little beach to clean you're you're probably right I don't have the exact dates yet but we will discuss this whenever we get to the city managers all right uh item six the City attorney report Mr Mor you have the FL thank you Mr Mayor we'll be talking uh tonight about various proposed uh Charter amendments and some ballot language spent a considerable amount of time since our last meeting on that um multiplicity of issues going on between Beach tree nourishment and um and other agenda items that we have as we enter the new as we've now entered uh the new fiscal year I do have to ask is just a general statement as we work with and through other agencies um that Commissioners be mindful of the um of their roles individually um and not collectively you are individual members you don't speak for the board um and so as you reach out to other agencies other divisions of government whether at the state level or otherwise being mindful of your role um and the representations you make in that regard otherwise I have nothing else to council Mr Mr Moore uh anything on that hand tower on 8 Street uh 126 you did talk to me I followed up with his Council I've not received a substantive response yet uh I don't have any information to report beyond the fact that we the city have submitted this to permitting uh for the for the County's review Kyle and I spoke about this as recently as last Thursday and talking about um additional correspondence with the county but I don't have any information or updates on that person thank you I just add on our um report outstanding code violations there is a little summary there this yeah but this just been going on for and enough W in anybody I mean this was first raised to me in July of 2022 right um and depending on your perspective on the matter it has not yet reached a resolution yeah and Mr Moore has been very sympathetic but he's more L got handcuffed saying that as an attorney I just want to know that it states that the the applicant has to pis County for a full independent assessment of the situation so it's there's there's other people involved too so just a note to residents for sure I I I think member Banker's concern is the you in as much as he's he's echoing sentiments or concerns raised to him by constituents as it was submitted to permitting um more than a month and a half ago if not longer um and and ordinarily certain things should don't typically take that long however this is a unique unique item both at the local and county level and I think as a result of that people are are having to review things they may not ordinarily find themselves reviewing especially in this landscape so um it's definitely proceeding on um a more unique path for all the various legal reasons we've talked about in the past but the questions well taken I just don't have more information appreciate it and just for the record this person is following the direction he was given by the magistrate is that correct at this stage yes by the magistrate and more importantly by City administration at this stage any other questions or comments for Mr MOA thank you Mr MOA I appreciate it up next city manager report Mr reer thank you mayor so first off we have the Golf Boulevard undergrounding project um the utility uh consults of Florida are pretty much complete in its entirety of phase one and they're starting on phase two um Duke uh they're binding cost estimate for phase two I requested it because originally we agreed that we wouldn't pay the phase two until this budget year so I requested it I'm still waiting on them to turn that into me so I can get that uh project rolling and get the um materials ordered for that um but it's not slowing down utility uh consults of Florida cuz they're they're already moving along on phase two and they're based on they've experienced with phase one uh they're they're trying to put as much as possible in the RightWay and not reques any private ements from residents um and that's just been the way of it um seems to be working out the best there's plenty of PR right away um and Duke's been agreeable so we've met out on site and and made it work to the best uh for the residents um in this project the uh storm water Improvement project um we've been cleaning and videoing the pipes as we talked about we're about 90% complete as of today uh a little bit more tomorrow and then all that will go to Gemini engineering uh where they will um complete the final design make their recommendations based on our last discussion to council and um provided the bid documents to move forward the project any surprises up to this point no surprises uh we did get a video I haven't seen it yet but I was called the uh four street that check valve that is not functioning properly where the sleeve comes out of the seaw wall the check valve is working but there's a the first joint of that of that sleeve um is compromising it's leaking directly into it um into the pipe so um I'm going to give that to the engineer to figure out to fix as part of the project so that's what that's one check valve that was working and then since then the pipe is eroded to the point where no longer works correctly um the fmit insurance you saw that I got the uh the answer to uable question on some of the property insurance she provided us the different options um and I sent them to the council by email uh to look over I don't know how any of you feel if you'd like to uh raise our deductibles or uh all of their perils um and name storm deductible um it does lower the insurance but obviously you know if we have damage we're going to be paying more on pocket to a certain point it didn't seem to me that it was U it was worth making that that type of a modification certainly we some savings but all it takes is one event right right and we we're currently budgeted for the the original plan which was the uh that 5% name storm ,000 conduc so the best coverage would be now that's where they kep us the uh okay this brings us to the project that you mentioned earlier um I wrote it down here as the emergency Peach of motion control project but now it's been titled uh see the plans the post medalia emergency Shore stabilit project stabilization project excuse me and um that is you know we had a meeting today with the County contractor which is going to be Gator dring and the county um it's in the planning process um and we're obtaining the easements necessary to do the project currently have the three easements I should have the other two uh easements for Condominiums uh by tomorrow um in speaking with Gator Gator dredging Representatives they at this point don't sound like they're going to start until Monday I gave them the permit paperwork to fill out they also need to um complete forms um to to certify that they're going any changes they make to Morgan Park they're going to restored you in the same condition or better um when I say changes more part the it's going to be a large operation um we are gathering theot plans um putting together information to send out to Residents but it is going to be um a set up to 250 dump trucks full sand daily um so that's going to start early in the morning um and that's when we're going to see the biggest lineup um the way theot design is they are going to use the center lane um going south from Morgan Park all the way down to 19th to uh have a queue of trucks um and they need to modify the opening of the drive to Morgan Park for the trucks to turn in they need to relocate temporarily the uh Pavilion structure um and that is basically to allow the maximum amount of sand and trucks to get in and get out on a daily basis so that the project can completed in a fast amount of time um they based on their experience of what they've done in the Treasure Island St Pete the South portions of the beach um they feel that um maximizing the amount of sand they can get in there keeping the project timeline as short as possible is the best best way to go about it um right now they're asking that uh the project spans 45 days so that would be the closure of Mor Park for a spend of 45 days they're also going to need to use the marina parking lot for staff parking which is going to shutle down to Mor Park um so the beach the accesses have been closed because our overw walks are not usable with the drop offs the good news is they did say they they since they going to do the entire Beach um and restore the Dune systems they're going to be putting a lot of stand out there and they and they will work with us to build the stand back up where our overw walks are so that they are usable so hopefully um where the Tide's coming in um what they can do will get us to a point where we need very little modification um to those overw walks um because in talking with the state it started getting complicated when they were telling me that the the what they permitted for the over loocks um the beaches change so no longer are they a permittable structure to be out as far as they are because the D have wash back so far and they don't they typically only want to allow you to extend about 10 ft off the ding system so when you lose all the Dune you're kind of way out there especially at 21st Street if you've seen that it's about 25 ft off the Dune now so this will help so we're going to have to see where it all ends up but hopefully um make in the restoration of the beach and all the s counties supplying us it's going to it's going to make our loocks usable again um let's see so again there's the pile up of the trucks or the long queue of the trucks is going to be in the morning time because they're going to get up um they're going to start very early and then the trucks are going to line up until they just start letting them come in when the sun comes up and dump in the sand so you will expect that there's going to be a closure of that Middle Lane on a pouard early every morning uh 6 days a week Monday through Saturday um and they'll have a they're requesting Sheriff be out there to help control the traffic um and then from there as you truck dumps you're going to go back to the pit which like is somewhere in the center of the state and um you know refill and do another another whole cycle of trucks so that is not going to be as much of a pileup because it's going to be more spread out as they don't so it shouldn't be as much of an interruption in the early afternoon but that's right now the information we've been given um and we'll try to put that all together the maintenance of traffic and just a general overview to send out to the residents so that they're aware of what is going on yes question so you said it was going to come from the north to the South to 19th Street so pretty much anybody that's north of 19th Street they'll still have the ability to come South on another Street to get down to 19th to come across right well what they're going to do is they're going to have the center lane blocked off they're going to be controlling traffic moving southbound um as the trucks turn in and come out um so it will back up traffic moving south but if you want to go around it by I guess Bay Shore that probably is going to be possible um but again they'll be allowing traffic to flow South it'll just be directed to allow the trucks to turn in and turn out and let the traffic turn in and turn out okay yeah that's I would recommend that if they could somehow make sure that they're not black blocking 19th Street but that at least would give people north of 19th Street to use bore to get back there and come out uh if they want to avoid the um option of trying to get in between the trucks I'll bring I recall them saying was that they didn't anticipate it being that much but depending upon the efficiency of the the trucks coming in dropping off their load and getting the heck out of there uh it was very much possible that the Middle Lane could be blocked all the way down to the Cross so um it's it's an inconvenience it's people are not going to be happy about it it's going to be very noisy in the mornings it's as soon as the trucks are all gone they're they're head Orlando and they're making a U-turn and coming right now with more sand and they're doing it again so it's twice a day and it's a it's it's going to be a big hassle for a little while but we have basically been begging for sand for several years now and right now we have no coverage whatsoever if a storm were to hit us uh it would be devastating so uh this is imperative but it must happen and as a community I ask everyone please be patient uh during this operation and be mindful that uh we may be inconvenience with not being able to access the beach we know that Morgan Park is going to be closed they're going to have to move the Pavilion temporarily um there's going to be uh about 20 vehicles that are parked in the marina area uh that it's going to be again a convenience we' asked them to park on the south end of of the marina so that at least if you're trying to access your boat you can get in on the North side uh but uh this is something that must happen and um this is what we've all been waiting for so the good news is is the county is picking up the entire Tab and uh and and they're they're actually coming to our rescue so uh I'm hoping that we'll get some more information out maybe something on the website and and an email blast or two just to remind everybody about what's going on and uh uh and truly how grateful we are to be in this position because um city manager reefer uh was able to to scramble and get the the few temporary easements that we needed uh and the fact that I've been probably the most vocal person in the county uh they put us right at the top of the list so they said by the end of October this project may be completely over and other communities may not get in so I consider it all a win and a blessing for for Belair Beach all right would you like to continue Mr so when you mentioned to the crosswalk were you talking about the 19th Street crosswalk yes okay so this is great so this has to do with the rebuilding of the dunes but this this isn't rebuilding the beach like the system that we were talking about restoring the beaches now correct me if I'm wrong but the way that they explained it was that they're going to be building up our Dunes to where they're about 10 ft high and anything extra that they bring in becomes burn yes and starts heading for the awesome so we are getting sand and then as soon as the Doom construction is complete uh they the county is also hiring a professional company to come in and do the SE through our entire Beach uh so uh is it going to stop our Hur no but it's certainly going to help us if we do get one come on up Mr Kelly just one to ask when's it start uh we don't have an exact date yet they're talking Monday okay because we have the race this weekend and they wanted to start after the race they were um they were actually wanting to close Morgan Park tomorrow if that tells you anything but uh the race is this weekend correct yes yeah okay and so they're purposely not working on Saturday for that reason right uh will the other like Anyan Rock Beach be getting this too or Rock Beach at this point is not because they've not been able to secure theirs or their easement anything going to be done since it's not really going to be going in the beach but some of the Overflow I'm sure there's going to be a bunch of d7s D9 pushing the sand um problem is stops at 19 stre that big crater only going down south and how much is that going to taken out you know actually well because this isn't your standard dredging where they're coming from out of the water wet sand they're actually bringing in dry sand and uh they're starting at the seaw wall whereas before they sort of sort of building it inward uh this is a different operation and uh they seem to have enough confidence to spend over $20 million yeah it would have been nice because as the storm pulls the sand out okay we had a real high tide we had a real low tide we would have brought some equipment in there with guys that know how to run blades at the real low tide we could have pushed about 40 to 60% of that sand back up leaving a crater and since we didn't have any storms that would have filled back in two to three days and then push it back up we probably would have saved about 67% of sand well it's amazing to me that they're bringing it all in from Orlando good job um Mr reer would you like to continue sure yes um so yeah next on the list was the dun walkover modifications like I said I've been talking to the state about the permitting but as we talked about this project is going to change the layout of so we have to kind of see where it all ends up and hopefully we can make our walkovers usable and open very shortly after that project is completed um I'm sure you all have heard at this point um our city clerk um Patricia Gentry has announced her retirement date and we need to start searching part the next clerk so I do have a question about that um is this her last uh uh regular council meeting or are you doing one more one more one more I'll call series of special meeting so I sent you all the job description um it's been updated it's been reviewed by the City attorney um I'm looking for any addition that Council would like to make before we post it i' like to get it posted hopefully tomorrow um so we start getting applicants um the RFB uh contract negotiations continues Bas Pro told me um they would have to me their reviewed side of the contract early this week I will then pass along to our attorneys um and it's right now scheduled to be approved um at the October 16th special city council meeting which will be right before the work session on that day so we a 6:00 meeting the uh RFP for a Services we're going to start to put that together that's something we talked about when we're planning the budget uh we're just coming up on the end of our current contract we need to go back out and find a new auditor for future um budget years and then code review Services um this is something U we put money in the budget for to have a professional planner um an experience of code review um help our Planning and Zoning Board review the code make suggestions um to clean it up and update it to um prevent uh having to have so many variances and then and leave the code flow and be more uh be up to date with the construction and planning and zoning pieces of the code um one important thing though is that we do need to remember um that the seter bill 250 um has to do with currican in and we follow with in that uh that zone of um where we cannot increase um the level of restrictions we can't make more restrictive code until to be in effective um before October 1 20 24 at this point so when we talk about the pool code um with the 18 in that that would be something that would be less restrictive so that's something that we could take care of this budget here before that um some of the other stuff if we are going to um increase our restrictions um we can have it all planned out we can start drafting the ordinances and then you know when we come around to the the U the expiration of that bill um then we could um make our code adjustments then so that that's the plan at this point um the City attorney and I are working on um getting a payback agreement from another uh County that has uh done a similar code review so great any questions or comments for the city manager just one quick one on the um the city clerk U job description did you want any feedback on that now or just give to you later I mean it's not a big it wasn't a big it's just a very small item that when I was reading that under the qualifications and not to be nitpicky but I know sometimes we always try to come up with unique adjectives when we're working documents like this so if I look down in the qualifications where it talks about the knowledge of the laws ordinances and regulations it just kind of startled me when I read complete knowledge which uh that that would be a toughy I think for anybody so just something less than complete like just just knowledge of the laws and ordinances or above it use we use comprehensive complete just kind of startled me a little bit that um I mean maybe only Randy would be the only person that would have a complete knowledge of but sounds a lot like practical it probably is okay all right thank you very much Mr reer now we're on item eight which is the city clerk's report M chry you have my report is just a short recap of the meetings with we' had and the city email list which you were just saying you know we're doing Beach restoration and we'd like to grow our list but it's not growing very fast so we'd like to figure out a way to get the word out to get more people on our list so we can let them know what's going on so just want to bring that up a big digital sign out for starters and then we also have a nice website that coupled with our Constant Contact whatever service we use I'm sure the word will travel fast yes we do you can sign up right on the homepage of our website so thanks for bringing that up good also the fact that there's you know 45 fulls siiz dump trucks blocking go that's probably going to be a very good indication that something's happen all right any questions or comments for Miss chry well I I have one uh whenever I received a phone call that you had decided to retire I I wasn't sad I'm not saying that I wanted you to leave but uh I never want to hold anybody back from doing what they like to do and uh you have served this community well thank it's been an honor to work with you and uh we're not done yet we have a couple more meetings but um I wish you the very best of all oh thank you very much thank you thank you [Applause] all all right we are on to the consent agenda which is item number nine this is for approval of the September 18th 2023 final public budget hearing uh minutes do I have a motion to approve motion May do I have a second second I'm going to give that one to vice mayor Shirley all in favor I any oppos all right one person opposes the consent agenda passes all right now we are up to the public hearings uh beginning with item number 10 this is for consideration of ordinance 23-6 this will be Mr Mor you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor um last about two weeks ago we had a work session on a series of proposed Charter amendments took the feedback of the members present and distilled that into revised ordinances um we have the way that we're doing this the ordinance calls for the election the resolution has the ballot langage you don't adopt the resolution have ordinance ordinances take two readings resolutions take one so you don't have the resolutions in your packets and make that's on purpose do however before each of the ordinances um in your packet materials There's a summary of what the changes would look like if all were adopted and accepted by the electorate again all you're voting on is whether or not to submit these questions to the electorate um if the electorate approved all of them then that the language that you see in yellow um highlighting with red text and underline is how it can change and then there's also though the resolutions are not on the agenda tonight I to help with some of the confusion know at the work session I just made two pages this is what the ballot language would look like um if approved with your Indulgence mayor I would say that we should go through these one at a time of course they are ordinances they each have to be read by title so we'll start with the fourth the first one this is 23-6 an ordinance of the city council of the city of Beller Beach Florida submitting to the city electors a referendum question on the amendment of section 2.02 of the charter to increase the number of permissible consecutive terms for City Council Members including the mayor from two terms to three terms identifying the issue to appear on set ballot providing for ring providing for the adoption of ballot Language by resolution providing for publication in accordance with the law and providing for an effective date this has been a first reading of ordinance 23- 06 by title only as the title suggests mayor this is the um ordinance that would change the language in the in the um Charter so such that individual council members including the mayor shall be prohibited from holding office for more than three as opposed to two consecutive JS thank you Mr MOA before we go to Council debate let's go to the citizens for comment would anyone like to comment on this proposed ordinance all right citizen comments are now closed I'm going to need a motion to adopt ordinance 23-6 would someone like to make a motion yes I'd like to move that we uh consider approving the ordinance 23-6 motion is made by lyd Roberts do I have a second I'll second second is by council member Livingstone Mr Roberts you have the Flor we we discussed this um a lot in a couple of the workshops I don't think it's necessarily imperative that we do this but I think for the most part most of the council felt um based on a lot of feedback that we've heard from May dtis of the benefits of being able ble to be in this position for three terms as opposed to two terms in some positions that are available that our city can be represented often times because we have a relatively shorter amount of time that we're eligible to be in our positions some of those other positions with the county and other organizations were not thought of as being here long enough to actually be in those seats so I think that's the main benefit of changing our our current ordinances from U two terms to three terms there'll be some other changes you'll see down the road as we consider some of these other um uh ordinance changes but I think it makes the most sense for our city so that we're best represented within the county and possibly even the state thanks thank you Mr Roberts do we have any other questions comments on this yes Mr Banker um Mr Mo could you refresh our memory and on how often a charter has to be reviewed I believe the charart your Charter has to be reviewed um according to your Charter in six-year increments I believe off the top of my head that doesn't prevent uh Charter provision from being Revisited sooner than that my understanding is that you last reviewed your Charter um somewhere between 2018 and 2020 I believe I don't think we're past that time and that said um this started we started discussing a bunch of Charter changes earlier this year and we just went to vote I think the elected uh voted 92% were making the changes back two years ago or two and well it's 2 and a half years ago now and I have a big problem any Charter changes two years after El let votes these changes in um and extending these terms you know I go back to history to see where where we went wrong where we went right when Washington the only president that ever Reed all the electoral votes he declined to run a third time he noted when he left office and they wanted to run a third time need to establish an office not a kingdom but as a servant the Pete Jefferson who probably was one of the smartest presidents we ever had maybe the smartest man servant America he noted specifically that through the the two terms was enough for one person and that might overextend the executive power by having a president serve more than two terms um we're now going to have Council serving 12 years uh that's it came in my opinion and it's not needed the electric was the people clearly said two turns three years a piece now I'm sure you can buy a lot of votes with some cheese and wine this coming year and get this thing changed again but does it benefit the city and why would why would we want to do this and I'm not going to go through each I'm not going to make a speech on each one of these Charter changes but I'm 100% against it charters councils are council members are Charters are there for Council to hold Council accountable ordinances are for the residents to be held accountable just because a couple of council members don't like the way it's written or they're going to lose their seat should not give Council the opportunity to changes now it does have to go to the voters but I think this is just wrong that's all I to say thank you for your comments Mr Banker do we have other comments from the council I just want to add um that um the reason this is being brought up has nothing to do with existing council members doesn't affect any of us and the positions we currently hold is for the future of b beach there have been some uh laws that have changed within the State of Florida that has created the need for us to take a look at our our existing Charter and um to just be mindful of that none of this goes in effect unless the voters vote on thank you vice mayor Shirley um the reason why this came up is that recently the Florida legislature uh introduced a new law that required uh the Council on this level to do full Financial disclosures uh which is um something that none of us want to do because we're a small community we're not paid anything to do this job and there's always going to be a possibility that someone uh might take advantage of that public knowledge however uh there I truly believe that there's still some good people out there that are willing to actually take that risk and step up theity and and serve them uh with a quality that we we all expect unfortunately uh often times someone may interpret uh a change to our ordinance as something that we're trying to take advantage of the community and that is just not the case so you're going to find that uh not only number one we start with extending the ter why would we want to extend terms well the first we had a candidate that ran for mayor before me that no one knew and he was elected and we realized quickly that maybe that wasn't the best recipe for belir Beach uh a lesson that we learned from that is most likely we will never uh elect a first term candidate as mayor in this community again if we do I'll be surprised it could always happen but certainly someone that we don't know running as mayor doesn't work well for me and I don't think it works well for most people that I know in this community so the formula is run once as a council member run for mayor your second term as soon as you become mayor you have to start branching out into the community and you start interacting with County and state officials and also other municipalities and it takes a while to build those relationships uh without building relationships we don't get much we have to really work hard and uh and interact with with our neighboring communities and again the county and the state to make things happen it's that third term that I believe is the most beneficial for belir Beach not necessarily the candidate because at the end of the day what what are you getting out of it other than benefiting the community that you live in uh and so that was uh that was my whole reasoning for for putting this ordinance together and uh and I hope that if we're able to put this on the ballot uh that everyone will remember what I said tonight that this is uh this is good medicine for b beach and that's all I have to say any other comments from the council no all right well let's uh let's put this to a vote P Randy I'm sorry I so sorry I got on Roll here you you you've done everything just fine so far I I just wanted to interject to state that as we're talking about each of these um most especially because the amount of time was spent trying to make sure they they that they exist independent of one another I want to make sure it's clear it's it's tempting to talk about all of them collectively and there is a a collective effort here but at the moment uh we are just on ordinance 2306 um which is specific to changing the consecutive terms to two terms to three terms so as you as you vote you're only voting on that ordinance we'll take each of them as ex session thank you for clearing that all right Patty would you please call the RO council member Banker no council member Livingstone yes council member Noto yes council member Roberts yes vice mayor Shirley yes mayor gais yes so uh the first reading passes 5 to one all right mayor um as we proceed to the next one I did want to know one difference you'll notice in your agenda materials as you're flipping between these ordinances um just as we've talked about some changes in the Florida Statutes one change that came um with this legislative session is a requirement that each ordinance have a business impact estimate uh in in the in the agenda that's published with the agenda and so we've done that here um it's to take effect with the October one date uh so that's what you'll see here on business impact estimate in each of these instances no discernable impact um however it is there to ensure absolute compliance in the event that we don't have any technical issues or challenges as we proceive um so with that ordinance number 23-7 an ordinance of the city council of the city of B Beach Florida submitting to the city electors a referendum question on the amendment of sections 2.01 2.02 and 2.07 of the charter to reduce the number of atlarge members on the city council including the mayor from Seven members to five members to specify the timeline for transitioning to five members and to adjust the corresponding voting requirements for official action of a five member Council identifying the issue of P un said ballot providing for ring providing for the adoption of ballot Language by resolution providing for publication in accordance with the law and providing for an effective date this has been a first reading of ordinance 2307 by title only um just so you know the corresponding ballot language that's intended to accompany this that is not in the ordinance but it's what will um in the resolution to be adopted next month should this pass is shall Charter amendment number two titled reducing the city council to five members from Seven members the ballot language would be shall the city amend the charter to provide for a city council composed of five at large council members including the mayor as opposed to the existing language providing for a city council composed of seven at large city council members including the mayor and adjust the corresponding voter requirements for the council to take action what you'll see here here in the body of the ordinance is three separate sections had to be amended to make this effective um there the first two are um one is just an an outside reference to there shall be a council of seven members changing that to five that's the easy one the second uh language that has changed is to add language to the election and terms section of your Charter to explain how this would happen um I will tell you that the the challenge with this and the next two um proposed ordinances was making sure that each contemplated the possibility of the other without being dependent on the other and so for example in our last work session this language contemplated this happening in the um March 2025 election well if we move the election then that language isn't going to make sense and that's an if but that possibility exists that the voters have the ability to approve one and not the other three or anyone and not the others or combination thereof so the language is beginning with the next regular election for the council member seats whose full terms of office at the time of their election or appointment were originally set to expire in March 2025 the city shall transition to a five member Council so basically member G mayor gtis and I believe member Roberts and I believe member of Livingstone are all on that site their seats are all on that cycle um so when those and and I leave one more mayor M tarot um I I don't have the chart in front of me but suffice to say anybody whose term end is scheduled presently to end in 2025 that's when whenever those seats come up for election um and the whenever is dependent on the other Charter amendments whenever those come up for election what we would do is instead of having the mayor seat and three council member seats up for election you would have the mayor's seat and one council member seat up for election such that your voting cycle going forward would be 3 2 3 2 um uh in terms of the seats that are up so that was the easiest way to do that the challenge again being you were serve an at llarge seat so you couldn't say you know the district 2 seat or the district six seat you had to do it based on when your terms end so that's why it reads that way and then the final proposed change in the ordinance is the Quorum requirement uh your your Charter presently has explicit language that at least four members of the Council are required to take for any vote affirmative vote to pass because it's four of seven which is a majority of seven I just change the language to say a majority of the council um so that way when we it wouldn't make sense to have four out of five be the require super majority requirement going forward for all business so that's those are the proposed changes in thiss happy to answer any questions thank you Mr MOA before we move forward with questions from the council let's go to the citizens for comments would anyone like to comment on proposed ordinance 23-7 all right citizen comments are Clos before we continue I'm going to need a motion uh to adopt Ordinance 23-7 do I have a motion so Move Motion made by vice mayor Shirley do I have a second second second by Mr Roberts vice mayor Shirley you have the floor I think our City attorney did a pretty good job explaining it I have nothing more to that any other questions or comments from the council just a comment I would like to command um Mr MOA on this we discussed this a lot during the last work session and trust me please when I tell you that understanding and having this thing flow is not easy and did a fantastic job of tying everything together on these various ordinances I went through it initially when we first started talking about this and went home and said I think I'm just going to figure out how this is going to work and after 17 tries I finally decided I'm just going to let him work about it so he did a fabulous job on this and I think the three people that actually come up or the three seats in 25 or myself and vice Mayors and Mr a yes sign that's right thank you but yeah so great job I second that any other questions or comments no all right I'm going to uh just go ahead and spell it out for those of you that are not aware of it we did u i I actually did a survey of all of the municipalities in um penel and find out we were one of the smallest municipalities with the most members we were we were compared with Argo we were compared with St Petersburg um really just didn't make sense uh between that and also the fear that we would not have enough candidates in each election this makes perfect sense so now that I've spoken does anyone anyone else like all right P let's take to a vote please council member Banker no council member Livingstone yes council member Noto no council member Roberts yes vice mayor Shirley hi mayor gotus I so it passes 4 to2 that is the first reading is thank you Mr Mayor uh the next ordinance on the agenda is ordinance number 23-8 an ordinance of the city council of the city of Beller Beach Florida submitting to the city electors a referendum question on the amendment of sections 2.02 2.04 and 5.05 of the charter to increase the term of office for individual council members including the mayor from 3 years to 4 years and to amend the regular election schedule to accommodate such terms identifying the issue to appear on said ballot providing for the adoption of ballot Language by resolution providing for publication in accordance with law and providing for an effective date this has been a reading of ordinance number 23-8 by title only just as I did with the previous one I'll read the proposed ballot language that would accompany this it is the title is increasing term of office from 3 years to four years and the language is shall the city amend the charter to provide that each individual term of office for City Council Members including the mayor shall be for 4 years as opposed to the existing three-year term beginning with the officials elected in 2024 and amend the regular election cycle to accommodate the longer election terms so that's the ballot language I want to I do think it's worth looking at the precise language that's been added here I'm not going to read it chapter and verse but I will tell you this was the most involved of the proposed amendments for a few reasons I think that your points were well taken during the work session that if we move to a 4-year schedule but stay on forear terms but stay on the current election cycle what would happen is we would have an election in in March 2024 those people would serve for four years so they would serve till 2028 if this passed and was approved by the voters and then the next cycle would be 2025 and go for four years so they would serve till 2029 so if we didn't change anything we would have an election in 2025 then nothing in 26 nothing in 27 and then again in 28 rapid fire two two new votes 28 29 and then again for these gaps and so there was a concern articulated by the by the council um or at least by some members of the council during the work session that that should that we should keep those staggered terms and so this ordinance accomplishes both changing the language from three years to foure terms which is a simple Amendment you see that in 2.04 for example for the mayor um and um but what it does is in 2.02 says that commencing with the 2024 election if this passes at the 2024 election whoever wins for the seats that are vacant with exception of the vacancy being filled for Mr Z's seat which we can address separately but excuse me the regular term seats that are up for election in 2024 if this passes would serve until 2028 if it fails they'll stay right on schedule for their three-year term so the voters are simultaneously electing who would serve and how long they'll serve on for for that term um at the March election if if this passes this Council um and then again the election cycle is altered so that we would go as as suggested earlier 2024 then the positions that are scheduled in in 2025 would move to 2026 whenever we have an election in 202 6 again because I couldn't presume that the ballot measure for November versus March elections would pass and so you would go to 2026 and then that way again it'll go 24 26 28 30 so every 2 years you will have an election with this with this change and avoid those larger gaps in between and again it'll do be that 32 32 cycle um discussed a moment ago so that's how this is contemplated to to work happy to answer any questions councel I will say that it makes perfect sense as long as you don't explain it to us I listen I I I will tell you as as as as convoluted as that may have seen your poor city manager sat in the conference room where I did this all on a dry race board and figured it out um it is more involved uh you know and that is at your request based on some of the feedback given last time there's cleaner simpler ways that just says three to four but then you don't think the consequences of it and and um it's cleaner but it's not necessarily the result you want B picture all right let's go to the citizens for comments on this particular ordinance [Music] 23-8 any some comments you will be tested on your way out [Music] make seeing there are no citizen comments they are now closed I'm going to need a motion to to adopt ordinance 23-8 so mooves motion made by LD Roberts do I have a second second second by vice mayor Shirley Mr Roberts you have the floor thank you so the other day I turned on my television I have um spectrum and so with defaults the bay news9 and then I'm immediately going to change it to the station I really wanted to watch and as Bay news9 came on they said we're now going to talk about the changes City of Tampa is now going through with they're voting so I said oh this to this they were doing exactly this and the net of it really is they wanted to change their elections to be in November which we're going to talk about later of um the same years that we have the general election for our country and the midterms they wanted to do that for a couple reasons number one is going to save them a lot of money like doing it just those times um I won B you with the detail on that but more importantly was the turnout they had statistics that said when they have elections the same time as the general election um they had like a 65% turnout the elections that were not tied to either the general election or the midterms they had like a 177% turnout and I think that sense people come out through those larger elections so that's really what we're trying to do here is to try to get our elections tied in in the November election of even years just for that so in order to do that this is one of those things that need to be changed where we're on a four-year term if we're on a three-year term obviously you're only going to be on odd numbers even if you start the first year on an even number 3 years later you're automatically in an odd then you go back to an even doesn't work so that that's the main reason we want to do this thank you Mr Roberts for totally ignoring Mr Mora on sticking to the topic I felt I the same way these two had to be joined together for it to make sense why would we want to you know extend the terms why do we want every two years uh specifically so that we can line up with a presidential and midm El any other comments or questions from the Council on this no all right Patty can we take a roll call please council member Banker no council member Livingstone yes council member Noto no council member Roberts yes vice mayor Shirley hi mayor gatis hi and so first reading passes 4-2 ordinance 238 and Mr Mo have something to ask um not about that one but that 2309 um ordinance 2309 is an ordinance of the city council of the city of B Beach Florida submitting to the city electors a referendum question on the amendment of section 5.05 of the charter to adjust the regular election cycle from March to November contingent on the pass mage of a separate ballot ballot measure governing the duration of council member terms identifying the issue to appear on said ballot providing for the adoption of Bot way resolution providing for publication in accordance with the law and providing for an effective date this has been a reading of ordinance number 23- 09 by title only as I've done with the the two previous I've read the ballot language proposed ballot language here that will be before you next meeting um Charter amendment number four conditionally aligning local election sit CLE with federal election cycle in November if a majority of the city's electors approve an amendment extending council member terms to 4 years shall the city also amend the charter to provide that its regular local elections for Council Members shall be held in November in general alignment with the federal election Cycles as opposed to the existing requirement that regular local elections OCC in March yes to amend the provision no to retain um I I I appreciate your admonition to Mr Roberts I will tell you that in drafting these there was a challenge in understanding that the way that you folks had talked about this these were linked one of the explicit directions I was given at our work session was we don't really care about having our elections in November if we can't get our election Cycles changed in a way to these even numbered four-year terms such that we could stay on that same November cycle um but when I asked do you want it to work both ways the answer was no we don't want them to be each contingent just contingent on them and so that's how this was that's how this was written it is very I think clear to the voters that number four is conditional on the passage of number three if number three fails number four is going to fail no matter what the vote is um but it still needs to have a passing vote to to be approved and so uh other other than that the the in terms of the body of of 2309 you can see 5.0 the the language in 5.05 says beginning with the regular election to be held in 2026 uh so it would be very very clear that beginning with the regular election be held in 2026 on the next on Tuesday next after the first Monday in November um then this would happen I can write this like that because we're only doing this if we move to four years so we already know in the 4-year ordinance um where or the four-year ballot language we are extending the terms of a few seats so that they would extend all the way into November 2026 or in 2026 um I know it's a little convoluted I'm sorry um it's the only way you can make all of that work but basically if you if the voters approve the four-year term and they approve this then the first time you have an election in the very next election after the March 2024 election will be in November 2026 um that will be the gap you'll jump no March 2025 no November 2025 no March 2026 November 2026 will be your next election were they to approve everything and so the people elected in 2024 will serve till 2028 people elected in 2026 we'll serve until 2030 and every four years therea if it is approved by this Council ands thank you for explaining that Mr MOA let's go to the citizens for comments like to make a comment all right citizen comments are now closed I need a motion to adopt ordinance 23-9 so mooves motion made by Lloyd Roberts do I have a second second second by vice mayor Shirley Mr Roberts once again you have the floor yeah I think I cheated last time got already talked about this somewhat so pretty self-explanatory we just want to um get on the foure cycl and that's why we want to do that any other questions or comments all right Patty would you please call the rooll council member Banker go council member Livingstone yes council member Noto yes council member Roberts yes vice mayor Shirley hi mayor gallus I so ordinance 23-9 first reading is approved the vote was 521 right now we are on to item number 14 consideration of ordinance 23-10 this is a first reading Mr Mora thank you Mr Mayor this is ordinance 23-10 an ordinance of the city council of the city of B Beach Florida amending section 3887 of the city's code of ordinances governing the permitting process for special events Associated costs and fees and potential penties for of unpermitted or non-compliant special events providing for the implementation of administrative actions providing for codification providing for separability and providing effective date there been a reading of ordinance 23-10 by title only on the first reading Mr Mayor uh we workshopped this about two weeks ago this is the ordinance that was in part the product of some concerns raised by activist organizations and members of the community concerning special event permitting um and this is the ordinance done in collaboration with that organization uh to reach a a better product for the community and its govern thank you Mr Mor let's go to the citizens for comments CR all right citizen comments are now closed before we continue we going to need a motion to adopt ordinance 23 -1 so would like to make a motion so Move Motion made by vice mayor Shirley do I have a second second second by Mr Roberts vice mayor Shirley you have the floor thank Workshop this pretty well and um it's been an ongoing work in progress trying to fix an ordinance that was uh Loosely assembled years ago um Mr Mo did a great job together working with the um Outside Agency that was that brought it to our attention and um think it's something I agree um it was a great collaborative I guess offering this ordinance um it was something we had to do uh otherwise it could very well be in the last thing we want to do is want it in court so because of this entire process we now have Mr moris is a better product in our code of ordinances when dealing with events any other comments no all right P would you please call the roll council member Banker yes I'm sorry yes thank you council member Livingstone yes yes council member Noto yes council member Roberts yes vice mayor Shirley hi mayor Gallas hi and so ordinance 23-10 first reading is approved unanimously right now let's go to item number 15 which is consideration of ordinance 23-05 which will be the second and final reading Mr Mora you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor this is ordinance 23-05 an ordinance of the city council of the city of b beach amending chapter 18 section 18-5 of the city's code of ordinances entitled time for qualifying removing the time the specified qualifying period providing for the establishment of the qualifying period by resolution of the city council providing for the incorporation of recitals providing for separability and providing an effective date this has been a second and final reading of ordinance 23-05 Mr Mo before we get to Citizen comments would you U please give a summary as to why this uh this ordinance was created yes happily Mr Mayor so the um your code presently provides that the no person shall qualify as a candidate in any regular city election prior to 8:00 a.m. on the 88th day proceeding the next regular election nor later than 12:00 noon on the 81st day um it's a very fixed set period it is inflexible um there's not really a lot of leeway to change that as it's written um and so the as if you apply that to the March 2024 election for example it would fall past the deadline that the city needs to notify the uh supervisor of elections of the ballot language and qualified candidates and it would also span the Christmas holiday such that uh and the weekend such that there would really be two or three business days during which somebody could qualify which challenges to candidates interested in the position so um in order to rectify that what we've done is changed that language to just say we'll do a resolution this is very common in other communities to set the qualifying period by resolution which you only do on one reading that resolution is in our materials tonight and and we'll be reading and addressing that in a moment um but that's why this uh was written um addressing your your election code thank you Mr MOA please go to the citizens for comments anyone like to comment on ordinance 23-05 all right CI comments are now closed I'm going to need a motion to adopt ordinance 23-05 again this is the second and final reading I have a motion so Move

Patty and uh for Mr Mayor just for clarity in the record going forward congratulations Mr Chester being appointed uh your term will run through the March 2024 election um at which point the seat will be up for regular election and we'll address that in the in the resolution that's next yes okay all right well uh let's get to the first official order of business for Mr ches uh this is uh item number 17 it's consideration of resolution 2023 d10 Mr laa thank you Mr Mayor resolution [Music] 2023-2024 for the purpose of electing three city council members for a full term of office and a fourth seat for the remaining tenure of a recently vacated council member position to establish the qualifying dat of process for person seeking elective office for the 2024 municipal election authorizing the city manager to enter into an agreement with supervisor of elections establishing a bowling place for the March election authorizing County Supervisor elections to verify candidate petition cards and facilitate the election process and establishing an effective date this has been a reading of resolution 20231 by title you um this is a single reading as it is a resolution the resolution in large part is Administrative it is um to document for our purposes and with the supervisor of elections what we are calling for you have three seats whose regular cycle is scheduled to be on the March 2024 P um I don't think there's any real any real controversy or question there there was some discussion about what happens with members abley and the language in your Charter as it reads contemplates that the person appointed by the council upon a vacancy Shall Serve until the next regular election our next regular election scheduled will be held in March 2024 what will happen is that election for that seat will do nothing to change the cycle that that seat is on what it will do is whoever is elected in March 2024 to the seat vacated by member Z will serve for the remainder of that term ordinarily I would tell you they will serve until March 2024 five when they will serve until is in part a function of how all these Charter amendments function because if those terms are extended through November 2026 then that may change that calculus however they will serve for the remainder of the natural term of council member Z's office upon the March election how are we going to do that was a question we had at the last work session and that's provided for in the resolution in section four sub a and subb and the way that it reads basically is the three assuming you get four people who run the three people um you know and as I and as I view this we may have to address this assuming you get five people to run the three people who get the most votes will get the regular seats the fourth person will get fourth place will get that shorter term I'm that's how that's designed to function um as I review the resolution um I'm realizing that it doesn't address what would happen if in the event you don't have a full if only four people run how will that be decided um that could be construed as a tie that would be resolved by your um your Charter's language on drawing lots and straws and the like and we may I may been speaking with the clerk and manager wish to do another resolution in November to clarify that um but assuming you have five people such that you're having an election um and a contested election the top four vote Getters would fill those seats first place second place third place if you will would take the ordinary seats fourth place would fill council member Chester seat and for and council member Chester you are fully eligible provided you remain a qualified elector of the city you are fully eligible to run again um in Earnest to run for the position March thank you for uh for clearing that up let's go to the citizens for comments no all right CI comments are now closed before we continue going to need a motion to approve resolution 20231 discuss after the motion discussion the discussion always happens after the motion uh you you did the person I I'll move it okay do we have a second second second by Frank Baker M you have the floor I think this um resolution is very clear um section three where he talks about the three vacancies and then the other one gets the rest of Mr D's term I think it's it's clear place and and as I was talking about I talking about it as an aside with the city manager a moment ago um one of the suggestions we had he had was if we have four people qualified we can still just run the election just to see functionally who's getting that fourth SE that's one approach we could do um or to save on the election we would have to address how that would be resolved without the need for one um May COA that I didn't address that here um um in the in the various ordinances on elections that was an an oversight that we can still address um I would appreciate your insights on that if you would prefer that you run the election if there are only four people um if of course if you have less than four people run then those two or three would get full terms but at four do you want to run an election or would you have that rather resolved by Lots on who gets the short strong there for the short term yeah I I would I would say that if we only had four candidates the first question would be to go to each C and see if anyone would consider doing the short term and then that would save sa us from having to at least have that valid language but we have other valid language anyway so I don't know whe if there be any you're running an election regardless for sure have we always treated the replacement I don't I don't Rec always in the past and maybe it's just been handled wrong but when we had to replace someone on Council they stayed on through that term for that person's term that may be the case candidly I didn't go through the entire history of it in part because all of that is fact intensive for example member Livingstone was appointed in June of last year it feels like she's just served a longer time than member Chester might get to but it's really just a function of when member gun seat is up in March um whether or not it was done in the past to me doesn't militate the doesn't command the result to me I looked to the plain language of your Charter um I reviewed that with your fellow CH with my fellow Charter officials candidly I reviewed it with my colleagues as well say am I am I missing something here and the the unanimous uh consensus of reviewing the language of your Charter as it reads is that they are appointed and served until the next regular election um and nothing and the rest of the charter specifically dictates the cycles that seats are are up for election so that would run counter to other language and you have to read a document like that in harmony with all its terms so that's how I got to that result it may I can't tell you that it was never done the other way had I been your City Attorney at the time I don't think I would have interpreted it that in the way that that I see this I at first I didn't agree with you at all and then I realized that really we're not flipping the cycle what we're doing is if you have a an elected official who resigns early in his term um you're not actually you're giving the council to speak on behalf of the citizens there's still a whole more greater than 50% of a term that uh we should take it to the citizens to allow to vote for but less than if it were less than half the then I would then this is the case of like Mark Chester here I I don't know that it's really about how much is left in the term as much as it is are you having another election again on a regular cycle not a special election are you having another regular election if so the documents of your Char and the spirit of the representative democracy that we have say well then let the voters weigh in you're having an election anyways you guys fill the seat as a stop Gap measure so so that we could continue to do business with a full compliment of seven members and avoid three three ties in the light where we didn't need them um but now the voters are going to be weighing in on three other seats why not just have them Place everybody I think is really more the thrust of it it's not if he had been in his last year but we're having a regular election same result and that is what's happening members able seat would have been forgetting all the charter amendments would have been up in March 2025 that's one year left in the term on its ordinary cycle so it's not really about how much is left in the term as much as the seat was vacated before a next regular election had memb AEL resigned in April 2025 whoever filled that seat whether it was member CH Mr I mean in April of 2024 that person would serve 11 months and they would never come up for election because there's no regular election between that and the end of the term so that's the only reason where time comes in if you're less than a year left because you don't have a regular election or if it's qualif yeah yes um that would be that would be another issue yeah so um if you can't qualify in time so um that's that's why this is working this way um and um you know my my one request of you um as we look at this resolution would be I appreciate consensus on how you want to handle if you have exactly four members qualify how would you like that handled that's um again my shortcoming and drafting this that it's not drafted but it's not in there but I would appreciate Council ins what you'd like to see in that instance I've heard member gtis mayor Gus's recommendation that you see if we can't get somebody to volunteer for the shorter term but is that what is that the will of the body at least the consensus comments yes so I think it's clear that if we have five or more candidates for the March election then then we definitely will um have an election yes sir that's clear if we have four or less but we have four exactly even though it may cost not may it will cost money to have an election I guess my gut feel is it makes sense to go ahead and do that for the sole purpose of knowing what what our citizens how they voted so who was 1 2 three and four and as you stated earlier whoever comes out to be fourth out of the four would take Mr Z will see and understand you are having an election for that based on at least at this point you have first reading I won't presume second passes but should it pass in the same manner then you will have issue elections on ballot any other comments right um I'm sorry I to interrupt your presiding officer I'm looking for consensus Direction one of the challenges I had in drafting the charter amendments was want a consensus Direction I have one or two of it'd be really helpful to get the views of those members You' like this this answer now it would be most helpful yes I would we can do that um okay well let's just uh let's start with our well I will tell you this it there's a big difference between serving a year and a half as opposed to 5 months yes sir and I'm not sure I agree with you on the filling we've had this happen before our country where we had to they appointed somebody president after they resigned and they didn't have an an earlier election they filled out the term so yes and I would say those were Bound by different do no I I I just I you might have had more people participate in this if it wasn't for only five months as opposed to fill the entire term that's my two sents I hear that um understanding that we're here now um if four people qualify how would you like that result in terms of would you would you prefer that we resolve that internally meaning draw law or straws or something to see who's for place or do you think in the instance where there are qualified candidates that that that should be submitted to the I I always like for the the people to be able to vote on things I I'm also in favor of saving money and not wasting money whenever that's possible so okay putting a lot of pressure on somebody who just got up here sorry Well normally I go left to right or right to left and I just had to do roll Le would you like the weigh in on this yeah you know as far as saving money by not have we only have four people qualified we're going to have to have the election anyway because of the um amendments to the Charter so the um you know having another question on there is not going to be that significant having the council member election so is that you prefer the vote in that instance pardon so is that you saying you in an instance where four people qualify you think a vote would be more appropriate election than I would say yes put on the ballot but it still shakes out to how do we determine who get what seat right whoever gets the least out of those four whoever gets the lowest number gets the oneyear term or the what would ordinarily be the one-ear term the shortest term we don't have any other option right what what else you going to do the other option is to treat it as a four-way tie and in your code a tie is resolved as evidenced here by drawing Lots or something else so if you treat it as a you can treat it as a tie or you can submit it to the voters if you treat it as a tie we would draw Lots or straws or something and that's assuming weend in the council that vote passes in March 2 to reduce the council to five then then you that doesn't that doesn't impact this cycle okay so that vote it's not retro act I mean it doesn't happen at the same no the the cycle down to five happens at the conclusion of um that seats term that fourth seats term so they would serve that remaining period and then at the end of that there's there's two L Council positions Mr I think the charge pretty clear on how to do this and I stick with it stick with it treat it as a tie and then yeah understood it's Livingstone I think council member NATO um summarized it pretty well and I'm in agreement with having an election makes sense Mr Roberts so one scenario that we didn't really talk about yet so let's say for example we have four spots and we only have three people that actually register um so then all three of them when what do we what do we and you would appoint the vacancy thereafter we would appoint a vacancy okay got it got it yeah so I'm in favor of um of the votes um people people will be voting on the charter items anyway so that makes sense um I'm still I'm in the mindset that if we have four candidates um that anyone who is interested in a short term sort as a trial size they should be given that opportunity and then the other three would do a full term and then you don't even have to have names on the bot it would cure itself understood I think I have my consensus Direction um I will of course look at this particular aspect of this M Baker your point on the Char as well take it it could be treated as a tie um much as you would you know you would treat it as they have all voted for themselves and it's a four-way tie that would be the result absence some direction if for some reason um in reviewing that my analysis changes was on the flight issue I spotted I will let you know okay we still need to vote on the resolution all right so we are voting on resolution 20 23-10 as you already have your motion would you please call the r council member Banker yes I'm sorry yes thank you council member tester yes council member Livingstone yes council member Noto yes council member Roberts I vice mayor Shirley I mayor gallis hi so uh resolution 20 23-10 passes unanimously uh we'll move forward with that all right we are on to item number 19 unfinished business do we have any unfinished business authorize the city manager to Grant easements to Duke Energy Florida LLC uh before we go to the council for comments and uh and a vote on this with citizens like to speak no citizen comments C comments close all right uh this is placed on the agenda by city manager reer you have the floor thank you mayor so this is a item we discussed in the last work session this is uh an easement at Crossman park Duke is requesting to place switch gear uh equipments uh that have to um do with the undergrounding of the Gulf Boulevard on the Eastern side um I mentioned before the uh the idea when designing this project was to try to keep all the equipment as much as possible off private property um in some instances it was unavoidable and U residents have cooperated and given eement to make this project go um this is an opportunity uh for the switch grou to be place on public land of Crossman Park and um this it's the city's decision to allow that easement for the purpose of of the undergrounding project I've included the uh the easement itself the uh the map of uh where the two switch gear will be placed in cros Park which is going to be the Northwest uh part of the parcel and um also they give us a sort of rendering what thank Mr Reaper before we forward on this I'm going to need a motion uh to authorize a city manager to Grant eement to Duke Energy for LLC do I have a motion motion motion made by Frank Baker do I have a second second second by BME Shirley Mr Banker do you have the floor there's two boxes junction boxes to the left uh are they going to be removed no those that's communication all communication both of them the one looks like power the little should communication as um you get clarification on little [Music] small I have a question um it looks like the house on the corner on the opposite corner has a box or something going in there assume that he's already been granted but I realized today there didn't Putters for a wall there is that is that been taken into consideration yes that wall has been taken consideration the entire project um it was actually as you know it was trenched and fil for quite some time because it's a unique piece of property where um our usual rules in our ordinances for walls don't apply because it's completely the counties right away with um with their line of sight for their intersection so they did get involved after we approved it per our uh code um and then they had the they've actually had to back the wall off the property line closer to the to the house itself and reduce the height of the wall because of the interception but Duke's been part of this process been part of this eness are huge I mean you know as they should be for block wall and U I just noticed that this morning so no they're fully okay I I was shocked that a single person was out there dating that female really it was a female wow okay any other questions or comments on this topic no all right all in favor I any oppos all right you are off thank you mayor okay now let's move to item 19 unfinished business do we have any unfinished business no I think everyone's probably getting ready mayor mayor um I I didn't get this in on the city manager report I just want to mention that uh officer CL did point out that the sergeant was called into an emergency that was supposed to be here to
