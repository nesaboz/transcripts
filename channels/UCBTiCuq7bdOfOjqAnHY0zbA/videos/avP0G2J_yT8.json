citizen comments um i'm going to keep pointing over here even though it's not here anymore it's right over here the podium uh anyone who wishes to address this you have three minutes please come up state your name and address and then address the council would anyone like to address counsel i see a hand back here still not good lin what's the story we didn't fix that mike there you go electric is a good thing good evening everyone uh andrea cavone 119th 12th street i somehow made it to the agenda tonight so i feel like i need to speak to it i was campaigning on february 14th i was going around the neighborhoods and placing informational campaign cards and doorways i was approached by a neighbor and he instructed me not to knock on a door so we had a brief discussion i reassured him that i was not knocking on doors i believe it was an elderly neighbor that he didn't want me to disturb after the discussion i moved away from him he then kind of positioned himself in the crossroads so that i either would have had to go through him and around him or engage again which i chose not to do i felt like he was maybe watching me to make sure that i didn't go to that house and i'm a responsible citizen if he asked me not to of course i wasn't going to but either way i felt extremely unwelcome and i felt that i really wasn't able to campaign properly that day and that was my concern thank you all so much thank you andrea anyone else yes sir uh chris barnes i live in 1024th street i'll speak up a bit because i'm sorry i'm hard time hearing you hi i'm chris barnes i'm living 124th street um i was also campaigning for you ma'am ranzo and i was i'm just gonna you know i'm gonna just we're not supposed to campaign so you can speak about the incident just i don't get into it i was out passing flyers out and i was also kind of confronted by a neighborhood in the same area and he was kind of aggressive and confrontational with us and wasn't very welcoming and was just telling us not to knock on neighbor's door he's doing the same thing said i happen to have a uh aggressive doberman pinscher she's not aggressive over adventure she's just a small 50 pound little black lab mix of some kind and uh i was actually probably about 10 feet away almost towards the other side of the street with the dog she's actually i'm actually in the process of doing making her my service dog for me and so she's not confrontational she's not aggressive anything like that and so he was more confrontational with us and trying to stop us from doing from walking and he was not very nice at all so that was about it thank you yes jim van scoy 7th street velar beach so the occurrence first occurrence was on monday and it was on howard and it was a um resident mr lusk he approached andrea and one of the firemen who were out on the street with us campaigning but they never said a word they can't the firemen that have been going out with us are just a second body they're not saying anything anyhow i come back from place in a sign on golf boulevard and i see mr lusk having a conversation with the two of them and it looked kind of heated like he was he was having a heated conversation not them so i pulled over to the side he started to walk back to his house he came back because he saw my car which stands out and he started to approach me and i told him i was not going to speak to him that i felt unsafe around the people that were campaigning for the other side so then he proceeded to go back to his house that was on monday so there was two incidents on monday and the third one was on wednesday with the same gentleman it wasn't until wednesday when we had to file a complaint with the sheriff's department because i thought three incidents was beyond what it should have been and i just thought it might progress further so i felt like it was important for us to follow a police report and get it on the record in case something should occur or progress further thank you thank you anyone else like to address counsel yes hand in the back bill lusk hibiscus drive west can't believe i'm standing here right now that was me they were talking about you all called the police i honestly as it relates to andrea remember the conversation well i told them point blank i love what they're doing i love volunteering i respect their candidate for volunteering for the city for three years and then they asked me about voting and i shared my perspective on the last three years i feel as if they may have walked away wondering why are we campaigning it had nothing to do with blocking or aggressive i actually thanked them they thanked me as it relates to the next gentleman i recognize him i never even talked to him i talked to a council member that came back to our house after knocking on the door 9am ringing the doorbell yup they had a big dog and interesting clothing on and i'll be for the life of me i feel like i was set up for something but i think people in this city know me well enough i think my neighbors know me well enough i'll always step up for a 92 year old woman and say hey could you not knock on her door that's the gist of it you can make of it what you want you filed a police report i kindly replied with an email to lynn reeves and i think i'll let that email sit so thanks for a couple minutes thank you anyone else like to address counsel saying other hands i'll close citizen comments kyle we still don't have our guests from the league of cities i'm going to take item three and hold it off kyle if you'll just wave your hand to me when he comes in we'll get him at the next opportune time okay next we have a guest of honor here we have our fire chief um jeff davidson chief davidson good evening everyone jeffrey davidson fire chief for pinellas coast fire rescue we're proudly serving the city of bel air beach i want to give you an update on the fire and ems calls here in the area in the last ending february 28th we luckily we only had 63 firing ems calls in bel air beach excluding the downgraded calls we have an average response to your calls of four minutes and 47 seconds which is a pretty good response time we're happy to serve you the county standard is seven seven and a half minutes so four minutes and 47 seconds average is a good service to your community i wanted to invite everybody on saturday march 19th at 10 a.m we are having our new fire engine will be there and we're going to have a washdown ceremony and some refreshments and we'd like to invite the community to come and participate so there's some flyers over there on the counter and we hope to see you there thank you could you just hang on one second see if anybody has any questions here counsel any questions for the chief i don't have a question i just want to commend um the people that work for you one of my neighbors had to call 9-1-1 they called me i ran over until you guys got there you know i stayed out of the way while you guys did their thing and i was very impressed with their um level of knowledge their integrity and the way they treated my neighbor and it was a wonderful experience and nice to see you guys in action so thank you great thank you very much for for the feedback i uh rarely hear uh i do hear them but i rarely hear a negative comment about pinellas suncoast fire rescue and it's really unbelievable how many people send thank you cards if they'll stop by in the station just to say our our men and women go the extra effort to make sure that your needs are met you know even after the emergency sandal just to make sure you have everything that you need so anything that we can do for you all please just let us know chief i want to commend you and thank you also i mean number one that response time is terrific uh that's absolutely outstanding and i think the citizens need to remember that response time what we have now okay um i'm not i'm not sure i'm at liberty to discuss something you and i had discussed a little while back but um there's forces it works that that could possibly change this and how they respond to fires and stuff so when the chief comes in and you read about uh how the how the trucks are going to be dispatched and where they're being dispatched from pay attention to that because um i had pleasure of doing fire ops training and i thought i was in good shape and i could barely handle a morning of what you guys do every day you know 12 hours a day right um it's tough work and mine was a simulated thing you're doing with real fire and real smoke um it's tough and i will tell you this a minute two minutes means a lot if you do fire ops training you see a pic a video where a room at three minutes is one thing and at five minutes you can't go in the room anymore it looks like hell it's all flames and it's the roof is falling so um seconds mean a lot in a response and you guys are fabulous you and your men and ladies are fabulous thank you uh also very proud of our department uh for these of you who don't know about uh one third of our department are service members and veterans including myself so i'm very proud of that fire department uh the men and women here are here to serve and we're happy to be here in baylor beach so thank you keith while we have you i'll see if there's any comments from the audience um if they do we'll just have you step aside for a second as they ask it anyone want to speak with the chief yes mr hansig right up front here chief just yeah just take two giant steps that way and then come back to the mic how's that thank you for your service thank you for your sir john hanson 22nd street i'd question for the chief what plans if any does the pinellas suncoast have in working towards an iso one certification and the reason i ask people don't know about it it affects your property insurance [Music] if your fire department is iso one certified your premiums go down chief 9 0001 they didn't catch the gentleman's name i'm sorry john yes all right that's a good question john so that is one of the things that we are currently working on so um i don't know if you guys let me see except this way i hate to not look at you when i talk there so john's right so the iso is the insurance services organization rating that's anywhere from a one to a 10 x um and basically they come out and they evaluate your fire department but it's not just your fire department so forty percent of your scoring is your water and your water department um thirty percent is your um communications and your radio system um with the sheriff's office dispatch we always get the it's actually 40 points on there so we're going to get the 40 points on there and the rest is it's not so much um your training and your equipment the number of people that you put on scene how fast you could put them on scene uh and the parameters so we strive to put on a fire call the first unit on scene in four minutes and the last unit on scene and of the first alarm within eight minutes and you're supposed to do that 90 of the time so kind of good that you asked that because one of the things i did want to mention is uh one of the things that we're doing is looking to move our indian rock speech fire station further north in in the iraq's beast not into bel air base but it'll be closer and we actually be better response times in the bella beach which is why we're doing that so that's going to be probably a couple year process to do but we have some properties that we're evaluating and how we can do that and once we get those things settled we'll look at re-evaluating our iso evaluation and a lot of a lot of it has to do with record-keeping and training records and inspection records and but mostly is response times and the biggest portion of it is your water system so we're working with the municipalities to make sure the water system is where it needs to be and the hydrants have been inspected every five years and that the flow testing are done they're marked they're in the computers all those things there's a lot that goes into it so it's a big process but that's probably something we're going to look at an evaluation is done about every five years unless you ask for one sooner so we'll probably start that process in another year and a half and have it complete in about two and a half years but the number one party right now is getting that fire station moved closer so we could better serve your area and better serve indian rock speech as well so thank you for asking that question all right um anytime you need to contact me um our my email address is on our website usfrd.org and you can contact me at any time and i'll try to if i don't have the answer i'll definitely find one for you okay i have a question for you i'm sorry are the citizens done i have a question uh what iso version are you currently on um well we currently are an iso rating of four okay and the best rating is a one there's no there is a very small percentage of departments that are actually a one um and like i said before the majority forty percent of that support is your water department um so we have to make sure we work with not only peller beach but baller shores indian rock species indian shores and then the unincorporated area so it's a little tougher to coordinate all those things but it is something that we're working on proudly [Music] so to get us to a class two would probably be something that we could easily do not say easily but you know with the work that we do and just documenting the work because that's that's usually where people lose their points on their scoring is not that they didn't do the work they just didn't document that they did the work so that's the problem how do you pass that cost along are you passing that along to the taxpayers or is there an intern there's no cost for that cause for your iso certification to even improve it no ma'am there's no cost no no ma'am and uh the things that they do the record-keeping is something that the lieutenants and the firefighters and the drivers do on a daily basis and it's just making sure that it gets categorized in the right places and we know where to pull that data from so when we have fire calls they actually they don't want to see every fire call they want to see fire alarms and things they just want to see the working fires where you needed the 15 people on scene minimum and how fast you can get them there so those are the kind of things that they look for oh great questions any other questions for the chief chief thank you you're always welcome here thanks for the great work hopefully we see on the 19th yeah kyle i saw some people come in yes okay all right so we're gonna go back to number three uh which is a presentation from from the florida league of cities florida municipal insurance trust level 2 certificate of safety excellence to the city of bel air beach this was a certificate for risk management score 100 for the fmit safety excellence initiative mr representative i'm going to turn sideways if you guys don't mind as well um first of all i just want to apologize for being a little bit late i was at balor bluffs uh giving them their level one certificate so i had two meetings back to back so it was a little tight on my time um my name is trevor reshey i'm a safety and risk consultant for the florida league of cities and i'm representing the fmit which is your insurance provider for the city um in 2019 we developed a process called the safety excellence initiative it's very similar to the iso audit that you were just discussing with the fire department and it's designed to encourage municipalities to create and implement safety management systems for both worker safety and public safety so i want to first of all congratulate the city for being the first city in the entire state of florida to go through the entire process for level one and that was in 2020 and then just recently in january of this year uh you guys scored a hundred percent on the level two so you're the first city to get level one and now you're the first city to get level two so that is an excellent achievement for for you guys and it's uh honestly it's a it's a great model for other cities that are going through the process currently as well so congratulations here is your certificate level two any questions on the program or anything like that before i wrap it up thank you and thank you for doing the program keeping the cities at their absolute best and thank you for the recognition really appreciate it thank you well and well earned by our staff here kyle and lynn reeves and everyone who work toward this yeah great thank you john [Applause] okay i see three sheriffs in the back we're honored to have three i think only two are going to make the presentation but we have pinellas county sheriff's office we have law enforcement and code enforcement whichever order you'd like to go oh that's weird i can see myself in the computer now i'm not used to that good evening i'd also like to take this opportunity to let the fire department know that we applaud them every time they leave the scene also sergeant switch with pinellas county sheriff's office i am presenting the stats for january of 2022. under the ucr property and person crimes i am showing one assault which was domestic related i am showing one burglary and four larcenies or thefts however in my research mayor if you remember we discussed last month's meeting the two that occurred that were unlocked doors at the condominiums at the north end of the city there were an additional three or four if i'm not mistaken that were reported after that meeting again unlocked doors and in this one there was a firearm that was stolen so again we cannot stress enough the importance of locking doors however in reading the report it looked like they were visitors from out of town so it's kind of difficult to get that message across to them and of course i'm sure it was an oversight on their part but through the research that's what i found moving along there were it says a total of five people however it was a total of five charges those for warrants a domestic related incident that we just spoke about and driving under the influence which was also related to the driving while his license was suspended under deputy activity you will see that traffic enforcement leads that category directly followed by directed patrols lastly there were there was one crash in the city and that's not including the one that obviously occurred i'm sure everybody's aware of that when that occurred right here at the intersection but the crash itself resulted in bellair shore and then lastly there were a total of 164 citations and warnings issued of those 134 were warnings 21 were traffic citations five were parking however i don't have the ability to break it down whether or not they were citations or warnings because you handle parking citations in-house and then four were boating and that's all i have i um i know this is the january report but uh you know once again yesterday minding our own business and we got the hollywood movies coming through with high speed chases you guys are doing an incredible job keeping us safe um under some really scary circumstances we had a family member right opposite where that guy crashed and grabbed somebody out of the car they were at crabby builds yesterday when that happened um kudos to the sheriff's department and the bravery what that you folks put out day in day out um it's just amazing but uh you know we're a sleepy little town generally and to have these high speed car chases it's just getting a little scary so it is and unfortunately i wish we could proactively prevent that from happening but sometimes it's reactive and half the time it seems like it doesn't even begin in bellar beach it's just a community cut through area so sometimes they'll start in clear water they'll come through here largo indian rocks and work their way up they're two for two and you know i i'd like to say keep up the good work but i'd like it to be nice if it just would go away this one started i know in dunedin but you know hopefully we won't see it anytime soon it's a little scary so that is council do we have any uh comments or questions for the sheriff citizens anything that uh carjacking that happened was that was that a minor or what what was the age unfortunately i can't comment on that comment on it and the only reason i can't is because i just came on at six o'clock and i just became aware of that through the news feed that we get through our intranet so if you want i can look into it but based on what i saw i don't believe it was a minor i believe it was an adult if anybody that's fine if you can okay okay thank you citizens any comments thank you sheriff thank you vote enforcement good evening mr mayor council members staff citizens uh steve klapke for the record just to let you know february uh was a very busy month in code enforcement again still a crackdown on the contractors that are not pulling permits or contractors that are not licensed working in pinellas county working very diligently with the um the building department and the department of licensing uh we had quite a few more issues with uh people not pulling permits and i will tell you that again with the good working relationship that we have with the building department and the licensing bureau uh they are actually really cracking down um i will tell you that on a couple occasions when i pulled up to a home where they're doing work first thing was well we heard about you here's our permit um and and that's what we want to see and again that's that's for the protection of the citizens of this city and uh again uh no real major incidents to report but again we're out there actively going after these contractors and some of the other other code violations you know have kind of dwindled down there was some citizens that we sent letters to that have uh responded and took care of their incidents so i think last month i had like 12 open cases and i think i'm down to two so other than that it's uh it's been a it's been productive and again i enjoy what i'm doing deputy i i it's it's hard not to notice the step up in the enforcement on the permit situation so hopefully the word will get out but if it doesn't get out maybe they'll watch the movie here or the film of this night and i mean you're going to get them i mean it's all over the place it's like every day you're getting people so um it definitely got to pull the permit if you need to pull one get it perfect and and like i said i thank uh len and and laura for coming up with that new spreadsheet that works out a lot better so you guys can see exactly what we're doing and any incident that i come across i go ahead and log it in there whether it's a parking citation or a permit or whatever the issue is council citizens thank you thank you very much for your time adam six is the city attorney report attorney salzman mayor council members uh have met with the city manager we've gone through a few of the outstanding issues that we're resolving nothing of a great note to bring forward to council there's some resident issues that we're resolving looking at some other contract issues but nothing to bring forward to council at this point we will meet try to meet as often as necessary i'm working on i would say probably three different issues right now anyone have any questions on counsel citizens any questions for the city attorney thank you thank you mayor city manager yeah yes mayor and consul this uh i've given you my report in the packet uh just a couple things this is a test operation tonight with the uh new audio and stuff and you know we'll work the kinks out we're still waiting for uh the parts to to extend the wi-fi over in here so when we do move into the ipads then we'll have a better uh wi-fi net in this room uh the city attorneys rfp is going out it's going to be published on the 9th so it'll it'll go out this week and we've got two bids out 7th street and 16th street seawall and and boat dock as i mentioned here and the 13th street uh drainage uh fred did provide me last week with the uh section 94 the code which i mentioned here and we'll be bringing that to a work session to get that cleaned up that's all i've got any questions for the city manager um on golf boulevard you know how that's blocked off and we have to merge can you do you know what's going on or how much longer and any idea any updates it's uh it was a sewer issue and they're replacing the pipe they started out uh blanking the street but they started out doing a cross cut uh it's a contractor they haven't given me any time frame when it'll be finished the other day it looked like they were starting to fill it back up but then they were digging it out again so no no firm date on that just cares i have a question uh the 16th street seawall renovation um we spoke last week and uh we you mentioned 16th and 17th um are those the the asphalt is that part of this project or is this something else no this is the seawall 16th and 17th street or the stormwater project and we're getting a proposal from dual engineering to do the design for that currently okay do you know when that'll happen i'm waiting for the thing at any time and then we'll get the design done which usually takes four or five months okay question i'm done or the city manager our normal engineer had some health issues and you backfilled with somebody else is that all working well they stand in engineering uh it it's working pretty well uh you know the the difference is larry was a one-person show and he would come and a lot of stuff got moved out a lot faster but uh it it might delay a like a a house construction uh review it might take a couple weeks now or with larry we we got comments back in a week so that that's the only real push the other permits we're not having any issue with thank you council any other questions for the city manager citizens anybody have a question for the city manager just come to the podium please um jim van scoy 7th street um there's two polls that i've seen in the city and i'm just wondering if this is 5g have you noticed them they have a like a tall tube rusted tube sitting on telephone poles is that 5g i don't know if it's been upgraded but that is part of the communication system for the satellites i don't know for a fact that it's 5g they they the way that it's went since the legislature kind of took away our authority we don't really they can come in and put them wherever they want we can well i know that we cannot we cannot uh dictate where they put them we can dictate though according to the to the statute that we can dictate how they look the beautification of you can dictate a little bit about landscaping around them but the the poll is not really going to change yeah all right unfortunately they took it away from the yeah the cities to issue right away permits and things of that nature so lynn is speaking about that's what's known as preemption uh sometimes tallahassee says that they don't want the local cities the localities to handle something and this is a situation with the 5g so um yeah we have very limited as to what we're able to do so you may find a 5g antenna and that's not lynn reeves or the city or the city council it's uh tallahassee uh and the big um cell phone companies yeah they and like i said they pretty much have a free-for-all to put them in the right-of-way wherever they want most of them look like it's a single pole sometimes i call it an ice box that's next to them a little uh actually there's one across the street right here uh and then it's got like a uh shriners cap on top of it as an example because so that's that's what it is any other questions for the city manager all right uh yes okay come up come up introduce yourself and speak into the mic can you get it on a record you mentioned the 16th street did you say the boat dock there you mentioned some of the other couple the uh seawall is going out to bid or it's out to bid right now there's a little what do you call that at the end of that street then the official act no there's there's a platform out there yeah the dock okay you're not doing anything with that no they will modify the sea wall and they'll have to adjust it the reason i ask is it used to be able you could pick somebody up on a boat there there was two steps going down that routed away that disappeared nobody fixed that there was a hinge system so you could you know it's got the room i know you could lift that up get on a boat go down the two steps the steps rotted away never got replaced the hinge system they put a solid board in there reinforced it and that's it are we doing anything with that or is anybody aware of that even no we're aware of it actually uh it didn't rot away it was hit by a boat well regardless the steps are gone yeah and they're they're gone that a boat hit it and knocked it loose uh we have projects for docks that's not the next one the next one is 7th street that we're going to is that somewhere on the list it will put it back to the way it right well we'll replace the dock over time the whole thing in a year down the road a couple years down the road probably a couple years it is yeah and we pulled that hinge thing out for what reason so you wouldn't go off there was a reason so you can't use it as my point right and it's been out of commission at least a year year and a half no i'm aware that somebody hit it with a boat yeah well as long as somebody's aware of it because i used to use that i can't use it anymore and as far as the ramp down here when are those piers going in i'm not i'm a little ignorant on that or or whatever we had there we're putting something back in there uh right now what is out to bid is the ramp and the sea wall there after that's finished then we we're in the process of getting quotes for the dock to be replaced so that's a waste of revenue no no it'll be this fiscal year okay thank you okay any other citizen questions for the city manager okay seeing none i'm going to close the city manager's report thank you city clerk um on my report the election that'll be ongoing through the month of march um the munico codifying i'm waiting for the proofs to come back from unicode so we can get those codified and then the public records request that then flowing ongoing and that's my report any questions for the city clerk which which many codes are still awaiting you pardon me

comments questions for the city clerk citizens any questions for the city clerk i'll close the city clerk report thank you patty okay we're going to the regular agenda we moved item nine off consent into regular uh this is a motion to approve the february 7th 2022 city council meeting minutes to have a motion please move by glenn gunn second second by dave gaddis comments starting with playing gun i'll defer okay are you different to me yes thank you um so i only had one change and patty uh you and i went over this i am prepared if you want to play the audio if we need to do that um the last comment on the notes here it said mayor manzo found council member in otero's point of order valid it should be not valid and that occurs at 54 minutes and 37 seconds of the audio tape and if the council wants to hear it i think i can pull it up on my phone or you can take my word because that's a pretty exact measurement there so um that was it other than that i find the minutes to be absolutely fine okay um mayor mantha i would have to listen to it and then you know just to want me to play it now if i had reception in here i can play it we don't have to play the whole tape we just need to start like it so i have my minute i have each just like you have it timed i have a time okay so i can go back so you can listen to it but yeah can we do it just like we did last time contingent on i have i have no problem with that and if you have and if you think i said something else then contact me privately and i'll i think i actually explained why i said no on that one so it came up afterward you'll see okay okay other than that i'm fine any other council discussion or comments citizen comments last word okay so with that change conditional upon patty finding what i found in terms of the the mistake in terms of the point of order um we'll vote on the approval of the february 7th 2022 city council meeting minutes all in favor to approve say aye aye and anyone opposed it's seven to zero patty and so they're approved conditionally with that change and you'll contact me if there's a problem yes thank you okay item 10. uh consideration a proposed park and recreation board event for april 30th 2022 this is a fly me to the moon frank sinatra rat pack style musical event funding is in the fy 2021-2022 board budget approved by the city council first let's start with a motion moved by glenn gunn in a second second by leslie and taro glenn i'll defer to parks and rec okay i think we have the parking direct chair here tammy lavender hey everyone how are you tammy lavender parker board chair um so i don't know if you just this event if you want to jazz in the park last fall will be very similarly set up it's just a different music style we're going to try to get a pizza truck you know all things italian that night and we're basically using for the budget what we use for the flyers last year because we don't have to mail out flyers this year because we have the sign out front so between um the website and the sign i think we'll be able to get the word out and with a few if you guys wanna want us to put this together so if you have any questions i believe you have the detailed budget sheet everything else because i know last year there were lots of issues about the parking and the safety and and it went flawlessly and we were going to follow the exact same plan uh council well tammy if you if you don't mind just staying up there if anyone has questions to you and then we'll debate it you can sit down but let's see if anybody has questions for you first while we have you here any questions for tammy frank last year um the jazz in the park how many attended that do you know sure yeah about a hundred 100 any added counters or you that not a fair question i guess out of towners mean like someone that wasn't a bellar beach resident um other than like my guest that i invited one person showed up that we were like we weren't sure we didn't ask but you know based on discussions that we've had in the past it was we're not inviting everyone in every neighborhood but if a couple of people show up we're definitely not going to kick them out it's it's i just would never do that so i understand that but when you put it on the sign out front then you have traffic especially this time of year yeah okay thank you sure any other questions for tammy before we debate uh yes i have something now when you put it on the sign then can't we just put a private bellar beach verbage in front of it so that just everybody driving down the street won't think it's an open public one and um yeah tammy there was a few people at the last one that came with other people though that lived here i i noticed like yes uh yeah so you know and granted you didn't kick them out but um i think we could probably put that on the sign as well and isn't there room for something like that yeah we can we can add something to the sign if we want to uh i don't think that's a big deal and actually i wouldn't think april 30th by that time the the snowbirds are gone and so we're not going to have the mob of traffic typically just counsel any other questions for tammy lavender tammy thank you we'll debate it now okay okay thank you now back to the council glenn you deferred so council it's open for comments and debate um i'm all for it i think it's a great idea i probably would not want to put that only private for bellaire beach because that seems very unwelcoming and even if that's the vibe i don't think that should necessarily be advertised it doesn't look good for the city when we're like us only so i just think it should be on there if out of town people come well then that's just what you do and more the merrier frank i i'm hoping to support this since if we're not going to put it i i like councilwoman schwab's idea with the private um i understand what your feelings are but then let's sell tickets to it since there's only 100 people that attended it and there's what 1 600 residents even if there's only two dollars a ticket all right that can keep it more private just my thoughts because she she does a fabulous job the beach cleanups and everything else she she is a gift to this city so i i commend her for everything yeah i'm gonna have to agree with both of you um robin i think it's just nasty to say no one else is about invited if someone happens to come we got room we're paying one price here so come on down it doesn't really matter it's not like we're going to have this isn't going to be woodstock and 100 000 people are going to show up frank though i'm with you i don't know you know we were involved with the original one this was you know the idea of having stuff in the city i think i floated back when we first started this uh this council here three years ago and we had some pushback from some citizens and some of the pushback we got was should we be using city money for this so the first event that we ran which was the biggest event that's been run probably in decades which was the city festival that city festival was complete completely self-sustaining in fact the city's festival made seventeen hundred dollars after all expenses were paid now what i'm seeing here and budget the way we did this because i remember it well on the council we said we didn't know how if we'd even get a a sponsor the first time so what we said was we're going to put money aside in the budget and if needed we'll sponsor it because the last thing we're going to do is tell everyone we're going to have a festival and then say well you know it's cancelled at the last second so we were able to get sponsors and it it was it was more than self-funding we made money um somehow along the line we went away from that model and now it's like the city is paying for all of this stuff and that's where i have a little bit of a problem okay i love the music of frank sinatra i saw frank sinatra 13 times when he was alive i saw him in three different states i'll go to this thing i'm sure it'll be wonderful okay and i'll pay five dollars or ten dollars or whatever it's going to be if that's what they're going to charge to people but i i don't know that we should be in the entertainment business here the budget should be the fallback if we can't get sponsors or we don't want to charge a ticket price um because we're just at this point i mean we're we were giving gift certificates as prizes at the halloween contest that's all coming out of taxpayer money and that's where i have a problem with it not the event they're they're done extremely well but the parks board did a great job on every single event that i've seen i wasn't a jazz but i saw the other one um and it was great but i didn't christmas lighting all that stuff was great but i don't think we should be using our city money unless it's a backup unless we can't get sponsors and i know you'd get sponsors for this if you worked at it that's all i want to say thank god this is an old budget decision so it was made when we created this budget so going back now to try to argue it is probably not worth the time and effort i would think that for next year's budget when we sit down and start thinking about this yeah let's go ahead and analyze a little further at the end of the day if only five people show up to this thing it's going to cost 1500.57 1557 right if 200 people show up it's going to cost 15.57 if 500 people show up it's going to cost maybe a little bit more but it's going to be a marginal cost 15 57. so i'm with robin let's let's be neighborly about this thing it's it's aimed at residents we're giving back to our residents and we can debate this the merits of this thing next in the next budget cycle but we've already made this decision let's let's continue to move forward we're making great progress and we've done great good with this uh park and rec board good job i support it thank you i i'd like to echo what mr gunn said we voted on this budget and i i don't really see a problem with funding this this event the last one was excellent everyone was relaxed it was a nice evening the sun was setting and uh great music and a great time to get to know our neighbors i didn't see uh i didn't see a lot of people coming in from outside and uh um i think looking back i think one of the reasons why we had the sponsors and the and uh brought in all the various vendors was because we were trying to make it more of a uh area-wide event instead of a baller beach event so i think that if we're smart with the way that we word the the verbiage on the side we can let people know it's really for our community but if you happen to be nearby and you do stop in we're not going to uh turn you away and that's uh that's it that's all i've got council any other comments open it up to the citizens well i'll just say real quick um you know i kind of like the idea of sponsors it may be a little bit too late in the game to do it now but maybe i would encourage for the next event to try to work on sponsors to try to be more financially neutral because i do remember way back and when we were starting events one of the biggest complaint from many council members was about the cost to the city and why should our city tax dollars go on for a festival or a halloween thing so i just want to remind the people that said that that they said that and they may change their mind and that's fine i'm just pointing out the the past comments so i would just say just to be smart financially going forward i mean if you can find a sponsor i'm sure the pizza truck the italian ice people would be happy to pay a nominal fee because they make way more money um than they paid so i don't see like you know you could probably get so many off of them so i think that for going forward the next event we should really think about trying to get some sponsorships but it may be too late right now for this one in a planning sense mayor just just to let you know the the park and rec board is working on a sponsorship package it's not totally completely yet but they are going to bring something to the console for the future perfect okay any other city council comments i'll now open up the citizens see no hands we'll come back to the city council and glenn you'll get the last word well i think we've covered all the merits of this thing i think it's good for the community and i'm all for it i support it we've done a great job with it thank you okay so what we have in front of us now is considered item number 10 consideration of proposed park and recreation board event for april 30th 2022. we've presented a budget of 1557. for this it's applied me to the moon rat pack style event uh yes vote is going to get this passed and move forward i'm going to do a voice vote on this all in favor hi hi anyone opposed 7-0 item 11 consideration of merit pay increase based on annual evaluation criteria for city manager submit increase based on the city council employee evaluations uh first aid motion gun second i'm sorry was that leslie no it's me akki babanaki sorry sorry i can't even see you from here i'm sure that's no problem it's the furniture here okay uh glengon numbers and evaluations are in the package unless there's some debate just to correct too patty had issued some replacement pages i know we got them everybody in the city has also had the opportunity to see the replacement scores and everything the pages the website yes okay good good any other council comments yes i would like to add something um i know it was very uh concerning to a number of people last year during the reviews and stuff that i was in violation of an ethics issue so i just want to let everybody in this community be fully aware so that your mind is clear that that was not one neither is this i've not only spoke to the ethics commission and been cleared i also have a personal attorney which was the chair of the ethics board and have been cleared former city attorney fred riley has cleared me the real estate board which doesn't need to clear me but they have cleared me my broker has cleared me there is no violation i just want everybody to know that up front that i have every legal right to do my responsibilities as a city council member and evaluate the city manager and grade him on his uh rating for his score counsel any other comments citizens comments back to counsel one last word the information's in the packet the evaluations are there the numbers are clear and i suggest you move forward and what we would be taught this isn't actually this isn't in the question so i'm going to add this to the question we're talking about a three percent raise that's what the numbers show correct everyone on council did i say that correctly if anybody if i didn't say that correctly say something okay so it's a three percent raise so i'm going to call the question with that in it then consideration of three percent merit pay increase based on the annual valuation criteria for the city manager that's based upon the evaluations that were in the packet i'm going to do this out of voice vote all in favor aye aye anyone opposed 7-0 congratulations mr reeves thank you thank you okay let's do it one more time for the city clerk here consideration of merit pay increase on based on annual evaluation criteria for the city clerk this is a merit increase based on the city council employee evaluations and patty i know you got the tables right for your raise that worked i'm just kidding that they were perfect for hers uh first in motion so moved moved by leslie notaro second in the second by dave gaddis leslie um i stand by what everybody said in their evaluations we're very lucky to have patty here morning yes speaking supposed to be working my bad is that better go ahead um did you hear it john or we need to repeat it yeah please leslie if you don't mind i just said i stand by everything that's in the evaluation we're very lucky to have patty here and she deserves it and again this would be for a three percent uh increased merit increase based upon the table and the scores any other council comments any citizen comments back to council leslie in a tarot net last word let's vote on it okay so this is a consideration of a three percent merit pay increase based on the annual evaluation for patty gentry for this last year again i'll do a voice vote yes vote we'll get that raise all in favor anyone opposed 7-0 patty congratulations thank you all very much thank you do we have any unfinished business council members um item 14. um hang on we're not on 14 yet i'm on 13. i'm sorry okay and i'll take 14 in order with uh i'll call the individuals so item 14 is unfinished business do we have anything mr reeves i have one thing and i don't i'm not going to make a you're going to know what i'm talking about okay remember we had a meeting about the water and easements okay that's still unfinished so i just want that not to be forgotten about i know fred reilly was working on it there was lots of questions but i don't want anybody to get all excited about it you and i and fred were looking back into the history of florida on that so um i just want to make sure it doesn't get lost on the radar no it it hasn't actually uh just before fred left we we had a discussion with uh an attorney uh from the homeowner's lawyer and uh he found some some things in it that that technically what they would have to do based on what fred told me and andy and i have talked about a little bit uh that they would have to go to fdep to get title to it if they want it what fdep's going to do we have no idea what they'll do right okay all right i just wanted to you're aware of it and andrew you're aware of it also okay thank you that's all i had did anybody else have any unfinished business um i'm a little confused here because 14 is supposed to be city council comments yeah we're on we're on unfinished business i'm not thirteen yeah but all right i don't know why there's a six page email information i i don't know why either but we're going to be addressing that momentarily so oh is that city is that city council business or is that unfinished we'll be addressing it momentarily let me get through 13 and we're going to bring 14 up and i'm going to be coming around to everybody on this council um so number 13 anybody else any other unfinished business none that's close now we're going on item 14. it's an odd month we start reverse alphabetically and we start with read a swope um yes i'm actually the one councilmember banker that put that in here um the reason why i did is i just feel like that this city and this council can come to some kind of a middle ground with everybody i mean that way we don't have things that happen like this it's just we need to come to the middle ground other than that i don't have anything else to add about it i am going to say that i am very excited that this chapter in my life is over and ending and more power to the new people that come in and i'm really looking forward to getting back to what i'm going to call the real world um so you know i hope you all enjoy yourselves get out and vote um it's coming up hopefully the candidates that have signs out there will get out and clean those up immediately afterwards so the city can look nice that's actually all i have to say so i'm glad my chapter is over leslie mataro no additional comments when gone i like the new reporting format i think it's really kind of move things along and the transparency before the meetings it's really kind of nice to get your thoughts in line so great job by the staff i think you've done a great job implementing the new report upon good job that's all and if you don't mind i i like it too does anybody have any comments on that real fast just so we have a little feedback the new reporting that's format i think it's working good it's smooth i like it good makes sense universal we actually agree on something that's great frank bancard well getting back to this six page i i don't know if it's an email or not that the councilwoman had put in but my name's mentioned in here at least 10 times and i think there's a history that needs to be cleared up here you have the floor i'm going to give the same um note to you that i gave to the citizens when they spoke we're not going to speak about any particular campaign and we're not going to attack any individuals but you can certainly speak about your actions and what you want to do on this well i want to enter this it's a little lengthy but i want to enter into the record and i have emails to back it up okay are you adding are you asking that this be entered word for word yes and i have it typed out here too patty loves you for that i'm sure okay so patty this is i can email you i can email it to patty too if she wants perfect if she's frank you have the floor go ahead okay there's a uh this is about light iron 14 uh city agenda this day about mr lusk on his hibiscus drive um there's little history here on february 6 last year i was out door-to-door campaigning for myself i met mr lost that day who spoke to me for about 20 minutes about the city primarily about his boating and marina which he has a boat slip after my election to council i further received an email from mr lusk which i want to quote you did all the right things to earn the most votes congrats frank last year at our council meeting in october discussing billy's it was stated by a council member because i brought up this the issues of buoys missing in belarus shores and ballard beach is now under scrutiny of improper marking on our buoys a member of council also noted which was sustained by another it is to their understanding that other neighboring towns also are under scrutiny because of my persistence on this matter first i want to clear that misleading statement up on march 3rd last week i attended and spoke to the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission fwc in tampa well i i will get more in depth at that meeting in this report i want to note i was told towns and cities that have buoys and markers marked idle speed no wake are not required to change their buoy markers because they are grandfathered in because these permits are perpetual the problem here according to fwc our city has to modify the perpetual permit which was granted last year which takes away from the grandfathering clause hence changing the current buoy language furthermore in october 2021 i received a call from mr lusk about the buoys possibly being changed in ballard beach because i raised issues with fwc i told mr lusk i was on vacation with my wife and he said can you give me a few moments mr nellowski and i went into a conversation lasting one hour and 44 minutes about him being a boater enjoying the rights to anchor his boat near the shoreline and go to his home and to attend personal business i asked mr lusk numerous times as my wife became increasingly angry to get back to mr lush but each request was followed by just a few more moments when mr loss said to me that boaters should be able to enjoy the ocean and golf anywhere they want and those that want to swim should go to lakes i knew my time was being wasted and i told him i needed to get back to my wife but noted i would send him documentation requiring permits etc i further agreed to meet with him later if he wished to discuss this matter the meeting at maggie mays the following week was another one and three quarter hours long after the first 30 minutes i told mr les just we just have a difference of opinion and you're holding me to actions which occurred a year before i sat on council and proceeded to get up and leave mr lusk then said so you're going to leave and not hear me out i said again last week and today it seems it's the same position although our out of courtesy and being a council member i stayed for another hour and a quarter but when two women told us we were disturbing their breakfast i said we needed to end this and wish mr luck's a good day that then followed by two more phone calls and text messages i further provided mr lusk recent boating incidents of swimmers and bathers being hit in florida which he replied they are not in bellar beach hopefully these past events clearly illustrated that have fulfilled my oath in representing and hearing out a constituent by nearly spending four hours on one subject not to mention time for research and providing it to him now under mr lut's fabricated falsehoods specifically relating to me so noted in section 14 of the minutes tonight one mr lusk remarks of my door-to-door campaigning with fire personnel at pinellas county on february 16 2022 the time of day was 10 a.m not 9 00 am as mr mistakenly cites the firemen who were out campaigning for the mayor never showed on show to campaign until 9 30 a.m because they had a call out at 3 a.m which lengthened their shift the firemen who i was with parked his truck towards the end of howard on the water side of hibiscus not in front of mr last house as mistakenly cited in the email i wore no hooded sweatshirt ever going door-to-door campaigning and especially not that day the fireman who was out supporting did his sh did have his shelter dog with him who he takes to the fire company well i did go to mr lusk house knocked on his door no answer was received and i left the flyer at his door i want to know while i spent an ample amount of time last year at mr lust's house his home did not resonate to me that it was his home while door-to-door i further knocked on about 700 doors the previous year as well simply i do not earmark a person's home while proceeding south on his biscuits i did notice mr lusk waving his arms and hands at me in the street which i weighed back but continued door to door after completing our door-to-door the fireman and i went back to his vehicle to go to our next destination mr les was still on the street when we walked by and was on the phone and said frank i need to talk to you the firemen and i stood and bill continued to talk on the phone i then said after about one minute what do you want mr lusk replied can't you see i'm on the phone and you will have to wait until i'm done i then said good day and proceeded to walk away which followed mr lusk putting the phone down and saying i was rude for not letting him complete his call mr lesson then said frank a number of elderly residents are scared when people knock on their doors and i'm asking you not to do this i said bill a year ago you were thrilled with door-to-door campaigning if anyone does not want to answer they don't and i never spend more than one minute at any home when there is no answer mr really said frank let me talk i said bill you only want to delay my work here have a nice day and we proceeded down the street and got into the fireman's truck mr lust so notes that i filed a police report on february 16th on this matter in those minutes i have not filed any police report on that day or my entire tenure in this city mr royal supplies that he is a spokesman for the elderly and expects others to follow his direction mr nusk is not an elected official of this city if he desires to represent the elderly or anyone else he should seek elected office finally mr west contacted me by email on january 25th 2022 or 22 days earlier from the february 16th issue after i blind copied him and many other residents about a city matter regarding beach umbrellas he replied he did not want to receive further email communications campaigning lobbying and or communications from me anymore he further claimed my attempt to bring back shade was a rogue attempt i responded so no further communication occurs and i don't want to inadvertently send him another please block my email that proceeded by his assistant then contacted me then an irate call from mr lesk who said loudly i don't want any further communications from you and hung up the phone while mr lusk asked our city four questions in that email who only god would know the answers and not our city matters job or duties he ends his email to our city manager what has happened to our beautiful city i believe our city is as beautiful as the day i moved into it is my belief that my first amendment rights and decisions by the supreme court give me a right to campaign door-to-door which i have done for over 40 years the campaign season i've this campaign season i've spoken to supporters on both sides of the fence not one was irate or employee it is very peculiar mr west 22 days prior to february 16 unequivocally demanding no further communications to him by me but stood in the street waiting for me while i am the councilman of the city i will represent all citizens although expecting me to stand in the street until he finished a call legitimate or not is completely disrespectful and in his word rogue attempt to delay my business more importantly to waste a fireman's time who has been out since 3am serving this county is disheartening possibly his questions can be answered by looking into a mirror in his own home right thank you and i have the emails of this history i want to present the patty back okay you want that included in our stuff okay so patty that's a included to be included in the next set of minutes yes okay you can do that afterwards that's fine and just to follow up on my fwc meeting um when i was talking to them about the billy issues uh the chairman actually had a bill walton take me out and another gentleman believe their attorney and they said here's the issue you put in for a permit amendment which now has to have the buoy's names changed i said does it and he says yes and that's when we got into the perpetual permits of other cities not even being addressed i contacted fwc last year they said they never run to any city on this side of the gulf okay to have their buoys changed so that was a misstatement by this council when they threw it out to me last year i also said so because we amended the permit buoys now have to be changed he said yes i said well i have three emails which i gave their secretary stating what language do you want on these buoys in may of 2020. each one said idle speed no wake and that goes back to 219 2019. attorney then said well that's the problem we will take this back to tallahassee and get back to you i don't expect anything in return but i'm going to keep filing as frank banker's citizen more appeals with that's all i have to do thank you frank robin hockey now just before we go to me i just want it for frank spain i mean um i can attest he wasn't wearing a hood because i just looked at my ring remember i talked to you my ring when you running the diploid belt he didn't have a hood on so i have a video if anyone wants to see it so he wasn't wearing a hoodie just a sweatshirt so i can confirm that by video when i talked to him to say i wasn't home and sorry but thank you um as far as my comments um i don't really have any comments i say good luck to all the candidates um it doesn't matter who you vote for the most important thing about this election is to vote doesn't matter who just vote that's the best thing you could do for yourself your country your city is to to vote so i just encourage everybody to please vote thank you dave gaddis i think that this is our unless we have an emergency meeting this will be our last council meeting in this format um don't know who's staying who's uh who's leaving but it's been an honor to serve with each and every one of you and uh definitely it's been a rewarding three years i've learned much about the city and and i've also learned much about each and every one of you i wish all the candidates the best of luck i also would like to encourage everyone if you've not voted please do so and we'll see you on march the 15th thank you dave frank i want to first address the pack this item 14 that was placed in here um i did not file that police report i was home and the reason why i was home through a lot of this election was so that these events didn't happen directly with me um the reason why firemen were going around with campaign workers was so that there was protection okay um the final straw the final straw and i'm not gonna embarrass the person because that person is here today i'm not even gonna say the person sex but there was a person who was screaming it wasn't bill lusk okay this was different this was a different street at two of my campaign workers saying did you see this did you see that just jawboning no one in this city should have to go through that had i been there i would have got my telephone out and recorded it and you would have been facing a criminal harassment charge that is harassment you don't do that you want a campaign you can knock on doors you can knock on the door right after we get done if you want people have done that but you can't be doing this to people you can't be doing this around the city and in terms of whose house you can go to anyone who's campaigning anyone for anything by the way president vice president uh congress whatever you go to any house you want if a person asks you to leave you have to leave that's it they have no right whatsoever to tell you not to go to someone else's house that's none of their damn business and it happened several times and that's why a report was filed if it happens again it'll be more than a report it'll be a full complaint not going to tolerate it for anybody and that would go if if my opponent was going through it i wouldn't tolerate for him i would never stand for that so i applaud everyone who's campaigned and put their hat in the ring here i'm gonna me and dave may not agree on everything but one thing i do agree on it's been an honor to serve on this is our last meeting unless there's an emergency of this council i think as a whole we may have had issues where we agreed and disagreed but i think one thing we can all agree where we leave bel air beach now three years ago we are in a much better place than where we were three years ago we've helped this city i'm proud of the work i've done i think everybody else on this council should be proud of the work that they did and i echo what others have said it's your right to pick your your people who are going to serve you and the election is march 15th so whomever you vote for exercise your vote and exercise it carefully it's been an absolute honor to do this i think i speak for everyone on this council it's been our honor to serve you in this council so with that i'm going to ask for an emotion to adjourn so move in a second all in favor all right thank you everyone"
