    "transcript": "welcome to the december 7th uh work session of the city council of the city of bellar beach please rise and join me in the pledge of allegiance i pledge allegiance to apply the united states of america to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all could you please call the role council member robin ockey here councilmember marv bean council member jody shirley here vice mayor glenn gunn here mayor joseph manzo city manager lynn reeves here city attorney fred riley and council member dave gaddis and council member rita swope are not present okay thank you okay i called this with regard to the ongoing sixth street angle boulevard protest they've been going for 115 days the city and the uh and the sheriff have thus far been able unable to bring any relief to the individuals that live there so i'm not going to read every point in the agenda but i am going to go over it factually and then i'm going to open it up for discussion on the floor as to what the council may wish to do about it i'm not going to spend a lot of time on the facts because we each got a packet and it was published that contained most of the paperwork but i think there are some things that are worth mentioning um this started july 22nd and it has went non-stop to election day there was a few days missed because of inclement weather um and it seems like then the other days went longer to make up for it then it remained we were told it was going to stop and it resumed again on november 27th played the tape last time of approximately five minutes of what normally is an hour to an hour and a half of non-stop horn hockey um it's illegal to have horns okay to support anything as ravanaki said i love my chihuahua i support blue go green bay packers it doesn't matter okay it's supposed to be a quiet neighborhood so it's illegal it's illegal under state law which everybody got a copy it's illegal under city ordinance okay it's number one thing in our noise ordnance and to booth i found out today that's also illegal under the county ordinances so we got three legal um statutes that prohibit horn haunting for no good reason a good reason is you're about to get in a crash or someone's in the road or something like that bad reason is i'm supportive of your cause by the way this has nothing to do with the clause i voted for donald trump and i had a sheriff goldie sign of my house so people are doing this for my benefit preaching to the choir i'm already on your team but this has been going and i gave some of the uh emails that people have sent around which has some real bad misinformation it's only one person that's complaining it's eight people who are complaining in five different families and thanks to the social media response that happened in the past some people are too afraid to even come forward so it's affecting several people certainly if you live 50 feet away and you're having corn blowing it's waking you up it's creating severe emotional distress it stopped us now excuse me the way this works okay this works let me just explain this this is a work session and this is for the council to discuss but we do have a park usually as long as council agrees where we open it up to the citizens we don't have to but we've always opened it up to the citizens that will come later okay so and i will ask at that at that point okay you have to keep the masks on it's it's the city's rule um so back to what i was saying this this this noise okay it doesn't go away stopped us from homeschooling our grandchild it's interfering with my business it's interfering with there's a person who lives on the southeast corner is ready to move they can't sleep okay this is how it's affecting people okay it's not that people don't support the cause if we were handing out leaflets if we wanted to do a demonstrate a presentation in city hall jody shirley's sitting here saying she's going to have a luncheon this is all good stuff i'm the reason why i have extra police i'm the one who proposed that so we support the police but this is creating a rift with the police police have asked these individuals to stop they have not the complaint was filed against two of the deputies last week who asked them nicely to stop they filed complaints against them this is not appropriate they're trying to come up with an amicable solution so now i see they're spending one of them standing across the street in bel air shore so now we're involving another city city that i happen to be in personal litigation with that's not good okay our city our city manager i witnessed the day that he came out and spoke and made a little bit of difference um but it didn't stop it so that didn't work we didn't we had the sheriff we could have used the sheriff to chase after these violators who were beeping these horns we didn't use it sheriff has been called multiple times has never to my knowledge stopped a single car that is not law enforcement that's ignoring ignoring the problem and i've stood out there and watched the sheriff as they beep right in front of them and drive away with impunity violating our villains now it may seem fun and i'll tell you how much fun it is person unbeknownst to the people who are doing this asked them last week what are you doing what are you doing quote we're here pissing off the mayor that person will testify to that for me so you're here pissing off the mayor you're pissing off eight other families you're pissing off the police you're pissing off the whole city you're also pissing away our noise ordinance because if the police can't enforce the noise ordinance for corn honking you can't enforce the noise ordinance for working on sunday and you can't enforce it for loud music because if you do some attorney is going to slap the city with an equal rights protection case so there's a lot more at stake here than pissing off the mayor who never by the way did a thing to these people don't even know until they moved here so the problem for our city and i had been working with fred riley when i was allowed to back three or four days after this started because i kind of sensed something was wrong here you don't protest on sixth street where there's nothing there's nothing there there's no municipal building there's there's no one there there's houses it's a residential area and our city doesn't have ordinances like some cities that say you can't target protest people you can't go outside their house and protest so we don't have that other cities like winter haven and stuff winter park i'm sorry have those codes some of this stuff has went all the way to the u.s supreme court and been authorized so one of the fred riley has given us a lot of options but some of the stuff is adopting some type of a code that says you can't stand outside people's houses in protest you know you want people to beat horns outside your house you want to play a drum at midnight you want to have 20 people outside your house we're not going to speak to that level yet but if it has to happen and the city doesn't want to do anything well that might happen we have no ordinances we've had no enforcement for over 100 days um it's quiet before these folks come out in the morning it's quiet when they go away one of the sheriffs actually tried to convince me that these people may be beeping at emergencies well stand there before and stand there after and see how many horns you hear honking you'll hear none it's not a light there's not people falling asleep or doing anything wrong it just happens when they're out there i got it the people support them 115 days folks 115 days you know i remember when we had the festival last year we had a room full of people here all targeted all from us one particular area pretty much and they said well you can't make noise we're gonna have three hours worth of noise in a festival frank banker says the city is a quiet peaceful place what are we doing having a festival yeah people were gonna have fun for three hours well we had that festival and it was so quiet that somebody said the music was so low that you couldn't hear that's how quiet the festival was three hours was bothering frank banker but i don't see any comments now from anybody that it's bothering them i got it if you live on the other side of town you don't hear it but we could this could be brought to anybody look at leslie mataro i know you own condos on golfboard if you like this well leslie detero gets it leslie doterra wrote that the police should be chasing after the people who are doing the beeping leslie i agree with you 100 okay that's what you posted it's in our book so the purpose of tonight isn't to discuss the merits of the cause again i agree with your cause and if you were handing out leaflets or you were volunteering with the police i'd assist you i would introduce you to every police chief that i know but and they could use your help by the way st petersburg they want your help our sheriff wants you to stop the citizens would like you to stop we live there it's quiet i work from the house i'm on with courts and i have to explain why there's horns beeping in the background i'm asking you nicely i'm looking right at you and asking you nicely please stop there's better ways to make your point and the first amendment is not an absolute thing there are restrictions you can't light yell fire in a crowded movie theater there is a limit and if you're going to make noise for 150 days 200 plus hours in a residential neighborhood i think you've exceeded the limit there's been supreme court case of late holding protesters liable i don't want to go down this road i'm asking you nicely stop all of this because now our city has to react we have to ask why the sheriff is not enforcing the law this isn't helping anything i'm asking you to help to stop i really am my neighbor asked you to stop too stopped for a day went right back and you told her it was going to go on quote forever forever folks this will be our cultural attraction so yes joey i'm going to go right to you unfinished basically so i'm asking right now i'm going to turn it over to council to see fred reilly has given a number of suggestions maybe mr riley wishes to speak to see where do we go from here what do we do next um to stop something that has been foreign to our city for so far and is disturbing the culture of our city and disturbing the city itself there's just no place for bellar beach to have this one day sure i'll go out with you two days sure 115 days yeah tony sure yeah i just in an effort to kind of move this along i i guess i'm curious what the intended outcome of this is because i don't know how we can as a council or a city enforce anything there's we might be able to put in some a code in place similar to that in winter park but that says you can't be within 50 feet of the facility that you're picketing in front of or and they're not within 50 feet of your home you're you're suggesting that this is a uh one some one email i got uh your accusation was that this is retaliation against you in june because you filed uh suits against cities and council members and you know if that's if that's your feel and your intent is to move forward with something along those lines i can't be a party of it because you've named me in that suit so you know you guys have kind of drawn a line there you say that they're trying to piss off the mayor i don't believe that that's the case your one of your words was a beat well that beat doesn't sound too offensive to me i know at my house i have a neighbor who pressure washes 24 7. it seems like and i go in my house and close the windows and close the doors and uh turn on the music so i can't hear it and i'm okay with that so um you know i don't i don't know what i don't know what we can do and what your intended outcome is if there is if we're moving this forward to some sort of um new code presenting a code that will eliminate it but i don't know how we can and we can't step on someone's civil rights so i don't know how i don't know what the purpose of this meeting is well the purpose is what i had said here let me correct just one or two things first of all i'm not suing anybody in this city okay that's a faucet from juventus but secondly it's interesting that he got a memo that i only sent to lynn reeves that was not sent to council so i'd love to know how that got to jimmy shirley it was on one of your original all of the these the papers that i received an early on cover sheet said that and it was sent to all it was count sent to every council somebody sent it to council i sent that to liber reeves but anyway that aside um what are we trying to accomplish okay first of all it's not a beep i play the tape if you'd like i will play of a serenade of horns we played last time i think everybody got tired of it after two minutes we've been going through 150 hours of it so um it's not funny okay some people think it's funny but it's not funny okay and you may very well wind up being liable it's not funny okay so it's very serious and what are we gonna do as a council well we've got a couple things working over here the response or lack that thereof of the police is something that we have to talk about i think number two is what do we do as a council the city of winter park ordinance talks about targeted protesting i can't get the police to come out and deal with cars that are beeping horns in the middle of a road let alone trying to explain to a targeted protesting which must be about 150 pages of legal documents that have been collected so far um that's not going to work okay the case and fred reilly found this case so i'm going to give him full credit it's called frisbee vs schultz it went to the u.s supreme court that's the case to use it basically says you can't protest within 50 feet of a person's house period that's it it's already been approved it's brookline wisconsin they're still using it i pulled up their mini code the other day and we can put something similar and that stops people from being in front of anyone's house having a protest right now it's funny because it's the mayor but next time it's not going to be the mayor it's going to be somebody else it could be a doctor it could be a lawyer it could be anybody in this it would be a plumber it could be anyone in the city who's getting a protest in front of their house i mean how long is too much okay 115 days an hour a day what i told you and i have never lied to this counselor to this city is a direct quote from my neighbor they're willing to swear they're willing to come in and appear in court for me so that's the strength of that i was not there i was in the area when it happened so take it for what it's worth okay there's plenty of other documents i'm not going to go through them tonight about posts that were made by one of the protesters so i've got the information okay i'm trying to come up with an applicable solution as where the police have got the complaints filed against so tonight the question is as a city our noise ordinance is not being enforced folks okay that sits well with everybody and we can go home and catch monday night football okay um if the police have refused to enforce it i disagree with vice mayor gunn so where do we go that's the question well i know for a fact that the police do enforce uh loud reoccurring horn honking because my daughter got pulled over when her car had a faulty issue and the horn was sounding and she got pulled over there was more to make sure she was okay but it was loud and noxious and they pulled her over very easy to track who's whose car it was i can see you know if i'm going down the street and i took the horn and i get pulled over it's my right to to the horn i mean that is it there's no this i believe this code that we have in here has a it's referencing a um it says unnecessary excessive use of the horn and i don't think a tap top on the horn is unnecessary is an unnecessary excessive you play the tape right i mean it was not a tap tap on the horn there's air horns that you could hear down the block okay and that's why my point is i don't know how we can overcome this is my point i don't know that and then the other reasons that i just stated i don't know how i can be part of this meeting because even if we come up with a solution it's been brought in front of us that you know this is retaliation well you know if it's if it's all about the lawsuit retaliation i can't even be sitting here i need to i probably need to excuse myself right now anyone else to me it's a work session i think we can all agree that the cause what they're supporting is not the issue like i said if they're supporting their love of chihuahuas then that's fine too so that aside because everyone keeps bringing that up that oh i support the police it's not that so we all support the police i think the issue is the longevity and the permanence of the location now i've had heard in the past that was because the couple was elderly it was close to their house and it was difficult for them to walk farther to the other side of the block and i said well you know being a physician i can counteract that because if they can walk three houses to the block they can walk into the driver into the car to another location get out and probably walk less i don't i don't understand why this is going on so long i i'll be honest i mean if this was done in front of my house for this long i would be annoyed as well whether i was home or not just my neighbors i'd be annoyed for my neighbors at our home that don't work i don't know how to solve this i i don't think pushing these sheriffs to pull over every car that did two beeps because technically excessive now they were going down three blocks holding their horn to me that's excessive a little bit to support is not excessive so i can't i ca i see both sides so i think the main bottom line and maybe something we need to work on and come to a middle point for both parties is why there and only there and at those times and can we do something like i think in the past we said okay well you know you're not allowed to park on the street can we give them a special one day a week you know you're allowed to park on whatever street you want for an hour to support your cause and of course if anybody else wants to do the same thing then we'd have to grant them that right and then that could become a problem if 50 different causes are happening but i guess i'd like to hear why from the party and find out what and why now why suddenly now and why can't your time which i i appreciate you're putting the time into this cause but maybe that your time could be used in a more constructive manner supporting the police like volunteering or helping or going to other areas i remember during the election there was on seminole and east bay there was people out there with signs and you get way more traffic there to get your point across and you get way more horns and there's not residential right there and i'm pretty sure they're used to horn honking so they're probably not going to complain that there are so i guess my bottom line is is the underlying cause the retaliation i'm not saying it is i mean is that it if that's and i'm not saying that's the case i don't know because i'm not them if that's the case then dude we have other issues we gotta work on i mean and then i'm gonna go back to my quotes from past like now we're getting into grade school kind of uh behavior here with retaliation so i'm not gonna be down with that but i wanna know the lie i'm not on either anyone's side i just want to know the basic facts and the why if this is going on this is going on so long and why we haven't been able to come to a resolution amicably robin let me give you two pieces of information because jody shirley unintentionally i'm sure misstated the law okay the the state law says you're not to use your and i've given you a copy of this not to use your horn other than a to sound a a for a warning to other motorists it's not okay believe it or not to just give two taps of horn to your neighbor these people aren't given two taps they're given five ten taps they're leaning on the horn from sixth street to seventh street and beyond sometimes so that's the first thing and it's never allowable it's not allowable under the county code it's not allowable in the power code if anybody thought it was allowable i have a first amendment right to beat horns well you do you got to do it up in portland now we all have seen what's going on in portland okay it's lawlessness but portland you're allowed to beat warrens they don't care however in pinellas county the sixth circuit court of appeals has ruled on this very issue two police actually did give tickets to protesters and doctor protesters to two cars supporting a protester and it went to the all the way up to the appellate division and their argument the people who beat the horns argument was we got first amendment right we were supporting them judge said no you don't you don't have that right because the state law prohibits it forget about our law you don't even need ours use the state law it's prohibited so you're not allowed to do it okay and what happened they got fined okay so and it it's not like there's thousands of cars coming by there's times that there's only one car coming by so there's no question who made to be who they deform and who's there's no one in front of you there's no accident imminent or anything like that again if you come out they start usually around nine o'clock if you come in at 8 45 you can hear the birds chirping then all hell breaks loose for an hour to an hour 15 minutes and then it quiets down again for the rest of the day once in a great while you might get a horn because somebody's maybe not paying attention in the crosswalk or something but other than that there's not much it's quiet even though it's called boulevard so you know that's the situation and i'm repeating again what was said so yeah i would like to know the why too because i never knew these people until this thing started i never did anything to them and if i did do something to you my telephone number is on the city website call me and tell me what i did to you i'll be happy to call you i'm a reasonable person but when you disrupt our lives and torture us for 150 days i have to take action if i have to to make it stop this cannot be a permanent part of better culture mark b well supporting the police is fine we supported the sheriff until he got elected and maybe a couple days after but at this point everybody loses the sheriff loses as he's in the middle of the position every one of us on his council lose because it's a very hard decision to make so the situation is forcing us to do something but in the end everybody loses why carry it this far 115 days or 150 days or even 50 days makes no sense i support the police but we've got to do it in a manner that is fair to everybody this is not fair to the city it's not part of the residents it's not fair to lynn reed's it's not fair to the attorney it's not fair to the anybody anybody of any of the residents sitting here it's not fair for them to go through this so um there's points mayor you made that are very strong they're within the law i understand your position um but i don't feel sorry for the horn honking the only thing i'm going to say now is if we have to do something how is this winter park code gonna help us out and i'd like to hear from fred and fred if i could just add on to that consider also the frisbee because what i had said i think frisbee is more beneficial to us in our situation um months months ago when this all arose i was looked at how you know how can you solve the problem one of the things that became obvious to me immediately is that the city does not have a code provision that relates to targeted protests so that wasn't available i researched it further and found the code provision that mayor manzo's reference in winter park and basically what was happening in winter park that led to them putting in an ordinance is that doctors were being protested against due to the type of their medical practice and there was a concentration of doctors and that the city put in this uh and it was a very well written ordinance that uh put in time reasonable time place and manner restrictions of related to somebody exercising their constitutional rights the case that has been referenced further evaluated that ordinance and determined that those reasonable time place and manner restrictions were in fact constitutional so for purposes of considering a measure that could be taken here that is a good example because you have a shining example that has already passed constitutional muster so from from the standpoint of should you consider something like that i think it is something that you you should consider because you you have some certainty if you go through the steps to put that in place robin i also wanted to just give you something i forgot to also piece of information okay this suggestion that the individuals are infirmed okay i've had a long time to watch their uh their actions and i was out there last sunday waiting absolutely for the police to come they never came um i wanted to speak with them but um afterward uh the um the lady came over to me and confronted me now i was standing about 100 feet away on private property she came up to me spoke with me not too nicely but spoke with me um started off the conversation with what's your problem which is the way we pick fights in new jersey where i come from you know so that's the way it started luckily there was no fighting site kept my cool and she and her husband proceeded to walk all the way down my block some eight or ten houses so probably 600 feet 700 feet turned around walked all the way back walked all the way back to gulf boulevard and went back to their houses on 6th street now i do know that mr purcell a little bit slower okay he's 78 but i hope i do as well when i'm 78 as you folks are doing mrs purcell i don't know if i can make it down the block as well as she did okay very good health and now she's across the street doing this at bellar shore further complicating an already messy situation and i saw the city clerk from bellar she were visiting her on sunday folks we're watching and all of this stuff is going to be coming out good night first off i wasn't saying they were infer this is just what was told to me at one of our virtual work sessions when this was brought up and so you know i said that that's correct that was told to us that was successful okay i've never met you guys so i have no idea sorry um so what i i totally agree with mark being i mean there's no winner i mean if you think about your actions not just the support for the sheriff and if anything i don't think it actually does if you look at it support the sheriff because now they're using more resources or more time on this issue maybe trying to stop drivers from honking instead of stopping the driver from speeding which is more of a detriment to our city so and it puts them in a bad situation because they're over here dealing with this when maybe they should be stopping the guy who's looking at breaking into the house over there so i don't think it's helping the police we talk about all the time since i got on this council of the premier community the premier community the premier community bellar beach a quiet community this doesn't seem to me like a premier quiet community with all of this raucous going on um if we do get the sheriffs to start pulling over people for honking think about how that's going to make you feel that your supporters are now getting ticketed they're not going to be too happy with you or the cause and maybe they're going to negatively associate that with support the blue knowing that we always are talking about finances in this city and we always try to pinch every penny because we don't have as many opinions as we like so think about the amount of money this issue has been costing the city with fred reilly having to research this with having to speak to the manager and speak to the the people in question so if this is truly and again i don't know a targeted protest i would say this isn't benefiting anybody not the police not the city not our coffers nothing so it seems like this is more of a personal gain and again i don't know yes i don't know if it is i'm just making my observation from being a listener but i will tell you that if i go to your house nine o'clock at night eight o'clock a night hell even two o'clock at night and honk my horn for an hour i'm pretty sure he would probably not be a big fan of me at that time so i'm just saying take that into consideration in my life and i tell my kids you know if you're thinking about doing something to mean to someone think about how you feel if it was done to you first and i'm just saying put it you know i used to work the night shift so i understand the noise so it somebody comes over to your house and hops all night or just for an hour and 15 minutes every day for 115 days while you're trying to sleep you probably won't be happy so i'm just saying when we do these actions and not just this just in the world in general let's start thinking about how it affects other people and if it's a negative effect then maybe we should re think about what our motives are that's it that's my mom talking tonight sorry hang on one second i'm gonna i'm gonna see if yes give me one second i have to first get permission of counsel before i open it up to the floor give me one minute okay what's up i understand i have to get permission of counsel the citizens don't normally have an opportunity to speak i recognize you let me get permission and then you'll be heard when you speak you're going to come up here and speak into the mic you're going to give your name and address okay counsel do we do we have mark you want to have something to say and then i'll see if we want to open it up here just one thing i want to ask lynn do you have any idea what the cost total cost has been just rough around the corner no i can tell you that there's been numerous police calls by miss van scoy and the mayor to the other and other individuals the time frames on that i don't have all the police reports on that uh i can ask the sheriff forum uh i know fred spent time on it i've spent time on it uh you know it's it's you know well you're you're talking not only money but valuable time that both of you and everybody else needs to put their energy elsewhere not just with this continuing saga going on it just totally doesn't make any sense i don't get it mark when you want to talk about time money that's professional time mr purcell used to be a doctor i came home from the hospital i had a very serious procedure i was recovering in my bed and you all woke me up that morning okay i i i will tell you the day i don't have it with me okay it was in september so you woke me up okay you're a doctor do no harm counsel i think at this point before we go to what we might want to do there may be people in the audience that wish to speak and perhaps they can maybe even stop this depending on if we've impressed anything um to anyone so i'm gonna ask if it's okay to open up the floor for uh comments any mr owen before you do that i i would like to say a few things absolutely but can we just do we have that okay once mr riley finishes yes okay we have consensus gonna mr you can't interrupt us okay this is a formal session if you want to speak i talked about the decorum we don't scream from the seats mr raleigh i'm sorry i'm following the decorum and the decorum i followed at this meeting this work session is um to sit here patiently and give all the members of the council an opportunity to discuss this and i've answered a question that council member beam asked me i don't want to preempt vice mayor gunn so if he wanted to say some things i will gladly wait till he's made some comments but there are several comments i would like to make i'll save my comments for after statement for after okay so go ahead mr elliott you're on the floor great um and folks this is a work session i know this is kind of formal tonight but it's a work session so we speak up okay because i am going to be exceptionally deliberate in what i do um i have worked on trying to solve this problem for months i have done everything that i in uh in my capacity as a city attorney i could do to try and solve this problem i have last couple weeks spent considerable time on trying to solve the problem last week i spoke with the general counsel from the sheriff's department and i sent this after that discussion with her sent a email to the city council members that explained the the general counsel's position on the issue and her position in a nutshell is that it's they they take the position that the sheriff's department is won properly enforcing the law and two they are complying with the terms of the contract with the city that's that's their position the if you want a suggestion from me about a specific action that you can take it is consider a winter park style ordinance having said that the under constitutional law the a sidewalk is a public forum and a citizen has a constitutional right to stand in a public's forum and hold a sign okay so the um there's plenty plenty of cases that relate to time place and manner restrictions on somebody's constitutional rights and one of the things that that i have never been in favor of in the time that i've served in in my capacity the city attorney for this city is putting you in a position so that you become a great test case in federal court where you spend an inordinate amount of money defending anything this this is a city that should not if we can help it be in those types of situations and i have gone to great lengths whether anybody in this room believes it or not to try and make sure we are not in that position okay so having said that i i will come back to something that that mayor manzo stated and several of you have have said a version of it and that is that there needs to be an amicable solution to this problem and an amicable solution is easy it's called reasonable people acting in a reasonable manner to solve a problem and you know dr ockey referenced uh being back in grade school we're not in grade school we're we're citizens of a community um i i live in a you know um a little less desirable uh community across the bridge called bel air so every time i come over the um the bridge i look at this beautiful city that i'm at the uh honor to be the city attorney for and what a fantastic slice of paradise that you have here and my my suggestion is uh similar to what the mayor has suggested and two of the council members i don't vice mayor gunn hasn't spoken yet but i feel confident he would would have the same sentiment that this is a time where uh the appropriate thing is for reasonable people to do reasonable things to solve a problem and if that doesn't work then my suggestion to you as a council is to consider a winter park type uh ordinance and go through the steps to put it in place and then enforce it those are my comments thank you mr riley any other council comments before i open it up to the citizens i just want to say thank you to fred for all he does for our city and keeping us out of trouble and representing us with uh definitely respect and grace i appreciate it second and to tell you the character of this guy okay this attorney who i admire and i don't admire a lot of attorneys but i admire you this guy has spent a ton of time and you will never see it on his building statement he has called me on sunday mornings we have been discussing this thing since two or three days after it started because i kind of sensed there was something not right here and he and i have been discussing it and we have been when we were able to work together we were working together giving each other cases and information and um and trying to help each other with the research and stuff um fred no one could have said it better reasonable people acting in a reasonable manner it's christmas time trying to get work done i just became a grandfather i haven't even had a chance to talk to my daughter because i've been spending every night doing legal research on this topic i'm not doing that for necessarily the city folks so please let's let's straighten this thing out now before it escalates into something that no one's gonna lie everyone loses more than saying i'm gonna open up for the citizens mr purcell you have your hands up now it's three minutes you come here and you speak from here no you no we can't hear you and you have to be up here so that's that's what it's going to be or you can speak well i don't want robin you can move okay you can speak over here speak at that right these things are very unsensitive so you have to be like an inch away okay first of all take your name first object to being called a protester i'm not objecting to anything we are supporting the law enforcement officers and retaliation was mentioned what do we have to retaliate for the only person that's been harassing is the mayor who sent police officers to our home mrs micelle i'm going to stop you right now would you like her to speak up because she's you guys come on that's why you're getting sued guys calm down walk out go ahead sue joe just stop both of you this is ridiculous i would say a word to her joe stop i'm not gonna stand for this stop come on guys you guys come on my kids act better to send anyone to your house now speak let her speakers get to the moment officers who said they would have to start finding us daily for having political signs in our yard you come out when we're on the street with your camera get within three or four feet of us stick it in our face take pictures of us sit up on your balcony take pictures of us all day you're not working i am working mrs purcell wait just something you're not working with a camera standing out on the street corner over there for one hour a day it's not constant honking and no one has complained to us well maybe three people at the most the whole time we've been out there mostly we get support from people you have never come out to speak to us you just hopped past us taking pictures and saying i have every right to get out here it's a public sidewalk so you haven't drugged us off anything are you are you done speaking well first off i just want to do a referee for a second i just want to say that i think fred can back me up technically you're not supposed to address anybody directly while you're giving your three minutes so that's why he was trying to stop you but i think we let you because this is a different kind of issue and we need to find the facts and the why so just for future if you ever come to another meeting you can't directly talk to somebody accusatory or not you have to talk to the council as a whole so that's why he's interrupting you just so you know because those are the rules and usually we cut you off but i want to know the why that's all we haven't heard the why we heard accusations against me i was 100 feet away from you i have a 300 millimeter telephoto lens i don't have to get by you i did try to walk by you the other day you did not move from the sidewalk i walked by you i went to the next corner and took more pictures i can't even take pictures from three feet away with the lens that i have it won't focus why am i doing it and you're saying i'm not working i'm an attorney figure out why i'm doing it think protester liability okay we're asking you nicely to stop okay if you don't want to do it nicely then you're leaving me little choice little choice that you have to take it to a court is that what you want to spend your money on i'll do it is this a work session involving the city are we talking she asked the question is this she asked a question i'm answering her question okay so let's keep this on track okay just please don't call me protester i will not call you a protester but i will tell you this you have a lot of nerve to say i said the next let's talk let's stop it there okay nobody say have a record i didn't send anybody to anyone's house the complaint and this is recorded by the way so please by all means the day that the officers came to your house i believe was the day after thanksgiving i think that's the 27th i don't know i don't have a calendar in front of me make a public records request go to the and get the tape to record it because the police record every call that goes into them i complained about the horn hocking in fact i think you will hear on that tape that i said the protesters okay we're not breaking any law that i know of but i said the problem was the people beeping back the word talking beeping back okay and in that day i believe it was only mr purcell outside there were signs in the right of way not your house i haven't been by your house in probably at least three weeks okay and that was only because i was making a u-turn and i went down fifth street so i don't know what you have in front of your house you used to have some campaign signs i don't care mrs purcell i was the person on this council that said not to enforce the sign ordinance so i certainly did not send the police to your house to enforce it when i told our city manager here and our city attorney we should not be enforcing it had nothing to do with you it had a different issue there was a campaign sign that was confiscated and we thought it shouldn't have been so we actually were in the process of reworking our sign maintenance so to post on social media that i did that is flat out wrong maybe you were misinformed i'm not going to say it's a lie but that's misinformation i didn't send the police to your house and i didn't tell them to take any signs if they took signs out of your front yard they should be put back you could put any sign you want in your front yard but you can't put it on the right of way because that people can't see when they pull out of the street that's vice concern i'm the mayor of the city i'm concerned about safety i'm asking you person to person to please stop i will hook you up with the police chief of st petersburg we have a family relative who works there they really really need your help they're getting defunded we funded the police with a record amount of money i funded them i ran out of campaign to increase the police and tonight you heard us talking with the city manager we increasing police that was my initiative and i thankfully was backed by my council so don't say i don't support the police and we posted pictures of me at the officers memorial and everything else that i went to i don't have to go to that stuff i went because i honor and respect law enforcement so it's very disruptive june vance coy who lives with me was going to homeschool her grandchild her father is a policeman we had to not do it because we couldn't concentrate so that's my situation i'm hoping you'll hear me and my sincerity i totally support that but when i heard from my neighbor what you said i started thinking otherwise i'm sorry did you say that i said i doubt it but nothing's impossible okay now is there a way we can i'm sorry is there a way we can find a middle ground could you spread your message around the city and other areas we never i never said you didn't support the police ever mr i'm having a hard time hearing you do you speak please speak right into the mind we're supporting law enforcement okay not necessarily your city alone every city okay i understand that but you're on sixth street in bellar beach your message isn't getting out to every city it's getting out to the easement across the street may i see your complaints all these things can i make another comment the purpose of this this is a work session is to discuss how to solve a problem and the count or point counterpoint and all that is is i think to some degree necessary in order for everybody in the room to understand what is the situation and get some understanding of the position of the various people i think it's clear to me what the position of the various people is and from my position i again will say reasonable people and i should have said people of good will will act in a reasonable manner to find a way to resolve problems i i will say to you and your husband you two have the constitutional right to stand on that sidewalk and hold a sign okay and uh i like everybody that is a elected official i'm not an elected official i'm their lawyer but i swore to uphold the constitution every one of them did the same when they took the oath of office just because you have the constitutional right to do something doesn't mean it's the appropriate thing to do it's it's been disruptive and i'm i'm just making i'm not sure may i complete my comments well okay may i answer yeah it's not i'm not debating anybody i'm saying is a city attorney for this city i'm advising my client and i'm responding to several of the things i heard people of good will and reasonable people will solve a problem in a reasonable manner and that to me is the best course of action that you you as a council can take if that route does not work then i highly recommend that the council instruct me to draft the ordinance that related that's similar to what they have in winter park and then once that's on the books we can go through the steps of um trying to enforce that that's those are the best two solutions i have and to be quite honest with you going back and forth with recriminations about things is is to me counterproductive for everybody and i i'm because i'm the lawyer and i'm supposed to wait till the council calls on me but there's some times where i i have to step in and this is one of them um you have your constitutional rights the mayor has stated why he uh this this has been a long saga for him and others and again i'm hopeful that reasonable people will find a reasonable solution and that will be the end of it that's my hope i would like to say one thing you keep saying that this is a big problem this is news to us we've gotten nothing but support the only complaints we get regularly are from the mayor and his girlfriend that's it none of the other neighbors have complained they support us it's always don't give up don't quit we appreciate it so i somebody this is mrs purcell i'm gonna ask you return to your seat the three minutes is passed up okay i have laid out that there were eight families affected ben corwin my neighbor across the street complained the two people who live at 605 complained that would be the lady one of them being the lady that you told that you were there to piss off the mayor last friday or thursday i believe last thursday um your neighbors two houses down laurie i don't know her last name i just know her as lori came to see you okay and asked you about what was going on and she complained okay we have complained numerous times so to sit there and say it's not bothering anybody you know if it were me okay and i was bothering even one neighbor it would be enough for me to cease and desist okay i just would say oh my god i don't believe it if i was playing my guitar too loud one night my neighbor said you know joe i'm hearing you i'd say oh my god i'm sorry about her i'll crank it down i wouldn't go out and keep doing it okay and that leads to the whole why is this happening and we never did get an answer why it was happening it's affecting a lot of people and other people are scared and again there's several hundred pages of posts on social media all of which miss van scoy has okay they're not subject to public records she has them okay this is a problem there's a lot of there's a lot of attack one of the things i put in this book was somebody who said they were going to come and break into my house they were going to come and break into my house until i changed my mind on the police well that's that's not what that said the statement was referred to if somebody breaks oh it said when read it again that's exactly like the separation of that statement was yeah you're going to wish you had at least when somebody breaks into that advice okay and again i supported the police so i don't have to justify it to anyone mrs purcell thank you for your comments we ask you nicely okay and obviously we've kind of tried to give you your opinion i have another gentleman in the back so please about to see here sir please just give us your name and address when you vote when you sit down just across the street i think i may have a solution to this because i agree with the attorney when i was in law school the first thing that they say is you try to determine problems from a reasonable standpoint and it appears that you obviously have felt threatened because this is going on for a long time and well i don't know what the issues are and so what i might suggest is that it would seem to me that anybody in this room if somebody is getting their free speech uh criteria in order communication with somebody they have a right to do that but at some point it becomes a nuisance it can become harassment and then it goes into assault because they feel threatened and at that point the constitutionality of it isn't allowed anymore if i'm not mistaken as soon as you cross the line and you're threatening somebody and so where where's that point i i would say if you're you know protesting for five days maybe seven days it would still be look like it's a protest but if it's 15 days or 20 days i would say you would start to feel harassed and so i could see an ordinance that's what say any protest that lasts for more than five days seven days it will be looked as assault or whatever the legal terminology is and then whatever punishment that would be allowed under the law say that will be the criteria so that way at least you allow people to have their constitutional say but you also give comfort to those who are in a position where they're going to be criticized for no matter what they do and quite frankly everybody in this body is probably in that in that position and so nobody likes to be criticized but to have it done for weeks and weeks and weeks i know i feel threatened and i i would be afraid to go out of the house and so it's just too bad that it's gone this far and i know whatever pain that whoever this party is i don't know the part of it that she was just she obviously has an issue where she felt that she had to protest but quite frankly 150 days i'd feel pretty threatened that so i would back off but but it appears that he obviously knows your stance because we've been battling it back so that would be my suggestion is look at an ordinance that allows a certain period of time to protest and then figure out a penalty for for being assaulting thank you mr baldwin june vancouver 7th street lr beach i talked to miss purcell long time ago several months ago can everybody hear me i want to make sure go a little closer all right several months ago when i went over to her and talked to her about this protest and i told her why don't you move it around the city keep it fresh you can move it from corner to corner and maybe get more residents involved and and get more people supporting the cause and i told her i said my uncle's a former assistant chief of police for the city of orlando i have officers in my family that work for saint pete i have a cop in my family that works for seattle okay so i totally support the police and i asked her i said why not move it from street to street within the city well i would have to get permission from the city hall i said well what you could do is you could call there or write an email to the city clerk for a month's worth on month on the first i'll be on first street on the second i'll be on second street on the third i'll be on third street so if you gave a 30-day window to the city clerk you would also get your permit at the same time for parking on the street her words to me were that's not convenient i said well what about moving up to the light there's crossman park it's across the street the house next to is vacant the house on the corner is faking it's not convenient i said well what about moving in front of city hall it's not convenient what about moving at the marina it's not convenient so i ask you that being said what's not convenient okay the other thing okay i have witnessed and you heard me say it earlier someone almost got hit in the crossbar now last year somebody died died several cities away in a crosswalk do we have to have somebody die before this happens that they're protesting and possibly possibly distracting drivers right by a crosswalk coupled with the fact that i've heard several times several times people saying fu to them yelling out of their cars because they don't support the cause okay and and just two days ago because they were blocking the sidewalk totally her husband was okay i personally witnessed the gentleman have to walk up somebody's lawn and go around him and you know what he said troublemaker that's what he said to the guy said to him so i ask you what is the cause here what are they truly supporting okay let's come to a solution a peaceful one but let's come to a solution thank you thank you john hansen mrs purcell you get to speak once so if your husband wishes to speak a speech okay ma'am listen listen we're not going to have this this i think is typical of what we're going through you're screaming in the middle of the council session i ask you to stop before that's please the truth i can respond to that ma'am you cannot respond to it and if you respond again you're going to be responding from outside in the hole that's fine mr hansa go ahead john hansen 22nd street bel air beach i just listened to this from the last speaker all of these suggestions whether they're true or not i don't know i wasn't there nothing's convenient so it's not just them standing on a sidewalk with a poster supporting law enforcement i support law enforcement i thank officers every single day i thank firefighters and other first responders because they are our first line of defense given this global war on terrorism i've gone in harm's way i signed contracts and gave enough to lay down my life for this country and to appoint the first amendment does protect us until it doesn't and as i mentioned to somebody on a city council in a recent phone conversation you don't have a right he yelled fire in a crowded theater let's just say hypothetically here that's not hypothetical but a few weeks ago i was at gulf and causeway waited to make a left turn i had stopped short in the left turn line because some idiot blew the red light and came over into my lane i couldn't go to the right because there was somebody beside me there was a car turning right off the causeway on the gulf apathetically a deputy could have been citing somebody for improper use of emergency sounding device id horn you'd had a multiple car wreck and a citizen did right there enough's enough i think that the points been made but what i'm hearing tonight certain parties are unwilling to budge and i have to concur mr riley if we can't come to an amicable agreement then by golly the city council needs to rep send approve the drafting of an ordinance for protests or whatever else you want to call it because enough's enough i've seen too many situations just sunday when the power went out over here wife and i go to breakfast we're coming down back up golf from clearwater beach i'm doing the speed limit of 35 miles an hour and some bloody idiot in a beamer passes me in a turn lane and i'm tired of counting the number of times i see people pass in the turn lane at gulf in 22nd somebody is going to get hurt if not killed one last point shalom we is non-negotiable shall and will it means you will do it but unfortunately this contract in the next sentence for the sheriff's department leaves it gives them discretion well i've got a suggestion for your discretion your discretion should be at minimum write a warning if you're not willing to write a ticket i said is there anyone who hasn't spoke from the citizens no one else wishes to be heard we'll bring it back i'm sorry yes i'm debbie maul and i live at 115 causeway i'm just appalled by this thing this is ridiculous as a as a citizen of this city and as a taxpayer in the city mr reeves stated that we are paying the police 55 an hour times two an hour to deal with this we're paying our attorney i would guess 300 an hour or more um i'm very upset about this uh this is ridiculous i never really felt did i just give you a raise i'm sorry i just taught you what i do my attorney it's a well-deserved one [Music] that's not binding by the way but um my my biggest concern is that um i i i just think that there's gonna be something else behind us this has gone to the point of being ridiculous and i would like to see this thing resolved uh if you know in just a decent manner i can tell you when when i go to the beach in bellar another shore on the beach on public beach and you guys harassed me for having an umbrella or not you know not being what you guys determine at that point is the mean high tide line but you will not go after someone who is creating a noise ordinance in our city that's a real discrimination issue in my book um i had a real issue with that one but that's for another day so my point here is that we just need to resolve this thing we do not need to spend another dime on this we need to put something in play and resolve it because this this is really uh junior high behavior and it needs to end thank you thank you miss mall mr shot rickshaw 115 13th street just to echo what um mrs mall said i don't i don't know whether to laugh or cry to me this is so element in elementally elementary way so simple i don't know why we haven't resolved it listening to this and the fingers being pointed clearly we have residents who have a right to support an organization which they strongly support but by the same token uh for the extended period of time clearly they're disturbing people and i don't think there's one person in this room that could stand up and say that if this happened in front of their house every day unless they were part of it and they were normally up that they would be okay with it so i have a right to sit in my backyard and talk if i'm talking loud and my neighbors say hey rick could you could you uh keep it down a little bit we're trying to sleep i would say yes i'm sorry and going about my business i mean this is just like it's like my like something my mother would say to me you know respect other people so that we all can have a nice quality life my god we live in this wonderful little city and i can't believe this is going on so i don't know these people from adam but if i interpret what's happened here you've been asked by a resident representing himself and others to please stop a consistent noise and you basically have said no so i guess that's where we are the ball is in your car if you're the two i don't know who's there every morning but you have to leave here and make a decision either to continue to annoy people even though you may have the right or you think you would just like to do what would be neighborly so i guess the ball is in your court thank you thank you mr shot any other citizens wish to be heard i'll bring it back to the council um i got you i i don't think the winter park ordinance was i don't have confidence that the winter park ordinance would solve this thing because what purcell they're doing i do not believe is a protest okay if you look at the warning and i think you would have a hard time connecting the dots to make a case for a protest uh i believe in what they're doing support degree they're making a statement and it would be no different than if they were standing on the side of the road saying support you know wearing your mask and let's all fight copenhagen right so that's i i support your right to do that now with that said there's a little onerous aspect to this thing and i think it i think it's about appealing to your sensibilities of being a good neighbor okay i i agree with your right to make those statements all day long but i think it's obvious that it's affecting somebody and whether whether there's a animus there or whatever i don't know but it's just not being a good neighbor so i would appeal to your sensibilities of being a good neighbor i understand where there's there's harassment on both sides where i see i saw a pattern of behavior tonight where within 30 seconds i was i was threatened with being arrested for walking out of a meeting i was also named to be a litigant in a lawsuit so there are patterns of behavior on both sides here that i i don't agree with and i don't like so i think the one of the biggest issues here is we don't have the tools in our toolbox to address this thing from the city you don't have it in our ordinance i looked at the ordinance cited by the city attorney and i think part of it was it wasn't taken in its full context about a person being responsible for or noise if you go back i think you will find that the intent of that was for a supervisor or a worker operating a piece of machinery that's disturbing the piece so i think your reference there was wasn't in its full context here bottom line is that our contract says the police have the ability to uh use discretion in how they apply this stuff so not only on the ordinance side but also on the enforcement side i don't think we had the existing tools that christmas thing so i agree with the city attorney i agree with everybody else who's made the statement here we just have to deal with this thing as adults here and appeal to your sensibilities and if you have any good feelings for this city about being a good neighbor about saving us money and being a good steward of the taxpayers dollar then please allow us to get back to meaningful city business and stop spending money on some of these frivolous issues that i think adults could work out between themselves so uh that's that's kind of like my bottom line right there i think if there are more complaints than just the ones these tuesdays that i've heard about before this such as eight people my question is are those complaints bona the city that absolutely they went to city hall they've been not acted upon i mean again i'm not going to give away i'm not talking about the floor i'm not going to go there sorry for interrupting you i am disappointed in that uh this whole thing has degraded into a personal spin i i believe in the statements you're trying to say but there's there's some onerous aspect to this thing and i see it here in the animals and vitreous flying back and forth so what i would say is please please be the adult here and perhaps let's stand down or figure out a better place to do this or there there's something about not being a good neighbor here and i don't think that's your intent i hope it's not your intent so let's perhaps all take a step back and take a look at it from a different perspective so i think that's that's pretty much my point it's not a protest i don't see it as a protest but i do agree with uh mr malls it's it's boring on being a nuisance and a harassment and we need to look at some other ways but in the meantime this thing could have a long protracted timeline for trying to enact ordinances or take other kind of actions let's just take the high ground on both sides of this thing and let us let's do some meaningful work for the city and save some money that's all i can thank you i'm brought on to come to you next time i want to say something um i'm going to speak to the council but i'm going to look right at mr and mrs uh purcell i'm asking you oh i'm sorry this is better it's as close as i can get to it okay okay so i'm asking you personally to listen to what everyone has said here i think it's been unanimous in this room that everyone has said enough is enough no one is supporting what is happening in terms of 115 days in the same location 60 feet from our bedroom window you said you didn't know um now you know okay you know so let's start fresh from tonight we'll see what happens tomorrow morning if this stops or if this is a once a year thing if it's a once a year thing i'll come out there and hold the sign with you i promise okay but if it's going to be every day then unfortunately the city has to act upon it and then you also force me to act upon it personally along with miss van scoy and other people legally of course i don't want to do that i am begging you do not make me do that protesters and i say protesters in general not calling you that there's a whole new area of law about protester liability i'm speaking to you now i know what you own i know where your stuff is you don't want to do this please you're unlike a lot of the other protesters you have assets yeah i would stop there because again we're talking about this pattern of behavior where it's always a threat whether it's overt or veiled or whatever let's stop it you made your point you made your appeal so stop it there and you don't need to try to rationalize it you're you're dealing with adults in this room you don't need to pontificate yourself let's let's all be reasonable like you had said and i'm gonna interrupt you guys i'll tell you whatever you have for robin i need the floor right now um i agree with glenn i think reasonable is the best way i disagree with the whole definition maybe protest i'm not a lawyer but i've learned a lot of law since i've been on here so and i'm watching a lot of law and orders so i'm in mexico right just like dr google you guys are all experts in medicine so i could be an expert in law but you know when you support the blue is the same as protesting mistreatment of police when you hang out like you said your example of having a sign where your mass protect us from covet you could say i'm protesting people that don't believe in science so i think you could make an argument for protesting that way i'm not a lawyer but i'm just saying i'm not a lawyer i'm just saying that it all depends on how many five paragraph one sentences with a thousand columns you write down in law so i'm just saying bottom line is i think this meeting we're at the point where we're not going to get anywhere there's no not going to be a kumbaya moment you're not going to agree you're not going to agree so i think we can maybe wrap this up and see where it goes from there if activity doesn't stop then i think maybe we need to look into ordinances and we'll rely on fred as our attorney for our city to guide us in the right direction to that point we need a consensus if this continues then i certainly can give fred a text i'll come right back to you i just need the consensus that if it continues we're talking about winter park is not the solution frisbee is but um i need to be able to say fred do something we can't sit here and be talking about this another month you know another 60 days from now so we could have 175 days of this so well i i'm gonna say i don't want to speak in front of council members so go ahead the only thing i have to say at this point if the city is forced to do this we'll have to and that's that's a crime right there it's it's a tremendous amount of wasted effort but if we have to we have to right right give you a path forward from my perspective you have a a special meeting in two weeks and in two weeks if there has not been a amicable resolution that that's occurred then in two weeks it should be on the agenda for you to give me direction to take action okay and i will tag on to that i've listened to this discussion this evening [Music] in some ways this is one of the tools that you in the toolkit that you did have is that you had the ability to have this as a workshop item that you've discussed as a council and then citizens have given their perspective on things too i i will say something about a common problem with tests of wills tests of wills usually result in no one being happy and i again will go back to my you know line that i'm going to use over and over again reasonable people of goodwill will find a reasonable solution to a problem and from my perspective that's as far as you can get with this topic tonight and what you know my my suggestions give it two weeks have it be on the agenda and hopefully reasonable people especially at christmas time will find a way to find it in their heart to get an amicable resolution all the way around so mr uh so we have consensus that we'll move this forward to a work session let's let's schedule it i will pull it down if things stop um and i will say this publicly if things stop we will never talk again about this no hard feelings it's christmas time bury the hatchet there's no hatchet to bury because i never had a problem to begin with but no if you have no problem i have no problem i will be totally happy and i think everybody in the neighborhood will be so that's my offer and i mean that i'm saying it publicly so with that are we ready to adjourn yes yes okay then we're adjourned thank you everyone"
