here council member Lloyd Roberts here vice mayor Jody Shirley here mayor Dave gtis here city manager Kyle reefer here and and City attorney Randy MOA all right give you just a second figure that out sounds great like a baseball stadium I think we're better now all right all right before we begin our agenda i' like to remind everyone that this Saturday I'll tell you what we're going to just going to pause the meeting for just a minute and see if we can get this figured out are we good can everyone hear me out all right great I apologize for the technical difficulties let's move forward before we begin our agenda I'd like to remind everyone that this Saturday November the 11th is Veterans Day this day holds a special place in our hearts as we come together to recognize the brave men and women who have served and continue to serve our great nation on this upcoming veterans day let us pay our respects and express our profound gratitude to those Heroes their service whether in times of war or peace reminds us of the values that Define our nation freedom justice and democracy let us ensure that their sacrifices are never forgotten and that our veterans know they are appreciated not just today but every day thank you Veterans for your service and dedication to our great nation the United States of America Now we move on to agenda item number one Mr Mo yes sir sorry if it's possible I'd like to suggest we have a couple of guests here tonight that actually are not from b beach and as entertaining as our meetings are if we could they're on item 30 I thought possibly it was okay with the council we could move that to the front of the regular agenda um so they don't have to go through the so we're on agenda item one which is the first order of business approval of the agenda so uh before um we can do that someone's going to have to make a motion to amend the agenda so are you making a yes sir I move that we amend the agenda would anyone like to second that motion second second by Jody Shirley all right uh because we're just voting to amend the agenda there's no discussion all in favor I I any oppos no all right well then the agenda is amended now uh I need a motion to approve the agenda as amended can we clarify where we're moving number 30 it up to be the first item under the regular agenda so I don't know if we would make that 21A and 21b or the easiest way to make that happen so what I would like to do is rather than ring okay we'll just call it item number 30 and it'll it'll be number one that's perfect is that okay with you P thank you very much okay all right so would anyone like to make a motion to approve the agenda as amended some motion made by Lloyd Roberts do I have a second second second by jie Jody Shirley all in favor I I any oppos no all right one opposed so the motion passes and so the agenda is amended so we will move right over to item number 30 may just some clarity understanding that Mr Robert's amendment was such that it would make item 30 the first um Regular agenda item before 20 before what is presently 21 so it would still be it would move to the beginning of the regular agenda regular agenda not ahead of all the other items yeah that makes sense okay so we will um make that we'll put that right at the regular as the regular agenda begins all right so now we are on to Citizen comments item number two if any citizen would like to address the council about a topic not already on the agenda please raise your hand and wait to be called on we ask that you limit your comments to No More Than 3 minutes if any council member would like to respond to Citizen comments please hold your responses until we reach Council comments at the end of the meeting uh before I call on uh random citizens we already have we have two cards completed to speak uh the first is Clifford gibons make this quick and I know we have to give you our name and address K given 2300 well I'm here for a happy occasion um we've had something happen here in the last 3 months it is rare that happens in any governmental unit and that's the tenaciousness of maratus and his leadership and persistence and rapidly um coming to the crisis that we had after Hurricane day and coming up with a dune restoration program in which he absolutely spearheaded and marshaled it all the way through success and I urge everyone to get out there and see what he did because it's just amazing uh 400 dump trucks a day coming in from Orlando with total precision and uh let me say Kyle did a lot to be able to help get all the permitting together and Mr Mayor you deserve an enormous amount of credit because you singlehandedly did this I watched it and I just think that everybody in this community has really got to be proud of what you did and I'm here just to say thank you thank you Mr GI I [Applause] appr normally I don't respond to Citizen comments but I I will add that um the county responded to multiple request and at the end of the day they they control the purse strings uh and they they did get it done uh and so um we owe just a world of gratitude to the county also for handing over some of that bad tax to protect our city all right we have another citizen who has requested to speak is JJ S can I get that right yes sir I apologize for my app but I was caught at the last second so and I do like to commend the uh the city for the doing restoration we just had a couple questions as concerned citizens um I'm at 2760 Golf Boulevard um the b beach CK um I think that it's a great job there was a tremendous amount of trucks coming in uh we're right on the seaw wall and where the beach begins and the the the sand is incredible at the same time it's almost too incredible it's it's awfully High almost to the point that residents that have a a f a first floor access to the beach have no view of the beach because the sand is so high now we do have existing cosos and other things there for the dunes um but with regards to um I consider myself still young but there's Al we have also elderly people in our community and to be able to walk out on the beach you have to go up really high most people can't do it and then the drop off is just almost dead down the beach so I'm concerned for um the safety that the hazards created by creating the dun so high and we haven't really seen and I might have missed it in an email with regards to what the final plan is but from when we talked to the people last week when they completed and we're right at the Morgan Street um beach access they said this is it so we just had concerns we're not sure if they're going to be planting any more of Education up there um if they're planning on leveling it off but as it is right now um it does seem somewhat interesting as to how residents have access to the beach because it's such a high incline that um most elderly people I think would have enough time getting upstairs let alone being able to walk up to the beach the beach is also um somewhat soft in that point so wherever you put your feet in you're d in probably a foot or so so we were just kind of hoping that maybe the the city could give us a little bit more idea of what they're planning on doing with the the SE graes so they planning on leveling it off um but there is a somewhat of an access problem for residents that are directly on the beach so hopefully that can be addressed and that we can have some sort of vision as to what the final product and if that is the final product then we'll have to deal with it but hopefully they'll L it off somewhat so that other so everyone can have access to the beach thank you Mr I appreciate your uh your concerns and uh we'll have someone get back okay thank you what any other citizens would like to speak please yes hi mayor council members good evening I'm Tammy lenda 97 Harbor Drive um I'm just here for a couple of save the dates um representing both our Community Foundation and the park and rec board um the first thing I'd like to make sure everybody takes note of is the um Foundation is having a holiday food drive the boxes are in the lobby um it started on November 1st and the last pickup to get it out is um November 17th um December 4th is our holiday social and Christmas tree lighting we once again will have it catered with heavy apps and suets and then we'll do the Christmas tree lighting and it's we'll have some nice new Beller Beach logo items for sale for the holidays January 13th is the health and wellness Fair um one slight change with that this year it is only 3 hours long it's from 10:30 to 1:30 instead of from 10: to 2 and the last thing I'd like to mention is our January 20th Bridge cleanup um the one that we had in October was a little light light and mighty um but there is still a tremendous amount of Gard garbage underneath the bridge from the hurricane so um we are going to bring in hopefully some people from keep pel's beautiful help to help us clean under the bridge but we're really going to try to get the word out for the January 20th clean up to get all that garbage picked up from underneath the bridge that's all thank you thank you Miss Linda any other citizens all right citizen comments are now closed so now we're on to item number three this is a presentation from pellis County Sheriff's Department uh beginning with law enforcement monthly report from Sergeant Bowman hello Sergeant how are you good thank you good evening mayor vice mayor council members um I'm going to cover the statistics that uh for your city for the month of September this past September you had one theft which is the same as what was the month before in August um just looking at year to date though uh the UCR and property crimes and person crimes are down uh last September we had 23 and we're at 16 for the year in September they had uh seven people arrested here there were actually 10 charges the majority of the charges were traffic related so six out of the 10 were traffic as far as Deputy activity there were 664 events that occurred the 797 deputies responded um looking at them the the top uh the majority of the calls that we responded were directing controls traffic stops house checks um vehicle illegally parked or abandoned and ordinance violations so that accounted for almost 80% of all the events there was one crash that was documented um for September and there were 192 citations the majority of those were warnings with without being 115 uh 51 were parking and 19 were traffic I was also provided with the annual studs did you want me to go over that as well it was uh October 1st through September 30th looking at the number of offenses uh that occurred the majority for the year the the highest number that you'll see is 22 uh burlar conveyances which could be car being broken into more than likely um and then the rest after that uh that you see double digits is pretty much traffic offenses such as DUIs or driving on a suspended license as far as incidents the majority the higher number of incidents um are information calls so 16 of those taken by our marine unit um 20 in had some sort of a Narcotics uh background to it whether it be a person um finding narcotics or um being disposed of and then 18 were ordinance violations as far as the number of arrests for the year uh there were 43 subjects arrested for misdemeanors on 56 charges and that's accounts for 60% of the arrests that occurred um there were 18 on felony and 11 people arrested on warrants as far as total citations for the year there were 2,26 um of those parking were 551 uh traffic citations were 289 and warnings were 1,333 and then for our crashes um that occurred in the city for the entire year there were a total of nine and almost half of them four of them were at uh Gulf Boulevard and cway Boulevard that concludes the information I have is there any questions Council any questions thank you very much Sergeant I appreciate it thank you have a good night now we're on to the code enforcement monthly report be CL here tonight Deputy CL is out of town so the report uh so uh one thing I noted um we have a pretty typical monthly code report here to about 60 to 70 events um this month um if you look at the pie chart a little bit more attention was given to the U front yards and the overgrowth of weeds over the plants obstructing neighboring properties and flter so a little bit less than we're used to on the construction related nuances so Deputy CL must be making a impact on on that CU we used to see higher um pretty good distribution throughout the city um and as far as even cover all streets and we still have the same uh standing code cases um that we've had for months now so hoping to get to a resolution soon the uh structure project getting wrapped up and the uh other structure that needs permit from the council Council any questions for Deputy re rep no questions thank you very much all right uh so now we'll move on to item number four a presentation from the felis Sun Coast fire and rescue District mayor vice mayor council members in our community Jeffrey Davidson fire team for pel Sun Coast fire rescue District um here to tell you everything that's going on with the fire district as well as the monthly report for October 2023 for b beach so we just last meeting I told you that we were awarded a FEMA Grant it's called a safer Grant this a staffing for adequate fire and emergency responses we it's 100% FEMA funded we were able to hire four additional firefighters um and we just recently completed that so all four new firefighter EMS are on board and two of them are former Marines and one is former Coast Guard and that's something very special to me because now we have 14 of our Personnel who are prior military about 30% of our personnel which is uh pretty exceptional so hiring those for additional firefighters gives um an additional fire suppression unit on the beaches the unit that we had down south was only two persons although it was built as an engine it technically can only run as a squad which because it only had two firefighters on it but now it has three firefighters on it every single day so that's improving the fire service and the UN service all along the beaches as well we're going to be advertising for an RFP for three new fire stations uh the first advertisement should run on Sunday and it's going to be open for 30 days and we received an unsolicited proposal from a P3 to build three of our fire stations rebuild them they're all as you know uh 58 years old 53 years old and one is not actually a fire station it's rented space in an office building um so that ad will run for um being on Sunday be open for 30 days we're also going to be posting for an RFQ for anyone who wants to put in for a design build for our Mainland station uh which is going to house our Emergency Operations Center we're also working uh side by side with the county uh we're trying to incorporate midyear funding uh this March so that we could uh have a peak time Rescue Unit for the weekends uh to better to provide a better service to Belair Beach um until the new fire station is built and then it would be full-time uh the plan is to move the fire engine that's in in Rocks Beach Station to to the Northern end of Inox Beach the property is located between 24th and 25th Avenue uh three blocks from your border here and when we get the rescue fulltime that'll be centrally located on Southern Indi Rocks Beach um we met today with the property owners we're looking at' been talking for almost two years now trying to uh negotiate a property with the Church of the Isles which is a great location in order to provide the best response times here you'll have you know from that property to this building right here is under 2 minute response time which is our goal uh and we're hoping that we have all that finalized and a deal in place by March we have some meetings in in January and everything is is positive and we moving forward with that we're also there's a lot we're also um going to the legislative session this year uh for Appropriations uh in order to rebuild existing fire station 27 which was originally built in 1965 it's 58-year-old fire St the original station was our district actually started uh in here in 1951 as a volunteer firefighters in 1951 and that was the original fire station that we're still operating out of there were some additions made to it um but we need to have a state of thee art facility and we have state representative Kimberly burfield who is sponsoring our request um very positive that's everything's going to go well that requested for $7 million um so all good things a lot of good things going on uh October was a slow month for emergency responses into b beach which is a good thing we had 12 emergency responses to Belair Beach including two water rescues two fire calls uh one motor vehicle crash and seven calls for Emergency Medical Services I wanted to apologize that we were not able to be at the uh pets and pause event on October 28th the crews were on their way here unfortunately there was a pretty bad motor vehicle crash and there was three uh adolescent trauma alerts and they were tied up there for quite some time so for us we would have been here in October we had 592 fire training hours and 179 medical training hours for a combined total of 771 training hours for the month of October so we are constantly training our firefighters and paramedics um and lastly I wanted to wish we want to wish everybody uh a blessed and safe Thanksgiving season and remember that uh the most common cause of residential fires anybody know unattended cooking right unattended cooking so we urge you to um keep a fire extinguisher near your kitchen and don't hesitate to call call 911 after you've gotten your family and your loved ones out of the building thank you thank you I like to congratulate you on the extra Personnel that's quite an accomplishment so good job there um questions or comments from anyone of the council thank you Chief thank you oh I do have one request I've asked for this before you've got a nice report that you're looking at and we're not and that's a lot of numbers for us to try to drink in it's sort of like drinking from a fire so um if you recommend it you can email a copy of that before the meeting and uh that way it'll showen our agenda and we can uh review it week Absolutely I'll that so you have it a few days before your meeting awesome thank you so much oh thank you thank for coming to Beach tonight all right have a good night all right we're on to agenda item number five which is the city attorney's report Mr Mora you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor briefly as you folks are aware see at the end of the of the road here we did receive a resignation from another council member um late last month we were working on the process for and I imagine get discuss at some point tonight um for member Livingston's vacancy um as we speak of vacancies I would like to take a to acknowledge as a charter officer um that this is I believe Patty's last meeting with us and it's been a pleasure in my one year here and change um to get to work with such a professional person um somebody who's so attentive to detail and really cares about the job she's done for you guys and it's going to be regardless of how we move forward a loss for the city I think and and just thank you Patty for the chance to work with you um otherwise I have nothing else to add but I'm happy to answer any questions you may have Council thank you very much Mr Mo right now we're on to the city manager's report Mr you have the FL thank you mayor these projects we project continuing um for to wire the phase one section and completing plans anding for phase to the storm water Improvement projects uh combined Pro projects are on the agenda tonight to um have the plans and final bid approved uh to go out and advertise on Wednesday November 8th the emergency Shore stabilization project um is still underway uh most of the S has been moved into place uh the planting is and restoration of the dunes uh or of the of the planning of the dunes I should s restation of the access point War part is still being completed um I will do um communicate more the county to find out the final expectation for the the as far as the slope and and compaction of the sand so we can answer some of the questions that were asked assent comments um so far what I do know the access points are 44 in wide um through the vegetation and um the idea is to maintain as much grade on that pathway to prevent the water from getting to the properties uh the city clerk search uh we I put on the agenda one I plans we have a candidate our top qualified candidate here tonight for the city C to interview and included all of the um applications we've we've received for the opening and the RFP for auditing Services uh we're drafting that want to have it released in December and another agenda item tonight is the uh code review Services uh found a contract that like to get approved to pick and I just want to also thank Patty I got to spend little over a year working with her she her City Clerk and uh her knowledge is really um I've learned a lot from her a lot of this city and she she's been here a long time she's definitely be a l how she's appr thank you thank you Mr Reaper do we have any questions or comments for the city manager okay so so I I do um whenever you contact the County would you ask them right now I I suspect the sand is Fluffy that it's it's Lighty and it's going to nourish a lot of our Beach uh because it's I can't stay that high so as it starts dropping down it has to go somewhere or it's going to get packed down one way or the other uh if they find out that or they they say that nope at the end it's only going to drop X number of feet at least that's our expectations um do we have a plan in place to uh to do anything for for the residents and their walkways or is climbing a baby Hill the only way out uh I believe the hill would get easier to climb um but from the answer I got from the public works director was that the intention of the design was to keep to go the path to go over the Doom as much as possible and she provided some other examples that sou in the way that excuse me the way that it was explained to me was that anywhere there's a low point in the day it's going to act as as a funnel if if we have a storm surge that's where the water is going to go so you definitely don't want to be right behind it if it's carved out too much um so I think I think you're probably right it's just going to be a settling more than anything and uh maybe over time it'll get carved out just for people using okay any other questions or comments um when they did that I noticed there was no like vibr roller to compress that sand so it's like you said fluffy and it's the wind's going to blow it um Feet's going to move it uh one good storm is going to suck it back into the ocean um is there anything coming up to like preserve that uh like a boundary around putting like a lower boundary around that because I can't see that s lasty too long or is that just all County engineering I think it's a combination of the county and the state um I will get an answer on that question is this is the first Beach project I've seen where a truck to stand in so I'm not sure what expectations what was the total cost that over 20 million right for the for pelis County yes yeah and uh and the goal was to bring the sand in um pack it down as much as they could gr it off and then put vegetation on it so something would be the only thing they had was a little low profile Dozer pushing that sand um wasn't really too much of compaction Mar council member Banker I've asked for sand for several years now and we got sand it may not be in the form of beach nourishment but I can assure you it's going to nourish our beaches anything to prevent flooding storm surge on 100% for the what I'm so upset with our County that four or five years ago when I went to them about these Perpetual rates I said look no one's moving on this we need to either go to court and get a court order on the Perpetual rights or a court order that the Army Board of Engineers is incorrect and they said we're trying to work it out in a meable fashion which never never really works out so what we did was we spent an absorbit amount of money bring sand in from Orlando when they sand 20 yards off the beach that we could have gotten from the Army Court of Engineers now m question is if Beach R nourishment and the Perpetual rats get signed will the county have the money to do complet I can assure you they have the money if they're willing to spend 300 million on a Bas Hall Stadium they'll find the money well I'm hoping anything else Mr re thank you mayor all right now we are on to item number seven which is the city clerk's report Gentry you have thank you um my report is just a standard uh recap of the monthly uh activities and but mayor I would like to say one thing I can't tell you how much I have enjoyed working with this Council this Council has been the best to work with and I really it makes my daily job unbelievably fulfilling and Kyle is the best city manager I have ever worked for I work for him every day all day all and he is the best so thank you for let me say that um do we have any comments for the city CL Roberts so when I found out Patty was leaving I had brief conversation with her as to what she was going to do and the sole reason she told me was to spend more time with her grandchildren which is awesome however when I look through the city Charter I found that that particular reason requires a 10year notice so you know can't break any rules here as a labor guy you're now well employ any other comments I can say it's been an absolute pleasure to work with you uh you saved my butt more than one time I don't have enough fingers the number of times that you've called me out on mistake uh but it's you were doing your job and uh and you made this job very very easy um I don't have other Clerks toare to but if I did I'm almost certain that I would still say that you are the best you're going to be severely sorely missed and uh please come back and visit us time of time all right thank you mayor anything else no that's it all right now we are on to the consent agenda which is items 8 through 15 here py wanted to wrap up all of her business before she left so everyone just bear with me uh this is for approval of the August 21st 2023 city council work session minutes the August 28th 2023 emergency

thank you so much for your hard work p thank you all right so now we are to the second reading and final public hearing items which are items number 16 through 20 I'm going to start out with uh item number 16 this is for consideration of ordinance 23-6 this is the second reading Mr Mo whenever you read these would you read them just maybe just slightly slower if I must uh happily Mr Mayor this is city of Beller Beach ordinance number 23-6 Charter amendment number one an ordinance of the city council of the city of belir Beach Florida submitting to the city electors a referendum question on the amendment of section 2.02 of the charter to increase the number of permissible consecutive terms for City Council Members including the mayor from two terms to three terms identifying the issue to appear on set ballot providing for reing providing for the adoption of ballot Language by resolution providing for publication in accordance with the law and providing for an effective date this has

comments are closed uh before we continue I'm going to need a motion to approve ordinance 23-6 so Move Motion is made by Leslie n do I have a second second second by Lloyd Roberts m n you have the floor um I think we've been over this so many times there's not much we can add to it Council I'll reiterate again I don't believe this is a proper time to be changing our Charter this is only we've only had the charter change what two and a half years ago need to be re address every five to six years this is like a self-serving these these changes I see are self- serving we're going from two to three terms uh we elect the president no more in two terms the governor no more in two terms I don't think people C plus we have that caveat you only have to leave one year and you can run again this is unnecessary any other comments from councel I just want to remind the public that this is a ballot item and the citizens will vote on it so no matter what's decided caring this vote right now it's just a put it on the ballot and allow the citizens to make the decision nicely said vice mayor do anyone else like to comment all right in that case Patty would you please call the RO council member Banker no council member Chester yes council member Noto yes council member Roberts I vice mayor Shirley I mayor GIS I so the citizens get to decide the second reading of ordinance 23 -06 is approved right now we are on to item number 17 this is consideration of ordinance 23-7 this is a second reading City attorney Mo Mr Mayor city of b beach ordinance number 23-7 for Charter amendment number two an ordinance of the city council of the city of B Beach Florida submitting to the city electors a referendum question on the amendment of sections 2.01 1 2.02 and 2.07 of the charter to reduce the number of atlarge members on the city council including the mayor from Seven members to five members to specify the timeline for transitioning to five members and to adjust the corresponding voting requirements for official action of a five member Council identifying the issue to appear on set ballot provided for providing for ruming providing for the adoption of ballot Language by resolution providing for publication in accordance with the law and providing for an effective date this has been a full uh a reading of ordinance 23- 02-07 on second reading by title only thank you Mr MOA it's harder to do it when I slow you down it does it does all right let's go to the citizens for comments on ordinance 23-7 would anyone like to speak all right we have no takers uh citizen comments are now closed I'm going to need a motion to approve ordinance 23-7 motion made by council member Noto do I have a second second second by Mr Roberts Mr ter you have the floor well is um Shirley just said that we're not voting to make this approval we are voting to put it on the ballot to give it to the citizens to make the decision thank you council member Naro would anyone else like to speak yes Mr Bank while I'm big on reducing the size of government um mostly Financial wise um again this is not the appropriate time I believe to do it yes this will go on the ballot okay but when I was going around campaigning you wouldn't believe how many people didn't even know there was a council b beach when I was telling him I run for Council so again pump up wine and cheese into the people mislead them information get just about get anything pass today so again I'm against these ordance St these resolutions and these changes of the thank you council member Baker would anyone else like to speak on this topic yes after Roberts thank you we have discussed this a lot I think there's a couple of main reasons that come to mind the first one being that uh Mr Mayor uh checked around other cities and towns similar in signs to us and we were one of the very few that actually have seven people sitting on either the commission or the council most of all of them had five which makes the most sense coupled with the fact that we anticipate there'll be probably less people interested and running for these seats based on some new requirements handed down from the state so we really don't want to be in a situation um where it's difficult to actually find candidates that are interested in order to build a seven so it makes a lot of sense thank you Mr Roberts any other comments all right and I would like to Second Mr Roberts thoughts on that um with everything that's going on with the U full Financial disclosure it's getting harder and harder to find candidates we were already too big and now we're going to be too big with a city that is not interested in running so really it's in our best interest to reduce the Council 7 to five and I believe that once this goes about the citizens will agree all right on that note Mr Mayor Mr Roberts I believe this I believe Mr mo may verify this I believe this this state has given us a that the city cannot produce enough people they will come in and give us people or appoint people I'm not totally sure I understand the statement you're making if the city cannot produce enough council members and or to have enough people to run for office there not a provision I believe in it it might not be in the Constitution but it's a statute that the governor can appoint people I want to be cautious as I say this um um the governor is certainly the chief executive and chief administrative officer there he may have some statutory authority to make appointments I think the broader point you get is you have to have qualified and willing electors um to serve there's no there's no statement in absent um volunteers that the um you know Governor will by fat or the legislature otherwise that said there is also the reason I was I was cautious in wanting understand your question is um there are some indications of the legislature looking at beach communities on peninsulas like this and elsewhere and uh apping that there's that the existence of these communities is a redundancy that should be Consolidated um and so you're seeing similar efforts and that's something that on a home rule basis I think local jurisdictions would want to resist um but I I just wanted to make sure I understood your question okay I'm not even going to touch that anyone else just I'll just speak up just for a second that just reiterating why we need to reduce the number of people on Council or why we should allow the citizens to make that decision because the last thing I think I want is someone from at the state level running our local city city and that is uh what we're trying to avoid I agree 100% And if we're not able successfully Implement our Charter um who knows what can happen U I don't even want to think about I want to keep B air Beach the way that it is I want I want to uh keep our city attacked what brought each of you here is what I want belir Beach to be and the way things are going um there are forces against us all the time so this community is near and dear to my heart and I I truly believe that this is the right direction for our city any other comments all right Patty would you please call the rooll council member bankard no council member Chester yes council member Noto yes council member Roberts I vice mayor Shirley hi mayor gavis hi again uh we're not changing anything we're just merely giving the citizens the right to vote on this topic second reading of ordinance 23-7 is approved by now we are on to item number 18 consideration of ordinance 23-8 this also is the second reading Mr Mo thank you Mr Mayor this is city of Beller Beach ordinance number 23 -08 Charter amendment number three an ordinance of the city council of the city of Belair Beach Florida submitting to the city electors a referendum question on the amendment of sections 2.02 2.04 and 5.05 of the charter to increase the term of office for individual council members including the mayor from 3 years to four years and to amend the regular election schedule to accommodate such terms identifying the issue to appear onet ballot providing for the adoption of ballot Language by resolution providing for public in accordance with the law and providing for an effective date this has been a second and final reading of ordinance number 23-8 by title only thank you Mr Moore let's go to the citizens for comment on ordinance 23-8 anyone like to speak all right citiz comments are now closed going to need a motion to approve Ordinance 23-8 do I have a motion sub Move Motion made by Lloyd Roberts do I have a second second second by leso Mr Roberts you have the floor thank you one of the main one of the things we want to try to get done by Council and of course as we've said multiple times it will be voted on by the citizens we would like at the end of the day and that's something that's talked about in a later amendment to have our voting take place the same time the general election when the president is eled as well as the midterms more people statistically turn out for those votes by far so the fact that we have ours um in odd years doesn't fit into that square pay so that's one of the main reason I think we're trying to get this part is on is four years which are even number years three years will'll never achieve that but it's an OP it's just a matter thank you m Mr Roberts I will add that aligning the elections everyone votes for the president there are other elections where there's very little turnout sometimes in the teams um this is going to be the best way to hear the voice of lb citizens by aligning with the presidential and midterm elections other council members anyone like to speak yes Mr Banker yeah um I find these things contradict uh from past comments on the past ordinances were proposed to be passed if it's going to be so hard to find people to run for this Council why would we be increasing the number of years that just doesn't make any sense people would want to be getting off sooner the terms wouldn't be who would want to run for three years if it's going to be so you know egregious to uh be on council member so none of this makes sense in my op so yes Mr Chester I I can address that I don't I think just serving period regardless of how long is takes a lot of thoughtfulness because there's a very invasive um Financial disclosure that you have to put forth now and I think it's going to be getting harder to get people to serve and if you can get people to serve I think it would be better to try to get them to serve longer if they to do it so I think that's I think that's the reason why that in my view thank you Mr Chester Mr Banker I see you over there enging well absolute power absolutely corrupt so the longer you stay in you usually get more corrupted government that's why we have 535 people in Congress and nobody likes except for is that uh your final word yes would anyone else like to speak yeah I'd like i' like to add that um by aligning with the national elections then we also save the city quite a bit of money uh so we're not adding elections and extra for the clerk um which is huge benefit to the city and um the corruption on is just ridiculous in the city we have no authority to do anything without city manager city manager has all the authority we just and help him through the process so this is that's just a ridiculous thank you vice mayor sh any other comments all right Patty would you please call the RO council member Banker [Music] no council member Chester yes council member Noto yes council member Roberts hi vice mayor Shirley hi mayor gallis hi so once again the citizens will get the opportunity to tell us what they would like to have the second reading ordinance 23-8 is approved and we are on to item number 19 we're getting close to the end of these ordinances this is uh for consideration of ordinance 23-9 again a second reading City attorney Mora you have the floor thank you Mr mayor city of b beach ordinance number 23-9 Charter amendment number four an ordinance of the city council of the city of B Beach Florida submitting to the city electors a referendum question on the amendment of section 5.05 of the charter to adjust the regular election cycle from March to November contingent on the passage of a separate bot measure governing the duration of council member terms identifying the issue to appear on set ballot providing for the adoption of ballot Language by resolution providing for publication in accordance with the law and providing for an effective date this has been a second and final reading of ordinance number 23-9 by title of thank you Mr Mora let's go to the citizens for comments anyone like to speak on ordinance 23-9 see that we have none we'll bring it back to the council and close citiz and comments before we continue I'm going to need a motion to approve ordinance 23-9 so Move Motion made by Lloyd Roberts do I have a second second second by vice mayor Shirley Mr Roberts thank you Mr Mayor um it's basically what I said earlier and a couple of other members expressed as well we want to move it from March to November so that we'll be tied in with the uh general election as well as the midterms I actually was watching television maybe a month or so ago and was either the city of Tampa or Hillsboro County as we all know when we TR on Spectrum it goes immediately to Bays 9 typically and they were they were doing the same thing and they discussed items like a vice mayor just brought up how much money it was going to save them by moving to the November election time period And they also gave out the statistics of when they do have voting that takes place on the November elections um the percentage of of people that turn out is like in the high 6 and any other time it was in the teens so pretty dramatic difference Mr Roberts anyone else like to speak yeah uh question um how many Beach communities have their elections in November for uh city council towns does anyone know that my recollection is mostly Mar March I'm not sure I can tell you that I've spoken to the elections board and they have uh confirmed that we would reduce the cost of our elections well I understand that but I'm just wondering uh I don't know any other each communities to have the elections in March you're in Lu because whenever we have elections in March we don't vote for any of those communities so that yeah yeah I understand it but what I'm saying is each Community runs their elections in March Beach so I'm just wondering how many have it in November I don't know any so there's a pretty easy answer to that we're just smarter than they are we're D any other comments no all right let's take it to a vote he would you please call and roll council member Banker council member Chester yes council member Noto yes council member Roberts hi vice mayor Shirley hi mayor gtis I so the second reading of ordinance 23- 09 is approved and we will take it to the citizens for vote all right now we're on to item number 20 consideration of ordinance 23-10 this is also a second reading City attorney Mor you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor this is ordinance 23- 010 I mean 10 an ordinance of the city council of the city of B Beach Florida amending section 38- 87 of the city's code of ordinances governing the permitting process for special events Associated cost and fees and potential penalties for unpermitted or non-compliant special events providing for the implementation of administrative actions providing for codification providing for separability and providing for an effective date this has been a first reading of ordinates 23-10 by title only what's that a first reading was it sorry uh second reading of ordinance 2310 by title only Mr Mayor all right let's go to the citizens for comment any citizen like to speak NOP all right s some comments are now closed before we continue on the second reading of this one I'm going to need a motion from councel anyone like to make a motion so move vice mayor Shirley second second second Roberts Vice you have the floor this is something that has been brought up in front of us um I think actually City attorney brought to your attention that there was a potential problem with the ordinance it needed to be modified and this second looking at it so therefore um I think more add nothing to add again this is the ordinance and and thank you again for the reminder that we're on second meing this is the ordinance that was the outgrowth of some um um community outreach we received from an activist organization um having reviewed the ordinance independent of their concerns I I reach similar conclusions about our the history of our ordinance its language it's its vagaries frankly and and how it aligned with certain constitutional principles this is a robust um ordinance that addresses those concerns and is the product of a collaborative effort between us and that organization um to uh address this issue um I will add uh as a matter of PR pragmatism or practicality this is not an issue that has come up a great deal in the past um the fact that it's not a frequent problem doesn't mean it's a problem not worth addressing um and so we have the ordinance before you as a as an incept to rectify I guess I would just say talked about it it's been talked about yeah this this began in April discussion about this and for various reasons um we're here now but we are here with the revisor Min all that as much as I hate when um kicked on which doesn't happen all by outside organizations I actually am glad they did because this organization was civil enough to work approv with us come up with a mutual solution and rather than taking into a law we got it work out so I'm I'm happy any other comments from the council all right P let's take it to a v please call council member Banker yes pardon I'm sorry I really didn't hear yes yes council member Chester yes council member Noto yes council member Roberts I vice mayor Shirley I mayor gatis I so ordinance 23-10 is approved unanimously okay now we are on to the regular agenda and as promised by an amended agenda we move right over to item number 30 uh this is a request to the city of Beller Beach from Indian Rocks Beach a property owner for a letter of no objection to set piling and construct an 11 by 12 dock extension on the front of the existing dock install a new 13,000 lb capacity to the right the do and a 1500lb capacity personal watercraft lift on the left side adjacent to Belair Beach South Park uh this is placed on the agenda by city manager reefer so Mr reefer you have the floor thank you mayor so this request came in via email for the as the city manager through the website and um this is for uh property in Indian Rocks Beach that's this is 300 Harbor Drive new beach and the owner uh record is B no and Mr M has uh asked as part of his variant application uh for the city being the owner of the property which is South Park um at the very Southern edge of b beach where it borders in box Beach um to get consent from the city being brought um a requirement for their variance um application each side of the property owner requesting the variance needs to give consent to the request and the being that the city is the owner this city council represents ownership of the property and I put it on the agenda so that it could be considered by city council the uh there is an existing dock on the property at 300 Harbor Drive IND Rock be um that dock has been there for quite some time closer to the uh early 2000s um I included an aerial image uh from the property of appra what that shows the existing Dock and shows uh where the South Park's property line uh extends out into the Waterway and currently the uh existing dock is right up on the uh the South Park property line the protection of the property line and then I requested the Mr M's um company of choice for the doc construction which was uh spieler um to present the doc plan the drawing uh showing the uh projection of the other property line um with the design that he selected so that you can see um how the dock will encroach into the protection of the property line so those are both attached to this and um I'd like to present us to the council for consideration and I believe the property owner Mr is is here tonight thank you Mr reer uh now we will go to the citizens for comments would anyone like like to speak on this topic no all right and that includes the property own oh I'm sorry not a citizen ofair Beach so I didn't know just give us your name and your address the 300 Harbor Drive Indian Rocks Beach where your neighbors to the South we have uh we we've recently purchased oh my name Burke no Sarah my wife Joe no Sarah uh we recently purchased 300 Harbor Drive uh lived in Indian Rock since 2008 and uh the current dock uh is 24 ft out as the city manager explained but we're wanting to add a boat lift and the water uh is very shallow and so we're trying to get the the dock out far enough to be able to includ the boat lift on there so that that's the purpose of the extension and uh as as was explained it encroaches on the property line of the B air we've gotten approval of the Southside owners and you are our North Side owner so we humbly request your approval um just that when we purchase the property um we were not aware of how sharp that property line went out into the water and so it is sort of an unusual situation um and that it gets makes it very narrow for us to try to put any kind of extension on again because we were trying to get to deeper water so that we can have a your your property angles to our property so that's what causes that that angle there does that make sense yes any other comments no all right thank you so much for speaking would any other citizens like to address the council right citizen comments are now closed before we continue this discussion I'm going to need a motion to approve a letter of no objection to build a dock extension Municipal boundaries and enters b beach public property do I have a motion motion made by Leslie NATO do I have a second second second by Mr Roberts Mr NATO you have the floor I think the um the last page in the book of the drawing of where it goes over the prop line it's a very minimal extent of inion for everyone call um and I think it makes sense to allow him to do this allow them to do this excuse me other comments I'm concerned because all I'm seeing is a I'm seeing something from the property tax appr appraiser site that appears a lot different than the doc drawing the doc drawing is not necessarily a survey so I don't know that I don't know which one's correct I'm not going to say that the property tax appr appraiser site is correct either because those lines kind of float a it so I think before we could even consider it we need to see a survey if the if the property tax appraiser site is correct you would really encroach into the parks Waterfront and as a representative representative the city of b beach I think we need to protect our assets and I would be reluctant to approve something like this without proper information and I don't think we have the right information thank you vice mayor we have other comments yes Mr Roberts I did have a conversation with with Kyle earlier today because I just wanted to verify similar things that Vice said so Kyle between those two drawings what what is your take on which one you feel is even more accurate or is accurate versus the um basically the the picture from the bot well light Man Shirley is correct with property the appris lines do float a bit or just overlay GIS database so that's not exactly accurate um I did provide uh the design engineer was a plan from the uh first and second Street storm project um to give them a little bit more accurate survey lines um so they use that to give this rendering um it's not you know certified drawing so I I still think it's not completely you know it's not it would be better to have Sur EXA so if I could address the the property owner real quick does he need to come back up uh sure please come back up so hi again Mr Mrs missarah so um the drawing that you provided to us is that and I think I know the answer already based on the city manager coming is this a um Survey Company provided this or was this a a picture design drawing that the engineering firm put together it it came from spieler the engineering firm that would be doing the work okay so what what data and information did they use to provide the location of the property lines and and that type of information was it A current survey or or some other source I think the city what the city manager was able to provide them but but I'm I'm sure they had other information I'm not 100% sure what they use to to come up with the drawing one of the things that I see on it is that there's an easement between our lot and where Beller Beach's lot uh starts so that could be the confusion there I don't know that that's an Indian Rox right away that's gap between the two so that 20 foot Eastman is is in Ro to e 28th Avenue North right away ex the property but it's that allow to okay so the the two property lines are identified there and like you expressed earlier they kind of come to a wedge yes eventually out there and get so right now the pretty much the entirety of the existing dot is in the easan area it is okay I think that depends on what you're looking at right so so looking at photos do goes into South and that was just at overlay K who put that together that's right off this right okay at the pybs as well they're they're not to be used but unless we have a certified survey it's hard to know what we're really doing because this looks a lot different than what was presented so you know I mean considerably different if we provided you a survey of our property it do it doesn't have your line that goes out in the water but that is just an extension of the property would that I believe company is going to need to do provide us a better drawing they can serve a survey or can certify it as what I'm would be what I would I would want to look at I can't speak for anyone else in the council but I would just want to be sure that because we we are giving up our water rights by allowing you to build over right so I need to make sure I know when I'm thank you vice mayor Mr Banker first uh the only reason I didn't vote to amend the agenda keep your last is because when citizens get up more non agenda items they always have to wait for the end of the meeting to council to comment that said um has letters been sent out to like First Street Second Street Third Street Fourth Street people that use this Doc in this park um no find them of your request because is this going to infringe on their the site you um people going to the park because I think the citizens that use this park that live in that Mar is like any type of a variant request you'd have to notify that yeah there is no doc on that on that part yeah but I'm just saying we're trying to put in there is that going to encroach now with you it would just be that small corner and it wouldn't be like you would have any structure on it the lift is on the complete opposite side so basically you would have something level with the seaw wall it wouldn't where level with where they were standing so that wouldn't so there's not going to be any encroachment on vision from the people in this part that use the part the do they'd be able to see the the dot which is level with the seaw wall Mr Chester you have anything you'd like to say yeah the the only thing um there there is looks like a discrepancy between the drawings um looks like the overhead view it's right on the edge of the existing and on the Rend Steeler you're not quite there um I I will tell you I'm I'm a boat owner I I want to help you but um you know I'm with Frank you want to make sure that the people that use this we don't have something that's going to even though you're going to have a flat thing there if you had a 43t boat you're putting up on the lift you're going to to block the view of a lot of people so I don't think I'm just saying that that's it's happened to me right the boat lift is on the right side I understand that but you can be on the left side and trying to look out and if there's a huge boat on a lift there well you can't see there there is okay I'm going to have to have to we generally don't have a lot of I don't want to get into this uh I'm the only one who's not spoken yet so bear with me councel um I do feel their pain however that does not mean that I give them a pass and and I'll tell you why I bought a pie shap blot I I bought one of the smallest seaw walls in this community and I thought just like you I'm going to put a nice big boat out back and it didn't work work out so what I had to do was a lot of research on how to go as minimalistic as I possibly could I can tell everyone here the last thing that would ever happen in any Board of adjustments meeting would be to allow structure to span across into someone else's property anything that you add onto your existing dot that goes out or to the left is going to as far as I can take from all drawings that you've given us um it's going to come not only it's not only going to encroach it's going to invade into Bor Beach property once that happens now you've created a liability to our city and I know many people could say one way or the other that no that never happened but we seen all sorts of things happen um our I would never never give permission to someone in another Community to do something in our city that our own City would not do there are variances we we are are we try to work with people uh to a minimum uh so that they're not taking advantage of us uh and in this case I I see no way possible that I could approve this and I'm very sorry um and that's that's just where I'm going to stand on this any other questions or comments from the counsel yes Mr looking for U the possibility of of amending the request to where their dock extension in fact would not cross into our property instead of having like a rectangular shape it would effectively be a a trapezoid back in my geometry day so it would the left hand side of the dot would now run effectively parallel to the property line and then come over and then and then back down again so you're you're cutting off that triangle you can Envision that on the left hand side again Mr Roberts if you did that you are zero you are right on our propit line correct we don't do that for anyone well the existing guns are be there yes that would that's we have no idea how that happened and we weren't involved in that decision but um it did not involve the board of adjustments and never will go in front of the board of adjustments correct so my vote is is definitely no on this project Mr go in front of the board of adjustments at all or is this it will not it's not seeking relief from this city the only relief they're seeking from the city of b beach because this is Indian Rocks Beach property is that the Indian Rocks Beach uh process calls for them to get the input on what the neighbor's position on the issue is and in this unique case the city is the neighboring property owner and so that's why this is before you in the first instance so they can fill out the forms being asked of them in the adjacent jurisdiction to say what do the neighbors say normally the neighbor is you know two private property owners here the neighbor happens to be a local government and that's why it's before you at all that you're not passing judgment on the variance as it relates to the you know modification of the relief the relief requested here is in tandem with an application in another jurisdiction so um they're not really in a position to do that as they're here tonight can Council direct this to the board of adjustments no I mean not really because it's not it's not really a we're not regulating the matter at all it's really more of just a policy decision I will also add that um because of my design decision I currently am limited to a 26t Lo our is 242 I realized you could say we could buy a different vat down the road just any other questions or comments I thinker could get pretty creative and come up with some other designs too that can help you I I will I'm going to go ahead and add one more thing if if this was a resident on the other side of that park there is no way that they would be allowed to do what you're asking for just say so are you saying we're not even allowed to go up to that line in Belair Beach we're not allowed to go up to that line and so I I mean I can't do anything about the the existing dock uh but I can certainly stand up and say I don't agree with uh with making it even worse and it looks to me like you're going to cross right over and to b beach can we take a vote now thank you for your consideration I I suggest an amendment if the owners are okay with that based on what I said previously to where it would not cross excuse me cross the line so it would be parallel with the property am now granted it's going to be close I I appreciate the council member's effort to to try to develop some kind of compromise my my concern as your advisor here is you're being asked based on a form that's been submitted or is in the process of being submitted to another jurisdiction without giving any illegal advice to the property owner in the other jurisdiction they are coming to you for based on the relief they've sought elsewhere so if they've already I don't know where they are in that process if they've already made that submission to the other community have to modify those submissions and it's not just as simple as the mother mayi in that in that instance so I just want to make sure that's clear in the process you folks can proceed as you wish I ask a quick question what is our current setback on the do should know this 12T okay so that's what we mean 12 right from from our property line to and I do know that there have been exceptions but um not to the point of zero maybe down yeah there may be an opportunity to TW that a little bit my recommendation would be to tear down that dot and start over are we ready to take thank you any questions or comments all right can we just do this by a uh let's just uh do a Voice vote all in favor of um let's see yeah yeah I'm looking for the best way to okay um this is to approve a letter of no objection to build a dock extension that crosses Municipal boundaries and enters M Beach public property all in favor to approve it to approve it any opposed all right I'm I'm sorry sorry it's just too much all right now we are back in the natural order of things which is uh agenda item number 21 in the regular agenda this is for consideration of resolution 2023-24 d11 a resolution of the city of Delair Beach Florida calling for a special election of the city electors to be held on March 19th 2024 for the purpose of submitting to the city electors referendum question on an amendment to the Charter of the city of Beller Beach to propose increasing the number of permissible consecutive terms for a city council member from two terms to three authorizing the pelis County supervisor supervisor of elections to appoint pole workers authorizing the assignment of polling place and establishing an effective date um I I do want to take an opportunity to speak here mayor if I may this has been a first reading of resolution 2023 d11 by title only first and final reading the diff what we've done already you've already called for the election the ordinance contemplated that that the ballot language would be done by resolution and so what this does is specifically identify what the ballot language will be for that measure the ordinance contains all the other detail but when you submit a ballot question you have to provide the language you have to provide the title um which is limited to a certain number of words and also the ballot language which is limited to a certain number of words by Statute to the supervisor of election so for clarity and with with this um resolution the title is Charter me number one referendum increasing limit on consecutive terms the question that will be submitted should you approve this resolution in its current form is shall the city amend the charter to prohibit council members including the mayor from serving more than three consecutive terms as opposed to the existing limitation prohibiting a council member from serving more than two consecutive terms yes to amend the charter provision no to retain the existing chart provision and that's what's being proposed here everything else is the standard exor on the day of the election and all that stuff but that's really that section one is the meat of this and you'll see that with each of these resolutions thank you Mr MOA let's go to the citizens for comments on resolution 20 [Music] 23-11 all right CI and comments are now closed we have a motion to approve resolution surley M mat you have the floor um just said this was simply

item number 22 consideration of resolution 2023-24 thank you Mr Mayor this is City of Bell Beach resolution number 202312 a resolution of the city of B Beach Florida calling for a special election of

Belair Beach to propose reducing the number of council members on the city council from Seven members to five members authorizing the pelis County Supervisor of Elections to appoint pole worker pole workers authorizing the assignment of polling place and establishing an effective date in this case just for clarity in the record Mr Mayor the charter amendment is to reduce the title is Charter amendment number two reducing the city council to five members from Seven members and the question posed is shall the city amend the charter to provide for a city council composed of five with

cycle to accommodate such terms authorizing the palalas County Supervisor of Elections to appoint pole workers authorizing the assignment of polling place and establishing an effective day in this instance the charter title is Charter amendment number three increasing term of office from 3 years to four years and the question is shall the city amend the charter to provide that each individual term of office for City Council Members including the mayor shall be for four years as opposed to the existing three-year term beginning with the officials elected in 2024 and amend the regular election cycle to accomodate the longer election terms I want to be clear here just so that there's no misunderstanding because the issues have been um I would say combined in some of the discourse when we're talking about amending the election cycle here we're not talking about moving to November we're talking about adjusting the terms of office to account for these new longer terms and when will the when will that phase in and phase out based on the various seats on the council that's what that language is referring to thank you Mr MOA let's go to the citizens for comments seeing that we

authorizing the pelis County Supervisor of Elections to appoint poll workers authorizing the assignment of polling place and establishing an effective date this has been a first and final reading of resolution number 223-14 by title only this contemplates a a charter Amendment uh proposed Charter Amendment with the title charter liit number four conditionally aligning local election cycle with federal election cycle in November the question being posed if a majority of the city's electors approve an amendment extending council member terms to four years that was number three um shall the city also amend the charter to provide that its regular local elections for Council Members shall be held in November in general alignment with federal election Cycles as opposed to the existing requirement that regular local elections occur in March yes to amend the charter provision no to retain the existing Charter provision for clarity um for your purposes and for the public should this be reviewed later Charter amendment number four can only pass if number three passes um if number three fails and four somehow passes it will not become effective um this was that's why the language in the title is very specifically says conditionally I know we've sort of referred to these as as as sort of housekeeping or administrative or technical ballot language and ballot titles are are very critical when you're putting things to the electorate a lot of care was put into making sure we're capturing what's being done here so that's why it needs to thank you Mr MOA for explaining that let's go to the citizens for comments all right citizen comments are closed going to need a motion to approve resolution [Music] second by L Roberts you have the floor nothing D any other comments you call council member Banker council member Chester yes council member Noto yes council member Roberts I vice mayor Shirley I mayor GIS I resolution 2023 D14 team passes 5 to one all right now we are on to item number 25 this is consideration of resolution 2023-24 thank you Mr Mayor this is resolution 2023-24 calling for a general election to be held on March 19th 2024 for the purpose of electing three city council members for a full term of office and a fourth seat for the remaining tenure of a recently vacated council member position to establish the qualifying date in process for person seeking elective office for the 2024 municipal election authorizing the city manager to enter into an agreement with the supervisor of elections establishing the polling place for the March 2024 election authorizing the MS County supervis Zer of election to verify candidate petition cards and facilitate the election process and establishing an effective date this has been a first and final reading resolution 20237 by title only Council you saw a version of this resolution almost identical last month and it was approved this resolution is intended to supersede that one for because during that during the adoption process it occurred to me that there wasn't Clarity on what would happen because there are four vacancies and one of them is for less time than the other three and there was not Clarity on what would happen if you had less than five people run um and so what this resolution does is specifically address that situation uh what it the way it addresses it is first it retains the language from the previous um this is all set forth in section four of the resolution on pages two and three of four for this or page 93 and 94 of the PDF materials but what it says is in the event of an election where five or more people qualify the top three people get the full term fourth place gets the shorten term for the and this is for the remainder of Mr zable um Mr um member living Stone you may recall filled member gun seat so that term is already up um that's not an issue in this election this is for the seat vacated by Mr zel and now occupied by Mr Chester um and so that's how that will work fourth place gets the shortterm if four people qualify I tried to harmonize uh the the guidance given by this Council and provide that when they qualify they have the opportunity to volunteer to fill the shortened term the first person to do so will get the shortened term and that's how that will work absence a volunteer if they all say listen I just I'm I'm applying and I'd rather I just want to get in and I I don't want to sign up for the short term the way this will work is that pursuant to your Charter and general election principles each member will have been deemed to have voted for thems resulting in a four-way tie your Charter contemplates any tie will be resolved by drawing of lots and so we will have a drawing of lots to determine who would get the shorten term of those four qualifying members I looked at it a few ways but this is the way that I think is most consistent with the language in your Charter and otherwise um absent a direct volunteer saying I I do want to be that one uh and then finally if there are three or fewer um people who qualify those people will have been deemed to vote for themselves they will fill the the full terms any remaining vacancies let's say one person runs or three people run any remaining vacancies will be filled in the manner that you already fill vacan SE which would be by this commission after the election so once those two people let's say three people qualify and that fourth seat remains empty once those three people are sworn in this Council will then seek applicants to fill that position and fill whatever vacancies remain so it's the the whole Choose Your Own Adventure of it is set out here so that there's no confusion for public and for this Council on how the seats will be filled going forward uh just as candidly an oversight as I as I wrote it in something that I think especially given where your community is right now that Warren Mr MOA thank you for explaining that to us let's uh let's go to the council for comments I'm sorry let's go to the citizens for comments did a motion didn't we we've done so many of these I don't believe there's been motion sorry I got caught up in the moment thinking how many nights you kept me from being awake because you were up all night figuring this out all right so uh we went to the citizens for comments no one wanted to speak so Citi comments are now closed uh I'm going to need a motion to approve resolution 202 23-1 motion made by Lloyd Roberts I have a second second Frank all right Mr Roberts you have the Flor yes I think Mr Moore did a phenomenal job of explaining that and it sounds to me like all bases and combinations and permutations are covered um I think it's great Robert any other comments right again I would like to thank you for uh sorry just trying to make the meeting go some I was about to sing your Praises never mind all right uh Patty if you please call council member Banker yes council member Chester yes council member Nota yes council member Roberts I vice mayor Shirley I mayor gtis I so resolution 2023-the number 26 this is for consideration of resolution 2023-24 16 a resolution of the city council the city of B Beach Florida providing for an increase in solid waste collection and Disposal rates and establishing an effective date it's been a first and final reading of resolution 20236 by title only Mr Mayor thank you Mr Mo let's go to Citizens for comments all right the floor is closed going to need a motion to approve resolution [Music] now this is the next step to make that happen by the way they've um wasb I think has already done a pretty nice job out there I thought one of the things which seems like a minor change but I appreciate it when they come down my street they come down my street one time which also helps to protect the asphalt roads because the garbage trucks are one of the heavier pieces of equipment that drives out of us and came mess with the asphalt over time uh the previous Group which did a great job they came down one side went down and turned around somewhere and came back to the other side the current group is coming down one time and crossing the stream Gage which makes a lot of sense to in my neighborhood they have to do just one time or two times they do they have to turn around oh anyway Waste Management used to do that too when they first start you do which one Waste Management used to come down and collected one on both sides of the street and then they found out it was easier to do one side around the other side okay it's just less U Less tearing up with the roads if they can we can reduce that so effectively it's got it in half on my street so just a good thing okay well they uh they took my garbage off to for the first time and Hey whenever I pulled the can in it was empty so like like I got it right that's good all right any other questions or comments oh boy you must have your wife must take the trash out because the best thing is that the recycling has wheels instead of having to to about recycling now has wheels that's the best thing does everyone like that big container unless I unless like I think you're Pi alcoholic bottles I mean he's throwing up a container that size of one that's a little judgy is it you know occasionally we would we would run into overflow with our existing one and then right before this happened happens our 19-year-old son moves out and now we put nothing in there so uh I mean I I filled up my container but I take it out of the uh recycl that big container takes up space in the garage council member n you had a comment yes um I noticed that the first where ass Clause makes reference to the waste management contract nowhere in here does it reference Waste Pro I believe that was amended in the final form that was in the packet that went out that was caught earlier today and amended um we are we are aware of that and have amended it it's not the as you have that were circulated on Friday caught and address today thank you C any other comments all right since we're uh I think on this one still going to call council member Banker yes council member Chester yes council member Nota yes council member Roberts hi vice mayor Shirley hi mayor gavis hi so resolution [Music] during a recent Workshop um I believe it was the September meeting there was some discussion about member manager reers leave a cruel and the way that it works based on his incredible Devotion to this community uh and and seeming in ability to get to just take some time away absence does make the Arro fer however um with that he has he's acred more time than the Personnel manual contemplates that he should be able to do and this is directly ly um a function of him being a past employee before becoming city manager and the approval that we've made provision for in his contract when he was hired and so what I've after listening to your discussion and this is again for your consideration you don't have to accept this if you if this isn't a proposal you like I try to take your language or your discussion and turn it into something you can act upon um so what I what I proposed here for your consideration is an amendment to his to his agreement um there's this is a two-page document found on pages 98 and 99 of the PDF if you're working digitally and at the bottom of of the first page it's adding language to his um employment agreement governing leave that says not withstanding any provision in the city's Personnel policies to the contrary the manager May at any time between November and December of each year surrender and receive the full cash value of any leave time approved in excess of the 40 days he is otherwise permitted to accumulate and this was the the way this proposal would work is as it states in November December he could cash out if he's over budget in terms of his leave this I I've written it this way to balance the equities of him not being deprived of the value of the benefit that he's approved while also preserving as this Council made very clear the desire to encourage him to use that time and so it's not you can't use your leave time some places people use their leave time as a piggy bank at the end of the year and say okay I'm going to sell off 25 hours or 40 hours um this year CU I I need that money or for whatever reason um this encourages him only this allows him to only cash out any excess and then he's left back at 40 and then again it holds the policy that he um that he used the time that's acred up to his limit the other part of this that you avoid is and I've seen this in other communities where you don't where you fail to address this is when the employee Lees say oh my gosh I had 85 hours nobody was really tracking it except me because I'm the chief administrator I need to be paid out on this and then we take some larger Financial hit at a later date that we weren't anticipating so that's why this is structured this way it's a proposal of course um I have of course I've discussed this with Mr reefer it's my though he can speak for himself it's my understanding he's a lendable to this otherwise I doubt it would have found its way into the materials U but with that in mind that's the proposal for your consideration thank you Mr Mora would any citizens like to comment on this topic all right comments are now closed do I have a motion to approve this addendum sove motion made by vice mayor Shirley do I have a second second second by Will Roberts vice mayor Shirley you have the floor um I think this REM moralizes what we talked about in that work session and uh again to I encourage you to take time off there's nothing more important spending family did some RNR so um although I'm in support of this policy I still think you need to take a vacation I second to any other comments are you happy with this Mr City yes I approved it anyone else Mr Roberts so just a snapshot where are you now with respect to um days I'm at about 46 yeah on the annual anniv the anniversary of being official is that before this year annary in November believe it actually say I have vacation planned December 29th January 7 all right you're right it's not very long but he's got to come back any other comments no all right um can we do this with just a Voice vote that's fine all right all in favor I I I any opposed all right the addendum passage use some of that extra money while you're on vation okay uh so now we are up to item number 28 this is for authoriz this is to authorize the city manager to begin negotiations with uh candidate for the city clerk position uh city manager R thank you mayor uh just for some background um after had sorry city clerk Gentry uh made an announcement of her retirement date uh we agreed to uh advertise the the opening and we got that out on our website and message board on October 4th and uh city clerk kry also emailed the vacant position uh to the P County Municipal clerks Association and the uh Florida Association for City Clerks um so that it was posted on their websites as well and during that open period we re received four applications and I went through U the four applications which I included um as part of this as an attachment to this item and um I I reviewed the education the employment history specifically uh city clerk experience but also um experience with municipal government um and uh just the time in position um positions held in there history and I found that one candidate uh stood out above the others um that is Miss Sharon Renee Rose um I set up a zoom interview she currently lives in the state of Kansas so we inter interviewed her via zoom and um talked for just under an hour and uh the city CLK country is also part of that interview we're both very impressed um with how she answered her interview questions and at that point I'd like to that's why I got on the agenda to recommended to city council uh for you to meet her she's here tonight uh I'd like to say that I reached out um to her on the following week and um asked if it was possible for her to attend this meeting and uh with the understanding that you know it's coming up quickly and we understand if she couldn't and she got back within 2 hours and it all worked out so she's here tonight um M Rose um pleas come to the podium and like you to meet her good evening mayor and Council good evening I'm just here to introduce myself um I have 18 years of Municipal experience uh with the last being the city clerk's position in the city of gardener uh during that time that I've worked with the city of gardener we have grown exponentially I believe when I first started my position in public works we had around 10,000 uh citizens we are now approaching 25,000 and we become city of the first class in the next year uh through that time I've I've worked with the finance department I worked there for two years and then I was promoted up to the city CL position I said about 5 years ago Council would you like to ask any questions yes hi thank you first of all for making the trip down here uh we

impeccable it's right on target for what we're looking for so um what would you say that you like most about living in Kansas I've lived there all of my life um I can tell you one thing I dislike are the Midwest Winters so Midwestern what Midwest Winters okay I'm not a fan of the Midwest Winters uh my fiance and I have spoken for many years about trying to move further south uh wanting to live near water wanting to live near a beach he actually came down earlier this uh summer I think he took his job in March and so now it's time for me to come join him excellent so have you spent much time

see your round it you have a little bit you know because we're a really small City and we don't have a lot of staff so I you know I I know could be high this work but I think your knowledge could be helpful to some of the other departments so I appreciate you taking the timeing absolutely Mr Banker I think you're going to get hired welcome board I appreciate you coming wonderful and I've driven through Kansas but it's never been a destination for me but uh welcome to Florida thank you um resume very impressive wonderful addition to city thank you I'm very much looking forward to it I read

fairness um I'm going to bring in another person and let him speak also because uh there was another candidate who did apply and is here tonight uh but um at this point I'm leaning in your direction uh based upon uh the feedback that I received from Patty Gentry and from the city [Applause] manager so when would you be available to start I would probably be looking at a month I would like to give my current employers as I am a member of leadership at my current city I would like to give them at least 3 weeks notice and then another week to relocate to perfect so so finally could you rank in order of quality how you think the council members did tonight that any other questions or comments no thank you very much thank you all right asra would you like to come up and introduce yourself yes and uh hi my name is asra packles and uh I've been coming here all my life and uh I was here when they first started the walls for the and all the land was empty so I've seen a big changes that have occur I'm a dentist and I practice for over 20 years and also an insurance agent uh for my companies and I I'm a de go site so but I haven't done any work on any committees like U she has but uh I'd be willing to start right away and I live a couple of streets down and I'm very interested in this uh in b beach obviously all my life and seen it grow and uh with all the roads that were redone by L it it's really an incredible change and I'd be um I'd be very happy to take on the job I know how to run a practice and uh I also consult My Sister's medical practice on an unall basis in California uh at the moment so like I said I'd be able to start right away and uh be than what you think thank you very much M Packer do we have any questions or comments for we have any information from her I okay I see it right there per council members if we could avoid any for count please yeah I have a couple of questions um so you're a dentist why are you are you not did you dis close your practice or tell it or you not practicing well my mother uh she took ill and I had to sawell my dental practice and I was involved in some core trials for many years and uh I won all my core trials in Illinois and they said that I'd have to work on for like VA veterans if I wanted to get a job working here in Florida they don't have any positions open and uh otherwise we're underneath another dentist to change my license down here to Florida and uh other than that I I like I said I consult My Sister's medical practice as a dentist on a non call basis and I s Insurance even on that sites of Health lifelong and Care fix toties Medicare supplements it's a lot of CE so I'm very familiar with the laws that govern different uh structures and people who need financial help and uh I think it be very good uh I was also looking at other positions like U maybe like a um you know that that are close by and this is just down the street it's so perfect I can't even imagine other than working a little bit over the bridge so your goal was to be close to home is that right and I live here permanently now so it's been very nice to Che across the street from the well nice to meet you yes very nice to meet you and um if there are any other questions I'd be you're my neighbor as well yes so would you consider um just doing this would you keep on selling insurance as well what would well I'm on the D ofite I'd be probably selling it on the weekends maybe because this is a a big job and Patty's been doing a real lot of work so I'd be willing to probably not do that at all and I definitely my sister wants to retire in her medical practice so this would be a per Shob right Mr Baker do you have any questions I just as Mr Chester said Pat's like a Pat's overworked on P in my she's like a 247 right is there more hours than 24 that Kyle I don't know I don't think you'd have any free time right that's there wouldn't be any free time to do anything else you know you need code too or pardon me you know the Ming code of the city ordinances how to load it and how to interpret it no I have to talk to Patty on how to do it but I'm very good at the computer I'm on it all day usually and I'm also a freelance writer so I was also thinking of paralal job but that's over 10 hours a day Mr Mr do you have any questions I like b beach and I I love the people here and I think it would be a good a good we'll see what you say thank you m pack it's very nice to meet you and I know that I I know you already and council member Chester that was since you were here you can at least introduce yourself thank you very much give us your history thank you okay uh now that we we have met Miss Rose we also met Miss Pack M Rose was the candidate that was recommended by city manager reer Mr reer do you have anything You' like to add just like to reiterate that I was highly impressed with uh her uh experience in government the fact that she was working for the city in Kansas for for 19 years and progressed uh from Public Works Administration uh up to uh finance and then into a deputy clerk position and then four years as a city cler um in talking to her um she's very educated has a lot of background I think she could bring uh a lot of her experience into this city and it would be a benefit thank you Mr reer let's go to the CI for comments anyone like to speak C comments are now closed before we go any further I'm going to need a motion to authorize the city manager to begin negotiations with Renee Rose you I'm sorry I'll just hold that for one second um you are not obligated to vote uh yes um you can vote no and there majority of no then uh the city manager will have to dig deeper I just wanted to make that clear so the motion is made by Frank Banker do I have a second second by Lloyd Roberts Mr Banker you have the floor I think we've seen both candidates um pretty clear of this election I think we should go to a vote call in the question yeah all right um so this is this is to authorize the city manager to begin negotiations with Renee Rose all in favor I I any opposed all right thank you both very much for applying as well as the other two candidates um M Rose I look forward to working with you if it works out and thank you so much for coming tonight and introducing yourself to the council Mr Mayor if I may just for clarity in the record you have authorized the manager to enter into negotiations with the candidate um at a later date would be the formal appointment on establishing the the date um of service salary Etc um so we will appoint at a subsequent meeting um but thank you for your authorization so we can move forward with the negotiation process M Mr Mayor question since she'll take at least a month uh from the time I guess she accepts your contract who's going to be going in for Patty she's leaving in a couple weeks and Laura and your your new administrative assistant too right yes so it'll be myself Laura Mone and Jen Jennifer and uh Patty before she leaves is going to kind of lay everything out that we uh need to get through I'm confident that we can do it and you really think three or four of you can replace one and with that in mind we'll also move with all deliberate speed on the process that was my next question this is if a special meeting is appropriate or necessary we will we will schedule one um if we can come to terms sooner than later um this is not something we'll just sit on until week M since you for that up we don't don't need a special meeting if the two of them can come to chch corre no the commission the council needs to aill it is a charter position the council needs to to fill it you've authorized him to negotiate I would strongly recommend a formal appointment of the position not simply an authorization to negotiate much like when you say you authorize him to negotiate the RFB but them ultimately bless the RFB I think it would be similar to that the uh Resolute or the uh question was to begin negotiations not finalize negotiations um and U the City attorney and I have already discussed a special meeting possibility of a special meeting if we can come to terms the only reason I bring this up is because she wants three weeks noce to our employer plus a week which is agreeable but is it going to be two more is it going to be five weeks that we're talking about 6 weeks you know what I'm saying until this process is hammered out because she's I'm sure you're not going to get noticed until you reach a settlement I think you're asking for an unknown variable right now it's it's something that they're going to have to work out and make sure that everybody's on the same page but I can assure you uh as soon as we get the word we will move as quickly as we can and as we as we talk procedure with the understanding you may have um ones or or family in the area there would not be a need for the candidate to return um for the purpose of the appointment we can do that if you will that won't be a hurdle to the process and I don't want you to worry ma'am about you know cost and otherwise but as far as that process again we will move with all speed I've been in communities where we were without a manager and and a clerk at the same time trust and believe I do not wish to be there and put my team in that position thank you Mr Mo all right we are moving oh Qui question how long do you plan on staying now before you head back to Kansas I actually have a plane out tomorrow morning at 600 a.m. okay so you have until then thank you thank you all right now we're on to item number 29 this is to authorize the city manager to put uh the storm water project out for B take away Mr Reaper thank you mayor uh so this is uh the combined storm water project just to take it back um this is what we did a capital Improvement Revenue note for in April um we've been working with engineering and Sciences specifically very fuy PE and uh he's been designing the project to cover the areas of of the remaining bmps of our storm water update at the time in 2016 and uh through uh some work sessions uh We've uh come up with the bid documents the uh technical specifications and the finalized plan and uh with city council approval we'd like to advertise this uh to this project about the bid on uh November 8th uh Wednesday and I'm going to put that on uh the online bid system demand star which I believe will re reach be far reaching um as as opposed to the way in the past where we stuck it in the newspaper and on the website I believe we're going to get a lot more um just by the nature of how demand start works it blasts it out and any contractor that does these type of construction projects are going to be notified so I'm confident that we should get some more bids than we're used to thank you Mr reefer let's go to Citizens for comments i' like to speak yes we have a citizen who wants to speak good evening everyone my name is Kim Shaw Elliot I live at 1219 Street I had the opportunity to talk to you guys some months ago when I was very pleased to support the bond issue for this storm Improvement system um and at that time I recommended that uh we take this as an opportunity to really study the needs here and to make sure that we're not rebuilding what we currently have which may or may not be adequate um and that we can really plan for the future in terms of looking at um all the climate changes that we're experiencing and and being safe in in future years so since then we've had a few opportunities for learning uh we've been through our storm season it's not quite finished but uh we did have a hurricane and then from the vantage point of my evacuated safe place um I watched as water came up 9th Street our my street uh we did have some damage um I likely was fine so that was good but um I certainly concerned about neighbors and a street is a street that had gone through the current improvements um and did experience some damage to the properties there I also watched as literally one of our former council members kayaked down history so so we we know we're in the face of some extreme weather ahead so with this project which is a wonderful project um I have some questions and one is is how does this differ from what we currently have so that we're not just be rebuilding something that we know isn't sufficient for current uh climate conditions so how does this differ the second question is um if so then what are the improvements what are we doing now under this plan that we don't currently have and the last and most important one is are those changes adequate are we are we properly providing for our futures and thanks very much thank you Michelle um we have another guest here uh who may be interested in coming up to the podium and maybe answering some of those questions well good evening mayor council and uh thank you for allowing me to be here and uh I believe you know the answers uh the questions that she has now we do address uh a lot of those questions and uh the way we're uh developing this project is to make sure that we're not coming back in 5 years or eight years that we are building a sustainable project being from the use of the uh to Road material the asphalt the uh the storm system the curbs and making sure that you know what we put in is going to be in for a a good good life so that's you know that's how we look at each each one of these from a storm water system uh you know the existing culs are there and we make sure that they drain and they don't leak and the water goes downhill so we make sure that we we got that make it to work uh I guess if anything else you know as far the project be glad to answer some questions when uh we came in for the work session and I really appre your caner and everything like that um we talked about 9 Street and he said we going to add in another drain and I said what's that going to do when it fills up so the other drain will carry maybe another 100 gallons of wood okay you aditt without once the water comes above the Alle okay it's not going to drink so at the end of the day we're going to be getting the same results in heavy stor that we have now um and I know NWI pumps contacted you yeah and the only the only solution here is and we one of our the prayer tonight was for wisdom and I hate seeing our money being spent on something that's not going to work not one person on this Council would surely have a contractor come in and have a problem in their house and the contractor says yes I can repair this you're going to get the same results okay not one person would spend their own money on this I think you've done a marvelous job in everything you've done but the only way to alleviate this water is to pump it out and I've had council members saying well once it breaches the seaw wall BR you know it's you're done you're in the DAT with water true but not true okay that last storm there was 2 to 3 fet of water in the streets at midnight water never breached the seaw wall till about 8:00 in the morning then it was too late if the pumps we had pumps working in there them streets would have been dry when those that would have breached the seaw wall meaning you wouldn't have gotten water in your driveway I wouldn't have gotten water in my driveway all right we need to put this plan and I want to go forward with the plan we need to put this plan at Bay right now now NWI is coming in I'm not saying they're the ones that are cause solution here but this is foolish money being spent this time because you're going to get the same results as you have right now at the end of the day now I I agree and I've looked over the MWI and I'm familiar with those kind of pumps and have designed those down in South FL so I'm familiar with the materials and what they've done and they're a good outfit for sure the uh the type of uh you know I think one of the others underground Vault or maybe something underground that we can do I looked at that and how to design that and there's you know the size of it and the volume to make sure that that it would even work we have a lot of utilities underneath the street you know we got Force man we've got water Ms and other time so the underground utilities made a underground Vault other than and digging up the road uh very difficult uh to you know to try to fit in there and make that work the pump idea we've looked at and I think in my discussions with MWI with what they're doing that's that's a reasonable solution you can place one of those in an area where we won't have utility conflict and then it would operate kind of like a sanitary live station essentially what we're doing and something like that can can be uh placed uh in the area on 9th Street down at lowan and have it pump out north to the creek out to the out to the Bay so that's something we've looked at and I understand MW is coming here so I S information on on night Street be glad work with them or if they have any questions I'll be glad to answer any questions they might have to give them as much information that they would need to give what they would recommend what I'm saying is City Hall is located right off the Ninth Street this this could be the jewel or Diamond of getting showing how we can get rid of Flo okay and we have that opportunity we have that money right now that we can see spend and solve problem not saying it's going to solve a problem under a cat 5 okay but it would probably solve a problem up to a cat 3 well it a Sol problem as far as uh when you have enough water coming in it can't get out we had a high tie a few weeks ago sir and um it was in all over the driveways of 9th Street 8th Street 7th Street all the way down up to up to 12 Street where it just be right because it just can't get out yeah no that's it just can't get out there so I pump is is a solution Mr Roberts um a quick question for you and of course I could do the math but approximately what percentage of our overall costs are actually being used for the the road improvements and the gutters as compared to the dollars that are being spent to replace the limited linear feed of pipes on our project I don't have the exact would you say it's a significant majority yes okay significant majority and Frank you keep referring to this as a waste of money the majority of this project is for Road improvements and gutter improvements there are many many many roads out there that are in dire need of work so the majority of this particular project is in fact the roads and go we don't want to BU your we've said this from the beginning that we don't even need a storm we just need big rains big rains and a high tide are going to result in flooding every timei under a 70y old plant you are absolutely corre sir but this is 2023 okay the roads that you're talking about why would you want to repave these roads when you possibly might have to dig them up to put in a system that will work correctly one at a time the roads right now that you're talking about that need replacing they do have cracks in they're crack they're heat cracks it's from stress okay they're going to crack you can go down a street they're cracks and it just was repaid a few years ago okay you're talking about what's what's the uh binding you're going to be putting down like 1 inch one and A2 inch it's 1 in to one and half so when you only put on one inch it's going to crack I mean I don't care how much of a tap coat you put down underneath that it's going to crack with the heat so why why don't we do this correctly we're taking a big bond out we have a storm surge tax we pay everyone let's do it correctly so what is the definition great get rid of the water as he agreed the pumps will get rid of the water Mr you shake your head okay because you don't have a FY problem hold on Mr Reaper I'd like to hear your opinion on this uh I'd like to bring up that we are um installing 2 24 in U oneway valve on the Swale system at uh basite par so that is going to be a change that's going to affect um this Elliot Elliot Street um it won't prevent everything because eventually um if you hold the water back it'll go right over the crow of the road and eventually make it street that did contribute because as the water rose up it went right through that 24in pipe into the uh drainage retention area and then as that buil it went to that backyard property um that's to the south of it and kind of made it way around um so that is one change and it's a it's a it's a economically feasible change um my concern with the pump system I like the idea and I think that it could take it to a whole new level but I I believe that the cost that we're going to look at to put these pump systems in place is going to be considerably more than our average storm water project we do with Beach um and I think our our storm water project that we are doing is significant because it is reinforcing and um refurbishing our our existing system as well as um reshaping the curves we have a lot of issues throughout the city where we have water um holding in the curbs a lot of residents do not like that and there's a lot of streets that are in a terrible condition so we are taking care of issues in b beach um I I would really like to try the idea of pumping out the water I think it couldn't solve especially certain areas yours being the extreme ones in the city um but at this point I don't believe that we when we did the uh bond issue we set aside um and estimations on that type of system um I think that would be something that we look at in the future to solve this problem um and I like to entertain Mi MWI pumps um to see what they have so we can kind of get a a understanding of what kind of costs we be looking at Mr reefer um whether you added pumps or not would you still require the same infrastructure to successfully drain water throughout our city yes um our existing infrastructure I I think it's it's a good design um that works most days of the year um but as our title water does come up and we get heavy rains it doesn't always work the water has nowhere to go I think when we uh went through and added the check valve systems they work to an extent um and I think that's a very important problem we did solve is you know staying on top of them maintaining them because when that water was coming up when you have a sunny day there's no real reason we should have that that that last event we had where everything was underwater for a little while um that was high tide and a rain event is that correct yeah it was a increased high tide we actually got a weather notification that it was going to be a foot higher than normal and then we got on the rain okay so if if if you don't have pums pumps are the only thing that you could change Beyond this project then it's something we would look into but um under no circumstances once a check valve closes and you have an extreme rain event are you not going to get through is that correct well if you don't have a p if you don't have a p you're going to have so even if if Frank got his way and got pumps in we would still be doing this infrastructure project exactly as described is that correct I don't yes because I don't think the design of this project um is any kind of spending money where we don't need to uh take care of issu with the existing infrastructure and like I said we need to redo the curving and the as well all these are due um per the the index that we've been using over the last four years now and you feel that the uh the extra valve you're it's an extra valve you're putting in it' be an additional valve okay and where is that valve located again it's going to go on the Swale Bayside Park which is I believe just north of my har Mr Banker you have the oh sure I'm sorry everybody I just want to say Mr thank you for all your work don't forget that we retired this firm is because we need an engineer to figure this out none of us up here her Engineers his firm has I know Mr fluty has done nothing but storm management design for years I've known him for many years and does a great job have a 55 to 60y Old system that has never been repaired never before has the city put money into infrastructure so we're making up for those shortfalls for all these many years that we've done no work to infrastructure I commend you for you've done you guys are doing a great job I think pumping water from the street into a Swale and moving it from one place to the other is still going to flow to the low end doesn't that water flows downhill no matter where you're at we can't change the elevations of these older homes unless they're knocked down there's no way we can have to manage expectations and that's one thing I think where we're may be falling short we're not conveying to Residents we're not going to fix the problem we're trying to alleviate some of the issues but by no means this this deferred maintenance does not fix the problem it help some of it but we're going to continue to have some flooding issues we live on a Barrier Island when tides are hot we're going to have issues there's no way we can fix that unless we scrape the whole p and start over that's the only way we can fix it and so you know I commend everything you guys have done this is great I you know I'm so thankful that we're moving forward with all of this and I in total support of your time thank thank you thank you vice mayor Shirley and well spoken um Mr Naro you've not said anything would you like this I agree with what VI May has said we can't we can't stop the rain we can't there some things we just can't control um and this alleviates a lot of the problems thank you Mark Chester uh I agree I we need to do everything everything we can it's reasonable but when we moved here we realize what we're moving into and when we purchased the home that we did we made sure we got something that was as high as we can you know within the parameters of what we have I I plus I like having a nice smooth street that uh you know and that the water runs out better we also discussed I think it's a good idea to get to people to where we're not blocking the uh the drains by putting things out that I mean we're doing that to ourselves so there's there's often times where I mean I we had it with construction on our street where because there's so much debris that the construction brings that it um inhibits the ability for you know water to drain like it should but I don't think one is exclusive of the other I think I like the idea of moving forward getting something done thank you Mr Chester I I would like to thank you sir also for being very patient with this Council I know it's a uh it probably takes a lot out of you every time you come here but uh I appreciate your perseverance and hanging in there with us and and I think we're almost done with this I just want to Mr Banker I'm going to give you the last go right ahead well earlier we one of the council members said because we're smarter smarter doing it 65 years the same way with the technology we have today that doesn't seem too smart to me I come from the heavy Highway infrastructure business storm order all right this is ridiculous what we're doing all right true okay streets need to be repaved okay but you have technology in front of you you shouldn't go forward until you have the other company come in and explain what they can do now as he said you could put a catch Basin in or a B all right they're very hard to put in places I agree with you with underground wiring or anything like that N9 straet the park you could put an underground B in there all right easily all right and that would really reduce flooding in a bunch of areas all right but this Council who says they're smarter I think will vot to go ahead is something that will not work and you agree with me sir without getting the pumps to move the water heavy rain storm surge we're going to have the same effect so I don't have know how how we're smarter than the other communities thank you thank you Mr Baker I'm going to close the floor I'm sorry let take 10 seconds just to clear the record my feelings are heard from vice mayor saying there's no Engineers I am a professional engineer in the State of Florida and the class a certified contract so just one well now I have to give Frank the last word storm water management yeah civil engineering does involve did you do I work for M for 20 years as well what storm water management did you do with PP can you give me one I for the whole all of our sites that's with M all right gentlemen all right gentlemen that's enough ask all right so uh I think what we're going to do just for the record we're going to take this to a roll call if everyone's ready we shall begin P would you please call the roll council member Banker no council member Chester yes council member M Noto yes council member Roberts vice mayor Shirley I mayor GIS I am so Mr reer you are authorized to proceed it was 5 thank you man all right and 30 is already complete so now we are on item number 31 much sir I appreciate it this is for consideration of approval of a piggyback agreement with Calvin gor Dan Associates for Land Development code revision this was put on the agenda by city manager re okay thank you mayor this um this is an agreement uh we discovered as we talked about in the um budget planning process uh we'd like to do a code uh review uh primarily the uh the Land Development code sections of our code with some other sections incorporated as well so um in that process uh before um when we were planning the budget I've I reached out to some firms to get an idea of um kind of costs we would be looking at to do such a venture and um we budgeted the uh amount of $30,000 for code revie and our contractual services operating budget and uh so um in the process of trying to uh find an agreement on existing agreement that we could piggy back um I was working with City attorney ashenfelder Indy sorry City attorney Mo's colleague and uh he pointed out that r t of rton Shores did a uh very similar project and they went out an RFQ and uh produced um Mr CA who was a planning director with um Calin G and Associate and they're out of clear water so U when I looked at the the uh agreement that t r Shores had in place um I noticed that he has a lot of experience in this area he's local and the nice part about it is is um he is a very good per hourly rate um so um after discussion with uh attorney eeld there we reached out Mr CNA um and he got the approval U from his uh Executives to piggyback that contract for our project um so we'd be working at the 156 per hour rate um I worked um through the agreement and the existing project scope tyton shes at and um set it up for our purposes and um I included that here my intention is if we approve this P contract to authorize give a work authorization to Mr CERN um with this project scope and I've already passed this for review and it's agreed that um this is well put together scope and um it includes um if you read through it includes you know the task of uh reaching out to the community and finding out on gting inl as far as the uh you know parts of our code that need to be reviewed need to be updated um I've already put together my own list my basis scope and the sections that go a lot to do with what I've seen in in the past year um just by reviewing the code and variance process and all that um and then he's going to provide a first deliverable um where he's going to review all this ex of code and he's going to um give an analysis write recommendations of how to change the code and why um and prepare a draft strike through which uh we would present to the um to the planning and throwing board which be the Land Development board um first uh where they would give their input at that point um with a recommendation to come to city council um where we would provide where he would develop the ordinances that would be necessary for changing the code um in this process mind you with the Senate bill um 250 um which we cannot increase uh make code more restrictive until October october24 um so the timeline being we take care of all this um uh discussion and and drafting of the ordinances which he's also included the now necessary um impact economic impact studies that have to go along with it but we get this all uh reviewed in place to um bring this ordinance so that's kind of the the gist of the whole plan um and again U this contract or piggy back in this contract and using this so um at the quoted hourly cost um not to exceed 23,40 based on the hours he feels U would be necessary to accomplish our project um and I just want to point out that's under our budget because we didn't um put funding in our general budget for 30,000 so I think we're looking to stay under it with a very qualified firm he also included his res and all his working experience feel confident about this thank you Mr reer I don't think we have any citizens to come anyone like to um Mr laa would you like to give any feedback on this topic uh just to add as as uh manager reer alluded to to my colleague Rob E Felder who worked with Mr Ser the community and is also very familiar with the procurement process to view this um as far as a code rewrite I do want to be clear um one that we we offered to do a version of this um but what you're looking at here are your Land Development regulations and while I can provide you proposed Land Development regulations that are legal um that's very different than looking at them from a planner's perspective and harmonizing those with the with the planning a planner's vision and a community's vision that's not always a Boyer strong suit and that's in that regard and capturing you know vision and Mission versus yes you can do this so of course I will be reviewing and and working with Mr CERN and manager reer as we navigate this process as manager reer alluded to with sen Bill 250 and it's and it's limitation on adopting anything that is more burdensome or restrictive there may be some that are placed in oper for adoption at a later date or we determine do we need to make it this way to accomplish the community that's that's my commentary but I'm happy to answer any questions thank you Mr MOA um we need to go to the councel for a motion I have a motion to approve approve the piggyback agreement that motion was made by Frank Banker do I have a second second second by vice mayor Shirley Mr Banker you have the for I think Mr reer and Mr Moore is explaining other comments or questions from the council I would just like to comment that this is something that's much needed we've always gone to Citizens for review of code and as a result we have uh a lot of issues with our code that um little holes that probably need to be closed up and um maybe some things that don't um meet what we're trying to achieve and um you know with as it relates to code and building code that sort of Think Clearly we're not doing a whole lot to change the land use but we're getting professional involved to help us with the process of cleaning out other questions or comments from the council I I guess I just to point out there are some sections of code that have come up to the board of adjustment um variance after variance Happ to do pool elevation things like that that would actually be less restrictive but would take care of something that we keep on braning Varian as for so some things we could take care of now obviously we're in a moratorium right now to where we canot make anything more restrictive but already some things have cropped up that we want to visit uh so are you going to make sure that these items are brought up and they're uh so we have instructions for the future once the moratorium is lifted because obviously we're going to be cleaning up code like crazy for a little while but eventually it'll settle down and then the moratorium will be lifted we're going to want to go go back but I don't want to feel like we've wasted our money and now we don't know what we're doing um so what what's the plan for hand so I mean the plan for that is is just um kind of the scope description of the project it's going to be uh as we move through the process um especially first and foremost I mean I have my list I know what that have been an issue um for the city in some some areas that we're that people are not actually following through because they're just need to be changed or adjusted so that they enforced um but I think most important it's it's the very start of it is conducting it says conduct a workshop with the planning and zoning board and or city council introduced project ticket but I think I would like to do like Forum to the whole Community um so that it is public also here every Source possible just to see if there's anything we are missing um that we can look at and then moving forward from that um you know that's where the professional the planner comes in and he looks at this these problems and he comes up with by his experience with other communities what what he thinks would work best best for us um and then gives recommendations that we that we discuss and work through but I don't think any of this would be lost um because we'd be going through the process and we be we would have um you know these documents and deliverables that we would keep um for the plan to to create ordinances other questions or comment Council all right well in that case this is kind of a big deal so hey I'm going to do a roll call vote on this one because it's always serious stuff we're dealing with our municipal code so PNY would you please call the rooll council member bankard yes council member Chester yes council member Noto yes council member Roberts I vice mayor Shirley I mayor GIS I so the motion carries unanimously and Mr Reef you are authorized to proceed thank you all right we are up to item 32 where's Mike Z when you need all right uh this is for consideration of Marina slip weight list policy and Marina license in use of city manager please take it away okay so these are um two documents uh the main document is the one we've been discussing um over several work sessions I believe it's coming up on a year if not more um but it is to revise the which is admin policy number 12 which is the ear waiting list policy um you know it was put into the place back um originally issued in or the existing version was issued in 2010 and um sort of a lot of things have changed in the city since the original weightless policy was put in place um and it's been brought to our attention but from residents that are on that uh waiting list um that we we should look at um changing how it works to better serve the residents of the community U we've done a lot of uh analysis and different members Council have taken it and come up with some ideas and looked at other examples and and we're at the point now where I think we've kind of looked at everything considered what we want uh the marina 2B and uh what our goal we're trying to get to is and we've um came up with a policy that will get us to our goal and provide a more fair um process to the residents so that if they get on the list they feel like they can eventually get in the marina um and then along with this document is the agreement the license AG for an actual SLI and our City attorney MOA went through it uh legal review changed some wording added some wording and the main thing I wanted to change in this was the section 3 e which was the late payment charge because the old version was set at a late payment charge of $15 per month and I thought that was extremely low um given what the average cost is per month um I work with the attorney and we agreed that $100 per month is more realistic to try to motivate somebody toate with pay um so that's really the only major major change of that so um again this is to uh approve the waiting list policy um I did I think did Issue it before the work session we mentioned um between uh that work session and now um comments i't any additional comments but um I would like to you finalize a policy and then work to um put it into effect and um you know we have an existing list uh we have we know all the time the timeline of when each resident got on that list um so I think the fa most Fair Way um to to Institute this new policy would be to reach out to the person who's been on the list who's a resident based on all the ranking we Define in our policy and then go one by one and let them choose which list they want to be on and then establish a new list and then moving forward from there so website forms all to constructed from the policy um one other thing um this policy clearly defines that uh nobody in the same um nuclear family or household can have um can have a more than one slip and we um we do have one name that came up there is a uh was once a resident no longer a resident but she has two slip agreements in her name um so by our new policy she would have to relinquish one of the slips to uh be following the policy um it was brought to our attention that that we were looking at this instituting this policy and she reached out to me um and went over the history of how she got those two slips um long story short she got her first slip in 20 2 it was slip 10 um in 2008 another slip was open um it was not I guess she was told that if she put the slip in her name um that it would allow her to have a cheaper rate with since 2008 which is slipped 17 um it was always for uh another res well not a resident but a boat owner at the time um Mr banka who's still has a boat in that s it's just um from that time period on her name has been on both slips it's caused issues for the city because when people get put records They See as somebody in the city has their name on Two slips so why do they have two slips um but she is adamant and telling me that the only reason it was in her name is because she had a resident um I guess res established residency and that it would it got a cheaper rate at the time since then we've raised the fees um when we did the resolution both these slip uh renters pay their non-resident fee today um she insists that they do not share a household and they are not family in any way she is respectfully requested that um it be considered by counil this one circumstance to let Mr banka um sign an agreement for his sub7 under his name continue the use um with the boat he has in it um and again they both have taking these s and install their own lists um so they've invested um in using R Marina for quite some time her over 20 years him over 15 so I Council consideration to in this one circumstance put the Mr Ban's name on the agreement for sub 17 Miss Z remain 15 TMI exactly let's go to the citizens for comments before we keep this conversation would anyone like this me all right uh say the comments are now closed we need a motion to approve the updated Marina slip weight list policy motion motion made by Frank Banker do I have a second second second by vice mayor Shirley Mr Banker do you have the floor Mr briefer well explained it all right and I'll explain my comment is that um that's another issue entirely um right now we just need to need to the um this motion out of the way for the updated Marina slip weight list policy and uh then we'll see what happens afterward any comments Mr Mr Chester we have anybody that's habitually late on WE we've had somebody like that and um when I looked at the policy an agreement I was like well I wouldn't be would made the pay either um right we he s c back up because we you know we do reserve a right to um to cancel or terminate their lease um so we did get it back but I still think it would be better to have something that like someone would not want your oh I agree I think I'm for going up exponentially absolutely especially we have weight list what comments um I'm okay with the weight list you know I would love to not have to address the marina again um we keep rehashing this I just going through the licensing agreement I'm not maybe I'm overlooking it but we don't require the vote owners to have insurance or it's home okay it just doesn't guess I didn't see spell that yeah we we keep track of the expiration date on current policy it also helps us um make sure that the same M but we go through I created an Excel spreadsheet that goes red when they're coming up on expiration get copy a lot of them set it up so that the insurance be automatic does that have I've never seen anything called anything on I don't I'm not seeing it in our agement what our limits are what our requirements are we they indify the city not I whole lot about insurance but I'm just saying I don't know attorney MOA have you looked at this and with regards to that that those are my only comments is going making sure we have problem in place you know the marina to Residential Properties and is it necessary to have something that there's an oil spill or F SP or boat sinks because I'm seeing a lot of boat sinking nearby and I'm really getting sensitive to that I I did review the agreement I I did not specifically look at insurance coverage and writers relative to those issues I know that in the um on the agreement on page two it has language specifically stating that um the licy shall no rubbish ear tackle or obstruction shall be placed in or around the slip or any other part of the Marena no trash garbage oil gasoline untreatable fluid other pollutants shall be discharged into the Waters of Marina so we you know we could recognize that as a breach terminate um where we where we find somebody in violation that rights terminate fora without as far as the insurance there is provision on form for the insurance there is not a as as I'm reviewing it now there's not a specific insurance Quantum or specific coverage um Fields um that's that's addressed in the I I don't know doesn't need to be I guess that's a question for you should it be we can certainly do that I mean it does say emergency movement boat and insurance on page five of the agreement it says in the event of emergency trying to find the language um there the licy is solely responsible for any liability connected to the see agrees that at all times during the period um they will maintain general liability property dent servance on the boat accessories and contents and amounts acceptable to the city so it's it's not a stated amount um that is where the language is paragraph 10 um and so we can we canate by you know if you come to us and you report to Mr reer I've got my insurance here it is I got $500 of coverage that's not that that's an acceptable the and you can State you know what the mean medor V is of our of our other register V owners and what what is customary if we wish to State it we should we should have a minimum if we wish to make a minimum we can set that we can and this isn't being done by resolution ordinance that's that's an administrative policy so if you direct a manager to to amend we can amend in that fashion without the need to have another 30 40 minute discussion on the yeah no I agree no I agree I think that would be my biggest uh my only com so pilot can address that my recommendation would be since we have I'm assuming everyone here is in agreement with the weight list policy everybody okay with it um we go ahead andove this make new amendments and then um vote for approve the license agreement I mean we've got a temporary and it's just a matter of voting on The upates not I thought that's what you yeah we don't need this to come back as long as you know in generally speaking the manager had the authority to do this without all without necessarily another hearing on it but given the commission or council's um stated interest and and extensive discussion on the matter he and I agreed it would be best to bring it before you just to say hey here's what I'm going out with since we talked about it so much but if if you're generally amendable to this he can make those amendments or we can make those amendments without the need to have hearings this isn't an ordinance it's not a resolution it's really an administrative policy agreement we don't we wanted your general blessing before we move forward with this if we need to make line minutes we can make those without further hearings are there any other comments from the council Let's uh let's let's do a roll call again council member Banker yes council member Chester yes council member Noto yes council member Roberts vice mayor Shirley hi mayor G us I new policies approved it's unanimous all right we
