    "transcript": "[Music] would you like me to call the role yes okay jc inval rudy davis angela berry brenda buenosero wanda schweer laura mataloni lynn reeves no no sir no no sir okay we're supposed to move a might here and there for the people here and there can you hear all right everybody can hear all right through these masks okay with uh i was approached by our city manager if our committee would be willing to look over the code situation for this ensuing year due to the law and that's what we all consented to at the time so we can proceed with this that the item would be review the proposed charter the city code and this is a kind of an overwhelming situation i would like to call on our city manager to give him give us his perspective of what is required of us seeing we consented to do this if you go down to where it says actually the word should be chapter six sections but section chapters 2 10 30 54 94 there's some existing codes that we need to make some adjustments to 94209 to match with what it says in 62-73 we need to delete some words like the police department in 94 to 256 and 5435 will even revise the fees so what what i'm going to suggest is maybe the best thing to do is have you kind of review the codes and take a look at them and see if there's anything in here that you think needs to be changed in those five chapters there is one area that we need to look at and that is we don't really have a quote about docks and seawalls and i'm going to pass this out to you i've got an example of more detail from the very beach and i want to try to integrate the docs and see walls into the update thank you that says as an example in the therapy uh what what the city councils wanted to do with the docks and sea walls is to get a little more teeth in it because if if we or someone in the city does an inspection on the seawall typically we don't have that ability unless it's a house sale like we had a seawall that fell in on bay and they were notified that they needed to get an engineer because we had a code the house was going to sell so but before it closed the c won't go in so uh they they just want to get a little somehow get a mechanism that's a little more stringent that we can say to people hey you need to have an engineer look at this not and we could say the same for um both dogs over the last few years we're kind of cruising around the uh the little coves a lot of the sea walls were damaged from the waters that were some of them actually started to crumble and until had been fixed the last time we went out there's still some that are in really really bad disrepair and that needs to be covered yeah and and that's really what you know we want to try to assemble something that's reasonable you know we aren't trying to be a timer we're just trying to say hey you've got a sequel we did do a survey of the city and we had with the 26th floor 20 26 notices that we gave to people and it was a sea wall or a dock that wasn't maintained and we got you know some of them as an example it might just be the cap is cracked or chipped off the seawall itself was fine it was the captain's crack so we notified people that gave them courtesy notices since you know they might want to check their seat so and we'll we're going to start doing that quarterly going out and seeing if the sea walls got worse or we took pictures of all of it and then after the storm laurel went out and we picked up some more docks that were damaged so we gave those addresses notices also so we're just trying to get a little more teeth in maintenance i guess i would call it there is a section in here this kind of talks about a lot of things but there's some highlighted areas which i guess you could look at but we weren't able to find anything really anywhere that talks about codes about sequels in most of the cities it talks about design criteria and stuff of that nature but we don't have the ability right now to do anything to you know tell people hey your seatbelt looks bad or it's got potential damage so you need to take a look at it you know and i guess what we'd like to do is create something in the code that would allow us to maybe say your sea wall has a potential deterioration we want you to get an engineer to look at it because we don't have engineering to look at that some way to do that with sea walls and knocks in decisions what we're trying to do is create something that says gives us a mechanism to be able to tell someone if we go out and do an inspection that they would need to get an engineer because we're not a seat ball engineer we're just looking at something that looks damaged and certified that their sea wall is okay you know it's we want to be looking at remedies and fines for non-compliance like we do in some of the other code enforcement stuff yeah you have x number of days to get this fixed and otherwise here's the find it would be loving well then we've taken the code magistrate so that's that's really where it's at it's just to try to get some compliance because as an example that sea wall on bay shore would not if no one would have known about it unless you were right there and saw and unfortunately it was me that saw it and i told the homeowner that you need to get the seawall fixed because it was doing this and there was a guy that was going to buy it and he was going to repair it but five days before the closing it was on a sunday we had a lot of rain and the rain got behind it and pushed it out so you know there's got to be time frames that we could enforce that they at least go get an engineer or prove to us they've got an engineer to look at it what prompts an inspection i mean is this just people like your neighbors well that could be one that could be one a neighbor can call and say hey i want you to come and look at the sea wall another issue we're going to start doing like i said either through the sheriff or someone in the city would drive us you know for a morning and that's how we found all these issues with you know sea wall caps that there's big chunks out of them well you need to do some repair there you know those things are easy to tell someone hey just just prepare your seawall so it doesn't look like you got bombed in berlin 1940s or something so that's what we're trying to do so they contact you well they contact me or code enforcement or just contact the city and people can do that anonymously i mean we have some people after the storm that contact us about you know a neighbor three doors a ways dock is in front of his you know we don't have any way to pull that wood out of the water we don't have the equipment and i did talk to some other cities about that and they don't pull it out either you know it's wherever it lands you've got to pick it up the county doesn't have a system to pick it up either but our main concern is you know their election like you know you you can drive around the city and there are some places that people just don't care about their knock as an example maybe they don't use it so [Music] if the boards pop up i just leave them there walk away i mean we found properties like that too before the storm after the storm we had several more so uh then the city's looking for a vehicle to go in and say fix this or not fix this or how to report it get it somebody reports it or we find it and we deem that it needs an inspection then we're going to we want something to be able to tell them hey you got to have it you got to get a certified engineer to inspect the sea wall and say it's not damaged in any way and it's not going to fall in and hurt your neighbor's seawall or you know fortunately the one on bay shore both neighbors had just done theirs brand new so it didn't affect their sea walls but if they hadn't uh the one to the uh south it could have they could have taken this seawall down but he just replaced it so so you're looking for one that somebody might spot that's dangerous right hanging out not necessarily cracked or discolored or rusty or something like that i don't want to be in a position to create a can of worms for hey you gotta crack and that you better fix it or we'll shoot you no i don't want that kind of thing no we're just wanting a mechanism so we have a way to say that johnny hey you need to get an inspection on your sea wall or your your dock is another good example it needs to be repaired the next amount of days and you've got to get a permit and do all this because i i did check with the water navigation to kind of clarify what you need a permit for as far as a dock uh if it's damaged and you're taking anything structural which would mean the cross members of the springers which i hope all of you don't want to talk about but it's basically that before your then you have to get a permit even though it's just a remodel if you're just replacing a couple of boards on top you don't need to get a permit but you know things like that is another issue people aren't you know they tear their dog off and then they have some guy at midnight rebuild it and we don't know if it's structurally sound or not so that that's really what the mechanism is for what other um municipalities have you looked at besides that we could maybe research well we looked down south and you know like i think it was core gables or naples and we found some stuff but it really wasn't any dictation it there was a company that put out a report you know what to look for type thing but other than that we haven't had a hundred pounds it's a report and we have sent that to the guy that does has done our seawall work and he hasn't got back to us with the response on how many things about that is a mechanism or a tool to be able to say okay that's probably one of the biggest things that we need to tackle and we have nothing existing within this we have code about docs but not really clarity that says you know we can ask a homeowner to to get an engineer to do an inspection it basically says it must be in good repair which is open for definition and there's nothing that says what happens if it's not so right so we're just trying to put some meat in that and how we can do that you know that's what that's probably one of the priorities uh these these two or three things that i got in the next little section those were just and doing some edits basically yeah housekeeping when we revise the rental registration fee we overlooked this section 5435 and we should have revised upward those fees at the same time and does it give you a percentage of important yeah so so we need to look at that we raised the rental registration or the city council then from 100 to 300. yeah okay these are people like nautical lodge the little motel they pay a a different fee and that's in 54-35 so what you know we'll have some more discussion on that but what i'm looking at is maybe the base it goes to the rental registration b and then we just raise the incremental for the rooms a little bit so that that's just something to look at when we raised the rental fee to 300 did we have to back that back down because there were some legal challenges no no they they didn't there i understand several years ago there were some people that came in i was on the console yeah i think we bumped it up and then we had to take it back down right patty yeah well this console had the warrior look at it i mean actually at one time i wanted to make a 500 and i was like i think you're going too deep here but that was their confidence so they raised it to 300 we've had a few people rumble about it but for the most part they've paid it and with that we're going to start getting a little more uh investigative because we're finding that people two months ago come and got like a parking pass because they needed to park somewhere else but now they say they don't rent so we're gonna have to we're gonna do some focused stuff on some of the condos because that's where the problem is in a few homes or someone says well i'm not renting my home but i'm house swapping well that's technically the same you know you know we've got people that will tell you that too so we're going to do some more we looked into a software system that actually targets airbnb rentals but it was ridiculously high for what we you know they wanted like 18 000 a year to target and then what they basically do is give you a list somehow they've got pictures of the insides and everything i don't know how they do it but it's kind of crazy so that's that be the other couple things are housekeeping and realistically the the console is just asking you to go through [Music] sections of the code and you know if you see anything in there that you think we ought to update updated so it's i think this meeting is more a homework assignment to look at it and then we'll have another meeting and kind of kick them apart uh wanda you did this last time so you kind of know what we did in this process we had a process yeah so we just take one and pick it apart of yeah yeah this is a sea wall manual that we we've asked an engineer to look at it um it's got some good information in it and it came from the city uh south of here so you know we may adjust the code and this is a document that we have available for someone uh that you know needs to work on their seawall or do something else to it and we provide that put it on the website uh i've got all these lists of codes that people wanted to talk about question one thing that came up was about the worshiping palms i guess people that planted them and they're not allowed in the city so that's that's something that came up uh tree height above roadways that's another thing that came up recently we went around code enforcement did because the fdot standard is 13.5 feet and there were the fire department complained that they couldn't get their truck down the street so we had to go around and tell people trees and one of the council members has a comment about and i don't know if we want to get that deep but paint colors so i don't know if you want to get that deep into that or god possibly one other thing that was brought up and i'm just giving you the highlights rental property inspections some cities do that you know if you have a rental property then they do an inspection on it that starts that starts messing around with the uh the rental agreements that the doesn't it well uh i will tell you that reddington wasn't ready to george patty that did all that stuff with theirs they didn't touch that section but what they did was they created some additional things that allowed you to do inspections like every other year or something and we can get that provided to you but uh i sat through a whole thing in league of cities a couple of years ago where they had three different lawyers talking about what you can do that doesn't negate your grandfather and under short-term rentals in the legislature right and there was more you can't do than can yeah and people are starting to do like what you have to have you know fire inspections and this and this and have this whole list of stuff to go i can't do that well and i've told the city council many times and i know some of you have heard me tell them don't mess with the parental short-term realm you touch it you lose your grandfather right so i will tell you that the sign ordinance is being rewritten but that's city attorneys doing that um so it's the main situation is for us to as a group to read through this situation and see that anything stands out and to keep in mind some of his suggestions and i would like you to kind of spearhead it for our committee if you would and then this is something that we're not going to be able to decide today but i i don't want this this is a personal situation i don't want this committee to turn into some kind of a let's put a fee on this and let's put a fee on that and then etc etc i think what lynn is talking about is there's nothing there to say that the city's got any right to do anything except unless it's he needs a vehicle if it's reported to the city can they go look at it etc so let's keep it kind of casual rather than demanding to start off with that doesn't work well you know when it comes to a sea wall if we see a situation and i'm going to use what the philippines you see a situation like that you know we've got to tell them to repair it sure or they need to go get an engineer that tells us everything's okay so that isn't to me being strong that's just being safe it's been protective and protective of the city and protective of the residents because where's the guy next door to you and you don't care about us see well and it falls in and we didn't you know we didn't we weren't proactive i guess so it's not a matter of we're going to put a hammer on somebody it's a matter of education and if there is a problem then they need the residents need to understand all we're doing is asking you to get something from an engineer that says your seat ball's okay because it may not be okay as far as dogs are concerned the dogs that are in misrepair can totally deteriorate and crumble and they can cause serious damage to other people's boats and properties and that's that's the thing anything that's that has a risk of causing damage to somebody else i think that has to have some very strong language around it yeah you know people we've got one right now that they stripped the whole dot and they rebuilt it but they didn't get a permit so now they've got a problem because they took the stringers and everything off and but they didn't get it it's like it's here today and not there tomorrow we're floating by my talk on the outgoing tide or i see it floating by my dock from the outgoing ties yeah it's not fine well that's a lot of them that's a lot of the problem mainly because we don't have the mechanism so that's why we're going to try to start this quarterly thing either using the sheriff or a resident that will take us and uh that gives us a little more documentation to be able to say hey your doc's these repairs or your sea wall needs to be looked at and who knows some people that i've talked to act like or they didn't even realize there was under their cap that was falling off because they probably don't go out there they just sit at their pool or something watch the water so storm will do that and i'll tell you about it yeah yeah so that's that's kind of where we're at and what we would hope to accomplish okay let's let's go around the board here rudy do you have any comments or observations um yeah again i'd like to hear one with a brief description of how they actually tackled each section what process did you use well we had we've had the full 90 days so we decided we were going to meet every other week for no more than two hours every other week and we split up the sections that had to be reviewed so that each each meeting there were certain certain number of sections that everybody was expected to have reviewed and be ready to comment on not trying to do everything at once just like say the very next whenever we decide to meet again the next meeting we would look at maybe section 2 and section 10 because they're kind of small i think section 54 has to have its own mean it's going to be fairly large probably yeah i haven't been through that in total yet but yeah so and if we're going to have this done by the meeting in march that's probably going to be meeting at least every other week because these aren't things that i guess how i look at it they are peculiar to the existing city council they're peculiar to the whole city and you know you need to make adjustments every so often you do need to look at things and kind of say well maybe i that word doesn't really fit what it should do you know for that section so that it's just real clarification now i'm i'm not going to tell you that they wouldn't like it on march but you know things have happened and we're in a different world right now yeah maybe make sure that we have done at least a first pass by march and the march report will be we've done this we've completed this much and here's what we would like an extension to work on because we were unable to give it the depth of uh study that it needed yeah because you guys aren't you your board isn't an optimizer so there is no 120-day i remember is so why do you want to create a subcommittee no no we don't need a subcommittee we don't need a subcommittee we i think we should every one of us review the sections that need to be reviewed by each meeting and be prepared to make suggestions or recommendations or treat them yeah if you go through them and you say we don't need to change anything in that section that's fine that's you know i found a couple of typos so far but it's well laura and i will probably come with things to look at you know we threw up those things but it's a section well we're going to have this handed in by the composer by march that's only six weeks from now yeah you know if you feel you need an extension i'll just ask that wisconsin or do you want to do one a week or you want to do one a week one week's good for me one a week is good for me i don't think that's very taxing and wednesdays are good for me when we get into uh 54 and 94 like lynn said those are pretty large we may want to save some time extra time at that point yeah i think 54 because of the uh the review of these other documents i think that's gonna i think that deserves a meeting all by itself that's gonna be a long one i agree okay then we should take it and read it and meet in a week and refer to section two first one start with two how about two and ten they're they're not very large and i think we could probably do those two which one two and ten is like this we can do two and ten in one meeting is what one is saying gets reviewed and our next what's next [Music] instead of a wednesday i can't do thursday and then on wednesday well what are you looking at the 20th yeah wednesdays are actually best for me wednesdays are best for me that would be the 20th yes 20 yeah same time same place can we do earlier one o'clock 10 o'clock i mean i like morning so you talking about morning on a wednesday no no i'm not on i got a not on wednesday okay afternoon is how early on a wednesday for you in the afternoon one o'clock okay one o'clock okay so wednesday the 20th two and ten by wednesday the 20th one pm one pm it's 30 need a week actually 30 is the marine that's where you start getting into the docks at the seawall by itself i think i think so i can't quite understand that rudy when he said wednesday the 27th oh i know that 27 at 1 pm i'm just adding 7 days you're not talking about sections all right yeah it was that was that one would be section 30 for the 27th it'll be on an email from patty also covering what sections etc on another subject just so the planning board knows this the comp plan review will start sometime in the next couple months and so but that's a long-term process and we're going to hire a consultant to help with that so how involved you were with that last time comprehensive plan it's up for review it's a cycle every five or six years the target happens to be six this time so we'll hire a consultant and that's basically going through the comp plan but i'm just kind of giving you some future issues yes and i know jc and you probably you wanted no i'm nick tom my husband you went through it right you were on 16th no i wasn't bored in 16 okay well maybe it's only jc okay task ahead but that's done by consultant and they'll come in and give you a presentation i was just looking at this says 54-94 with the big ones if you want to put two weeks we just set 30 on the 20th wednesday the 27th we could go two weeks set 54s meeting on wednesday february 10th and then go two more weeks and set 94s wednesday february 24th and then that would still get us under the march one while that would give us two weeks on those two big categories you know actually 54 is not that large that's the that's the one about the thieves that was only one section that were yeah that match yeah thirty thirty is the big one thirty ninety four when i switched thirty and fifty four fifty four available doable by the 20th and then put 30 down next that's wednesday february 10th and 94 is due february 24th then we go back over that pack all right the next meeting will be wednesday january the 20th at 1 pm and we will discuss our findings on section 2 and 10. then the next meeting will be wednesday january 27th at 1 p.m and will be section 54 and then the next meeting is two weeks later february the 10th where we will discuss section 30. and then the next meeting and last meeting we'll be discussing sections will be wednesday february 24th and it'll be section 94. thank you um uh yeah there's a point four on page two like the last point recommended improvements to advanced code enforcement protocol do i read that is how we actually have code enforcement officer via the sheriff or whoever represent the city their process fines penalties and responsibilities right that's that's another section to discuss then well it's more or less within one of these okay anything else angela and wanda are new to our committee by well from last year to one member we could never find and the other member had to resign because the council said he could be in the same household so i'd like to welcome the addition to the zoning committee of the two ladies and is there any comments from any of the other members at large no rudy i'm good okay class we have our assignments we can consider this meeting adjourned until next time"
