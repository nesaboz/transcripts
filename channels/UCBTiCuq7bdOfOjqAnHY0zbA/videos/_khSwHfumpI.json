    "transcript": "all right we are finished with that first meeting and now we're going to move right into the city council work session so let's get started [Music] eddie will you please call the roll council member frank banker council member leslie otero your council member lloyd roberts council member jody shirley council member mike sable vice mayor glenn gunn mayor dave gattis city manager lynn reeves and city attorney randy mora president thank you very much all right so we're gonna just jump right on into uh item number one which is to discuss the uh cost-effectiveness and expiration date of bin number b 22-0 12th and 13th street drainage modification project this was placed on the agenda by council member roberts and we have our carrier here to speak on this topic good afternoon i'm alex carrier with golden associates we are civil engineers lane surveyors located in clearwater florida um i was got a phone call from council member roberts about last week i guess he had some concerns about about the project we talked about moving forward with him being comfortable moving forward and we went over the project in detail we talked about specifically the storm pipes that um i guess we're in question whether or not they really need to be put in or if there's something we could forego with the project i really don't have a presentation prepared but i'm willing to answer any questions you may have um i think the bottom line if i may then that subdivision is about 73 years old um so we know that the storm pipes in the ground are about 73 years old we have witnessed one at least one location where there's a joint failure that pipes under the ground where they join together separate and fail and there's a creates a pothole in the roadway um so based on my experience pike's being 70 years old in the road sorry signs of failure um it's ready to be replaced and my opinion it really doesn't make sense to not replace the pipes at this time from putting all the money back into mill and resurface the roads and putting in the new curbs so that's my recommendation and if you have any questions well if it's all right with you i'll ask you just to stay up there let's see if the council has any questions for you uh council yeah actually again i got them from kyle the other day i was just talking to him and he provided that you may need a magnifying glass so kiddies i'm not not joking it's very difficult to read some of the numbers question mr roberts yes sir mr mayor um first i just want to go back a little bit my main my main concern when i brought this up and please keep in mind that i'm really getting involved in this kind of the 11th hour because a lot of this work was done previously before some of us were actually on the on the council but what i was trying the thing that struck me in my head was that if we go through with we spent 700 thousand dollars in change on this project and we asked the question are some of the scenarios that the citizens are witnessing today prior to spending that money are they going to disappear so that was my biggest concern so just just very quickly a recap most of us were probably all familiar with some of the scenarios where we have a high tide and no rain high tide and no rain and some of the roads flood now kudos for the city because they have taken steps already to alleviate some of those problems with the check valves the i think they're called low probe valves on there to when the high tide comes up those valves close and they do not allow the salt water from the intercostal to come on those streets so that's that's a big deal that's a good thing we also have the infamous high tide and a major rain event and when that happens those valves close and therefore the flooding on this the water of the stream typically doesn't have anywhere to go then because the valves close and the streets flood the good thing but that is they flood with fresh water whereas the other scenario they flooded with salt water so it's a little bit better but the streets are still holding water back so that's what the citizens are witnessing and then of course we have a low tide and a rain event the water actually goes out in the intercoastal no problem so that's a good thing so again that's that's what i want to avoid because i think we as council members uh the citizens that live on those streets they said great we just spent seven hundred thousand dollars and we're still witnessing pretty much exactly the same issues we had before why did we do that i don't have a great answer other than uh now's correct we had some great conversation the other day concerning that okay those pipes have been underground for a while i think seven years you know you could go online and look and i looked this morning actually and i saw the army corps of engineers at the site of course and they were saying most reinforced concrete mites for storm water can last over a hundred years of course nobody knows for certain so you do things like video the pipes to see what the conditions and and i think we've done that right what what kind of views did we see when we did that well there's a couple pipes right so that was a joint problem the pipe itself didn't fail okay so there's different variables obviously you can have failures from the pipe you can have barriers from the actual construction firms that are putting the pipes in that type of thing and we don't really know for certain so so that's that's kind of the big um unknown so i was reviewing a city i forget exactly what state it was in they went ahead under similar circumstances i was interested in the time frame they said they had when they scoped and videoed the bikes they actually saw dates so they were 73 years old but they saw no visible problems and they they went ahead kind of like what we're talking about and said you know what they're 77 years old let's not take the risk let's go ahead and take them out so they took them out they have them all stacked up and there was no problem with the bikes whatsoever in fact they used many of them again in other projects which was kind of interesting on that so i know we've already done some of these projects right on a couple of the streets what did those pipes look like did they did they crush them when they were taking them out or did they actually take any of them out in pieces we really wouldn't know what the quote overall condition those lights are okay so that that's what i really think is the challenge before us because if in fact they were to last another 40 years then there is no problem with going ahead and and doing like for example the one fight that's failed or that big pothole is obviously that's one we need to take out is there another albus or another when you and i were talking we were kind of talking about you thought there were two there was well i went back and looked at google earth so there's one pothole there are a couple depressions in the roadway was it not that same right um it was in the same yeah it was on 12th there's a couple depressions but the um and i can't tell if it's from old work that was done old construction work that was done or if the pipe is leaking at the joints but like i said in my experience typically when you have one joint that starts to fail that severely others are right behind it and i think we talked about the you know the pipes are elliptical right so they're they're not round pipes um we're proposing to put wrong pipes in but they're elliptical they tend to be more difficult to put in constructability they tend to get misaligned easier than round pipe so that gives me another indication that it's time anyone else yes and then frank baker i got a question about the surveys that's driving the specs for this rfp when was that survey of the this this stormwater system completed basically the specs and scope of this work that was done by your previous your previous engineer record larry was the larry flewy right he had done the watershed management plan and at that time it was actually a very good plan uh it looked like he spent quite a bit of time he had done quite a bit of research he prioritized the areas that needed to be done so the highest priority was the worst condition collection system the roadway and we're just now working through that list right you know that's my point so how what's the date on that survey in 2016 2016. so the point i'm trying to get to was that was a different economic clock climate uh some of the technology and some of the engineering thinking maybe changed a little bit and if nothing else our cost-benefit thinking may be changing where maybe where we had in the perfect economic climate in 2016 it was economical to go ahead and do that work and that's how we're approaching it now but now when we're looking at you know a 200 000 increase in repairs at just a pop or a blink of an eye then maybe we need to start going back and prioritizing it a little bit better and maybe some things even have to be on condition where it's just not economically feasible now if we can just mitigate the problem and wait for conditions to get a little better the technology or labor costs to come down a little bit or the logistics chain to improve a little bit supply chain economics that's where things improve a little bit then maybe we need to back up and rethink this thing before we just arbitrarily say well we've got a plan it's worked okay for the last five years let's just keep going i think no maybe the truth has changed here and you need to do a little more detailed thinking of this this thing that we just said wait wait why is it going over it along with this thing the other thing is never have we ever come up with any metrics for this stuff it's just a subjective thing are we getting better yeah we're kind of getting better i can tell what we can tell is not necessarily a salt water coming up because lynn reeves has a various student going out there and tested the water so the conditions are improving but we've got certain expectations nobody's ever said based on the engineering and the scope of work expect an 80 improvement on this or expect only you know x number of days we don't have any metrics how do we know if we're getting better or we didn't know so i'm just saying you maybe need to just put the binders on this thing and go back and rethink this before we start i think maybe you touched on [Music] the performance of the system um keep in mind the there's two you have two alcohols one on the twelfth one eighth and eight both go through residential homes the city doesn't have easements over those those pipes and um there's structure there's walls that have been built over those as well over those pipes um so we've done that's our constraint right now um in those two fall pipes but we've increased the pipe sizes up to that 18 inch pipe one's 181 to 12 by 18 but we've increased the capacity of the system by increasing the size of the pipe and we put a connector pipe in between the two outfalls for redundancy to try and help alleviate any catastrophic if one outfall fails for some reason you at least have another place for the water to go um so we we have looked at that we have tried to do the best we can with the conditions we have to increase the amount of water that we get off the street but again the only way to increase the amount of water the performance of the system is to really raise the roads and then raise the houses and that's really not going to happen um so the next best thing is increase the pipe sizes where you can yeah so i guess what i'm saying is some of that stuff they are iron clad constraints right right the outfalls and that sort of thing so i mean are we just throwing money in a problem that doesn't really have an economical solution or what can we do where there's an there's there's a sleep factor i can sleep with the amount of money we spend for this amount of improvement everybody's got a different expectation here i guess we're trying to follow you do you not want to put the pipes in the ground and not do the project at all or do you do you want to not increase the pipe size and leave the pipe size the same no i'm thinking we go back we look at the scope of the project and say wait a second now maybe we can borrow scope this section again and if it looks like it's going to last another five years take that portion out of the project and maybe move it ahead i'm just saying we just maybe a little more surgical precision in defining the project rather than just saying that's the project taken or leading we're going to do it all or not so i think you could do that um but i don't think five years is really a benefit you're going to be milling resurfaces in the world the firms that are out there are also 70 years old so when you put new curbs in you expect to get another 50 60 70 years out of those with the milling resurface you're probably going to get another 10 years before you even have to touch the road but the reason why you want to resurface the road now is because the road base is still in decent shape once the asphalt starts to decay and water gets to the base then you have bigger issues so in my opinion you're not going to open that can of worms without fixing what's underneath the ground you know i i think i understand what you're saying well you know when i threw out five years i just figured out arbitrarily when you talk about resurfacing the road and the curbs i will go back and say well we did a pavement condition indexing of all the roads there and where does that that 12th and 13th street fall because some of those things are being sequenced with these projects that's because we're doing the storm water on that road at the time and it makes sense if we've torn it up let's go back and repave it well maybe we need to rethink the paving and curving too it all goes together good i'm sorry um mr uh frank banker yes thank you sir um i heard you talking that there may be and i'm i'm getting broken uh speech when i'm listening on myself but anyway i heard you're talking about easement problems so am i under the understanding that you'll be replacing the 15 inch pipe currently with 18 inch pipe going up to that easement issue which is a 15 inch pipe yes we're replacing we're replacing all the pipes um except for the alpha pipes between okay so you'll be putting 18 inch and then you'll be reducing it to the with a 15 inch coupler for the last maybe uh 40 feet no no we're not going to reduce any pipe sizes so you're going to go into the property easement and take that 15 inch pipe out so there's two outfalls um that go between the properties the one on 13th to the north that's uh existing 18-inch rcp in the up and i'll fall to the south it's a 12 by 18 which is an equivalent um 15 inch pipe i misunderstood you so on the other one you said it's a 15 inch pipe but it's equivalent to 18 inch the 12 by 18 is an equivalent 15 inch rcp and i see you're saying i just i just saw it so yes we're coming into the box there's a box on in the road that takes the water from the upstream collection system and ties it into that 12 by 18 outfall we did upsize that to an 18 inch because we have the the cross connector we have the equalizer pipe between the two when you say 12 by 18 are you is your inside diameter 18 inches and your and your length is 12 feet long because most pipes are eight eight people no that the 12 by 18 refers to the inside diameter of the pipe the pipe the 12 by 18 inch pipe is elliptical it's not round okay so it's not it's not a round pipe it's okay um so you're not so what i'm what i'm getting at is you're going to have a complete flow of 18 inch from inlet to allen i'm sorry you broke up i lost i lost your train of thoughts so we're on to the understanding because the street that i live on we went from 18 inches to last like 40 feet to 15 inches which is causing nothing but problems when i'm getting out here on 12th street and 13th street we're going to have a continuous 18 inch pipe going from inlet water to outlet at the baffles so at the very western end we um in the middle of the street we have almost identical on on 13th and 12th we have a set of inlets that's really the first set of inlets in the catchment that they're catching rainwater the the pipeline across the street is a 15 inch it's an existing 12x18 and we're replacing it with a 15 inch round pipe and as we work our way down the street we're replacing that with we upsize it to an 18 inch okay so at the end of the day and yet at the discharge or the baffle uh discharging the water at even at high tide when it closes that will be 18 inches correct correct okay is that going to be double gauge pipe the concrete reinforced concrete pipe that size is typically about three inches in thickness and it has almost looks like welded wire fabric a heavy gauge welded wire fabric that runs in the center of that concrete pipe okay um have we ever have we ever discussed um putting in a basin a catch basin of maybe 8 000 gallons because i don't agree with your you know assessment of raising the roads to get more drainage because once those baffles are closed you raise the roads that water just comes into people's yards and even worse but if you put in an 8 000 12 000 gallon tank with with maybe an eight inch pump to discharge about 60 some thousand gallons an hour have we ever looked at doing something like that because when you're expanding from 15 inches to 18 inches you're truly only going to give us about 600 gallons more of capacity which is about the equivalent of one person flushing their pull out so that's not really that much more water is what i'm saying where those pipes are gonna hold but a cage basement with pumps would work i mean you have a lot of areas from in all over the united states that are flood prone and even below sea level pumps do actually work um a couple things just for clarification when i made the comment about raising the road you would also have to raise the houses to be able to get the water to flow you got to be higher than the higher of the of the high side for it to work high drops and i guess second the upsizing the pipes we're not doing that for for capacity of holding the water we upsize the pipe because it allows better flow characteristics and we can move more water faster through the through the pipe that's convenient um as far as pumps you can put in storm pumps store storm pumps but they're they're very expensive um they're problematic we do a lot of work in madeira beach they have two that they just had to replace the the pumps and it was 140 000 for each pump [Music] you can do it they don't always work they get clogged from beach balls to mattresses or garbage can lids a number of things cause problems with those we could look at that but i i think it's going to be cost prohibitive if um you guys are contemplating whether to spend 700 thousand dollars i mean with the pump system pump stations we're kind of playing in the 700 000 because i think uh councilman lloyd and even our voice mayor are concerned about the price and what are we getting out of this price spending the seven hundred thousand dollars my opinion is if you have spent one million all right and it worked i think everyone be in agreement let's let's spend the extra 300 or 500 thousand dollars rather than having something that's because what they did in my street i i i swear it's worse now than it was before they did it because you went from 18 inches to 15 inches you never put a breather pipe in there to let the water out now you got an air blockage in my opinion not letting the water out council members sable yeah it's going to sound a little bit evil but we're an island there's no way you're going to run from this and when i looked at that estimate review the rfp nowhere did i see them saying this will fix it upon completion of this that road will be dry that road will be safe from water uh for the next 20 30 years i'm not against repairs to any existing system if it's broke we fix it but we're at a problem here where believes councilman gunn and councilman roberts explained it about you had the various combinations high tide low tide rain no rain what i do want to hear from is the city manager he's our chief executive officer he does day to day today as far as knowledge he's kind of sitting corporate knowledge and i want to hear from him will this fix it or are we just chasing the wind here well mayor console it was never meant to be a fix it was to prevent high tide from coming back in it was to get a little more capacity in the pipes because they were 70 plus years old having lived on 8th street for 20 some years i i've seen the water there after this and i guess council member banker i disagree with you but that's just my opinion because it was a lot higher than it is now and that was because we didn't have the cross pipes going from 7th and 8th street but it's it's not an end-all be-all it was never meant to be it was meant to to try to stop things like a king tide coming up and that water ended up in the street if it becomes a downpour you're going to have water until the capacity the pipe is built but at least there's somewhere for it to go and as soon as the tide goes down it it will drop pretty quickly we put backflows on 12th and 13th already city staff did that probably a year ago and the water level is not that as it was and i know councilmember rogers talked to a couple people over there and they told him it was better so and i've heard that from a lot of residents are any houses or yards or anything in imminent danger right now well you're going to get some water in your yard that's that's the storm i'm just doing fresh water fresh water you know i had people telling me it was salt water and i told him no it's not salt water so i went and we went and got a test kit and i went out and took a saltwater sample from the intercoastal i took a sample from the street after and got those and then i took a sample of the water coming out of your your faucet and actually the water in the street wasn't much different from the water that's coming out of your faucet from the rainstorm so it was not salt water backing up into the street you know i've had a lot of people tell me oh that's salt water no it's not water and like i said before it's it's not the fix you live on an island you got water on both sides the only thing you really do as al said is raise the island you're not gonna fix it you know entirely and and uh you know 12th and 13th street [Music] i don't know if there's anyone here from there but you could a lot of times there was a lot of water on that street with the high tide before we put those check valves on is it water today was it water on the street today that's my knowledge because harrison was covered with water but there's no checkpoint right but i'm just saying so it's working you know person which never floods so you know it's it's uh that's why we started putting the check valves in and we did a lot of evaluation with those because i talked to other cities that said they started using what they call a duck bill it's basically a thing a piece of plastic sucks clothes well after it gets a bunch of oysters on it it won't close so we did a lot of research and these valves or something we found we talked to other cities that have been using them local key and stuff and it's i think it's been very good at stopping the high tides and stuff thank you before we go back around does anyone else have any questions okay i have a couple first off the joints that are broken what what is what how do you repair the joint does it require pipe replacement probably you have to dig the road up i will tell you that the comment was made at the meeting about slip line well to slip line the amount of feet we have is almost 400 000 uh right now it's uh 200 a linear foot plus 10.50 for what they call cleaning and hydraulic inspection so i mean we're talking double the price and those joints that are broken are they under the street currently yes okay all right um mr carrier would you uh agree with that that it requires pipe replacement to repair the joints yeah usually if you have a point repair where you fix the joint you're going to dig up everything around that pipe to get access to it a lot of times what to do is they'll fill the void with hydraulic cement you'll wrap it with a verify a filter fabric which keeps the soil from going back in the pipe and they easily band it once all that's done they get it recompacted then you're going to rebuild the road um it's usually not for a fix per se but it's a point repair and a more emergency band-aid if you will um like i mentioned before usually if you have one pipe joint that's leaking or something's wrong there's some sort of structural failure usually it's an indication that there's other failures in that system you just haven't seen them yet okay and let's just say that we snapped our fingers in the streets and the homes are now five feet higher the check valves are still going to do the same job if we get rain while a check valve has stopped or closed we're still going to have water backed up is that correct in from a rainstorm yes from a range at some point depending on how much it is because it's still going out the same height that ride would be using today but if you're if you're fighting if you're five feet higher you probably don't need to check valves because you're not gonna get a tie that's gonna be five feet high okay right most high tides are point five maybe a you know one point five in the king time so you have the hydraulic pressure hydraulic had to push that water out that system um that would be my ass here that would be yeah it would be on the island yeah i got you okay next round uh does anyone i have any more questions yeah i do have we have we run cameras down on the pipes to see where we stand with failure you mean the other streets we've had we've had some we've had some cameras in there i'm both 12 and 13. yeah because we've had cameras on some other streets where we had to you know as an example the only thing you can do between two houses unfortunately you can't dig the pipe you got a slip line that's all you can do and we've had to do that and as far as the the streets and the guttering goes that's slated to be repaired no matter what we do but let me just say if you if you repair we finally have two sections that need replaced and we in our asphalt repair is only going to last 10 years right because we're just trying to get another 10 years out of this base materials then that seems like a logical fix let's just fix these two slew areas and you know that's what i'm saying the camera you know running the camera down these pipes is probably more important than we're putting we're not putting as much importance as there is because there may be what i'm hearing you say is that the chances of repaving these roads in 10 years are pretty likely so if we can get another 10 years out of the fight then and we just do a few repairs and do a few repairs go ahead and you know mill and reach and top over the existing base material and get our 10 years out so if we did a let's just say we went into repair mode instead of replacement what is that in confidence well your my personal opinion is you're going to gamble and the other thing i would do regardless if you go and repair or replace i would replace all the stormwater inlets because then we had the hurricane in 17 because they have excuse me they have an opening about this wide not like that and guess what was in another garbage debris so what we've done is we've replaced those with grapes type stormwater penguins so that stuff is captured so regardless if you say let's just dig up the road and fix a couple pipes uh i would still tell you to replace all of the infants so what i'm looking for is consensus for our next meeting i'd like to i'd like to know where everyone's thinking right now what the direction is with this conversation do we shut it down and reinvestigate or do we move forward with it i like to uh they'd like to uh basically reinvestigate i like to point the inlets and repair what is damaged if you get damaged up let's go back we fix it we slip it not the whole ring it's just what is broken right now and then we can reevaluate potentially look we have money but we don't spend it needlessly we can keep the money set aside later for any other potential damage you know maybe potential ideas such as what councilman bank was talking about a box i mean that could be investigated but down line you know that's more of a preventative corrective measure i want to get out of the corrective stuff before i call on everyone else mr banker would you like to weigh in on this all right just just a comment the pump idea we looked at that on bell island it doesn't work and you're gonna have to we're going to put this pump between the houses on 12th and 13th street where you're going to put it you know we don't own any property there if it was in seventh street and we're in the park but 12 13 14 15 16 16 scott martin 17th and 18th where are you going to put the pump are you going to put a try to [Music] i don't i don't think that's your intent councilmember shirley so yeah i'm in favor of doing a little more investigation and seeing if there's a possible repair to just uh because it doesn't make sense to remove pipe that may be okay to replace it with the same style pipe place with the toro mean it's just putting band-aids on it i think fixing it taking the more major step is more appropriate floyd roberts um i first i just want to clarify for mr carrier i don't think he was recommending to repair the joint in the process that he was describing as a permanent fix so if we have a joint problem where we're seeing those potholes his recommendation is we go in for that particular pipe take that out replace it with a new pipe and go forward depending on the length of the pipe the length of sectioning you've got to pull out right um sometimes they call it diaper and sometimes it's better just to diaper that entire joint if it's if the pipe the integrity of the pipe's not there you know you want to diaper and concrete or blanket and concrete to strengthen the pipe again so my recommendation at this point would be to not go forward with the project as it stated today but i think it makes sense to go in there and identify maybe the one or two areas that have failed from a joint standpoint and go ahead and take those punches out and replace them that will require another bid obviously all of the gutters on those on those two streets to be replaced as well and the pavement now somebody had asked about so there's three actual streets involved there we have 12th street we have 13th street and we have bay is that correct so 12th street is actually in the category from a scoring standpoint that shows it's in the worst category so it definitely needs to be replaced they is in the second worst category so that that would not be an issue i don't think on the other hand 13 scored very well however from a project standpoint because it's basically a new street in there it makes sense to go ahead if we're doing those other two streets in my opinion it would make sense to go ahead and proceed to do all three even though somebody might say well gee whiz why'd you do that street my street's in worse condition than that you're referring to uh asphalt and go right correct so i i believe you know going ahead now and just repairing again it would require a new design to say this is what we're going to do from a stormwater standpoint and this is what we're going to do with the gutters and the street that would be a total new rfd for the contractors to bid on and then move on councilmember i pretty much stayed in my position that more of a surgical approach to this thing fix this stuff that's broken it's not broken don't fix it you know i'm more of a non-conditioned person i would like to go back and look at the floating report if nothing else and look at the assumptions that are still good assumptions and things that have changed we need to rethink stuff and i think you know the truth has changed i think we need to take a step back and think about things in a different way these days maybe there's a different way of looking at these uh these different line areas we we looked at a way to prioritize flooding that was your concern and we prioritized them three different ways one was somebody's home was being damaged one was the street was impassable and the third was there was some flooding but it was going in three hours or something like that so i mean these things were prioritized that way and now it's time to maybe back up and if we do a surgical approach and pick and choose certain projects the technologies improved with maybe more isolate that they're really going to damage places surgically fix it and while we're mobilized we do the same thing in the different areas rather than going from one street to the next to the next entire project we do all the grades together do certain things together i'm 48 i'd like to rethink this mysteries are there any other streets that are in dire need right now any other areas in miller beach that are in worse condition than 12 and 13. uh i don't have the pci probe i want to say 17th and 18th is that not an issue we did put a foul in the out out following that uh on 18th street but even going forward i would still replace all the humans regardless is is this a singular conversation pardon 17th and 18th it's just the same conversation yeah i mean it's just that they're not a joint right if we can go uh you know we can hire the company that does our camering for us just go camera everything if if that's what you want to do we do have that funding in the storm water because that state mandated requirement for the stormwater we did that in-house so we didn't go to a consultant to spend that so there's money there that we could go ahead and do that and you know but this is going to take you know complete redesign well i have a question um if we scope the pipes and realize that it's cataclysmic then we still have we have a winning bid on this project is that correct no are we about to lose it we're about to lose all right yeah the june 4th so right now what i'm hearing is a believe that the council has the feeling that we should wait further investigate and then re-quote what i'm hearing yes mr carrier i appreciate your time thank you so much i appreciate everybody's input thank you thank you okay so let me get this straight right quick so at the next meeting we have to officially vote this down all right yeah we'll bring something to be rejected a bit even though it will be past the day anyway okay all right just to keep our records okay uh now we're up to item two which is to discuss florida fish and wildlife and conservative missions uh notice an intent to revoke the city's waterway marker permit letter regarding buoys so we all kind of know what's happened and where we stand today and we have a map proposal of what we would possibly like to do i have any comments from the council i guess i i shared this with lynn and i'm just having a real struggle with the boat zones i know what lynn explained we have to do it but as soon as we identify boat zones you know where everyone's going to be parking their boat on saturday and sunday afternoon right and when aware of you know these sandbars that i'll just use the one at john's past as a great example that's what's going to happen on bellar beach so thank you for whoever the wrong council member was that created this mess this is a problem is there any way around this this happy to name these boat zones i'm going to defer to the attorney though i'm i'm getting up to speed on the issues i am familiar with fwc's requirements on your regular on your ordinances governing buoys they've issued a letter telling you come in compliance with their administrative codes and statutes in the next 30 days which actually much sooner than 30 days from today you have the option of designating areas as no vessel areas and i i i understand i'm waiting no pun intended waiting in the waters that have likely been navigated among you as to whether you wish to prohibit boats altogether make it um non non-motorized vessels only but you do have some leeway in what you designated if it is the collective will to say that it is an altogether no motorized boat zone that ability exists you have that authority um if you're trying to balance the where's the house of it i have to i have to personally get more acquainted and certainly defer to your manager in that regard as to what exists presently and the regions and zones you're referring to yeah what we had before was in a way so it worked perfectly boats didn't travel in but if they did want to come ashore to pick someone up they did and got out of the way zone people weren't driving up and down the no way zone was not an issue i've lived on this beach for 22 years and never seen a problem with boats and then there was now all of a sudden we've got to revamp the entire beach and people are partying behind leslie's house now so i wouldn't be happy i was living if i lived directly on the beach and for what it's worth you're not the only coastal community that's going through this i'm not even in pinellas county i think some of this may have spurred some attention in other in other areas in the county as well i was on a call with the five people who are tasked with administering administering this particular program and talking through and they said you know a lot of this is responsive and reactive and so you it is entirely possible for a community to have but our buoy has said this for 20 years and then say well our code has said this for 18 how didn't we know until we're notified we're not they're not patrolling all of the waters looking at every buoy and it is largely a reactive enforcement patent compliance i should say anyone else yeah i didn't know i mean look i'm not a voter but we have a lot of voters here and one of the biggest concerns was look i'd like to have the ability to drive in perhaps grandkids kids whatever then go back out to sea as a swimmer i'm not a big fan of boats but if they're allowed to come in you know slowly again no wake and then pick up everybody to proceed out without creating you know a standing parking lot i think to me that's a good solution i just didn't know that you're already allowed to do this i don't see why we're reinventing everything now at this point as long as our voters are allowed to come in drop off pick up and you know head back out what i am concerned about and this is strictly for military but if you got something that's been hanging on since october 21st and nothing's been done on it that's that's upset you can't be doing that and i want to figure out going forward what are we going to do to handle florida fish and wildlife and this is way above my head this is attorney todd you know what are our options at least we should have a series of options to look at and vote upon so we can in a timely manner close this issue with them it's open we gotta close it out yes and i think that's what the function of the discussion this evening is i will tell you that as it relates to handling state agencies our options are often limited as they are you know the parent relative to us hierarchy and so our options become more limited as we start trying to dictate how those superior agencies function as far as this boat zone goes uh what what exactly does this mean can you spell it out for us well what they what fwc you know we we can do vessel exclusion we can do swim zones and and that's kind of where we we had a public meeting to discuss this and you know a few people talked about putting a boat zone where a boat can drive into the shore place it the rest of the beaches swim zone okay the issue is the buoy issue came about because of a buoy issue with bellaire shore okay and trying to you know build our shores i don't think they really have any interest in the buoys or if they do i they haven't told me that so do they have they don't have any moves right they got one twenty some years ago the city of bel air beach and then went together they paid for their movies we paid for our homes okay when we went to update the permit the state said our buoys were fine their buoys were gone so they were taken off the program and there was no problem with having an i don't know wait zone but what brought this to a head was the fact that there was a lot of conversation back and forth with different people at fwc and trying to compare us to indian rocks or clearwater or whatever and so they decided to look at our ordinance well our ordinance doesn't mean current statutes so their position is now as they said in the letter either take the buoys out or create a swim zone or something you know vessel no exclusion zone and that's pretty much what the letter states i mean if if our buoys wouldn't have been brought into it who is going to stay where they were they would come here and look at our products but because it was brought to their attention they went and looked at our ordinance and that's what they do with the other cities they're they're not going to go they only have a few people up there they're not going to go door to door and say hey your ordinance they don't have the people to do that and so at this point we have to give them a plan of what we're gonna do or we have to if they're not gonna do anything then they're telling us to take the movies out there or and regardless of the reasoning that we're being heavily scrutinized we're still out of compliance and having fears right now what is the what are the options according to this code do we know i mean what are i mean because i see two options and that is swim zone or boat zone well there's some others like vessel exclusion zone which is not a swim phone uh i probably should have brought all that data with me but we had a complete list of everything they said we could do or couldn't do you know you could have a canoe but you can't have a motorboat no motorized boats but because we don't qualify for anything else like an idle weight zone we don't have a boat ramp within 500 feet we don't have a gas station within 500 feet those are stipulations but if you don't have this is all you can be so that's it compare this these two boat zones to what we have today what's the difference um principally the main difference is your present operation of the idle weak zone where you're okay with with vessels motorized vessels passing through at a low speed it's either they're allowed in or they're not as mine you're sort of left with this binary choice whereas you've existed in a in the gray space of a venn diagram you're now having to say either we're having swimmers only or we're having vessels and if a vessel can come in that means it has all the rights of being in that area which the way most you see this in some parts on clearwater beach jet skis come in and out of here everybody stay on this side of the boat and so that it's the mutually exclusive use issue right now you have parallel uses that can't necessarily be parallel you do have options again non-motorized vessels are permitted okay we're okay with kayaks and paddle boards but we don't really want you know jet skis and weight and weight boats without boarding and all that all right so guys just bear with me for a couple of seconds if this entire area was a boat zone if everything on this map was boat zone um would it and let's just say you take the swimmers completely out of the picture would it be exactly the same as what we have today or not you wouldn't have any boobs so you've got a boat zone you you you can't you can't have buoys out there it's called a boat zone it'd be considered open water for fire purposes it drives full speed at the same yeah so just a thought experiment here if you left it as it was you complied and the entire thing was a swimsuit boats can still come through at no they're completely excluded yes so then the other options are you create boat zones or you pull off and you've already done the economics on there what's it called to pull them however if you pull all the buoys now you're opening yourself up for boats to come in and air [Music] if there are no buoys that's a boat zone you are legally permitted to haul your ass full speed at sand i'm talking jet skis water skis anything yeah okay so the the the whole purpose of this design was for perception it was to show if you're in a boat and you're flying you know 100 yards offshore maybe 200 yards and you see this line of buoys it looks like a straight line and it says stay out and then for the people that live here they would they would know where they could come in and pick up children family whatever their dog and and then leave i we one thing that we never discussed was somebody just dropping anchor in this little square here and hanging out all day uh that's something that never came up during that meeting right there's one one idea and again you really gotta be the ancient mariner and glenn you know exactly what i'm talking about now something called a range marker a range marker is not a buoy a range marker is kept on land we service it what a range marker is and unfortunately frankie is you'd have to load this one up you have two items for example you have a lower and higher these are on land they're separated by about 10 feet and to come in you have to be what they call on the range which means physically you're looking at an alignment of the two items if you see that you are on the range you're allowed to come in if they're broken there's a separation you are not on the range you've got to turn to again beyond the rank they're again they're not buoys they're not maintenance items we do these are on land so you can look those up you know they're range markers i understand where you're coming from however i don't think joe drunkie and his boat's gonna care and that's the problem i mean not everybody's responsible so if we did hold on hold on a second frank baker yeah um we have now city attorney it represents a city that has uh no wake idle speed buoys in it um and i believe a council woman said if the council person addressed this this isn't a problem or whatever i'll take full credit to that because um i didn't really put us into a problem just for the records just changed in 2020 i didn't take the seat until 2022 or 2021 i'm sorry all right we should have never changed this amended the first permit that was in the works for 20 some years we should have abided by the permit and replaced his beliefs as so stated as we were responsible for under the permit direction miller each was responsible to replace belarus park police but that'll say we now have an attorney that represents a city that has the same buoys markers that we have right now why are we not fighting fwc um i believe article three of our constitution still is valid about special laws prohibited um when when a state agency tries to attack a city town or person that is completely a violation of our rights in article 12. i can go on and on from article 2 or the preamble of our constitution but simply there's a buoys there's a buoy right now in bel air shores okay no one's even addressing that so fwc just wants a pound of flesh in my opinion i think we should fight this we should leave the buoys there as of right now and take him to court i think he would back down mike saban okay blind now i understand you just came but you're the only attorney in this room give me a real big ballpark how much is it going to cost in time and cost to quote fight this and what's the likely result if we try tilting a witness i commend this community for its baptism by fire um the the um with all respect to the council member um i'm not a policy maker in any community i serve in i do not um administer the codes to the extent of a city attorney in another community that may have buoys in another um in a similar or comparable position that is that city's for that city to resolve and as much as i've been advised or involved in that process it's my understanding this was brought to that city's attention in the last 45 days and they had when i when i referenced a call was in connection with another jurisdiction and their response was okay just tell us what we got to do to come in compliance and they're amending their ordinance and they're on a 90 to 120 day timeline to try and modernize their code accordingly and determine what best suits their community so they are not taking an adversarial stance with fwc i i know that doesn't answer the narrow question you gave me but i think that context is important the question you gave me was what would it cost us to fight this i don't know only because i've not researched what defensible position you your community has i i appreciate and am a strong proponent of home rule and your ability to self-legislate and self-govern and the florida administrative code that is at issue specifically contemplates your ability to make certain regulations in this sphere but to do so in a matter that complies with state statute and state administrative code the fwc is the body that is functionally preempted to the regulation of florida's waters and environmental waterways and so our authority is i wouldn't say lacking but certainly mitigated in this in this sphere litigation is never cheap your results are never certain i i would vain to put a dollar amount on anything at this point you'd be going on the offensive so you're not having insurance coverage or anything of the like where you might see that in a personal injury context or or other land use disputes the authority to succeed in litigation against fwc on this issue i would put it less than 50 50 without having analyzed it just based on their rule-making authority and also the time with which this is not a new issue but rather a new issue that they've become aware of and you'll you'll come you know the discovery process will reveal how they became aware on what timeline and how soon they saw you know compliance from this event i'd like to remind everyone also that there was a public meeting held concerning this and this is what even though it wasn't a large group there didn't seem to be a lot of interest in this topic but for the people that were there this is what they came up with and um i would advise each of you to at least consider their wishes because they they put us here but on the other hand i think we owe it to at least to bring this up for a vote and then and decide from there because i don't really see a quick fix on this and we're running out of time and i ask that question regarding the location of the boat zones is it required to have two is there some there's no requirement it was just at the public meeting there was concern that you had to have centralized locations originally there were three there were three yeah and that was what the beach at access well we have four that are beach access crossover wall covers it looks like why not look to morgan street where it's you can if you're really just coming to pick someone up you need to be dropped off right so at least a vehicle can pull in and i i'm kind of trying to figure out why we have boat zones like behind you know townhouses the discussion at the public meeting was that you don't want to have boats coming into morgan because that was one that we have and we you know that's got it and i understand that there's more swimmers there and then i have another kind of stupid but on to that point is like why not go to the south or the north end of the beach all together so the purpose of where these are are located on the map was to give everyone in bel air beach equal access to split it up so because if you live let's just say you only did morgan and you live in the south well that's a long way to walk to to go meet daddy with his boat or if uh or let's say you put them all the way on the ends and you live right in the middle and you want to take one of those accesses it's still hot not for everyone but for some people it is so that's that's how this came out and it was actually it was a consensus it was uh it was a lot of back and forth and trying to come up with something that was acceptable for everyone i i can't say that this is 100 the best plan but it was as far as we could tell the very best option to to at least appease the voters and also try to protect the the public and our beaches all right glenn good so to put this into perspective i was at that meeting a number of council members almost outnumbered a number of people came in and said they wanted to hold something now my my observation is are you trying to fix something that's not really broken people who are are running around in boats they're not necessarily coming in the beach to pick people up they're coming into the beach to impart get off the boat and party and i think if you create these boat zones guess what you're not going to have a lot of people picking people up on the beach you're going to have all these boats are going to be crowded with people coming in to anchor their boat stand in the water waist deep and drink beer that's what you're creating here you're basically creating a uh what's the term a uh inviting nuisance or something like that and attractive nuisance because the people aren't going to be coming in their boats to pick people up maybe onesies two of these but i'll tell you what they are going to be flocking to me once one day working down the street and you've got a boat zone guess what's going to be pouring in there and you're going to be able to walk from the beach out to those buoys so i have a question for you what's preventing people from docking or dropping an anchor uh on bellary shore today the way it is now that you can come through the police is that correct yeah there's nothing stopping them yeah so well those boys are there right no so so my question is is i see a line of buoys am i going to go there or am i going to go where there's no buoys at all because is it going to be are they going to be marked so obvious that that was not so it's a road magnet no it's we we would have to re sticker the buoys that are out there swimsuit and i think what happens at these movies what happens at these movies if that says swim zone what does this say well there's not a second buoy there the only place that would be a boat zone is the interior buoys because i'm not you know i'm not advocating putting a big sign up to say this is a vote but as soon as it's voted down in a public meeting then it's going to be on the street right that's my only concern yeah i don't know that because just like the mayor said i'm looking down this strip here and those are going to say a swim zone on them you know what are the odds and realistically i think all of us know that you can't control everything and you know glenn may bring his boat over and go to deciding what's coming at morgan park who's going to go let me take this a step further today right now the way we are out of compliance is there anything preventing the boat from coming and anchoring and sitting there no hanging out says i don't know amazon that's all it says big zones you can go anywhere you want so below the posted speed and it's my comment i mean thank you for bringing that up about the community uh first for most always we're not the ones to really push direction i mean the citizens are you know they they go through us obviously we went out there we went door to door to door to door and they came up with this compromise that was a lot of work a lot of consideration for voters non-voters my personal thought now after hearing that is going forward with this because i'm assuming right now when i'm verified that this plan put us in compliance with fwc it'll close the item and we can proceed forward with other pressing matters of the city that is correct i will say just for for the benefit of all present the final paragraph of the fwc letter that prompts this discussion is since a significant amount of time has passed without these problems being addressed fwc intends to revoke the permit that authorizes the current 20 um florida floridian form waterway markers to avoid revocation and i'm skipping over a little bit to avoid relocation please provide them with police provide fwc with a corrective action plan that addresses these issues within 30 days of receiving this letter submission of the plan will told the revocation process while staff reviews the plan if the permit is revoked fellow beach will be required to remove the markers um from the waters of the state at its own expense failing to remove them is another violation of the law subject to and they give you their citations so what you're looking for tonight is you're not even obviously you're at a workshop you're not taking official action you're giving general direction say this is the plan and if this is the plan or some other formulation of it we will go to fwc and say hey good news we've got a plan uh and and we're working through it you guys look at it we'll fine-tune the p's and q's and eyes and keys of it all with all that but it stops the clock on needing to pull them in any kind of penal penalties they may otherwise impose and allows you to get the process going to transition to your brighter newer future on the waterway whatever that may look like for you folks because it'll take two months two ordinance readings plus we have to send the proposed ordinance which i did talk to him about that instead of using coordinates we're just going to use and they're fine with this as an example of the swim zone here would be in the ordinance would be a hundred feet north of 19th street to 24 7 and again what this does again right now you can take a vote anywhere on that beach we implement this you took that entire beach opening up motors you're now into two small lanes and that's okay because everything else is no boats at all only swim but and again this is what the system came up with yeah we're taking consistency and all we'll be doing is the buoys that are there all we'll be doing is changing the stickers the fire surviving output so the kayak the set of stickers yeah so which ones are there right now yeah yeah the thai weight zone yeah right yeah you're just adding the interior gooey so what's changing nothing if you go to a no swim so he doesn't realize there's anything let's keep him [Music] they're set up this way we decide it doesn't work they can be removed yeah just make it almost yeah yeah you're not you know i think the discussion we had that you know there weren't a lot of people but there were people here and the biggest issue because initially we had two scenarios one with four boat zones and one with three but the end theory was just do a couple and split them and that's what we did here and like like you said mayor if i'm looking at this and it says no swim here no swimming here it must have been here her swim zone you're gonna assume or they're swaying because you've always got that one guy like mike sable has to swim away you're the ring that's right the girl the guardian out there you're like what is that right yeah they do their rags and uh and then uh whenever the time comes we have to do an ordinance anyway to pass through yeah so this is the ball rolling and gets them off our backs right is everybody okay with that frank baker frank mr hair yes sir uh i i heard uh our attorney say that there was a town that um received a notice about 45 days ago about dressing their boots i these these permits are uh granted for three years and then they have to be reviewed every three years so i'm not sure that towns department is up for renewal right now or review but our permit is not renewable until next year there's three emails going back and forth to fwc from 2019 to 2020 asking what the verbiage is that we're requesting on the buoys each time we ask idle speed no weight in each of those emails fwc then approves a permit specifying the coordinates of 20 markers and each marker has accordance reference idle speed no wake on the printed on the buoys that said mr moore could go into court tomorrow morning for about 300 bucks in his time okay file a motion to cease and desist this letter and and keep that permit in effect to at least the end of next year because that would be the easiest fastest solution here and i think fwc would back down quickly mr mayor can't um let me go to the at least i thought here is um removing councilman um from any action in this letter take him totally out of the loop let it go to where it should be that's the city manager and city attorney to handle any further actions and any letters or any any actions at all on this and is that possible at this point in time i don't think we have any capacity to control the freedoms of anyone on this council i understand what i'm looking for is just a consensus if you want us to use this plan we'll get with randy we'll get an ordinance drafted and send that to them and say here's our plan all right let's start with uh with mr banker are you okay with at least submitting this to fwc and uh and buying some time uh me i'm not i'm not uh i'm not going to abide by a threatening letter that i do i do not believe it has any effect if we challenged it so i believe we should challenge fwc we have a valid permit right now that they say that's a valid permit it's their verbiage it's their questions they submitted it we still have at least one year left on it and i believe that's what we should stand by okay so that's a no and uh i believe that we should go forward with this study again by the citizens putting it forward it does answer the mail to fwc i believe there is absolutely no reason at all to file any legal suit we just finished an argument about trying to repair our streets and the scarcity money to you know do only encompassing things and to spend needlessly hundreds of thousands of dollars for a lawsuit that frankly can be easily solve by giving them a plan um it makes no sense so i definitely i recommend this be forwarded that we see as our uh answer yes uh council member shirley yes all right leslie mataro yes but there are some people in the audience that i think want to make some comments on this we're going to answer that we're just going around reaching our consensus and then we'll go from there lloyd roberts i have a yes okay the basic premise of consensus is nobody gets there unless everybody gets there yes move forward all right and uh and i'm feeling the same way is there anyone in the audience that would like to speak on this topic because i know it means a lot to him yes mr gibbons hi my name is this whole notion of boats is not the issue i think what you're trying to do is going to cause more safety problems the whole issue here is having to do public safety now if you're going to do an ordinance it's got to be based on facts it's got to be based on information that you have to present to the commission and as far as i know and i raised this question when we had the public meeting there's not been one incident with a boat and swimmer since this place has been incorporated in 1952 not one the commission says that now there's 58 000 votes registered in pinellas county not one single time has there been a boat swimmer incident on any of these beaches so i asked you why what would bring this about now i've submitted a four-year request to talk to lynn about this and to some degree but i'm very serious about this to go back and figure out how did this all come about because there is no need that you can show here that there is a public safety concern here to justify the ordinances you're talking about and then littering the beaches with all this trash that you plan to do that all of these costs to put 400 pound blocks of cement out there and then you're you're going to come back and deal with this issue soon because they're going to re-nourish the beaches and you spend all this money to put these buoys out there and these buoys that you're talking about right now are right on the sandbar i was out there the other day and it's about up to your thigh right now a little tired so what are you going to do with the 400 pound block of cement out there if kids are out there surfing and playing in the surf and so forth on the sandbar where they do you create a hazard enormous health hazard by putting all this garbage out there in the water and that's why the commission is so opposed to what you're doing you're making it worse by using this particular section of the co of the florida statutes to allow you to do this because you can go over here on page two and you're going to have to have a real tough study here to prove this and said any ordinance and doctor pursuant to this paragraph shall not take effect until the commission has reviewed the ordinance and determined by substantial competent evidence that the ordinance is necessary to protect the public health you're going to have a hard time doing that if you haven't had any incidents and 70 years here and there's no indication that boulders drive like this i've lived there all my life by the boat you want to go bring a boat in there when things are just perfect you you got to have an offshore breeze and you have to be calm because you don't want to get hung up on that sandbar and then you have no control of the boat after that so it's only a very limited time i've lived there and i've spent thousands and thousands of hours looking into the gulf of mexico and you just don't see what you guys are talking about it doesn't exist so i urge you to let all them florida fish and wildlife confirmation folks do what they need to do here is safe water if you're going to get all tangled up in this it's going to be a long bike and um i i hope that you will give some greater consideration to this than jumping the gun and trying to put another 40 or so buoys out there that are going to be covered in sand when they re-nourish the beach anyway so you're going all of this cost to try to get the commission to allow you to do this when there is no showing of need whatsoever let me ask peter baker who is the president of our economy and association next door just carefully they have 20 30 or so residents there and i can tell you everybody that i've talked to i go on the beach cleanups and everything like that i haven't found a single person once they look at this map they'll agree that i differ with your all's conclusions of that public development there was no consensus in that meeting if there's a tape i want to see it in the public records request there was no consensus in that thing so please do what the commission wants you to do and don't try to create all of these you know ways around it by having these bolts on that makes no sense whatsoever and there's absolutely no need that you can show that there is a requirement to do this thank you mr gibbons good evening council members my name is peter baker and i am a resident of hillsborough county i have a unit at the most particles campaigning association i am president of the association and while i have not got any formal consensus from the board i think in speaking to several of the members there there is a concern with the additional buoys that may be placed on the exterior of our area and i i noticed that you all have got a what appears to be a new version of the map of the zone so i don't exactly know where most our politics is in relation to your unit it looks like then there's a boat something directly in front of our unit mr baker hold up one second um just for clarification 2450 gulf boulevard okay thank you that's not what i was going to ask what i was going to do is clarify what it is that you're looking at okay yes sure there are boat zones on this map however the outlying buoys on the on the ocean side the ones that are in a straight line those buoys exist today we are not adding any more outside buoys there will be four additional buoys placed in so i whether you're for or against and i just wanted to make sure that you are aware of what what we're looking at well that that is a is an additional question i have some concerns because i know that some uh it appears that the the existing buoys are probably 500 feet apart and i don't know if that is exactly the correct spacing or whether or not the 24s that are the current current permit are still there or you're going to have to replace them as part of this product i stand correctly this is where they're permitted for this is where the printer but i would like to find out how many you're going to have to replace because they're no longer there because they have been eliminated by tides or other things how many new buoys are going to have to be bought and then maintained as part of this new project as opposed to just taking all the buoys down which is the second option that they are providing to you which would seem from our perspective you'd be better particularly if the boat zone as you're showing it now is directly in front of our complex we would have a significant objection to that boat zone being in front of our complex okay thank you very much any other comments from citizens no i just want to say that before you'll have to step up to the microphone sorry about future time i'm terry gibbons and i'm leslie's neighbor leslie you can correct me if i'm wrong i don't think i've ever seen a boat coming in partying and uh hanging out what was mentioned i've never seen that and do you think true i've never seen anyone come in the only time i've ever seen it is to pick up the kids or something like that but that's not true i mean it's just not it's just it's not a party i mean we're not talking about clearwater yeah we'll pray for bellar beach and not members just sort of maybe go from time to time just check out the beaches get a feel for what really is happening especially in the peak in the summer months is wherever you might have issues but believe me i've never ever and i have my kids you know they swim out there and you know so if i thought there was a concern believe me i would be all for that thank you very much um and uh for further clarification and uh and then we're gonna we're gonna have to take a break um we are not in a position to make a decision on whether we do or don't have buoys tonight okay what this is is we have a problem or fwc has a problem with the city of bel air beach and we must respond to it whether we want them in the future or we don't want them in the future whatever it is this is something that more than three people have to respond to and it has to go in front of all of the city for us to uh to hear public comments and uh and get a little more insight on what it is and which direction the city uh is going for so i think at this time all we're doing is we're just submitting this this interim plan that uh that as we go forward we can certainly tweak it or ditch it or whatever it is we decide that we want to do with it but we have to give the fwc something is does everyone agree with that i would like to see something says that on october 21st fwc provided suggestions on our draft ordinance can we get copies of that yeah what what that was we had two or three different ordinances fred had done and we sent him up there and then when we brought him back it was kind of back and forth with well do we want to do this or do we want to do that so now fwc is i guess to some degree because if you read their letter there was some discussion there's been a lot of discussions between council member bankered in them he's been in meetings he's been at their thing and uh they they're pretty much frustrated but that that ordinance that frank did or i mean fred did was to make it a swimsuit you know we can send those you know we've got them somewhere in our emails but we're talking about apples and oranges now we're talking about something else so those ordinances really don't because at that time i think we have four swimsuits [Music] because all the ordinance is saying is you're going to have a there's an example a swim zone from 100 foot north of 19th street to 24th street that's what the ordinance goes down okay thank you this is for clarification there's 15 boys in this outer stream here that they're permanent for how many are actually there have been going out and done a survey in their home not recently because you lose blues all the time i mean you know they could have been there three weeks ago and today there could be twelve of them because they break away and that's what happens i mean we've got the same situation on the intercoastal and we we're getting prices to put those back in we have coordinates where the anchorage is so that they can be attached to the existing anchor just put the concrete back in there you've got coordinates but the problem is you can't find them over time they're sunk in the sand yeah yeah they used to screw them in now they put lots of concrete okay so um again i think that has anyone changed their mind on what we're doing just to move forward so that we can uh further evaluate this we still have to do an ordinance which means it has to has to be voted on and that will give all of the city the opportunity to voice their opinions and what i'd like to do now is take about a five minute break okay [Music] okay okay okay uh before we get started uh i did this last couple of work sessions and i wanted to see if the consensus was still the same that we uh we end at 9 00 pm with whatever's yes okay all right so we are now on to item three which is to review the sponsorship a sponsorship program and agreement would anyone like to start off with comments on this just to give you a quick analysis that partner rich ward came up with this kind of plan uh attorney salzman uh went through it and gave us a shorter version of the previous version so this is a draft and really all i'm looking for is feedback from the console if you want to go forward with it or not that's really all i'm asking and then i'll have randy take a look at it and and you know just another all right would anyone on the council like to comment on that uh perhaps it'd be better if we just proceed directly with having randy review this and bring this up for the next work session i actually have a comment but i wanted to give everyone else the opportunity she doesn't have any comments on this i think it looks great i think it's a good opportunity okay mr baker did you have any comments uh i i guess the only problem i have is is the city will edit uh any type of i guess speech according to sponsorship on the city they have the right to edit the speech we can't hear you brian hold on um hold on let me know the microphone move the microphone see if that helps okay try again yeah the only thing i have a problem is says the city more or less paraphrase they have the right to edit the speech of any sponsorship under limitations i think he's saying by virtue of their sponsorship do they have a right to give a speech to edit the speech yes exercise full editorial control over the placement content appearance and wording exercise full editorial control any other comments okay i have one and uh it's a little bit controversial but i'm gonna go ahead and bring it up i'm looking at sponsorship opportunities and you look at that column there and you go to one two three item four recognition of sponsorship bel air beach city sign the council not this council but the prior council said we would not be advertising businesses on that side and i will not vote for this if that if that is not or if that's all there i i don't i'm just completely against it i made a commitment to the people that did not want this sign but that would not happen and i think it needs to be taken right out yeah that's something you know parking record this was theirs they they gave it to us so we're just trying to get it to the point where they can maybe solicit some sponsorships and we've got to meet tomorrow and we'll go back to them and say hey constantly doesn't want is event oriented and i just think that seeing an advertisement out there on that side will will reignite a power cap other than that i thought it was a good idea it's a great way to raise some funds and have more events okay so uh next is discuss charge for uh parking details and i brought this up and uh so let me go ahead and explain why i added this and where i'm going with it under normal circumstances most people don't have a problem paying for parking decals however they go to oregon park sometimes and they they can't get in um they feel like that um that maybe we should be getting these for free and that we should be using funds collected from the parking meters to to pay for the decals so i reached out to city manager and i said realistically what's it costing to uh to to generate these things and get them in the hands of people um what what did you no last year's cost was about four hundred dollars given from pride the state they made it for us and i know mayor you and i talked a little bit about this i wouldn't make some distinction about the first ones for years i i would just give them free and we used to be free but you know the amount of money that we take in is probably somewhere about maybe 4 000 so that's 800 permits per year and up until i want to say three years ago we did give them three i was actually voting for for a fee unfortunately or actually fortunately whenever i was going around knocking on doors that was one of the big complaints and i was happy that that's all that they were complaining about was having to buy parking decals but it was something that i i said that i would at least bring up and give the council the opportunity i didn't make any promises but that was whenever we were trying to lower a budget where there really wasn't much we could cut is what i that that's what i got out of that was that we were reacting uh trying to generate revenue and lower our overall budget by doing that and i don't really think 400 is a lot of money whenever you're detailing everyone in town but that's just my opinion so i'd like to hear everyone else's yes my question is lynn so you just said that when we the last time he checked we sold them for five dollars we had 400 people 800 800 comes off okay prior when they were free how did we typically give out i think in some years it might have been 900 so it's similar a little a little bit more okay guess what so i'm going to reserve my judgment on discussing the charge of parking decals until we discuss number five where we're talking about upgrading city christmas decorations and i'd like to know where that plan comes from so i will i will defer my judgment on parking decals until i hear the plan for how you find christmas decorations okay uh mike's able i just wanted to see go through all the names um yeah actually i have really no problem with that zeroing that out especially for picking up additional revenue potentially by sponsorship um and again i saw that tip talking to people you got the big ticket items obviously but you're trying to balance a budget using a for the decals that that's you're not going to be able to do that so i thought just provide the decals that's one of the things we do as a city no charge jerry shirley you were there i was and um two things is that when i come in to get details i have a lot of vehicles and it takes the girls they stop what they're doing they've gotta go get the book out they've gotta log every sticker they've gotta log every tag number they've gotta make decals work it's not just the 50 cent deal it's the time and labor associated with the issue imposed i am not in favor of making any changes because of that it's not the cost that you're looking when you get through the budget especially those new on the council you're going to see yeah maybe the 4 000 generated isn't a lot but then when you throw in parking fees that could be increased even more at radiators um you know which i keep saying keep testing the waters because they don't they don't stop coming right you can never get a parking spot on the street so i think there's opportunity to still collect have more revenues from parking i just think that we're talking about 700 000 storm water budget and anywhere we can get money to offset some of the overhead costs we need to [Music] themselves is a minor issue but the time and effort to get them done thank you great banker well when i when i moved here the parking decals were free and then there was a charge put on to them i do understand the big bulk process it's pretty archaic but do we allow people to if they don't have time to come into city hall to get a decal the mail they're requested with the check for that decal is super genius i'm sorry what was that again the whole thing uh when i moved here there was no charge for the decals then there was a charge you guessed by five six years ago but i don't have a problem with the charge but is there a process if i can't get into city hall if a resident can't get into city hall during the normal course of the workday to mail in their request with the check for two two decals one decal whatever you do all the time scan the email permit driver's license to us and pay with the credit card over the phone we do that all the time i'm sorry [Music] so what did we do he was just asking if there was a way to do it without actually going to city hall and mr ray said so um again this is uh i know that you want to have the conversation about christmas decorations i i agree with julie it's the cost of doing business there's so many hidden costs here that we don't really account for and the fact that you're getting emails and scanning stuff and putting in envelopes and mailing them to people that's even more costing somebody standing at the counter so i mean i'll be accounting for that stuff in class or how many hours are being accounted for okay all right well that's fair enough so just real quick uh let me kind of get everyone's opinion on what they think we should do and uh and then we'll move forward on it mr roberts i think we should continue with the charge this is a personal story we moved here three years ago when i came up to get the decal and was told it was five dollars and made the comment well that's awesome five dollars for a year and the young lady behind the counter said well you're one of the few who respond that way because of course it was free before so i understand you have free now it's not free but five dollars that's just one thing i'm for it okay um mr good uh i leave it as is all right judy yeah i agree like it is the argument was saying that it takes an inordinate amount of time for city hall to comply with us due to logging in tracking and basically maintaining this set of decals what i'm thinking about is look if it's free you just come to city i'll pick it up and it's a minimal time for the city employees to come out and give it they're gone they can get back to business so i'm going for free all right and frank baker um i'm for the charge in the continuing process there's a reconciliation process there to make sure it's the resident in the residence car that's a yes to continue the charge yes all right and uh you know what i'm kind of leaning towards uh what i heard about the parking and everything i'm gonna say no no charge but that's okay uh five and two so uh we'll drop that and we'll move right on to uh yesterday just one more question about it what what the current status of people that part in our parking areas without which you can't are we are reinforcing that or that is enforcing that this is going to fall under a general to bring that up it may not happen this meeting but i have well actually i'm probably going to ask that we skip some things and go straight to channel business but let's continue on with the christmas decorations yes all right um you brought this up i did like mayor gaddis when he was going around knocking on doors more than several people explained to me that they felt like the status of beller beach was higher than some of the other beach cities down the road and they felt like our christmas decorations were not equal to the other town's christmas decorations so they felt like we should step it up so you know in my opinion one idea may need to happen i don't know if the city atlanta has already looked at that in the past but if we could have maybe a committee take a look at that and see what alternatives there may be out there there's obviously cost the topic that came up was like christmas decorations that were lit in the evenings and some of the towns have those we do not so i'm just bringing it forward there's obviously costs involved with things like that if any of our polls they don't have electricity you know there's alternatives to generate power but that was the message i was getting can we just step up the christmas decorations a little bit yes sir mr god this is that a great idea that dovetails with a sponsorship what we do is we start brainstorming a bunch of cookie jar items for things we would like to do and then you throw it out there for sponsorships and guess what it has to be [Music] well i will tell you that we used to have lighted christmas decorations well they well no they were done by a company called clark sales and over time there was issues with the electricity on the wall some of the poles still have the electricity there but we'd have to upgrade that and then i think it was a garden club gave us banners and christmas mayors that were up there for many many years and they kind of fell apart so we bought the newer banner recently three years ago yeah so we bought the new banners to replace those we had an issue in front of city hall with that decoration that was there he called the vendor half the time the light wouldn't come on you know it'd go out so we went and bought the christmas tree it's our christmas tree we put it up it stays lit so that's sometimes the problems with the lighting because you're contracting out because we don't have the equipment to put that stuff up and how much did you spend on the banners just for informational purposes i'll have to go back and look but it was the the money that we spent on the christmas tree and the banners was what the consulate would give them a budget for christmas decorations which was several thousand dollars as i said they're not cheap they're not inexpensive the banners you know i know people would love to go down to new york to pizza they've got a mermaid that lights up and all these cute little things oh the lights those are expensive if you buy an individual yeah and people love them christmas are they actually set up to support why did anything we'd probably have to go back and have an electrician go through and what happens how that works is t coal will probably be the water tico we'll talk about duke will probably be the one that put the box up there and then what they do is they send you a bill and you have to calculate how many watts each light bulb burns from this period to this period when they send you a bill after it's all over with that's that's not important um well they well that's this school when you talk about the sponsor if if the park board moves forward with the foundation then yes dude could be a sponsor yeah because they're going through the park board and the park board's giving us the money so it's you know it could be a win-win for everyone and you know i know i talked to uh his name from duke a few years ago about hey do you do anything he said i can't do anything unless it's a non-profit so just different entities do different things right any other comments on this uh uh i would be totally against uh trying to make a buck off of my savior's birth uh in any way i'm totally against making a buck off my saviors what was the referee birth birth in any way fighting sponsorships okay so um my recommendation on this one would be to contact one of your um parks and rec people and pitch it to them and see if they can if that will ignite and turn into something so they have meetings should we just ask that back to them yeah okay we are on a roll so let's keep going uh discuss allowing dog walking on the beach this was brought forward by council members actually i'm willing to discuss at your next working group meeting in favor of going after the articles number seven date tonight all right everybody okay with that all right uh next is number seven discuss acceleration stormwater projects by partial use of reserve funds uh i initially brought it up and then uh council member roberts secondly the uh the idea so i'm going to pitch it to you mr roberts yeah my take on it is that of course it's a budget issue to be able to accelerate that so we're going to have to get put some fraud into that which is why you know the 12th and 13th street project that we already discussed today if there are ways to um extend the life and everybody's comfortable that with that with a lot of the reinforced concrete height we're going to be able to do those for less money that's a given so we're able to do those projects for less money we'll be able to do more projects faster so that's the way i'm working and the way that i envisioned it was uh it seems like right now we're either doing one street or one horseshoe at a time and uh what i would like to see is is these things spat up if at all possible and maybe we do two of them at one time and see how many you know how quick we could knock these out without without going crazy overboard but just trying to uh look at the possibilities of accelerating these projects because there are a lot of streets that the curves and the gutters are broken and they they just look bad and they've got potholes that have been repaired on and the asphalt is all cracked up and it doesn't necessarily have to be storm water projects but just general capital projects overall we're sitting on how much right now like two and a half two and a half million and we got 400 000 of rescue money that we've already converted to and we'll get another 400 000 in probably late august or september we've got to commit that money by 2040. committed to storm or is that yeah that's that's what we recommend so my question is is uh while everything's going up uh should we are we waiting are we gonna ride it out or should we actually tap into that and maybe accelerate some of these projects um yes mr goodman yeah i buy into accelerating it to taking into today's dollars and costs but here's here's where i see his 12th and 13th street will be a model for how you look at this so we've already agreed to back up take a look at 12th and 13th street to think about this thing smartly and then the other thing is we need to look down the road we don't have a good forecast of the out year budgets here okay we're still looking at this thing we're still looking at the strategic plan we have no really firm idea what how years of our budget is going to look like we we've got to make some assumptions on what's going to happen to expenditures we need to make some assumptions to what's going to happen to revenues coming in we need to look at what's in the hopper for capital improvement projects and new projects and that sort of thing and then we factor in the money we haven't done any of this stuff so that has to be done before we can figure out the burn rate where do we burn through our money and wow guess what i've done done so i mean we we've got a lot of capital planning and budgeting and stuff to do before we just say yeah i agree let's accelerate it and take advantage of today's dollars i agree with that whole artery but i don't think he just said yeah we got money here let's do it i think we need to come up with a firm idea of how we're going to handle 12th and 13th street and then just build on that that's that's the foundation we're building and start looking at the other campbell projects okay fault for 13 went well we can use that as a cookie cutter plan to do these other streams now let's factor in what other things do we do what are the ideas two years from now two years eight years from now and what's the burn rate that regulators use that's all i'm saying i agree with it but i think there's a lot of stuff besides just waving the wall and saying okay let's go for the decrease council yeah i just want to add this should be monte carlo specifically i agree with you sometimes it does make sense we're running about eight percent inflation forecast to go further housing unfortunately it may be in a bubble so task may drop what i will get to is there is a time and place for accelerating the projects but you can't do it unless you know exactly where you're going revenue was and that's what we need to go back get the budget hit the strategic plan and then put in say monte carlo planning okay what's a five percent of six percent seven percent what can we afford under each one of these and what is our threshold for pain how fast can we accelerate if at all mr roberts yeah i don't have anything to add to it actually when i submitted my wish list it did include uh road payment and stuff as well as for my project so i think i think both of those are very closely tied together in all of our projects that we're going to go forward so as i said at the beginning it's tied to the budget i think would get created with a budget in a previous organization i worked for when a new governor would come into place and he or she would say we want all these organizations to cut ten percent they didn't really have a lot of forethought specifically about what that meant um so oftentimes we had to push back a little bit and get creative and things like that but you know we survived so there probably are some things in our budget i think that we probably could cut and some other things that we can take advantage of that but i haven't looked at it in that much detail by any stretch but it's worth looking at for sure i think this is something that maybe we should uh every work session that we have we should devote a certain percentage of our time to this this topic budgeting what what projects are important to us which ones in what order they should come and uh and are we spending our money effectively we owe it to the community and i think also that we owe to the community just kind of fix it up a little more on what we're doing rather than just uh sitting on this money and uh while we're watching honestly everything that i have invested right now is losing money and uh and if it's sitting in the bank we're also losing money the numbers are the same but it's not worth as much so i think it's probably in our best interest to spend some of it anyway okay um so what i will do is uh on the next uh on the next agenda for a work session i'll make sure that this is brought up and i'll try to come up with some topics that we can discuss and uh and then leave it up to you guys we'll see how it goes any other questions or comments on that topic mr baker do you have any comments i would just uh be cautious of spending money right now with this inflation bubble um i agree each project has to be looked at you know aggressively if it's needed but um we'll probably be collecting if things go this way we'll probably be collecting five percent on that two and a half million dollars uh in another couple months with the federal reserve increasing rates as they've been so that's that's over 120 000 a year that's it thank you any other questions or comments nope okay uh now we're to a general business uh before i get started does anyone have uh anything that they would like to bring up any old business or anything [Music] yeah i've been pretty constant contact with duke and uh was the latest email i got back from her on friday and i i responded to her told her yeah i went to credit we got the credit for of these states on it's all with grant so she's trying to get it tidied up you know we did get an estimate for the one from one million to one three from duke so i'm trying to get her to reduce that estimate a little bit so we'll see where that goes but i just want to kind of give you an update on where we're at right now and that's a good thing if we get 200 000 credit that's pretty good i'm just curious what do you think it will be complete well if we could get them started we could start on the first phase because we've got a million or roughly already targeted in october you'll get another 930 000 well that would take care of first through causeway that would take care of that and because and that's kind of where i was born with it try to get these prices firm and then try to move the first phase on and then go as far as you can with the four million dollars and uh when that runs out i do expect based on what's happened in the past i expect some of the big c mayors will go back to the county and say hey you give us enough money because i know indian rock speech can't go through their old town and that that was the goal of the whole project that's the thing is that they're expecting us to do the entire run but if we don't have enough money are we on the hook for it if we if we tell the utility to go further but i'll give you an example indian rock speech is forget what street it is they're only going to this point because that's the money they got and that's as far as they're going uh and the county is okay with that yeah yeah i mean happened last time same situation you can only go so far with the money you have and i think uh maybe next time you're in the mayor's council bill clinton have a chat with him because he's the one that went back to the county to get the 35 million that we got to split now in the event that it's not completed is there another round of funding that's what i'm hoping that will happen if you're asking for it but what i'm saying is is there a contingency plan no not at this point okay no we've gotten the money guaranteed to us yes but it's not enough no not to complete the whole city okay it's about a million right now it's about a million children okay does that answer your question yeah all right anyone else one question uh status of cables over golf the spectrum cables they're still working down the street and i talk to them every week so i've got two issues at the south end all that's left down here is the attention wires and they say they don't belong to them they belong to frontier and i've made a couple phone calls he hasn't gone back to we had the same problem in bellevue time with that you know attention wire across 20 seconds oh we were yeah but here's the problem frontier and this is what happened to belgium states island frontier underground and everything but guess what they didn't do they didn't take the copper down they left it there so you wanted to take it down i want some money for it and that's unfortunately what happened because that's important that's a book resource well there's nothing going through it not talk to him about that i got him to take it down a couple places but for no money because i claimed that the polls were created you know but you still gotta argue with them the frontier told me there was no they had no facilities on the floor because i went to them and asked them well i saw their their very fiber map and it shows that we're done yeah that everything's completed in this area but they want you to pay stuff down those tension wires we had that argument and that was that tension wire that went across 22nd made sure and i knew they took it down i guess i they got tired of me okay anything else uh yes robertson i have just two areas i'd like to pursue but of course i'm not going to do that unless i have this support or authority of the council to pursue those one is ever since i've lived here coming across the bridge it has always confused me as to why we have two different speed limits so i would like the opportunity to chat with belair bluffs a leadership team over there of course no decisions will be made and just want to discuss it with them and see what opportunities um will avail themselves to us and i would come back and tell you guys how their conversation went and obviously there's two choices it could be 35 all the way across the bridge back and forth or it could be 30 all the way back and forth i'm assuming the um we would prefer it to be 35 my guess would be with the citizens but again i just want to sit down with them and chat and see what opportunities are there you know maybe we'll have like an arm wrestling [Music] tournament and whoever wins gets their choice or something like that but uh i'd like to pursue that it's okay with all you guys it's just in that zone right because 32 and a half the the corporate history on that and then raised was the condo people were the complainers they're not being able to aid around right they're parking yeah we had that discussion let's see the bridge was done in 2009 we had that discussion there was no interest to increase their speed limit whatsoever because of the conflict the second one had to do with the infamous changes that have occurred down here with the traffic lights so i'd like an opportunity to contact pinellas county and whomever else just to talk with them to find out what additional alternatives may be available i do have a i have studied the traffic plan um that they put together it's a wonderful boat about 18 inches thick so that was exciting but i think there may be some opportunity there i think the feedback that i've gotten from the belarusian citizens mainly has to do with the linking left turn yellow line that went away you know if you're coming from the uh north to the south that was there before now that it went away it just seems like sometimes you sit there for like two hours of course it's not two hours but it seems like a very long time without any and it gets more frustrating be that when you're sitting there at the red light and there's zero traffic coming from the south to the north where the blinking yellow light was there you would have turned you know 60 seconds that was the second lane that's correct and it takes longer when there's a pedestrian trying to cross right so they hit the they hit the crosswalk it delays the light a little longer so it's just part of it you know yeah i don't mean to you know we flip about it i drive it every day right just part of it you know it's just part of it because it's two lanes together there's no really they won't get rid of the second green uh straight uh writing they're quite concerned but i will say that it's gotten better they did slide it over it's it's definitely i've noticed more people are using the i guess you call it the outside lane to make the left turn and people are trained themselves to actually be a little respectful and not race to the end of the intersection or the you know where the merge is the only thing that i've really my only complaint is that pinellas county intentionally timed that light to make sure that you're stopped at every a traffic engineering firm that did this study so i'll probably call them as well just to see what their thoughts are and you know you can't jump ahead of the line you don't have to go through a higher power you can actually call the uh i forget what the name of the department is the signaling controller right you can call them directly and complain and they'll listen to you because they just want to shut you up and fix it you know what whatever it is to make you happy which accountants you're talking about yes and they've offered just so you know they've offered any kind any time the consulate wants to go up there they'll take you on a tour of that it's really cool it's pretty neat we need to do it it's it's really cool uh in fact let's just say that it hung up and you are sitting there for let's say five minutes um if you've got their number you can call them up and they'll flip the light for you okay yeah will you notice the problem is that quick and they're responsive so i have something that i want to bring up and uh and it's concerning miller shore uh so um lynn and i met with with commissioner blue and we uh we began discussions on what to do about our differences between the two communities and what he brought up was was interesting it wasn't in many ways his complaints are the same complaints that we have part of the problem is we've got non-stickered people that are parking there and nothing's happening you've got people that are breaking rules up and down the beach they're running the bicycles the e-bikes they're they've got they have legitimate issues and concerns so i immediately voiced my concerns concerning the umbrellas and i told him that that's really we don't want these giant canopy shades we just want single pole umbrellas that you can attach to a chair or you can stab in the ground or carry around with you i said if if you would work with us on this then maybe maybe we wouldn't have so many problems between our two communities so we discussed some ways to that maybe we could resolve some of these issues obviously the parking lot isn't an issue for both communities we don't like people over there that are creating a liability for us and they don't like people over there that just don't belong there but at the same time they do want to be able to use their their property so one of the things that we discussed was the possibility of gating of actually putting real gates in and uh and then figuring out some way to activate the gates where maybe you had a large gate and you had a small gate so for people on foot they could access that way and for people in cars then they would activate the gate i started thinking about that option and right off the bat beyond the beyond the expense of the gates and the electronics i was thinking well now you've got to provide everybody another beast with something so let's say you had to purchase a key fob well they don't want to buy a sticker now so uh who's going to you know pay 50 bucks for a key pop to use that so so then i started thinking about other options and uh or other things that we could look into we've discussed this in the past in fact i believe you've even brought it up and i believe glenn you have two which was towing so i asked him how do you feel about just going ahead and working on a deal with a towing company and giving them free rent if you pull in any one of these three accesses and you see a non-permanent vehicle have at it tow away and he said i would have no problem whatsoever with that the other option another thing that that we discussed was increasing the patrols on the beach um but i think that that's something later on down the road and this is kind of where i'm i'm going with this i told him that we wanted umbrellas and and that that was really our biggest concern obviously the the same concerns he have are more secondary because we don't live there and we're not seeing what's going on up and down the beach but i'm thinking that there's an opportunity to maybe work out a deal where okay let's uh let's let's revisit tagging umbrellas and getting our umbrellas back just the umbrellas that we're not asking for anything else and uh and then to pairing with that increasing the patrols on the beach so that when the police come by it's not every 12 hours it's maybe every two or three hours and they see the umbrellas and if you don't have a tag well then you can't have that at the same time they can control the parking lots we would have the towing companies coming in and if we try to make belly assure what it's always has been more of an exclusive area but it's an area that both communities would use together i'm trying to work out something with them that maybe will benefit both communities and i wanted to bring this up because um ultimately i can't make this decision everyone here is involved and so i'm looking for some feedback what are your thoughts i'm smiling because yeah it's you think you got it you got it in you're establishing trust i put my full backing behind me with these efforts thank you joey um you know it sounds like what what i've said all along it just doesn't seem like it's a big deal it just takes us a little effort on both parts the parking is easily handled with having a total service under contract they're happy to tow any vehicle that's out there they're making the money yeah and they put their signs up and you sign a contract with them and it's the best deal going um costs us nothing you know um i think it's a great idea i mean i've been supportive if you can get something i don't know about tagging the umbrellas and all that how that the logistics of that that sounds a bit complicated but um but yeah i think it's an easy fix well the the umbrellas let me go back to that a little bit we discussed tagging the umbrellas but but uh blue actually believes that if we can get the free access lots under control the majority of his problems will go away what's happening with that you looked into that um and we're looking into the cost for gates like he [Music] he was interested in carrying the cause i asked that question and the the deal is with that is uh it's all we could easily do gates splitting in between the two communities that's no problem it's whenever have a way to get in if you give somebody a code that they're going to share with their buddies it's going to be of use if you have rfid or key fobs or anything like that it's uh it's very expensive and well we think the parking stickers are a nightmare for administrative services imagine what it would be to maintain that and what if someone loses one then you've got to figure out what number it is and you have to deactivate so the more even though whenever we were discussing it it sounded like a good idea on the outside i went home and i thought about it more and more it's like yeah i don't think so and also from a legal perspective i'm afraid that it may be challenged by our own residents well why should i have to pay 50 bucks to use needed access well and i have a distribution facility that has maybe 30 drivers it's a nightmare that has automatic gigs and you know it's just a nightmare your gates are always broken they don't have the patience to weigh all the problems i think that the towing company and the increased patrols would probably be our best our best bet mr mayor yes um one of one of the bigger problems down there and and just this past friday was talking to the new patrol officer he's in the parking lot he was shoeing an unregistered car another one pulled in in a five-minute conversation we had without a beach sticker but talking to someone about her shore residents they're more concerned about the electric bikes that are coming in the uber drop pulse the taxi drop walls resident or non-residents parking at our city hall walking across the street um i hate this i hate to say this but i think your first idea i know it's a costly idea um it's probably the best solution and that was actually brought up by two residents of bel air shores having some kind of a double gate access i don't know what the cost would be i do understand about giving a key fob out giving a code out or whatever like that which all could be changed monthly quarterly or whatever thank you um i tell you probably not a bad idea just to maybe give us a legal opinion on that as far as the gates go and maybe you can get back with us understood mr gunn if you go with towing it's a reversible process okay if you don't like the results back out of it okay very very low implementation costs with respect to gates and thoughts and implementation is like give it to the tournament they'll figure it out they'll put the science out and we've got to assign a contract or a term and come up with terms that we can live with no maintenance costs are involved with towing and the word gets out there that they're towing your car i'll tell you what nothing strikes fear in the heart of an american driver and somebody they're out there towing cars and they'll take care of no maintenance costs and allow the toy companies they'll be happy to do it and or anybody walking through the parking lot a resident sees a sign she says a car without a sticker hey i can call up a towing car and he'll be here and i don't have to say who i am where i am i just say hey i'm in uh i'm off in the beach access parking lot off the 14th street or wherever there's some cars parked in legally here those guys will be there before you can well that sounds easier than filing a complaint with code enforcement i always right now we just need to have your house totally down yes sir i was always in favor of the umbrella tag but you know what i think in listening to this if we implement the towing factor and i i think if we come up with an agreeable option between baylor shores and us regarding the height of an umbrella as an example you know no no tense whatever we agreed to and they agreed to put an umbrella that doesn't exceed you know six feet and a diameter of you know pick some numbers so because i don't think we need to tag them if we have a reasonable umbrella approved number and the people in our city would know what that is because we would tell them you know you can use umbrellas now and here's what they need to look like say city of the property of city of miller beach or something right but but i think coupled with the enforcement of the parking area maybe we don't really need it [Music] well another complaint he did have was about the ubers the uber dropoffs and the wagons yeah and uh and i've seen those i haven't seen them so much lately mainly because there's just no incentive to go there for an uber crowd but i think that the towing is a nice olive branch and let's see what happens if there was something what's what's the current situation with belarus shores and where they meet for their meetings what do they have they made it by learning okay do you think they would consider our facility more efficient for them closer to better as an olive grants type thing if you had that in your pocket maybe so but i don't know if they're really interested in doing that i think that they're content right where they are would you yeah is that the way you feel about it too yeah it's a small room kind of a orange environment and you know what i can ask them though they did use our you know maybe something to close the deal a little bit i don't know people complain about them using it for free and that's that's you know it's it's always there's always controversy and uh maybe for now it's best to leave that one along um let's start with toeing if you're okay with that and let's just see what they say uh and at least they'll understand that we're trying something to to make a difference is there anything anything uh special we will have to do to contract with a towing company well we'll have to contact one i'm sure they have some type of contract since it wouldn't cost us anything it wouldn't require any answer is that right i won't i'd want the opportunity to just review what yeah at all it depends if at all i'd want an opportunity both to look at what arrangements exist in other communities are there any kinds of codified provisions you need in your code in order to be able to do that in some communities that is the case so i'm what i'm hearing is a discussion about moving in a direction which affords me time to work that in the background as well i can't unequivocally tell you here are the you know the five boxes you'll need to check because they sit here today right because we had a couple people that parked cars but i think it would have to be a between both right i may very well require renegotiating our interlocal agreement mr robertson glenn was referencing um i have seen parking lot areas before where there's a sign there that says you know you will be towed if you don't have the property and here's the towing company name and number which would make them trying to make it fun as i it's an issue on our own on our sidewalks i mean it's a if you walk a golf ball of art people will zoom by you on those e-bikes at 30 miles an hour on the sidelines yeah and so i mean we need to address that in ordinances not only on the beach but we yeah but also it's gonna get worse because these companies are springing up and their goal is to get from indian rocks beach to clearwater beach and eventually we're gonna start seeing the older ones and the batteries die and they just drop that's all they do they just leave them where they are see them all over the place in other communities okay um we're almost finished the last thing that i want to bring up is the sheriff's uh patrol is i know it's rare that they are going up and down our beach but they are traveling our beach in a full-blown suv four-wheel drive we are already losing all of our beach i can't imagine this doing anything but more damage to our our beach is there anything can can we give them a little nudge and say we want you to patrol but we want you to patrol on the atv that we have over here in the garage which is yours i got a call in the captain he's been out i told him last weekend about that stuff something with his family so i'm photographer [Music] eventually we're going to ask them to uh patrol more and we don't want them doing it in that big as you do in fact i believe someone was ran over someone was [Music] okay uh that that's all i have for uh for now uh we've got the dog walking you guys want it's only five after nine you want to tackle it right quick yeah okay okay just briefly i'm bringing my mops around obviously campaigning found that that in us got shocked bellerin beach is primarily you know we have our grandkids but a lot of us have you know the furry kids too and some of them would like to obviously use the beach but let me kind of clarify this a little bit we don't want to open it up to the public generally you know hey it's a dog-friendly beach it's all full up now just looking at maybe from seven to nine in the mornings so it really just kind of locates the to owners they're leash people already do walk their dogs on the beach but one it makes them legal right now they're all violating the law but it allows them to do that they're picking up as far as you know the argument said well you got you know feces all over so well we got raccoons you got coyotes they're already there but now you have a responsible owner on a leash walking from seven to nine no other times and you know so they all enjoy the beach they're off the beach you know back home so i just like to bring that up maybe put that in front of you know the public allow them to comment during a council meeting and uh go from there so you're suggesting specific designated hours yes because if it's 24 7 then we have problems from other communities seven to nine or i mean i'm just proposing to seven to nine just yeah exactly and it's a less traveled time it's just a residence it's usually before work or afterward you know we narrow that down but giving our residents a place that they can go with their you know their furry dogs um but they're still responsible for him obviously that gives them that option uh anyone would like to weigh in on this mr yes sir go ahead yeah i'm always amazed that you know dogs can't go on going hotels beaches but we'll use the dogs to find people in the collapsed buildings sniff out bombs drugs etc but as a dog walker at the towns county shelter and i do other things too i've seen so many irresponsible humans i i do the monthly beach cleanup i picked up dog droppings on the beach you can go right across the causeway there's a dog beach to the right they have dog litter bags people don't use them there's it's it's successful sometimes until the tide comes in and washes it out um i love dogs i've always had dogs and like i said i'd love to bring my dogs on the beach but i wonder if we passed the ordinance or mr moore might have to research us if a dog bites somebody attacks somebody are we responsible since we created an orange short answer notes there's a strict liability statute in florida statutes for the owner of a dog a dog is simply considered property and so if your property harms somebody and you as the owner of that dog are responsible not the owner of the property um as an invitee unless you do something just incredibly careless like you just leave sausages lying around and you know in a kid's playground or something that you know there's always there's always a hypo where you can get to liability but i would say as a general matter there's already a strict liability statute for dog owners and florida is a strict liability state for dog owners i understand that but i'm thinking you see these leads today anywhere from 4 foot to 12 feet and i i guess all that would have to be modified in order thank you very much mr banker anyone else flame gun yeah i just called up some of those places so clearwater north beach fort de soto fort de soto honeymoon island paso gorilla picnic island apollo beach gandy bridge by centennial park my point is are you creating another attractive nuisance hey guess what delaware beach has a dog-friendly beach and guess what all of a sudden you're gonna have dogs everywhere and i the hourly thing is great but how do you enforce it and monitor it so my thing is i think you're going to open a can of worms with this thing i love dogs my mind on the beach i used to do a little cross by the bridge there but i'm i'm concerned about that and how do you monitor it and so i guess it's all or nothing if you want to do dog beach do dog beach but how do you moderate seven to nine or five to seven or whatever when already talking about sheriff's not being able to enforce certain things in certain houses who can't do it i'll add for your consideration on the legal side of it one of the complicating factors as it relates to dogs on the beach or other animals on the beach is the mental health or physical health support animal and whether or not people make spurious claims about it your ability to enforce is really limited to asking two questions is this a support animal and what support function does it serve and you can't say like prove it show me it could do a trick you know there's no there's no national certifying body that has an official license you carry if it's an emotional support animal or otherwise all of us here having lived through most of the pandemic know how easy it is to order just about anything on amazon people get best that at least invoke that language and then should anybody attempt to enforce you're met with a very obstinate refusal and an assertion that this is my emotional support animal and so as you as you look to enforce that is a complicating factor you should be aware of we're here talking mostly about recreational use um and mostly for residents during certain hours but you get somebody at let's say 10 30 a.m who says oh you know this isn't my recreational dog this is this there's not a lot you can do yes leslie um i'm not in favor of a lot of dogs on the beach we've got here's a dog park at the end of the causeway and there's santee park there and all the other dog beaches there are plenty of things and i think it just opened up a can of worms for the the mess left by the dogs i don't think i don't think there's any reason we need to take this step so where do we go with this i did interestingly enough i was talking to some people this uh this past week and they've been to jacksonville beach and they have exactly the same hours that seven to nine in the morning it was typically used only for residents because of the timing i get when you're saying glenn about the enforcing what's the penalty violating they had also installed the banky systems in particular locations so that um dog owners i think most of the dog owners that i even see [Music] and stuff like that so um and something you mentioned earlier it's something that could be reversible and we can differentiate [Music] would that be after that i have no idea is this an ordinance when it is isn't it so it would be an ordinance change my hand i'm just going to tell you a study was done several years ago sixty percent of the pet owners don't pick up really sixty percent you can give them a bag you give them the world and they won't pick up and you know i don't i'm not you know poor or against it it's just we get a lot of complaints about dogs on the beach when you set the officer there by the time you get there yeah but people you know like randy said we've got people there's two questions the sheriff can ask him uh that's all you can ask him of course he's got to catch him well that's the problem i mean we can't you know the staff can't ride a parking i mean they're doing it right now and yes it's illegal you're not going to catch it you're not going to be able to get a cop out there i'm just saying look allow it for our citizens limited time um you can put a time limit on an ordinance give it a try out actually bring it up to the people [Music] i think what you're going to find is is it's going to be a little more in 50 of people that don't want it would be my guess everyone has dogs in this in this city i mean they're just all over the place but i also see all the time people complaining about other dogs doing their business in their hearts and uh and that's that's proof of what lynn just said is the the issue you got good dog parents you got bad dog parents and i think most people's the way most people think is no one sees me i'm not taking it up everybody no i just appreciate your time i appreciate you let me bring this forward to you i do you know where we get the complaints from that's regular so you know if you want to explore more i would go talk to the people make the first move they call it it's in the short term round people they're probably the worst well yeah you know that i know that one at 3 200. i've been there because we told them hey don't let your uh people take their dogs on the beach and they do it anyway so just to clarify so if somebody um from bel air beach went to the sixth street parking facility that's not best so they brought their dog there to watch the sunset of course that would be past the morning so that's been like short speech it is and uh and that's us not being very good at papers right well you can take your dog to the excess it's just and you haven't seen nice pet owners just like you're talking about that come to this history with their dog on a leash but did not go to the to just stay right there like correct there's several people that do that okay uh any more anything else you'd like to add no okay well that's it i appreciate everyone uh staying and let's getting through all this it's really cool we need to have another work session uh go ahead mr goddard [Music] thing and the tags what if you're parking and i'm just gonna throw it out there i'm i don't know if it becomes a liability as much as it becomes um just use an example it surely goes and says well i got five teenagers i don't want to be hassling with this i'm gonna take this one there's five of them there i'm gonna take this one at home and then you're constantly losing things to say nothing with my abilities and i'm not thinking it all the way through i'm just saying hey we need to just we're trying to come up with some sort of a solution some way to identify the residents of lrb so that whenever the police are patrolling and they see lots of weirdness going on or they immediately look there they're not looking at us they're looking at that i recognize the beach accesses and parking is a particular issue but i do want to caution you in the broader senses because we have these discussions to remember that our beaches are public resources i've had this discussion in other communities especially in the midst of the pandemic where people felt like too many others are coming to our place and this is for us the beaches are a public resource and so those others are ostensibly welcome whether or not we actually feel that as residents in our various communities so you know whether it's one community trying to close a new box road because too many people are using it as a shortcut or any of these sorts of dialogues we have those are all public roadways public beaches public parks and there's no we can't make that distinction between residents and visitors alike it's just it's an important thing to note i'm not saying that you shouldn't be having this discussion certainly but just being mindful of the ultimate resource that we have so is it an issue then if we come to an agreement that our residents can put an umbrella that has a tag from our issue you can have resources limited to to residents in certain ways and that there's a correlation there between taxpayer funds and the like just like you can have resident decals and resident you know or a you know in some places that have indoor facilities there's a like i lived in dunedin the dunedin resident could use the fitness facility for free a non-domain resident was like ten dollars a month or something and so you can make those distinctions uh but just ultimately saying you know you're not welcome on this beach because you're not one of us um you know are you you came here i see your tag that's an alabama attack what are you doing in our beach that sort of thing it happens unfortunately but it's not it's not the way it changes okay i appreciate it um there's some great information in there that kind of sheds the light on a lot of issues going on yes and uh i believe that randy is moses and you're supposed to find this uh information i i appreciate that and since we've got the composition of the body here what i'm understanding there was an individual i believe in indian shores who circulated a you know a reading of the beach re-nourishment thing the one thing that i think is important to get on the record for you folks and your residents alike this council doesn't control a tree nourishment i don't think you're trying to but your residents will come to you and say why are you trying to take my land with an easement or why haven't you gotten this to handle and you know you're going to the county to the army corps of engineers and several tiers of of bureaucracy between you and sand getting on your beaches or that you could unilaterally control it i think you would handle it one way or the other by now um as it relates to that interpretation i i it has been circulated to me i skimmed it i didn't review it in great depth if you'd like me to do a point for point review of it i'm happy to do that i wasn't sure what level of attention you folks would like me in my other communities in some other communities i've worked in manager says hey be aware of this that way if we if somebody comes to us and says it says this why aren't you doing that you could speak to it others won't want a memorandum i just wasn't clear you know what from a work product standpoint i don't want to fail your first expectations and if i'm not clear about the expectations i think what my goal of bringing that into this council was to give everybody the opportunity to read what was being circulated to the people that one have already signed easements and two are being steered away from signing easements and i can't really say that i'm for against it one way or the other because there were some good points in the document it was it would certainly scare me and make me not want to sign it but i think at the end of the day the fed is not going to give us the money not this go round we've missed it and in that leads me back to pinellas county i feel that it's their responsibility to maintain these species if if they're not willing if the fed is not willing to give us money then it comes back to pinellas county because all this tourism is coming in they're collecting all this tax revenue and they're not really they're not maintaining what it is that makes this place so great which is having an awesome beach making it safe and protecting the wildlife and the uh the vegetation from our beaches and uh and they're also not protecting us if they allow these dudes to wash away then we're all in danger if we have a big one so that's kind of where i'm leaning now is is i'm ready to uh to start working with the other mayors and show up at a pinellas county meeting and say okay we tried we tried it your way now what's next what what else can you do for us because this is only going to get worse and the uh the fed is only going to continue demanding more and more if we give in this one time they're going to expect it you know not only knows what else they're going to expect so that's kind of where we are right now and i'll be having that conversation with him this week just to close that loop from where i said i can certainly maintain an awareness of the document if if you get to a point where you need something more detailed please let me know my only concern being of course i'm the town attorney not as you've used the term the fed attorney and what i say it means might be totally different than what the attorney on their payroll says it means and you know just something to be mindful of for that matter that the county my concern i'm not saying i'm incapable of giving advice that i'm certainly capable of when you're talking about what does this mean how does this program work how is it administered um that's not a regime that we ordinarily operate with and so if you wanted to do that i can do that but [Music] maintain your word well i think the uh the goal is to uh get a requo is that is that what you took out of that [Music] we're having to redesign it and we're gonna have to get another bid and i'll talk to you about that and what i heard you know you know it doesn't seem that you have any problem with us doing some more hammering on some of these trying to wait to do some research and then talk about redesigning yeah and we can do that in-house right the video we have the equipment no we don't have the equipment but we have a company that is on a contract okay and we've got the money in the budget installed so i was going to ask to borrow your cell phone all right which is not even on the list was we were going to go back and start working on the infrastructure projects and budgeting and do we want to have another work session or do we want to cool it this month or well this month is about over and now we're halfway through thoughts don't everyone voluntarily will have the next council to be the first person to have the next council meeting and then we'll have another workshop okay well uh everybody's good with that i'm looking for a motion to adjourn a little bit second all in favor all right"
