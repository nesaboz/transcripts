    "transcript": "good evening everyone welcome to the monday october 19th work session for the city council of the city of bel air beach um would everyone rise please for the pledge of allegiance i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all and clerk would you please call the role council member robin ockey here council member marv beam here council member dave gattis here councilmember rita swope here mayor joseph manzo here city manager lynn reeves uh he's muted you're muted lynn here city attorney fred reilly here and council member jody shirley was unable to attend and vice mayor gunn has not yet arrived okay we'll note when he comes in if he comes in later on okay um all right i can see everyone except for rita swope so if rita wishes to speak then um let me know that you desire to speak because i can't see a hand up or anything like that um we have eight items on our agenda last one ending with general business so the first one is the discussion of the communication advisory committee report um i the city council has the final report we got that previously and i note that patty also gave us a copy at around 4 30 today um this agenda does not have names of the people who are bringing these things so i don't know who to re reference over here so just go back to the city clerk and ask who is bringing this before us mayor these these were uh things that the city council needed to review at a work session they were they were brought up at the last meeting so they were just added to the agenda uh we need to get some direction from the council going forward patty redid the uh based on we got like four versions of the uh survey and we just need to get some consensus from the console to move forward on the survey we were gonna mail it put it online let people fill it out different ways and then there's some other things in the report that the committee recommended click send things of that nature that we need to start working on if we're moving forward with what they gave us is someone going to walk us through the items one by one i know dave was on the committee but is there someone who's going to kind of run us through this i mean that's a nice overview but i'm not sure what about the discussion i mean i don't mind but the primary thing we want that the committee brought up was getting a survey out to get community response so uh patty sent the revised one out you know an hour or so ago but uh we'd like to get some consensus from the council to go ahead and move forward with this and set up the mailing to the residents then i'm reading that as we speak so maybe i don't know if everyone's had a chance to look at it i'm going to take a minute i just got yeah let me just look at it and maybe everyone else can i know patty just sent it out at like 4 30 so yeah well there there were four versions of it put in the packet and uh the committee said to somehow call the versions and patty and i went through it and this is kind of where we landed so basically this is i mean if there is if if a citizen responds to this and puts their it looks like email information they have choice they could email text automated voicemail call number they could put they can elect to do that or then they could just say no we don't want to give you that information we'll just go pick it up on the website or however we wish to do it it's totally optional and it'll replace i guess any list that we have now is that the idea yes yeah because the current list is is not a very good list right and dave you want to weigh in on this since you were heavily involved in it no it's it's uh it's pretty straightforward um if you would like to be contacted by the city uh would you prefer email text phone call or do you want to just go pick it up at your leisure maybe look on the sign something like that what we're trying to do is we're trying to be as accommodating as possible with the citizens and uh and give them options if there's not a lot of interest in one area or another we we may not necessarily need to use that option so uh the the first step was to get this survey out and um see what how everyone wanted to receive messages uh we we've heard that um they want better communication that's that was a whole purpose of the uh of the committee and uh and basically you can you can provide them with information but unless they absolutely want it they're not going to ever have that information so now what we've done is we've given them an opportunity to make it easier on themselves to receive that information this is the first step uh once we have this information then we can go forward um we've we've sort of discussed the uh the click send uh which is it's very uh cost effective uh emails we're already doing part of that clicks in involves automated voice telephone calls robocalls also we have a facebook page that's already enabled i know we're not doing much with it and and it's strictly for one-way communication but that's one way and then we also have the baylor beach website so as far as the the redundant forms of communication if we find out people don't want to look on facebook well maybe we'll turn it off and just rely on the website and then of course uh finally is the message board which uh i i believe that that's a topic that we should go ahead and cover tonight um i know that we're we're probably waiting on insurance to um to resolve their side of things but uh we sort of discussed uh touched on this at our last meeting about what we were going to do and uh and i think this is something we need to hash out because right now we we don't have anything more i said this once before the only thing i'd like to add to this list of email text message or whatever is a no response no response means your the city is not going to send you anything meaning you don't want any and if they don't want anything why even bother mailing anything out it's just a waste of time or money that's what we're trying to do is to get a list of people that are interested in the city affairs but on the other hand we've had problems before where the people say well i never got the information if this form is sent to everybody with that notation in there at least we won't hear any complaints about people not getting in for any information hi let emerson know oops sorry i'm sorry i thought i was muted my husband's leaving you're getting very excited about the topic there um marv i i think that's a good idea i have a ques actually it rose a question in my mind if somebody how often do we plan on taking this survey and and to what marvin just said i like the idea of saying hey don't bother me i don't want anything but you know you go moving out of town all right and now the next person inherits your house and you're not gonna be getting any information you know do we are we gonna be able to track the new folks that move in um and maybe get this survey to them because i would hate really for somebody to be uninformed you know that moves into the town based on the election that their you know predecessor made well we don't get just so you know we the uh the only way we would get that information is through updating the property appraiser we do a code review we know a house is selling but we don't know who it's selling to we don't get that information from the title company well could you then i mean you do know that it's selling right because you do that code review to make sure there's no liens right that's pretty much standard process so would it be possible that city hall when you get that you make a note and then you send out one of these surveys you know maybe a month later after the new person moves in um give them the option to elect in or out right that that's not a issue we could do that that's a small number of people right right but i mean this i just don't want to see you know because somebody could be here for five years ago i mean i didn't even know there was information coming out and yeah well that's what the person before you elected dave i think it's fine and add marv's comment in and everybody else has any comments but i think this is good to go out right now and i don't know what everybody else thinks but i'm fine with it well also to uh to add uh to uh what you were discussing with lynn just now i see no reason at all why this shouldn't be a yearly event that once a year we send this out and let's see if they update it or if new people add on to it they may decide they don't want mobile and don't want to opt out but i don't know what to do and we could certainly make those changes for them just to update the database so that's uh that's my opinion on it yeah about the only things we adjusted on the form we didn't figure we needed somebody to sign it that that was on sign and dated we didn't really that didn't matter to us we just wanted to collect the information i don't know my only thought about putting the comment marv made on it uh that sounds like hey if i don't want your information now don't bother me i i i'm a little iffy on that thought just that's just my preference but if people don't want to be contacted they aren't going to fill the form out that's that's pretty factual i was i was kind of thinking the same thing i mean there there are plenty of of i can ignore you uh methods up there uh basically you can check put a check on on the website or the the message board at city hall and that's pretty much uh i'm gonna go get the information on my own i don't need to tell you that i'm not interested um i i think it lynn is right that that's uh maybe it's just one of those things we don't really need because at the end of the day um we're going to maintain the other items anyway so i just don't want a phone call i don't want a voicemail or a text message and i don't want to email if those one of those three or all of those three are not checked well there you go i'd like to go ahead and speak as well i'll agree with uh city manager lynn reeves and council member dave gaddis's comments i don't think that should be on there they can figure out another method to get the information if they want or fill out the server change the survey when they get it the next time or go into city hall the other option is they just don't respond anyone else um this is work session we don't normally uh ask for public comments but i do note that there's a hand up from a jeff um it's up to the council if we wish to uh undertake public comments we've historically listened um does anyone have an objection to uh to having uh jeff speak everybody's good okay patty could you um get jeff brought in here and he'll have to give his name an address please jeff there it is okay hey jeff uh i'm sorry i hit that by mistake so i don't really have my hand up and wasn't able to figure out how to take it off okay just click it again there you you're good okay thank you did anybody else want to speak from the public all right and we'll close that um so i guess the consensus is to go forward with it lynn marv you're okay with your comment not being on it absolutely go with what dave says basically was generally across the board okay thank you so i guess we're good with that were there other issues with the um on the communications that we need to resolve tonight no i think this is the the basically the first step so that that's what we're trying to resolve and get the consensus of the console so we can move forward with it when will that go out uh approximately i'd say within the next month we'll send it out i'll put a put a letter together as a cover letter just to say blah blah blah please fill us out and return it to us and and we'll put it up on the website so you have it uh we'll notify the console the date of the mailing okay my only concern is that you know we're coming up with thanksgiving the holidays and all of that stuff in another month believe it or not so um just if you know people get a lot of they get inundated they get overwhelmed at the time so i mean if there's a way we could maybe get it out before without you know killing ourselves at headquarters here that would probably be great if not then it goes out when it goes out yeah we've got to send it to the printer and get that back and get it set up for mailing so these will be post paid for them to return post paid uh we can do that there was money set aside in the budget or we can uh we weren't weren't intending to do that just bringing it up you might get better well but but if you i guess what i need to do is talk to the if i do it through a mail or maybe we won't be billed for things that don't get sent back to us because if we did it here we would be paying the postage for nothing i don't know dave what's your thought we had several ideas about that um we feel that uh some people will not want to to mail something back with their personal information on it um so another option was to have a dropbox at city hall where they could just swing in there and drop it off the third option was to have a form on the website so if you don't want to fill out this form you can go to this web address and put your information in there and then it would email no matter what all three methods require human intervention to translate it and put it into a database so in in those three cases there's a good possibility not all of them will be mailed back and uh if we're prepaying for postage yeah it would uh it would cost us uh on the other hand uh we're trying to make an honest genuine effort and i think it's worth the investment talking to the mailer you guys say you could look into what a permit call you know cost and then i think you only pay based on the amount of responses as opposed to like you say running through the mail machine you're out a half a buck every one so right okay all right then let's move on to number two if there's no other comments we'll move on to the discussion of the park and recreation board recommendation for the marina rental rates there was a insert in our packet yeah this is uh me kind of getting some feedback from the console uh this is the information that uh mr luss gave us and you know he provided this during his presentation uh the park and rec board was fine with it uh i will tell you i did a little more research and the last time that we raised the rates at the marina was in 2006 which was 14 years ago if if i took the seven dollars by the rate of inflation from 2006 to today the new rate would be 9.14 so over the years the rates haven't been raised periodically unfortunately so we're kind of behind the eight ball as far as rates go if you look at from an inflation rate and i think most people expect through inflation things will go up uh so what i what i'd like to do uh if the council's okay with that i'd like to go back to the park and rec board and say hey let's look at it from a different aspect is the inflation rate something we should use or should we do it in a programmed line we have a minimum right now of of 30 feet yes reducing the minimums will lower some people's fees for a little while but it will raise other people's fees also so it was kind of a war the presentation that was given to the console uh it's been what month month and a half ago maybe two months that it was given to you so i i just want some quick feedback where does the console want to go with this mark well as we we talked before about this i think dropping it back to a 25 foot and let it level off and then eventually the rates will go up after that um maybe tag on a dollar a foot for the people that do use the electricity for a boat that's over 35 or have an air conditioning system in there but other than that leave it alone lynn based on your research it looks as if we're probably and again i know bill us did a very very comprehensive analysis for us and you know we're not we can't compare ourselves necessarily against some marinas because they have much much more to offer than us but you know by the same token no i wish everything didn't rise since 2006 that would be great you know but um this is a bargain i think so there might be some upside potential over here and i think we you know we still can remain competitive for what we give the individuals i'm not a boater so i can't really you know speak intelligently about all the amenities that we have and don't have but um you know if it can go up a little bit we can bring it up a little bit better you know to reflect the inflationary costs i mean all of our costs went up over since so um you know if we want to adjust minimums that's fine but maybe raise the per square foot i i have no objection to any of it really so i just think we should keep it as fair as we possibly can competitive as we possibly can it doesn't have to be the greatest bargain in the world you know it has its has some pretty nice benefits dave you had some comments prior to this what do you think um really my only comment was uh let's task the uh uh the committee and uh or the the board rather parks and rec board and uh they were to make recommendations and we were to decide whether we were going along with it or not uh i'm i'm fine uh either way honestly i'm indifferent on it well they are having a another the park and rec board's got a meeting november 4th and uh if the console's okay with that i'd i'd like to take this back to them and discuss the options with the uh inflation everybody good with that i'm good with it okay and everybody looks good with that okay lynn that's the plan so november 4th then you can report back to us if we have a november work session okay right thank you anybody else have any comments on that patty anybody and i don't see any citizens hands up on any citizen's comments i think we're good to move on then we'll close that topic so now we move to item three which is discussion of the pinellas county sheriff's office traffic enforcement results and supplemental service um i know i had asked about the supplemental service last time and lynn i know was awaiting the uh traffic results which we got today so then i'll turn it over to you because i'm sure you've probably had discussions with the um captain and other individuals but uh you can maybe walk us through this then we can discuss where we want to go well we'll just go to to page six that that seems to be the simplest and trying to break out weekends but uh over the two weeks uh the sheriff uh spent 227 hours of hours uh at a cost of about 12 500 uh in that time they had uh 214 traffic stops 57 citations 183 warnings as you can see by the report they averaged a traffic stop per hour now if you look at the citations the majority of the citations were on causeway and that's where the majority of the warnings and citations together were combined and basically it's coming over the bridge uh where the speeds were at a higher level gulf boulevard they only gave four citations and what they were using was spotters and there was a spotter deputy somewhere and police cars at other locations when he called them out as an example we had a spotter at uh causeway and golf there at the stoplight he sat on the bench for several hours and basically a deputy you know if somebody kept wherever they ran the stoplight they went after him uh when it came to here at city hall that they had the people in the parking lot ready to to catch the uh any speeders and they had a deputy posted uh that was clocking the speed in civilian clothes that was unbeknownst to anyone if you look at the citation wise the cost of that basically they they gave one ticket for every four man hours of use which four man hours is 220 dollars uh and that's using a spotter and a deputy uh the area that we've talked about many times where were on bay shore just to go through that the stop sign uh based on the conversation i had with the deputies a lot of this was our residence rolling through the stop sign it wasn't really cutter cut throughs and i think it would be very limited if that and the only way you're going to catch them is to you would have to have a spotter and a another car that would catch anyone rolling through that stop sign most most of them were saturday in the pm uh on bay shore and sunday morning so uh the kind of thought from that was that you know it was people leaving their home or vice versa coming back uh as you note in the detail there were a lot of a few of our residents got into discussions because they got stopped uh which you know unfortunately uh that's not a good thing i don't think uh and they they did cite the spotters so based on this information uh the console kind of has to weigh in and and give us some thoughts on where do you want to go with this is the value there is it really the bridge that's the the bigger problem and can uh our current situation and occasional speed things be set up which they've always done here at city hall over the years they've always had those occasionally help with that speed so just just need a little feedback lynn i would like to say i don't personally think the value is there that seems like a lot of money for no more than they were able to you know actually stop people which i guess is good because that means we don't have a lot of speeders and and that kind of stuff that as we originally thought um what i would like to ask is the ticket revenue for the bridge that doesn't go to bellar beach anyway so i don't know why we would um even think about bringing in extra patrols to ticket people on the bridge when we're not making any money off of that correct no we we get a a small token of that because it's a ticket written yeah it's uh i'd venture to say we probably get uh 35 40 bucks out of a ticket it's very minimal when there's a ticket given uh by the county that we get you know any great sum of money i mean i can get more detail if you want that but it's it's a small amount more you know it's not about the cost um it's about safety it's not about how much money we spend uh one question to you what did the sheriff think it was beneficial or were they surprised at the amount of speeders and the over the speed limit no he basically what the feedback i got from them uh they said the only area they would focus on if it was them was coming over the bridge onto causeway boulevard uh that that's was the direction or the comment that was made by captain liner and in in talking to the deputies that were involved in it uh they agreed with that the ones that i talked to that it's mainly the they get up over the top of the bridge they don't hit their break and by the time they're getting in the city uh so you know it's it's it's kind of a mixed bag as you can see the majority of citations and warnings were at causeway dave um what i see is i see um 18 violations where people ran the stop sign right red light rather and and i can tell you what it is because it happens every time they approach it they make a right turn they're looking left they're not paying any attention to anything coming right i see 18 potential injuries or deaths where someone could be crossing that intersection and the driver is not paying any attention especially if they if the pedestrian has a walk side and they're crossing that intersection there's a good possibility it's i've almost been hit there several times myself because they do not look um to me that's far more important than the 30 speeders on the causeway but i believe they're it's a combined effort i believe that out of those 18 or out of the 30 18 of them were also speeding yeah that's that's a possibility the the problem with catching this the rolling through the stop sign you would have to actually have two off-duty personnel to do that because you would need a person in civilian clothes somewhere as a spotter because if they see the and this was brought up by even the sheriff office if they see a police car they're going to stop if they don't they may roll through it so you're not going to catch them if there's a police car sitting there do you mind if i respond to that yeah yeah dave um where i saw them cat i saw one person get caught running that traffic light and uh where the policeman was sitting at was in the park yes uh in the parking lot and uh and of course that's after you've made the right turn and he's on the left side of the street uh he's in clear view uh of that traffic light so i'm not sure what they're talking about why why it takes two people to catch somebody running the stop sign or the traffic light but robin um i often see people pulled over is it on either 12th or 13th street that very first street on the right i often see people there so and because i've seen people there i darn well make sure that i stop for a full second just to make it known so i think that's a deterrent and i think they're kind of already policing that so i don't know if we need to police it more so i don't know if the cost is really beneficial so i think most of those are the speeders that they're catching oh yeah because they're already in a hurry they're gonna and so they're pulling out of city hall in a lot of cases because the the police cars sitting here kind of hidden behind our building they're coming over and they catch them with radar they don't see them and by the time they get them pulled over they end up making their turn so what you're seeing is is very true but i've also seen the cops like park there on 12th waiting yeah so i mean i've seen them looking for it and it's definitely a great deterrent so i don't know if the cost is i mean if they said they found 50 people and it was like exuberant amount of people then i'd be like okay it would be worth it but i don't know if that amount of money is worth it so i'm kind of iffy on this one the um you know i i think we have to keep in mind our strategic plan and it's not about making money it's about safety uh that's our number one priority for this city and we've talked about this for a long time every one of these i'm with dave gaddis every one of these could have been i mean we had somebody 50 miles an hour on the bridge i mean you're gonna kill somebody that bridge can't handle that um running stop signs running lights this is bad stuff in little city um we've talked about it for a while and i think it's good my only problem with this is if this was new jersey there wouldn't be 183 warnings there would be like 200 tickets and maybe 14 warnings and i think that's your solution for paying for it in the future because these are ticket blitzes okay this is what happens you're going to get a ticket if you break these laws and basically it's it's one of these things that you know i think dave gatt has said it last time we were here the message goes out that you aren't going to be permitted to play games anymore in bel air beach you're not going to run through here doing 55 on our bridge and you're not going to run our lights and stop signs and stuff like that and the only thing i would say is i i would definitely be in favor of seeing this happen again i just did the math real quickly and lynn if we get about 40 a ticket and we were doing 200 tickets that's 8 000 now that's not such a big hit anymore for the city to put something on like this every once in a while when we decide it's maybe time to to you know get everyone's attention again so um i'm in favor of it and if it means spending a couple thousand dollars out of our revenue that's fine robin i would be fine if it's a periodic thing you know holidays obviously when there's gonna be more traffic or like you said maybe a few times a year just to say hey we're here we're watching and then in reference to them saying that the residents got mad well you do the crime you do the time you know if you speed you get a ticket hey i'm not gonna get out of now i'd had a cop for catching me doing something wrong i'm gonna say all right you caught me thank you sorry lesson learned i won't do it again hence why i haven't had a speeding ticket in like 20 something years because i learned my lesson so i feel bad that the residents are abusing the sheriffs and yelling at them because the resident shouldn't be entitled because i'm a bel-air resident i shouldn't get a ticket no that's not how this works you speed you get ticket well well i will i will tell you that there have been people tell the sheriff i live in bel air beach so so congratulations mark i think we should do it periodically again with the undercover cars seems to work a little better and the mayor i agree with you forget the warnings do the tickets yeah it's ticket blitz time and you know i mean we'll even give i'll tell you we're such benevolent folks we'll announce it at our council meeting that we're going to have a ticket blitz in november because no one's going to listen you know that's fine and the bad guys who are flipping through the town you know doing 55 well yeah sorry we did tell you you know i mean i'm with you you know look i wouldn't want to get a 200 ticket either but i don't do 55 on the bridge so i'm not going to get that ticket it's real simple and if they were busting chops you know the bridge is 35 it's real easy to get it up to 40 if you're coasting your way down i could see people being annoyed but when you're telling me you're doing 55 on a bridge or you blew through a stoplight i mean i'm with dave what do we have to wait for somebody to get killed that could be one of your family or mine and i don't want it you know i i think we periodically do this win i mean maybe we can get some recommendation from the sheriff but i do want to see i mean if we can get money out of this to offset our costs that would be great and i know also during some times of the year there's different programs i know like mothers against drunk driving things like that have different programs to um there's money that they actually give during the years for certain stepped-up enforcement so maybe you know we can check with the sheriff of what might be available to defray some of this stuff because there are times of the year that the sheriff has his you know the blitzes on on drunk driving and things like that right he does that here periodically with this the speeding he'll bring six or eight cars here in the morning and park them in this parking lot outside of city hall what i will go back and talk to them about because what i'm hearing from the console is we don't want you to give warnings we want you to give tickets uh and and see what what feedback i get from them and if if we're going to do the supplemental we'll have to amend the budget or do some adjustments for because we'll have to uh set up a contract for supplemental policing and a suggestion from them lynn as to some of the best times i i don't want to i mean i don't want to necessarily give away our cards to everybody and say you know necessarily here's what you know here's the times to worry about and go break the law during the other times but you know kind of give us an idea what they think is best i mean we don't you don't want to be patrolling in a time when there's just not a lot of people here or something like that yeah well how they did this how we based the the time selection was based on the data we got from the boxes that we put out there before we did this and and that's why you see times like two to two to seven on bayshore or the different times in the afternoons that they did it in the evening uh time frame so uh that's that's what we used to collect the data was to pick those priority times where they were capturing some speed at uh that time of day so we'll go back to them uh and uh i don't know does the console have a number that they're looking at they want to allocate to this for discussion uh what do you want every three months every two months maybe every quarter yeah yeah but we we're not talking about doing what they did 250 hours we're talking about compacted okay okay well i'll come up with some calculations and we'll get the contract uh back from them and then we'll figure that out okay dave and ben robin okay so this is i'm looking at roughly two weeks of hardcore pulling people over is that right right right okay so we we pretty much have there's a there's a budget a starting budget right there so if if it was every two weeks um they did this uh then or they did it you know two weeks on two weeks off well we're looking at a little over twelve thousand dollars well what if it was one random week per month and we don't announce when it is we don't wanna know when it is but they come in and and you know wide open for one week out of every month and and now we're we're down to six thousand dollars i mean it could be a weekend too you have you know the games seem to happen on the weekend at least for my observation and going around it you know so i mean yeah i guess you'll get people on a tuesday morning but you're going to get a lot more on a saturday afternoon particularly you know once we get you know past the holidays here yeah we did thursdays we did sundays we did saturdays uh tuesday and wednesday if you you know get delve into these reports a little more you can kind of see the the time frames we utilized it and like i said it was all based on the data we collected from the boxes so so i guess we're asking you to get come back maybe with some a little bit more detail from the sheriff basically i mean this changes a little bit you know i know we have a very benevolent sheriff sometimes with warnings versus tickets and um you know that would be maybe a little change in the way they want to do business so i think that's something you're gonna have to kind of discuss with them and get back to us because right to make this thing cost effective you know we're gonna have to kind of step up the ticket quotient if if that's what's gonna happen it's a blitz i mean and it's and again i don't i don't want them you know i don't wanna get inside they don't do it anyway but they're they're not getting somebody who's going a mile over the speed limit but we want the abusers ticketed and you know the if it's if it's marginal maybe that's a warning but um there's a lot of warnings here that would never happen in some places robin have you gotten any feedback from the sheriff about recalculations for bellaire sure i'm just gonna keep bringing it up because i don't want it to be dropped and forgotten no he told told me he was going to look into that after the fiscal year which will will bother him again because now we're in the new fiscal year okay yeah we haven't forgot about it i'm just going [Music] okay i'll i'll bring you some information back and i'll have a further discussion with the sheriff and we'll see where it goes from there okay i didn't see any hands raised up so i haven't asked for any citizens comments but um i don't see any hands patty no okay we'll conclude it then um so we'll move on to item number four discuss recognition for purcells uh yes i i'm the one that asked for this um i would like to see the purcells recognized i think it would be a great idea to have a member of the sheriff's department as well as maybe a member of the blue thunder to come in and present them with a certificate of acknowledgement for all of the efforts they've put into back in the blue since you know we just had a long discussion about how important it is to have sheriffs in our city and i think that you know they should be recognized for their efforts and continue continuing to support them i'm going to speak up on this um i don't know the purcells they've taken the opportunity to write about me even though they don't know me um on social media said some stuff that's not true about me i don't have anything against the purcells i saw him the other day said hello to him in the morning um they said good morning i said good morning back what the purcells do each day is and i know they believe in their cause i think they they believe in supporting blue so they stand outside very patriotic with american flag and a sign that says support blue and they wave at motorists they've started as early as 8 30 a.m um they typically go for an hour to an hour and a half each day and that is fine okay i i'm glad they support law enforcement i support law enforcement i think everybody on our council has i just asked for more money to be spent on law enforcement um i serve on the pinellas county um emergency services uh citizen board as one of the mayor's representatives so i totally support him um but i don't support what's happening because what's happening is because of their actions people are violating our laws with impunity in our city um people react to them by beeping car forms and it's not a one day thing you know sheriff galtiary was here and he said what am i supposed to do on election day you know arrest everyone i said no because it's a one day okay this started july 21st two more days it will be 90 days i think they missed two days because of the rain um but it's been 90 consecutive days of this for an hour to an hour and a half i have spoken with lynn reeves i know lynn reeves spoke with captain liner we tried putting some signs up it made it worse they took the signs down i think the last conversation at least written that lin had according to my records was in august sheriff galtiary asked captain liner to get with me to make sure i was satisfied he called me i sent him a tape which i'm gonna have you listen to tonight he never called me back so this just keeps going on in our city and the problem i have is that section 22-61 in our noise ordinance says that horns and signaling devices are illegal except as a danger warning um that's the number one thing in our noise ordinance and if you don't like that then we've got the state ordinance that says um no vehicle shall i'm sorry the driver uh to ensure safe operation shall give an audible warning with his or her horn um you're not permitted to beat your horns because you support people and i've given fred reilly a court case right from our own sixth circuit that says you have no right to do that so we have this going on and it's going on day after day after day and people are annoyed with it we've had at least four neighbors in my area complain um people including myself were skewered on social media which is not right i'm trying to enforce the laws i support law enforcement but this isn't the way to do it so i want you to hear this is exactly what captain liner heard i'm going to play three minutes and 21 seconds this was not enhanced it was simply my phone placed on the um on the balcony about three feet from my bedroom window and this is what it sounds like for three minutes multiply this by 60 and that's what you're gonna get every single day it hasn't started yet oh that's gonna say i'm not here nothing it's only when cars come by me [Laughter] [Music] this [Music] [Music] uh easy okay folks that's three minutes so when they go for an hour and a half multiply that by 60 and you have a pretty good idea of the noise of that's going on that's supposedly helping the police unfortunately it's not helping the police the police have asked them to stop our code enforcement officer asked them to stop they haven't stopped um i don't see that it's actually producing anything for our city other than well a lot of violations that are going unchecked um this is not acceptable in a city that calls itself a premier city it's disturbing the neighbors it's disturbing people and yes there's people that support the cause i support their cause i just don't support the way this is being done um our city has to do something about this our sheriff has to do something about this and our city manager has to do something about this our city attorney is going to have to do something about this so it's going to wind up costing us money because i think there's legal considerations here you can't enforce your noise ordinance if you're going to let people every day violate the first thing that's in it i don't know how you go to somebody's house who's playing a loud stereo and tell somebody to turn that off when you sit here and permit for an hour to an hour and a half per day this blatant violation for 90 days running so i'm calling on this council and the city to do something um it's it's i believe a targeted protest fred reilly can tell you what that means not going to give you a lot of legal ease here but we're going to have problems if we don't get a handle on this that's all i want to say so i have no problem with thanking the purcells for their support of law enforcement but i i just wish they would find a different way to show that support robin no i agree that's very annoying especially if it's for an hour like that and i wouldn't want that outside my house so i mean and of course i support the cause and i appreciate that appreciate them supporting the cause but can we maybe find a middle ground and find a compromise like they can do it but maybe move around do it in front of city hall one day do it on another street another day do it somewhere else and i know they're going to say now well we can't park on the street blah blah blah but hey maybe we can give them a pass that hey as long as they're supporting this cause they can park on whatever belair beach street they want but move it around so that the same area is not getting inundated with this noise pollution because you know it's true like what happens if i lived right next door to them and i decided one hour every day i was gonna blare my stereo you know reggae music and are you gonna come after me when you don't you know so i mean i see both sides i'm all about the police it's not that i don't care if they were supporting black lives matters or honk your horn if you love your chihuahua i don't care but i think a compromise would be fine where maybe we could get them to spread the love for the police because honestly where they're at you probably don't get as much traffic as if you would in front of like city hall or just so you know and i'm gonna i'm gonna open it up i'm not i'm not gonna speak anymore about i just wanna give a fact to your point they all those suggestions you made which are all excellent have been raised to them and they've declined every single one of them they were they were told that it's not convenient for them and we said you can get a pass we'll let you park in city hall spread it around it's better equipped there's more space the marina gives you a hundred plus feet by the way i think there's a misconception here people are publishing stuff like well there's a vacant house so you can't hear a car horn a car horn to be legal in the state of florida must be audible at least 200 feet i've got neighbors four houses down from me that are hearing this stuff so it's you could imagine i'm 60 feet away from this and um it's it's more than annoying i mean it's it's actually i think it's actually becoming an issue okay um so all that stuff has been brought to their attention they refuse to do it okay and the city can set legally reasonable time place and mana restrictions which fred reilly can tell you about um so we don't have to permit somebody to stand on the same corner and torture the neighbors by doing this okay again it doesn't matter the cause i'm with you you know they have a trump flag out there now i'm i got a trump flag on my house okay it doesn't matter whether it's a trump flag abiding flag a romney flag it doesn't matter okay i have a sheriff's by the way i have a sheriff's servant galtiary sign on my house um it doesn't matter it's your cause doesn't matter it's the law breaking that's the problem dave gattis i think right now we're in a time of political indifference where everyone is energized about everything right now i'm not sure if we would be inviting more problems by trying to put a stop to it i am certainly not for rewarding someone for uh for uh using their free speech i i there's lots of people waving flags all over the county right now i don't think we need to give out prizes for that uh for for that uh type of behavior uh that i say that um we grin and bear get through this election cycle and then if it continues maybe then we address this i'm just afraid that if we try to stop these people from um exercising their their first amendment uh right they it may very well more people may come and you may have uh incessant hornblowing uh between now and election day um i will tell you this and i'm i share with you that i'm not saying to stop them okay i i don't like what's there it's arguable whether they're violating law or not they're probably not the way i read the law um certainly our city attorney would have to make an opinion as to whether there's even anything there but um the people beeping the horns are clearly violating the law they're violating too they're violating a a state law and a local law by the way i'm a note that glenn gunn is connecting at this point um 657 um but i i mean i i do think that you know i agree with you i don't think it's something that should be rewarded ironically a person wrote me a letter i think she wrote everybody a letter on council um and they go out and they pick up garbage on the beach so much so that they unfortunately earned the nickname of the garbage lady but it's actually said in a nice way she picks up garbage on our beach for 15 years um i mean that's something i want to recognize if we're going to do it but something like this i mean there's other ways of supporting the police and quite frankly uh i'm sure i know the police appreciate it but you know there's police uh staffs like st petersburg that are getting defunded by their city and um i i know i know chief holloway i can get the person in contact with them i'm sure the chief would appreciate the support down in st petersburg because there's a mayor that does not support the police and uh that's not what we have in our city robin yeah you have your mute button there you go yeah um you know it's hard because i know that the technically the people in violation of the law are the people honking the horns but it's not like people that drive by that are honking the horns know they're breaking the law because you know you i didn't know that until and i never would have known that if i wasn't on council and this issue came up so it's hard to enforce that part of it and you don't want to pull people over and give them a ticket for the horn so it's kind of like yeah i'm with dave i don't think we need to address this right this second but you know but talking about that things are getting heated because of the election cycle of the political environment now i mean this has been going on since july but because of the hype of the political it shouldn't be addressed right this second let's wait till november end of november and see but we may have to get a little a little stricter and i don't know how to do that i'm just saying that i think it needs to be reasonable and i'm with dave i don't think like if i go out there and start waving my political person's flag for an hour every you know saturday i'm not going to expect a reward so i don't think you should reward them for this i mean if the sheriff wants to go up to him and acknowledge him and say thank you well then that's fine but i'm with dave i don't think we need to reward somebody exercising their first amendment right in that case i want to reward on next you know on november 3rd when i do my vote so just saying anyone else all right so the consensus is then um we're going to wait and monitor this mr reeves i would like to hear back from captain liner he promised me a phone call and it's not like him not to return my phone calls he promised me sheriff galtieri asked him to get with me so um i wrote i spoke to him august 21st um i'd like to hear from him and i'd like to discuss this issue a little bit further with him so um i want him to be up to date on what we just discussed tonight and uh the sheriff himself asked for him to contact me so i'd appreciate that telephone call coming um because i would hate like hell to have to call you know and and remind the sheriff that i didn't get that call back yeah i'll i'll mention that to captain leiner uh and i will tell you that the console as a whole when the signs were put up there it it was it was a lot worse and it was happening and after seeing that for two or three days i told the sheriff take those signs out of there because all it was doing was making people honk at six o'clock at night or whenever the mayor probably would know better me but no it was pretty bad but you know the other thing you know i just wanted to add something to what dave said before you know we talked about it could make matters worse this weekend and again i i'm i'm everyone knows i have my trump flag outside but there was a apparently a trump rally i heard it all the way here um didn't know that was happening but uh there were some complaints from some citizens that you know they were it was pretty disturbing and they couldn't get out of their street and then people were on megaphones and horn honking and everything else and you know again it i'm not going to say that that's acceptable because he's my guide it's not acceptable at all okay and on the way back i actually thought there was a fight going on outside my house and there was a bunch of people and i'm not going to say the word because there might be youngsters listening but they were using the f word up and down the block f bellaire beach f u beller beach f u f u i mean i'm sorry i didn't pay 700 000 for this okay we're better than this and you know i'm not taking away anybody's free speech right but when you invite this and and yes it's a good cause i think what the purcell's trying to support the police that's great but you have to realize i heard somebody one morning pretty much giving them the uh a real jaw boning because i guess their girlfriend or friend was beaten by the police and they were ripping into him i'm afraid that the counter protesters or someone else catches wind of this and all of a sudden we get a scene in bellar beach that we really don't want you know so i mean there are people we all like the police and we support them and everything there are people that do not like them and when they come to town they're not waving american flags you know so i just want to caution everyone that we're kind of playing with gasoline here anyone else who closed the topic yeah a friend well i want to say several things the obvious um he cut out can you hear me now yeah after several things we didn't hear a thing so go ahead start again okay i i knew this was coming up so i've looked at several things and i i can cover a number of things the the first thing i would tell you is that i i would separate the uh original topic which is honoring citizens versus whether the how the laws are being enforced i i know they're uh in in some ways inextricable but i i think at times the the decision-making process for the council gets confused when other things are brought in and are other factors that are considered instead of the factor that's on on the table having said that the anybody that's on the sidewalk that's a uh typically a public forum and it's constitutional for somebody to stand on the sidewalk with a sign that like robin said i love my chihuahua or i back the blue or you know um it's a sunny day and you know god bless you whatever they say that that is a constitutional place so you have other than uh you know requesting uh nicely somebody to relocate i don't know that there's much you can do to restrict a public forum having said that there it it's really not appropriate in my uh opinion for somebody to purposely um do something in a one location that is uh is targeted to annoy um somebody specifically and you know that that really shouldn't be going on and i i wish people would um you know behave in a different manner than doing that if indeed that is what's going on i i don't have personal knowledge of that but i know um there's a lot of chatter in bel air beach on social media about lots of things and you know i i am just making the observation that it it really should not be a targeted thing because that in a in inevitably leads to a different problem which is something i can talk at length about or i would rather actually not talk at length about but i will mention it if you have laws on the book then you're you have a an obligation to enforce the laws if you choose to not enforce the laws or you choose to do things that are um one of a better phrase arbitrary and capricious that inevitably will get you into trouble so the uh the situation that you have here is that you don't have a police force you subcontract that with the sheriff's department you subcontract your work with code enforcement to the sheriff's department and there's contracts that govern that and i i could can read to you right now what the legal standards are in each of those contracts but you know you're you have a another party other than the city that is actually doing the enforcement and i i will say on their behalf um they have finite resources and they um you know police certainly have some degree of discretion and um you know they there's other things that they could be doing and a lot of their work in my opinion is priorities but um i i've talked to both lynn and mayor manzo about this on several occasions to me it is a a difficult problem um i think robin brought up the issue of whether the person with a sign is committing a a violation my uh my reading of that would be under most circumstances they they were not the person that's beeping the horn under the the florida statute and the city's code provision is the one that is uh potentially arguably committing an offense and they're the one that should um you know be penalized if they're doing something that's in violation of the law having said all that this is uh uh something where i i simply don't have a silver bullet um to to offer you as as to what is the solution i i will uh read you one line out of the agreement with the sheriff's department about law enforcement and this basically was brought up before and i i think it would be if the decision that you make tonight is to uh and i'm putting the purcells aside if the decision you make tonight with respect to um how how do you get a consensus on uh the further action you take if any um i i'd like you to keep this in mind this is from the sheriff's contract that says in the event that uh such concerns arise the sheriff will meet and confer with the city manager on policy matters regarding the delivery of such services and attempt to resolve any disputes or misunderstandings between them so that that's in the contract i think you basically did that once already i would suggest to you that that be done again and as several people have pointed out there's possibly some hope that uh sometime within two to three weeks things will come down on a lot of different fronts although there's no guarantee that will happen so i can respond to any questions if if you have have them but i just wanted to give you some things to think about in the event that um you want to reconstruct you want to revisit this in the future thank you fred um i just you know i've read the con the sheriff's contract too and there's also a provision that says the sheriff shall discharge his responsibility by the disagreement by the enforcement of all state laws county ordinances applicable within the city and the ordinances of the city now i'm not advocating that the sheriff's in breach of the contract i'm not but and then there's certainly room for discretion but we just saw a chart by lynn reeves that we had sheriff services for multiple weeks and i'm i guess a little surprised that we didn't throw a sheriff down here and maybe attack this problem you know and let people see that this is not acceptable again you know we have laws on our books and it is targeted i can give you two inches of postings from the internet we're collecting them all and um it's uh it's a problem okay i think it's something we have to look at i'm certainly amenable to saying give it a little bit more time election day i think is only two weeks or two and a half weeks away um maybe this will change but you know i don't want to wake up christmas morning listening to this okay and i don't think anybody else should have to if it was in front of your house you wouldn't want it it was fun of lynn's house you wouldn't want it robin shaking her head i know she wouldn't want it doubt the kids would like it so i i don't think this is something we should be doing and our city needs to make an attempt not just throw up its hands so i'm willing to try and speak i want to speak with captain liner that was sheriff galtiary's order um i don't direct him i'm just going to give him my opinion being an eyewitness here lynn reeves will i know lynn last thing i saw was from august i know you did something on the signs but um maybe it's time to step it up and let them know that the problem is ongoing they know it because they drive by every day i see them um and i'm monitoring it guys i mean i'm not sitting here doing nothing i'm monitoring it so um you know let's see what we can do maybe someone can speak to these individuals i think rita knows them maybe she can explain to him what the situation is and how it's impacting people i don't think it's helping their cause i mean i'll get him in touch with chief holloway i know he would love to have help down in st petersburg they need help we support our sheriff we like our sheriff we like them a lot and we're putting them in a real difficult way here marv i'd like to speak after marv yes you go ahead marth first then rita yeah maybe issue at hand if the sheriff is in the area and somebody is blowing the horn they just give them a warning you know usually the sheriff will give one or two warnings and then a ticket so it's possible that these people just don't realize the violation so if they get a couple of warnings and then a ticket then it'll stop or at least give them a warning that it's a law on the books that they're may not be aware of so that you know and then stop them and talk to them and see what happens then what's next yeah just so everybody realizes i know you've made suggestions that they should go different places and everything but they live like two houses down from that corner two or three houses down they're an elderly couple they walk down there every morning to uh support the blue um you know i've spoken with another homeowner that is right there on the corner and actually he brings out chairs for him to sit down that they need or drinks i mean he has had absolutely no complaint he is exactly right where their you know his property is right about where they're standing so they're not really targeting anyone um i know the city attorney fred riley used that term but they're they go there because it's easy to walk there they don't have to drive anywhere or carry their signs you know half a mile away or whatever but um they're not doing it for any other reason other than you know they just want to support the blue i mean i've spoken with them at length so i mean i think the other council members might benefit to go down there and speak with them as well so i mean go down there and find out you know why they do it listen to their story i mean they and obviously they have first amendment rights as well so you know i had a neighbor and i come to you next i had a neighbor who actually stood with them for a day until i told them what was happening um and what it sounds like and played them i didn't have to play them the tape they knew um and they said you know joe these people are fed up they've had it they've just you know they don't like the disrespect that's being shown to the police um i share that sentiment i i was enraged when i saw people dumping buckets of water over the new york police that's that was something when i lived up there it just never happened but you have a mayor that's extremely tolerant of that up there and he's and they're disrespecting him so again i share what they're doing but not standing in the same place every day and for the record i've seen the purcells coming off the beach after taking a walk on the beach these are not disabled people they actually are in pretty good shape they have pretty good endurance to be standing out there for an hour to an hour and a half in august sun pretty difficult robin you're next no i was gonna kind of counter rita's statement kind of like what you just said about i mean to me walking to houses carrying signs being elderly seems like would be a lot harder than driving somewhere and walking ten feet with the sign so you know and that's just from a medical standpoint i mean cardiovascularly one makes more sense than the other so i don't think that's a good argument yeah okay yeah it's probably more convenient for them instead of you know walking ten feet to their car get in their car driving forward blocks parking their car walking another ten feet but my whole point is i think if they truly truly believed in the cause which i feel they do then i think they would want to spread the calls around so i don't see the problem with spreading the love go to city hall hey park in front of my house for a day i don't care and do it for a day not every day one had one day out of the month sure i'm sure all of us would be happy with that if that's you know spreading the love that's fine but my whole thing is to me not being amenable to and not taking you're so concerned about police and supporting them but you're not supporting your neighbors and you're being selfish in that i mean i'm not i'm not buying that and i've never spoken to them and i'd be happy to but unfortunately i work and my work by the time they're out there but um yeah that's just my thing so i i i support their cause but i think they could do it a little bit differently and honestly if it was me out there and people came up to me it was like you know this is kind of annoying us i'm working from home my kids are distance learning at home it's a little distracting i'd be like oh i'm sorry well how about this maybe tomorrow i'll go somewhere else and then we'll do it maybe once a week here or something whatever i would that's how i would react that's it thank you robin anybody else and we're going to move on there's not we're not going to with the consensus then is that we're not going to do any special awards and rewards um and then we're going to monitor this closely uh and we'll be i'll be reporting back to the city manager lin i'm not going to give you an everyday thing i know your guys drive by it they see that it's ongoing i'll let you know when it stops how's that that's fine okay but you you're aware of it it just couldn't yeah it's continuing okay all right so let's move on to item five we have a discussion does anybody need a break we're at seven o'clock we're good everybody's good okay um discussion of marked walking and or bicycle path for all city streets marv yes i brought this up and we have a couple elderly residents that live on 22nd street at the end and a couple of neighbors on my block that have young children and they're finding that now that it's getting a little darker in the evenings and they're kind of concerned about the traffic back and forth in their children [Music] riding bikes or walking in the streets and the elderly person said he's getting a little scared because they get too close to him and there's not a designated place for anybody to walk or ride a bike since we don't have sidewalks the one elderly neighbor suggested why don't we put sidewalks in well that i don't think is going to happen but maybe we should look or talk about designated walking areas on the streets left or right four boat sites i don't know mark when i saw this my first concern and i'm gonna ask lynn reeves this question um to maybe elaborate if we were to put i don't know how wide a bicycle lane is maybe three feet or so if we were to put three feet bicycle lanes on each side of our street i think we'd have to become one ways because i don't think our streets are wide enough to pass two vehicles anymore so i was wondering if you were talking about maybe certain streets you know that happen to be wide or where maybe this could be accommodated um but i think if like i'm here on you know my street and if you put two bicycle lanes here we're gonna be a one-way i don't think you can pass two cars particularly when you pass a bicyclist you're supposed to give them three feet so if someone's hugging the inside lane wow we may have problems here so that was not that it's such a bad idea i think the sidewalks idea is wonderful but i think it it prohibitively costs you know it's just going to be it's not cost effective for us so lynn i don't know what the what the right standard is for bicycle lanes and everything i'm sure you're more familiar yeah it's three feet uh generally speaking it's three feet per bike lane and realistically about the only street that you might and that would be probably the strip between gulf and bayshore on 22nd because you might be able to do it there but it still would be very tight because even when there's a i'll say a yard cutter to get around it sometimes you have to go in the in the median a little bit when they're parked along the street but like 7th street 8th street first second up to there you you couldn't do that you'd reduce the drive lane robin what about between like on 22nd street between bayshore and the end and then even bayshore seems pretty wide to me like you could have i mean those two seem wide to me and then i don't think probably seventh eighth those end streets really need it because i don't know how much traffic but like bayshore 22nd there's a lot of traffic going through there so it's an idea for those high traffic areas i don't know about belle isle if that one is wide enough because that would be another high traffic area so i think if we could focus on the high traffic areas and see if it's feasible i think it's a a good idea because i'm like i'm with marv i mean my kids i you know it scares me and i've seen the older gentlemen and a couple of them that are walking with their walker and i totally understand and i've walked with my dog and seen him come too close so especially around that little curve there on 22nd right for the bridge it can get a little close there so yeah can we look in to see if maybe those would be feasible measurement wise we can look into the width of the road and see what we would have left but i'm just thinking off the top of my head 22nd the where the median is between bayshore and golf that there's a possibility there uh bayshore um you i don't know you know we'll just have to do some measurements to tell you morph threw out an idea and i i know we kind of always it's come up before we always say it's going to be too expensive but we really i've never seen it you know costs or anything like that this idea of sidewalks and now not in every city street i know we can't put them and i don't think you know your street my street we probably don't need them we don't get enough traffic but you know we know some of the streets are busier you know and it may benefit from that is do you have an idea i mean is there just a rule of thumb maybe purse you know purse uh foot a running foot of sidewalk what are we talking about over here you know because maybe we could do old streetlights like you're paving stuff do a street or two streets a year or something like that that's well at this point too you know well you could do that here's the first thing that's probably going to come up with some of the residents do you want a sidewalk in your front yard which the we do have the right-of-way there actually we have a rather large right-of-way in the area that that marv lives in and robin dave you know those there along 22nd street that's a pretty good size right away also uh you know if we did we'd probably have to do a minimum of a three foot sidewalk and that's not real conducive because really it should be a little bit wider with ada and things of that nature i i can get you some numbers i don't off the top of my head it's probably seven or eight dollars a square foot for sidewalk to be put down dave the only way i would go along with that would be if the if the neighborhoods did a petition and uh and we voted on it glenn i have no interest in doing that glenn you have the mute on there you have to unmute yourself i i'm with dave i i'm just kind of uh tired of this anecdotal oh i heard from somebody that they're scared of a car pass too close so well where's the science behind some of this stuff i mean how many people where's the demographics what's the usage before you start budgeting money to do this stuff and having to run the interference with taking people's right away i mean it's it's a cities right away i understand that but i mean you know you're going to get some major pushback on some of this stuff and uh again it's the anecdotal well i heard somebody told me this or everybody is against this or whatever it's like let's put some science and like dave says and just like the traffic calming policy get a petition together and run it through the the same kind of protocols and framework if you want to really go down spending this kind of money it's not cheap and you can expect a lot of pushback on this stuff that's all i have to say thanks mark yeah i agree the pushback i don't think i'd like it either but the point of it is there are some issues out there with um kids on bikes or older people walking around so mark the streets uh is something that they brought up or it would let the cars stay away from the side of the roadway and at least they'd have a safe zone i don't say all the streets but the ones that are major thoroughfurs to go to the beach say 22nd is a major thoroughfare a lot of people bring the wagons the kids the dogs walk right across the street and they go to the beach so you'll see that on the weekends and sometimes you'll see it during the day older people walking around with walkers there are only two that's true but why do we need to make them statistics um i don't know it was brought up to me i bring it up to you we discuss it end the story robin yeah i'm with marv i mean trust me i i get it no one's gonna want a sidewalk i had said before i got on council why don't we put sidewalks in while we're undergrounding i mean that would be the time to do it but um my thing is is i think something if if it's conducive the walking right path mark i think would work great because nobody's yard gets picked up now if someone tells me that the white paint in front of their house is offensive well yeah yeah okay but um i think that would be a great middle ground a great great compromise that way it's visible for the drivers to stay away from that the bikers the walkers the dog walkers the kids all have a path to go on so if it's feasible like he said the streets and then also on 22nd i mean do we need that median can we put a sidewalk down the median or you know around the trees because that one is a major thoroughfare to the um the beach access and that is a very tight area for cars and a well walked i mean i've i'm very aware of the precautions that you need to take and i've seen pedestrians almost get hit and it's it's a little scary lynn is this something that i mean what do we do do we yeah there's good things i mean glenn's point is valid there's going to be pushback mars point is valid i don't want to be you know scraping up somebody who got hit by a car someday and because we didn't spend money on a sidewalk so i mean but i think we we do have to kind of see what the where the neighbors are on this and um it's not necessarily majority rules but where are we at with it i mean if it's two people on a whole block that's one thing 20 seconds a bad street there's a couple other ones in our city but i i don't think every city street needs it so no no i think we'll we'll look into the widths and see what we have and bring it to another work session you know as a resident here i would make the same comment that dave and glenn made i don't want to sidewalk in front of my house either so i'm i'm happy where i live so i have no interest in a sidewalk and unfortunately my my street as well as the mayor's street if i put three foot in the street i'd have a lane and a half car lane it will be one way robin i i don't know the rules do you have to have a walking bike path on each side of the street or could it be one no you could do it you can there's no requirement that it has to be on both sides that's that's really there there's no law that says that okay so we can look into that option maybe one that couldn't support two that but could support one that could be we'll get some we'll get some street with measurements and see because because there is the state law you got to have three feet separation even from the bike lane and you know it could be that there's not enough space there at all but uh we will look just robin i mean we have a guy who i know him he bikes all the time he's always biking bikes our street all the time and there's no problem because my street doesn't same thing with lynn street we don't get that much traffic you know and usually it's you can't really go that fast you can't build up that much speed but we know like 20 seconds so many others people can build up a little bit more so i mean do i want a sidewalk i don't know i had a sidewalk in front of my house every house i've ever had so it doesn't bother me one way or the other i i would rather see a place in the city that needs it more get it first i just don't think we need it in our city and our street lynn doesn't think so either i i agree with them but um if you put one i wouldn't be too upset you know it's no big deal it's less grass to cut so i don't it doesn't matter we'll put the first one in front of your house man i'm fine with that it's it's six feet less grass it's okay either i'd be happy having it on one side of the road but but um um but my whole point is then like i'm all about let's compromise in the middle let's focus on the high traffic streets which we all know what they are and let's see if at least one bike lane could now i know if we only put bike one bike lane there's gonna be a problem which side let's start with if it's a possibility and go from there that sounds good lynn you'll get back to us maybe maybe work with a little bit with marv here yeah everyone's good with that i would also like to throw in that i agree with councilmember gaddison vice mayor glenn dunn and city manager lynn reeves i'd like to see some information on cost see some informational measurements and definitely would like for us to reach out to the community and see what they want i think that's the consensus yes uh glenn yeah just one last comment my observation riding bicycles to the beach and walking to the beaches the residents don't walk down few residents walk down 20 seconds feet most people recognize that as a major feeder road for bayshore and all the other streets and guess what as soon as they're across the bridge where do they go they hit 21st street or they they go up they don't walk down 22nd street because they know it's a major thoroughfare so once again not only the costs involved but what are we going to do build a sidewalk and they will come i mean let's understand what the traffic is i mean put in a sidewalk so somebody can walk down it once a week i mean it's again it's the anecdotal thing how many people yeah i walked out i walked down 22nd street once therefore we need a sidewalk because a car came within 12 feet of me and it was going 75 miles an hour you know i it's all anecdotal let's put some measurement to it thanks anyone else who closed that topic then i don't see i didn't see any hands patty there's no one i didn't know to anyone no okay we'll move on then so item six um this was actually my item discussion of town of reddington shores ordinance it's on short term rental i'm not really looking for a discussion i'm giving it to you simply as a piece of information um readington shores uh volunteered this mark markup of their short-term rental ordinance they were having problems oh i guess there was somebody there renting uh and advertising that the house can sleep 38 and apparently it couldn't and they put their attorneys on it i'm not sure who their firm is but apparently they did a lot of work they just like us are grandfathered in so they were very mindful of the fact that they couldn't really touch it our rule for anybody who's um listening might not um be aware we have a grandfathered ordinance for short-term rentals and we're not supposed to touch it but they do also and they their attorneys assured them and with a lot of hard work that this thing would be okay i'm not making any representation that it's okay i'm giving it to us as a piece of information that we may want to keep for future use um i know jody shirley had something she wanted to bring up on this topic but she's not here so i i just want to get this to you read it over i'm not advocating that we do anything but i think fred reilly gets a copy here we may need this in the future and there's a lot of legal work that has been put into this apparently um this thing hasn't been battle tested i don't think anyone's challenged their ordinance in court or anything but they volunteered it to us so i give it to everybody else as a piece of information that's it if anyone wants to speak on it i certainly will open the floor marv well about uh 10 years ago there was a house rented on my street not going to save the house and it was rented by four people and uh by the time the day was done there were 30 because of invites and i'm sure it happens from time to time one a couple may rent a home for a short term or a condo and all of a sudden you have 30 visitors for the day or for the evening or whatever and i don't know how good this is but there are parts of it i read through it from one end to the other parts of it that sure sound like it would be of good use if we had it glenn what's your comment on this well i i did speak to the or had patty speak to the city clerk there and asked uh them about this and and the information we got back is they did not really have a short-term ordinance that they could effectively use and that's why they built this i haven't spoken to anyone else there so i don't really know i think our short-term rental ordinance as it stands now it's grandfathered uh we we seem to you know we're very proactive if we have a problem we go go after them take them to code enforcement the condos have their own condo docks that's set up their system so the condo associations take care of them i know that which i'm doing some research on there's uh it's called the bel air beach club uh there's an issue that jody is concerned about them renting single night rooms and we've got to get a little more clarification of what they really are because part of those units are owned by one corporation and the rest of the units are owned by individuals so at the current time this is good information to have uh but i i think our current ordinance uh we seem to do okay with it and i wouldn't definitely would not touch it because if you modify it in any way shape or form then you fall under the state's revised uh statute into uh short-term rentals and i don't think we want to do that lynn mark i'm going to come back to you i just want to give a piece of information everyone i don't know who you spoke to there but that's what you said and the information that they gave you regarding that they didn't have a working ordinance that's contrary to what mayor henderson told the big c she said that they did in fact have an ordinance and that was grandfathered in and they had to work around it but they had some holds and um you know one thing i i will say you know we one of the things i think you know lynn you're always on it when it comes to somebody with these short-term rental abuses and stuff like that so i'm not saying we have a problem i'm not saying we ever need to use it we've got it let's use it if necessary but they apparently had the same thing and their attorneys were told do not disturb the grandfathering so i'm not sure who their firm is again i didn't i didn't go into it all but i wanted to pass this out to everyone so marv yeah yeah mayor i'll uh uh uh maybe make a phone call myself to the clerk because the information patty got back for me last week was that because i you know i was out of town last week so i asked her to make a phone now that's why she volunteered mayor henderson volunteered it to everyone for that reason she said you know you might find this useful and they were worried about the grandfathering so okay yeah just bring up common things if it's if it's an older house in bellar beach and and and it has a pool and there's only one main drain in the bottom of the pool that's a violation for rental runners uh if there are no ground faults if there are no fire extinguishers if the doors are hung the wrong way if there's only two bedrooms and you have six or seven or eight people running or visitors no fire alarms no emerging emergency call out just in case something happens i think you're supposed to have that when you rent a home there's certain requirements that the county has in place so i don't know if people that rent homes have to abide by our rules or the county rules which which is the most important or if something happened which which municipality or county would would be able to help us out if there was a problem don't know anyone else somebody falls somebody drowns a fire breaks out in the house there's no fire extinguisher no fire alarm no electrical safety those are the things i concerned about lynn do we require a fire inspection for these rental homes each year no no no they're uh they don't really fall under the fire code to to be able to do that because they're not like a airbnb or anything because we don't you have to be 90 days to be able to rent a place in bellair beach what about the condos they're shorter uh i'd have to i know they have fire inspections i don't know how in-depth they are i know they do do fire inspections for the condos the fire marshal uh i'm blanking his name bob hill bob hill yeah could you just when you have a chance i don't think it's immediate but if you would just check in i mean even more concerning is the condos because of the density of individuals there so let's just make sure that you know that they're being inspected on a regular basis and that you know that we're covered again i don't want to read the newspaper someday and see that somebody died in a condo fire in our town and we just have to be proactive so yeah great okay anyway so you have this information fred i think it's probably good for you to have that and you know and down the road if it comes up um you know you might want to speak with their attorneys and see what what they were thinking and doing on this but we we may have use for it so i just pass it on to you because i got it out of the out of another city um all right with that uh we'll move on to the seventh item which is discussion of political sign ordinance um i know fred reilly's done quite a bit of work on this i don't know fred if you want to go first unless somebody else has something to say you can move over to fred brad you have the floor okay during the summer an issue came up and i i wrote a memo that came with the agenda item and i i made quite a few changes to the the city's uh sign ordinance which encompasses a number of different provisions the what i was trying to convey in the men the memo that i wrote to you is that um several things one the uh cases on the signs uh politic political signs any kind of signs they're they're a constitutional quagmire in my opinion there um there's a lot of cases there are typical well they're in federal court because it's always a claim that they're somebody's constitutional rights are being violated and the more i dug into trying to make changes to the the city's sign ordinance the place that i finally got to is that what to me probably makes the most sense is to overall overhaul the whole sign ordinance and break it into basically two categories commercial signs and non-commercial signs i got to a point where i i really felt that that was the thing that needed to be considered yet i really didn't want to continue tinkering with it hoping that's what the council ultimately would like to do so lynn and i talked about it a number of times and i i did make some changes because i i started doing uh redline changes based on different things that i uh uncovered during my research but really where where i am now is that i would i gave really two alternate alternatives in the memo one is if this was something that you wanted to task a code revision committee with then i think they could look at this issue and come up with a an overall ordinance or i can do it if if i was given direction that yes we would like you to do that and this is the direction you would like to do one of the things that i will tell you from that i've learned from looking at other cities how they've handled it quite a few other cities have handled it by simply overhauling their code provisions into commercial and non-commercial if you task the a code review committee with doing this then my first suggestion would to them would be you know understand what the constitutional requirements are and then secondly look at some of the cities much like what mayor manzo just explained um other cities have done this and they've spent a lot of time effort and resources developing their codes and there were several that i looked at that i i borrowed um quite a bit from other cities because they were addressing things that i felt were important based on the cases i had read but i i don't don't recommend that you reinvent the wheel i recommend that uh either through a code review committee or the city council considering it further and giving me direction that you decide on how the problem should be tackled and then go through the process of tackling it so in a nutshell that's where things are fred thank you for the the background and the research on this and um i'll totally agree with you it's a very very complex issue and um you and i have spoken briefly about this in the past and i i think and this is in no way to diminish we don't even know who's going to be on this code committee i think if fred if you mean two or three other lawyers were going on this we'd probably spend a month and maybe maybe get a piece of law that might work i mean it's it's complicated and you never know how some federal judge is going to review it so my only suggestion i like what everything that you said but i think maybe to give you the guidance from the council i don't know we've been without our sign ordinance since the summer time um we haven't even formed the committee yet we'd probably be looking at two to three months down the road that takes us into next year and then you know several more months before we probably can bring anything to an ordinance and meantime we're kind of floating right now with no ordinance really so i i do think that the idea of breaking it between commercial and um and uh residential is great that's the way the supreme court law seems to break out so i think it'll be good my only suggestion would be maybe we as a council tell you i think we're concerned you know i might have some different concerns being a lawyer but everybody else is gonna their concerns gonna be the aesthetics and you know the the you know keeping the character of our residential neighborhood i think we can give you ideas to that and maybe it might be more cost efficient to just have you draft it because i could just see a committee getting very bogged down in this i could see us getting bogged down and if we you know if we if we started debating it so i just think it's a very complex topic for you know for individuals to pick up we start getting levels of scrutiny a lot of attorneys don't even understand it so mayor council i i would recommend that we have the city attorney do it it's too too complex too many what-ifs and even a code review committee would struggle with with this uh and the legalities of it and in the end fred would be doing it anyway because you know they'd bring something to him and say will this work so but that's up to the console but that's what i would recommend mark i'd agree with lynn just from that response we got from one resident was enough enough for me if i was on a code committee just to recommend that fred handled it robin's nodding her head dave's nodding her head i think we have consensus does anybody wish to speak against having fred do this i mean we can give fred guidance in terms of but i think fred you probably know it just by hanging out here for the last year and a half that you know we value the look of our city our strategic plan pretty much says it all that you know we value the aesthetics the city and and safety and this that and the other thing so you know using that gleaned together the you know you and i discussed a couple key constitutional cases and do your best i mean i i just want to say you know and i know fred's going to do an excellent job but we're there's no guarantee on this folks i mean we'll put the best law out there but if some attorney wants to challenge it or some citizen wants to challenge it with a constitutional challenge they can do it our key is to try and make it as good as we possibly can but it's like a contract there's always a way of challenging it if somebody really wants to so fred i'll add one more thing the a lot of the cities are doing exactly what y'all talked about which is that you value your aesthetics and and that is really the most important one of the most important things to you having said that there are cases and the cities have implemented the cases where they narrowly tailor the regulation in order to of course protect the life safety of people within the city and they narrowly tailor it to ensure that the aesthetics are kept intact and those are not diminished and from a constitutional standpoint that's that's the um i won't say thread the needle but basically that's what you're trying to do is thread the needle and have a nexus between the narrow the reason for narrowly tailoring it and the regulation so i would absolutely have that in mind if you read over the stuff that i redlined you'll see that that's a lot of of what i did um and again that that's some of that's the hard work of um lawyers from another city that have put that together but um the the one that the area that i was probably the most concerned about and i wanted direction on is is the distinction between commercial and non-commercial because if um if you're if you're making that distinction then you're uh largely taking out the um the issues or a lot of the issues related to free speech and that that is a really important thing you'd simply delete in its entirety the political signs provision that you now have and instead you would that would fall into the category of non-commercial and you know that's the distinction i was most concerned about and was not comfortable going ahead and working on until i got some further direction from y'all so i have some further directions so i'll continue working on it now okay not to put a deadline on it or anything like that time frame he told me he'd have it tomorrow morning well he's got a long night ahead of him it looks like he's in new orleans so he's not gonna be doing anything tonight next month baby fred is that a possibility for the work session or tomorrow whatever you take your choice next month or tomorrow you got to pick one or i'll pick it for you and i might go with lynn i'll give you next month how's that i think he's stuck on a smile is that doable i don't want to rush yet this is important oh he just hung up on us now he's muted himself put your mute off you're mute your mute get cut out from i said do you want to i was asking for a time frame lin said you'd have it for tomorrow so i gave you until next month so like i said which one do you want to pick and you just smiled at us so i like your suggestion better i bet you did let me ask you this is a month reasonable i mean this again this is complex stuff i don't want to rush a draft in the set we want to get this right but i also would like to get some sign ordinance back on our books fully understand yes that's reasonable and if it turns out that i'm not making the progress i'd like i will keep you abreast of where i am fair enough anybody else have anything i don't see any hands from the uh citizens patty so i'm gonna move on then we're in general business so does anyone have any items that are not on the agenda dave there we go okay so uh i've noticed that we're starting to get sailboats uh i've seen all of our neighbors getting them uh i seem to recall that the city of uh clearwater beach announced that they were doing something about it uh now lynn i i recall you uh uh you had told us that there was nothing we could do about it according to maritime laws or something like that but apparently what uh the city of clearwater is doing and and i saw in a news article and i i apologize i have not been able to find the article uh but apparently what they're doing is whenever they see these ships or the boats show up and they're just anchored out no one's around them they actually go out and they tag them and if they're if someone doesn't respond within so many days they they literally toe them off i don't know where they're taking them don't know what they're doing with them but apparently they have figured out some way to curb uh the abandoned boats uh in their harbor uh so has does anyone have any thoughts on that um i'm familiar a little bit with um madeira beach because madeira beach passed an ordinance i'm gonna say maybe last year around this time which i think got a lot of boats to leave madeira beach and again i i haven't read their ordinance but they had this problem where people were camping on the boats parking the boats and they were like let's get it out of our city and they effectively did it i don't know how if it worked for them but i know the boats left so um we might want to take a look at what madeira beach has done this is something that i i feel strongly about getting ahead of before we become another uh you know ocean parking lot yeah dave i'll talk i'll get with clearwater and madeira and see what what they're doing i'm sorry with that marv after lynn yeah i'm done i'll i'll get with them and and see jody brought something up about that and she said in key west so she must be familiar with key west that they do an inspection or have an ordinance to where they have to pump out that boat every so many days i don't know how they got away with it if there is a porta potty on it or whatever and it has to be if it has an engine in it has to run it has to have another mode of um moving outside of sail for safe harbor so there was a few things that she brought up and mentioned key west so i don't know if they have an ordinance down there that we could look at dave i agree with you i think we should get ahead of this because if if madeira has pushed him out and clearwater's pushing him out you know they're going to seek the path of least resistance and it'll be us because we've got a beautiful you know beautiful surroundings if you look at belair bluff it's already happening to them yeah that's been going on there for a few years already okay that's awesome that's all i had thanks lynn you'll get back to us then on that yeah thank you lynn one question for you um anything going on with the sea wall over on bayshore yeah they're waiting for the uh materials they they've contacted us and told us that uh they're doing any day now so i would expect very shortly and i did get a call from mrs shang telling me that they were waiting on the materials and from the enterprise any any damage from either neighbor no no nothing well and i i think that's because uh mr schroeder's seawall is brand new and it didn't even reach to his seam so i think that that's one side the other side hasn't came down any further than it was but they are they had to order some special panels because of the fall in okay any anything from rube i spoke to him actually today and uh he's he's working on it and he's going to give us some feedback i told him i'm i want it sooner than later so he has he he knows we're very interested uh one thing i want to mention though to the console it's been another two weeks we have still have no applications for code enforcement uh and and i've had a couple discussions with a couple of you i don't know what the council's thought is uh maybe we asked the planning board to do it just a thought i don't know what the console's thought is because you meant code review committee right yeah enforcement code review yeah sorry okay uh no just a just a thought let see if we can get the planning board to do it i mean they're established and uh you know i'll talk to the chairman if the council's okay with that and because uh currently we nothing here no no i'm okay with it any everyone else where do we have consensus here i'm good with it lynn everybody's good glenn yeah i agree with that is uh take advantage of a standing uh board and and maybe supplement them with the people who are still willing to uh uh sit on a committee or something [Music] yeah yeah i think it'd be good to have uh some resident input like that we'll also have to see if there's interest from our i mean we could i think i don't know if we proved up to two people from council but we you know if there's interest from council um make that known and you know i think we have to a nomination process but it will vote on it and get people on that committee so um yeah i mean i think that's a good idea lin you know they did a really good job with the last analysis that they did so um you know maybe if they wanted if they could help us out that would be great they don't have to go crazy so it's it's just that no no no i have a list of of things and uh some some areas we want to look at the sea walls and things of that nature and if if you've got any as a console any specific code uh uh areas that you want me to look into i've got of course the sea walls and uh short term no uh there's some things that we need to take out because it still talks about a police department in 94. uh it's just some embellishments there but uh there's some other areas and i think uh vice mayor sent me a a draft charter already and i'm going to get with him about we'll add some some other code areas so if any of you have any code areas that you want us to look at because we don't want them to look at the whole code we want them to look at some specific areas uh just email me and we'll we'll add it to it but i'll talk to the chairman here this week and see what we can work out great thank you anybody else have any other general business would everybody like to adjourn that we always have consensus on um just to patty just to be certain here the next meeting unless there's some major change from the governor is going to be in person we're going to do the social distancing thing all right and we're going to lynn we're still requiring masks to be worn in the building yes yes okay so masks will be worn we'll keep the social distancing and um it looks though like it will be in person and lynn you promised that this is going to be a quick meeting because they have to set up for the election so i'm holding you too and i didn't forget that well we do have to make it a quick meeting and i'm going to limit the the only major thing we have coming up is the franchise agreement for duke which is an ordinance and we have to have two readings and that's uh so we'll do that the first the meeting in november and then december uh and if there's any other peripheral stuff it'll be minor because because we want to try to limit it so they can get in unless you want to have a long meeting you got that on recording right patty matt marv go ahead oh lynn uh duke energy deal what can we ask him can we force them to upgrade the system is there anything that we can add in there to help out things or the franchise agreement i don't think you're gonna get too much no no no we it's basically what they are is what they pay us the six percent and uh yeah and you know they'd want some of that taken back i've sent it to fred he's looked at it uh so we'll be sending you uh a clean copy what i'll probably do is send that out to you early before the but it'll be part of the agenda here in the next week or so okay good and that's what november 2nd patty is the meeting november 2nd yeah i think it's the second right yeah i think so let's just just double check look for my calendar i can't find it uh yes it's november 7. yeah okay all right folks well thank you very much everyone have a good night the meeting is adjourned and we'll see you on november 2nd okay okay thanks bye"
