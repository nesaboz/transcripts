email okay but anyway as is that that's the only thing that I see that's not in this printed set is that something we need to change without approving it it wasn't officially we didn't talk about February at that right this one we didn't so I don't think we need to have right CU it wasn't at the meeting okay so anybody want to make a motion to approve the minutes from November 9th oh wait I have a question about the minutes okay um we have Tammy down as one of the beach cleanups on July 6th do you think she is still going to want to do that or probably not I would say I would say no you

other than us so no comments and then number four number four you said take it up to there so okay so so Tammy officially resigned from The Parks and Recreation board and at this point we need to appoint a new chairperson for the board as it stands our officers are um Patty Roberts is the vice chair and uh Mike Michael leaks is the uh secretary so we need to nominate a chair so we need someone needs to make a motion to your nominate I'll make a motion to nominate Patty if she's interested in becoming the chair I I'll second that woohoo all in favor I'll take over I I will ask John had told me at the last speech that he wanted to nominate me but he was also going to check and make sure there was no conflict of interest because of Lloyd being on the council no I didn't think so there is not we know that for sure is John going to be your Vice chair he said you know he didn't think he could do it because he's not here half the meetings remember he's gone so so can I make a no Michael

next one okay nomina in the meanwhile we'll all work together and just make whatever needs to happen happen we're good at we're good at coming together when we need to yes okay next on the agenda is the health and wellness Fair recap and I would like somebody to do that since I wasn't here I was here the day before but then not the day up I did get some great pictures from the four ladies that I so that was great and they all had nice who who other the think you knows you did I did yes yes and I got some nice comments about that good so look at you mommy raised you right fast you got done yeah um I could comment on it I thought it was of course run very well um I don't think it was attended very well I think we had a good turnout from the vendor side of things I think I'm always somewhat disappointed in the level of community participation that we're getting I would just love to see more um the people who came loved it the vendors loved it they would have liked more people to have come through it's you know people spending a significant amount of time out of their normal workday on a Saturday to come and if they're only speaking to six people instead of 60 you know and and you're bringing in maybe you know the this 10% of who you're speaking to then you know you got to try to make it worth their while too and we're trying it's just the community doesn't give us what we need and it was a beautiful day there was no reasons for it all the everyone showed up when they were supposed to they paid you know like I really felt like the day would ran beautifully you had nice meals for all the vendors it was really a nice event just not well attended do you know about how many people did they sign in I would say it was about maybe 60 people came through yeah and and I think the two previous years we thought closer to 100 so we dropped a little bit wow and not only that I mean like people were people who were like just walking the bridge came in and it wasn't really our people it was not that I care but they weren't really interested they were like coming in to see what was going on and the really unfortunate thing about it was we had a really a lot of really good services that I think I think our citizens would have really benefited from yeah didn't we put anything in the newsletter yeah that said what a disappointment the turnout was oh no not do that um we did last before we had it in the newsletter um I think you sent photos of it right we had photos of the event yeah yeah we did well we recap um it may be something we just I try to personally Market ory bring more attention to um whether it's I mean we honed it on the sign but whether it's like we really F focus on trying to get it up on the front page put on the sign uh I don't want to like beat it in too hard because I don't people but I mean I'm I'm more confused about why aren't people interested like are we not explaining what the event is well enough is it something we're not doing like if I was like oh I could go there and find out all kinds of information especially this year like I felt I brought people in from hospice I brought all these different people when my dad was sick these things were invaluable to me and just to know they're out there just to know this is what panella's county offers but no do we have yard signs that we could stick out there we've got them in the past we can do them again yeah you know we put them out we put them the right ways CU they don't even have to have the date on them if you can use them you have to just health and wellness for big Arrow right here there you go right now pull in get one of the guys holding on one of those big arrows on front of you can do that work face Justin Justin do it yeah so that's a good idea have turning the signs yeah seriously no uh yeah whatever balloons something to call attention to it like I don't know so much work went into it like a I mean I don't know when I go to an event I one of those people that are like what do I get now granted you get the services there but is there music like May band out there you know and just kind of making it so bring attention to it um you know I know that there was one person or coffee but um could have cotton candy going out yeah bring in some food trucks like bring in open it up oh that's kind of interesting bring in some food trucks at the same time qu the trick is we dealt with this with other events is trying to convince a food truck that they're going to get enough business yeah exactly yeah or you get one so yeah I do know one personal put your feelers out there I yeah I mean one I mean that's great if we can get y yeah it's something extra can get I don't know my mother's town and I love this I know we don't do it here but um like once a year their fire department gets together and they do a big neighborhood cookout for every the firemen all buy the meat they or barbecue maybe there's a fun that you know pulls it together and the firemen you know they love to cook and they all come and they cook for the whole community and one of the parks at the community we did that in loots it's really nice Terri really Tim chores does that they do like a a big Community uh picnic thing and everybody came to that I mean we have the space for that I mean if we're going to I don't know do something maybe we do something like that we're going to put energy into stuff I don't know we did that for what was it the hurricane the hot dogs and stuff oh yeah yeah we did I was one cooking middle middle of summer we can always add something like that I yeah um I don't know could go healthier but yeah cotton candy not so healthy you know that rib guy who's down on a seminal somewhere imagine getting him that guy is crazy I know you're you pass there and you're like that might be different tonight yeah okay we're we're hearing we need more signs we got a signs yeah we could definitely I mean we could up and down Gulf you know and maybe on a couple of the streets well technically I can only do it on his property on our City properties well you know the city property is also right on the corner so we could do it on the corner as well at Cross Crossman yeah we've done that before we F on the rules yeah and you could in 19th Street and 12th Street too bad we don't have a reader board there that that cross I'm gonna be honest I don't read the reader board I can't see it yeah I'm driving how could I read what's going on that thing that's how I feel about this it's really I think what happens in we've talked about this recently is that we get too much on there so like like I said if we got things holding longer I think you'll be able to yeah cuz I can't see it you know if I'm lucky enough to have traffic up to this which you know now's the season I can look at it but other than that I'm heading to that light yeah yeah the check is like it get it concise enough that like Quick Glance and you get the point yeah I do think it has to stay a little bit longer mhm and maybe and that's what we' been try our classes always want to be on there but I've been trying to cut them down for like when we actually have things that stand out so that people see it okay we're not there yet I think that's good more signage more okay more signs maybe more of um Aaron stands outside moreal delates Mas out like the uh the seashell who me yeah in a seashell buddy yeah we could put John in a lobster outfit and let him stand outside like that God look at that poor guy he would do anything he's such a cool guy yeah all right so are we moving on or are we any other discussion on the health and wellness yeah do you gentlemen have any feedback on the health and wellness I kind of you well no you said it all I the the vendor turnout was great we had a lot of new ones MH um it was just the the attendance was disappointing my parents came I I met them yeah I wasn't here I forget where I was was at I was figure out of town yeah but uh yeah I mean they enjoyed it they thought it was great but it's just trying to get more people and and we want we want to do it for Beach residents I mean get others that's fine but oh yeah yeah we want our community to be like hey wow you guys did this for us thanks we want to be a part of it but I just think the little yard signs are more eye-catching and all you could do if you did help and wellness fair and then just had a for lack of a better term bumper sticker with a date change okay yeah you know so you wouldn't have to new signs every year yeah exactly yeah what would it I mean I I don't know um as far as like notifying people uh of course I'm not sure you probably know more about this than I do but you know we Once Upon a Time talk about a QR code and have with events so you know if we were to do something like that and in that QR code you you could sign up for text messaging for like events coming up where they automatically text send out of text I get them all the time like if got 20 minutes or something you can so I'm going to cross hats sure so one thing we've been discussing at um the belir the bbcf is when citizens come in or residents come in to pick up their new annual parking passes they're given a little postcard from us BBC with all our information on it these are dates these are things we do QR code website yada yada you get your parking sticker you get that you get one for us and we get one for the city M which would be parks and wck and everything we're doing here again with the QR code so as your steady residents are walking in you have to come in for your parking PS yeah you're getting these pieces of information too because I don't know people don't read their emails I I don't I don't know what it is they don't read the newsletter like it's the information is literally everywhere if you want it right and let's say we do do the QR codes and get them familiar with it when you go to the beach and you see a QR code they already know what it means like they can just put their phone and know they're going to get the latest information so once we train them to look for the QR code maybe it is on the annual parking pass maybe it's whoever walks through that door we hand them two postcards I don't know maybe I mean the way I look at it um is you know we're talking about like how re chores does like that Community picnic and if you can a lot of people come to that I I I'm sure they would I think so too you know and everyone all the citizens would get t-shirts and all that so it was a lot of sense of Pride but at that function that's the you can explain everything everybody there you know yeah like we could do t-shirts that say like um Beach um I don't know Carnival or whatever state you called it in the year I did the shirts the design for Reon Shores and I mean it was just a you know it was a reiton Shores you get sponsors to put their names on the back of it you can if you want to you bet that was but I mean I think that's you know if people come to a function like that and I think you'll have a lot of hey lot of people get to meet one another that don't know one another and then at that point you you make it a broadcast or you would have that information you have a you have you know we have a table there city of Builder beach has that information also but so maybe what we can do is we are planning to have a large fundraising event this summer maybe we can somehow work the two PL things together maybe work towards it together together get as many people from the community side from the donation side to come together for the event of raising money for the Veterans Memorial Park that we're trying to put together for the town so if we could combine forces for that one event I think it can be really Dynamic yeah we uh so I I put on what was called a black and white ball for the police department okay similar thing we were raising money for our uh scholarships for for the kids that lived within Ocean Shores where I worked at the fire department and the police department did it we did a black and white ball so it was like dress it um and a lot of people donated items and they were auctioned off and like a silent auction uh no um we actually had an Auctioneer there made a lot of fun we made over $25,000 wow yep um and lot everybody everybody gave donated cuz they knew what the cause was for right um and I think that would be fun I don't know I think like a dance or something like that or a outing or a concert I was looking forward to your bingo music Bingo thing y'all were going to do I was looking for yeah well we still may do it you know what's up in the air and I certainly can't speak as the head of the BBC after I'm not but I mean somehow we can maybe combine forces and maybe do a day thing and I think the biggest concern is last year when when the bbcf did do a large event which was the um spring day or fall day whatever it was we just broke even so like we didn't really make money on it so if we're doing it as a fundraiser it has got to be a fundraiser if we're doing it as a party that's a different story right so legally you're talking about yeah just in every aspect yeah and then if we're going to do something where we're you know trying to bring in as many people as possible and really get the community so maybe we we do something because also we're going to do a ribbon cutting so that ribbon cutting we're going to hope to have as many of the community come and be present walk over and be a part of it Tammy's got a two star general coming in for that wow so we're trying and again this isn't for me and you know I it's for the community and we want them to embrace this stuff right I yeah for that I can also contact some folks I know they're in Socom and I mean if you guys the more than area of course yeah but anyway I don't mean to keep veering off I'm just trying to figure out a way that we we find the best way to communicate to our res that's that's ultimately what it is MHM yeah I so that this is my first year going to the event but I thought it was again I thought the vendor participation was great and it but it was It was kind of intimate because I was able to have some thorough conversations without five people like you know shut up you know so so I thought that part was and I know that's you know but that was a side section of it and then the other thing is that it was it was a beautiful day it was such a beautiful day that that may that that may have had some impact as well and it was one of the first beautiful days mhm in a while correct so and I don't know if you know to that point is that is January even the best time coming right off of the holidays where everyone's bombarded with everything just kind exactly maybe just kind of fatigue from the holidays they have not going anywhere so maybe if it's not a big hit maybe we do like a town picnic instead or something or a town Carnival or fair or I'll tell you what Readington they put on a good one and I mean I can certainly get the information of how they um organize it I mean I know it's not that hard but I mean when I tell you everyone came everybody showed up so it was really neat to meet a lot of new people and I think once people actually start meeting new people then we start events and then they can all start coming together because they recognize one another and I will say every event people come to they enjoy it it' be our parking lot maybe we could have like the shuttle making stops picking up people in different locations along Gulf and bringing them here for us like yeah rent our own shuttle for the day or something yeah or I don't know as long as they people yeah yeah yeah I think if we were going to do something like that we utilize the banner thing across the street that way it's shown um and it is for residents it's for residents and I do know that they that they have a check-in you know that they were actually you know like a wristband yeah um because it was free food of course um they didn't want just people coming off the street um they also have a beer trailer there that it was someone brought in not the city because of liability problems but right and then somebody could sell beeres and yeah they have their own license y they have their own license everything and he had music there the way um of course it was one of the council members but um you know I I thought it was a really cool event um for being an employee there but see as many people that were there we also don't have as many children here as they have right you know so we would need to make it more like fun for people our age like maybe we should set up some real LS like stupid stuff like that like a down like three-legged you know the egg toss the water balloon toss like just a real Old Town picnic cornhole tournaments yeah um yeah and just do it on like a Sunday afternoon you know like 12: to 4: or something Saturday whatever we don't have to tie up the the facility at night we have a lot of options we'll have to talk about them going forward okay so number six item number six is discussion of mural painting on the bathroom and I'm so glad that's on there so I mean I did um can I speak first please I have you have an artist I do and he actually sent some um some pictures I can share um but his name is John comr oh I know John I know him very well uh yes John's fabulous if he's willing to do it so is he willing to charge or to donate no he was going to charge can talk he's really good but he's got um all kinds of ideas and he's actually did it this is a want to that's just one and have you seen the work he's doing on his own home and he told me about another house that he was doing too but all kind just different IDE ones he did yeah no this is with um computer an application with our building okay okay oh really oh he he did like a a sketch of it oh yeah so he says it depends on um whether you want to do one wall all four walls two walls what do you want to do and of course the um um details the more details the more costly because it takes more time did he did he cut a at ballpark or what that was well um Let me let me read this one um this man has his own business for 30 years 30 years he's been around takes a group out on Rock Beach he's one of the few people with permission to do that and he will set up anywhere between 10 and 20 with 30 easels and he does um Sunset painting pictures which is another good idea to do like painting sips U paint and Si and he would do that here he would come and do that that's I think I used to do that at the pub I owned and it was very popular and we used to serve Mama mango I don't know what that sound is but that sounds good it was it was delicious I like the palms and the Pelicans I mean the flamingos well there's more than that that's just one set he sent here like this is his um Beach set up here yeah that's awesome look at this Michael Oh that's oh wow okay that's beautiful so that's his up we were running those tamy was running those pretty for a little bit uh she I don't think she was running it I think okay this is we're getting the getting yeah we we did as a group we all went together as a group is that how was here's the SK AR it and then we adver sketches cuz he actually went down and measured everything and then did sketches of things that he could do and I think he said here this is this is depending on how many walls oh I have no yeah that's him well that's actually cuz you sent that that's him yeah and you sent that I contacted him on messenger took him 2 and 1/2 weeks or 3 weeks to get back to me and he said sorry Petty this just popped up on my Instagram or messenger or whatever it was he's a great guy I really like him really nice we talked a couple of different times is he local yeah in Beach he lives right near the beach right on it where does he live out there um you know yeah maybe about I don't know two exits down from me I'm off of 27th maybe yeah the next one or the next one cuz I walked there okay so I don't think it was too far far from where I enter but yeah he said I could do each W for [Music] anywhere last and what's the upkeep oh that I don't know yet I cuz I just had to get y'all's feel first so I think it looks awesome 1500 20 25 character 2500 for the whole building 15 to 25 depending on the details here's like sketches he did like a sketch these like I said are computerized with the building which I thought was pretty cool and I think his work is phenomenal he said 1,500 to 2,000 per wall per wall oh per wall depending on on how much detail and in my head I had only in my head when we were talking about this last year with the park surveys cuz that's when it first came that um I was just thinking of the one that faced GFF Boulevard yeah as an eye catcher yeah but when he did this I'm like wow that's pretty yeah well I I mean maybe we we start with one right and then um also we can speak to him skes and about splitting the cost of this and he can give it half in kind and get an in kind donation and the other half in payment what about if he puts a signature on it yeah um you know hurricane Eddy yes yeah he did he part that W he didn't do the Hibiscus wall which is my favorite but he did is this something you could do Micha I love that idea I mean that one habiscus is kind of what I visualize but these are gorgeous so yeah that really look nice it's just the new colors you guys love that would to be done anyway great yeah like this one is really like beautiful yeah I really feel that I love the pinks and the teals it really does a nice job of uh whose phone is this one yours and your iPad hey nice work Patty girl I'm excited I am and like I said he's just super nice on the phone very cooperative and willing and I mean he did this in 4 days cuz I think it was Thursday that we actually finally connected he sent me a text or messenger and then I tried call him and had to leave a message you know our actual Talking was like last Thursday and I said well we have them you know he said I'll get back to you in a couple of weeks or whatever we have a meeting next Tuesday yeah I know they do like I don't know how to shut this down yeah you want his phone number that's one thing we don't have I still want to change the signs I hate that yeah kind of you know the signs like you want to ask welcome to Bel Air Shore or this is Bel Air Shore oh those yeah and their are so mean and nasty I nice I know you said that last year us designing something different same information positive rather than cuz is all this none of this none of even do too have a great time clean up your own mess enjoy sand dunes but don't walk over is kind of cool I mean we have an art program so if like that's something like if you get get an idea of what you you want it to look like he just kind of draft it and then we can tweak it moved one of theirs what down at 19th Street they moved one of their signs you know I heard they put yeah they have one that's in the parking lot but the one that's on the beach uh looks like it's a little too far north oh like it's on Beller beach side the house cuz the one house is theirs that's what I'm saying it's not past the house it's and it's not on the property line you just said I'm not good at but I think I know it had to do with the sand dunes that's what it had to do with CU that's where it didn't used to be there okay what are you saying the signs that say welcome to belir Shore that are on where b beach starts yeah okay one of them I don't think is on the legal property line oh I see I don't know cuz I it just doesn't look like it is um but their signs are just mean they all have these no no well aware of it the 27th Street entrance I think what those those kind of like were like a template that like if we go down to like National traffic signes if everyone kind of follow through of that kind of template but you're right it could be changed to yeah it could be much more positive is that like having the big cross outs um you can't do that like more effective at all even the simple street signs when you walk in that says leave nothing behind but your Footprints it's impressionable and it's nice and you know what I'm going to think twice before I leave something behind because of that yeah w any reason but you know what I'm saying you leave like feeling oh great they really appreciate what they have here national parks are really good at their signs about that kind of thing you know right so just branding changes so um I want to backtrack one quick second please um Kyle you mentioned we have an art program what does that mean you said we have an art program oh an art Aon we use we do different designs and stuff and we have softare so what about if we contact like Largo high school and ask about their art students and maybe if John can trace that for us they can paint it or something like maybe we can see if we can get volunteer art students to come in or if there's an art place around maybe one of the colleges or something great idea too yeah yeah yeah yeah that's a really good idea do you know involve the community do you know Yoli I know Yoli cuz her house is real pretty and she did I think she painted it so I thought about if it was I could knock on her door and ask her cuz as a citizen she might be willing if we buy the paint would you and I'm telling you I don't know you think that'd be okay yeah I think so and I want to tell you something else I have a feeling if we could get Comey to sketch it and you asked residents to come out and paint I bet you would get people who have talents and we can word it that way if you're talented if you want to if you're not don't come I'm staying home I'll stand back and watch and take pictures but I mean maybe residents maybe we put it out there find out if any residents are good at this stuff too or if we slow contest show us your best rendering uh oh I love that that's cool but then whoever I don't know who would choose the best I guess Park and W board and then whoever wins yeah they get the painting or or tra they get their choice they they get their picture and then others can come out and help they could do it themselves I mean that's a big undertaking to do it yourself but but like I can see Yolie being interested Darlene would probably love darene yes you do okay she works every um Halloween parade with us she was the dalmatian this year okay okay she works as the J she was the dalmati this year and last year she's a friend of mine that I bring on just to help okay yeah darene gray they live on 12 do you know them she's an artist talented no she's very talented though and she's good friends with Yoli she lives like two doors away she knows of Yoli's artwork so like Yoli's a type of person who would say okay you know let me get 10 people look what the city asked me to do let me get 10 people yeah I think she would love to be included especially since kind of okay okay while we're talking about this cuz we working on the new Website Layout but what I'd like to do um because other cities do this and they come out like really nice because in modern day people's phones take really good pictures but I'd like like to do oh photo competition or it doesn't have to be a compe pictures submissions um that we can use on our website we can put credits for what took it but I love that if you look at other cities websites they have some like amazing shots and it's just done by their residents and all it was me all these little things will help bring them around it will say wellow they're really trying to involve us so all these little things these are great ideas today so okay I think it's good mhm well if you want to talk to John about the you know um money part you can if you don't want to you have I call him I mean what you were talking about the um yeah I'll call donates part of it I'll call John I don't know if I have the all Le number but but I'll call yeah we showed up with my whole neighborhood we we showed up with like 10 people we brought out wine we set up a table we brought appetizers I can totally see that but you do my picture looked like this was on the beach this was on the beach the sun was setting as the sun's setting you're painting it I don't think it gets better than that so okay moving on from John anything else on the mural okay anybody that wants to look for a muralist because I did learn that is a term it's not just an artist muralist is a totally different type of artist are you going to reach out to Yoli yeah okay unless you know I don't know I've never oh you don't know her I've met her maybe once on the beach with her hubby okay um you don't have to I don't mind knocking on door see I'll see if I can get to Yolie for you I don't have her number but I know I can get her all right so park surveys oh excuse me can can you just send those to me so I can show you kind of like where we're going with it okay great surveys yeah so park survey so it's about that time isn't it yes and if I think we can just go with kind of the same who had what and just take Tammy's here's the bind John is willing to do them all if he needs to oh God I loved doing it so he can't have mine he could always have mine I didn't uh one thing I forgot to bring was the updated uh what's been done um okay so a lot of what we came up with what was it not a year ago but six seven months ago has been completed yeah um we just finished as you know Morgan Park painting um the Public Works guys uh Grady Marvin and Justin uh they put in new flooring uh we put in new mirrors mirrors um the flooring is actually a coating um it's like the garage floor uh new sink I believe or you had to in one of them cuz it was there was sink we were waiting on that then new soap dispensers uh fresh paint of course new fans new fans wow so very nice yeah they did a great job oh and not to mention um I got to give Grady props because he did a lot of Bondo work um where there was rusting issues and he made it look fantastic I'll show to you so the concrete absorbs all the moisture and then it rust they had a very good job um let me see if around to you guys so you can see here Tak extra maintenance so do you know what we're talking about Michael Park surveys yeah yeah we talked about it a couple Mee ago um but so I have fans soap dispensers some flooring yes sir uh uh with a new sink put in mirrors new stainless steel mirrors um the outside of the building was [Applause] painted outside painting when when was this corrective action when was it that flooring was like that epoxy floor the painting okay or that last the last yeah I think that's your the most recent yeah if you guys want to go from swipe to the right so right left right left so that's what it look used to look like the before and after everybody seen his girlfriend so so kind of shows you the before and after of what wow he that grd Marvin and Justin yes sir that's amazing you've seen yes anybody else just so you kind of see um Swip either side there's I think it's towards the right or left w so that's there we go that's the P yeah yeah so they they did a lot of work they really did um not of sand just doing stuff yeah work stuff um yeah so they did a really good job on it um in between all the other jobs that they had going on so yeah very have you guys been down the Morgan nope not since you should see how opened up it is could get in for the longest it like well the whole area that used to just be compacted shell mounded up um mixed with like some Dunes bill over um and there was like some in there that that's all opened up into like good sand really yeah like so there's a lot more space that's that's kind of like usable out there um so then we talk the when we put the grill back put one back we have brand new grill yeah because we never saw actually two grills we us at the same time so we we put that off the kind of the corner of the Pavilion and then we put another tree out there um left that space I think it's first come first Ser I'd imagine so it just it just opened it up a lot that was never there they have to go check it out yeah we want to try to maintain that yeah freshing paint uh curbs um there's some yeah did they R did the parking lot they beat it up even though they oh they beat it up with the trucks huh yeah so they did that again so what do we have 22 Parks No 19 20 what is it no um 10 no a lot more than that we don't have 10 Parks I do and then the Marina and the three accesses Oh I thought it was closer to 20 yeah okay so do you want to make a list again cuz I can name them yeah don't we have 6 129 Morgan wait we should have the list um Second Street 25th Street Howard Drive Harrison Avenue and then the marina is considered a park now y yeah yeah can you can you print us up one uh Park list yeah I can well yeah yeah when do we need to get them done when do we need to start do doing the surveys start you do whatever you want I um since yeah since they we just finished tree trimming also in all the parks so that's all good uh did lots some Landscaping there in b um but I mean I think right now would be a good time to point out especially was a cool weather uh to see if there's anything that maybe that we've missed or something that we can improve on uh before it gets too hot right so mean if we could that' be great if that's possible I mean do you have access to a list like quick I we can divy them up thank you I somewhere that's what I was what I just have city parks and then but they're not in list form but they're here anyway because this is the parks people looked at B [Applause] aisle we can make our own format for it opened last too funny this man we sent out the newsletter to day he came with me last year and did my par yeah so there's Morgan sound Street First Street that's right by you and Tammy right mhm I can do that in Second Street although unless you want other people to see other Parks okay don't fre it did seem like a lot more than 10 last year didn't it well you can count the accesses it's a little more but what the 12 6 19 that's what you got yeah yeah and it said four pedestrian walkover so they're talking about the little um oval things with the trees on them at the 12 19 and 6 oh the medians yes thank you that's I was looking for that word yeah are they going to be um switching from the causeway to Gulf into the two lanes exiting right they is still cuz I know they discussed it yeah they discussed it um and Tom wasburn who's with the county um has been working with us but it's taken a lot longer than we thought um um he left he emailed me on Friday to call him Monday morning about it and I called I have not heard okay I got to cheack out again um what's going on with the electricity on Gulf Street on Gulf Boulevard are you guys working with um Duke to fix those poles all right so the underground where they're at right now um the conduit in on the first on the south of Causeway MH and we're waiting on Duke to do the wiring and that's kind of we just keep waiting and are you guys on the schedule are you on the schedule yeah yeah we're on their schedule um there's no guarantees that n gets on like it's going to be a month or two um I'm hoping once they start that they just knock it out and then how many polls are you guys looking at again um so all the everything all the wires are going underground all the PO lights on it are staying but what they'll do is cuz they're not going to need as much space on them they'll let them and they'll put caps on them we and we'll keep our street lights as is um for now the hope is that more money comes through the the pipeline of Penny money that that that we can do that cuz it is golf over it is a county right away so if more money comes to make it more beautiful then and County and State uh not here this is not FD okay um I think it's it Alon it stops it stops okay which is a good thing for us because of the requirements gotcha um the one thing though is there is a standard that if we do change what lighting is now um it'll have to come up to what the standard so if we don't touch it it can grandfather or whatever reason yeah just leave it be got soate those still the wires the wires are going under yeah okay and then you they'll run to each light pole underneath the ground cuz I thought we had light poles that weren't working anymore or that you had poles that didn't have electricity to them no oh now you're talking about decorations now just I'm just talking about getting electricity to that for so there are so many poles but there's more that we want to put um those receptacles on there for decorations um Duke went and got all the ones that had receptacles working but then when they come through to put the wires on the ground they're going to have to rewire it anyway anyway okay um and then this year's budget I want to put um like a program in there for decorations City decoration oh good good cuz there's going a lot of people who want you know be like everybody else everybody else it's like the town everyone forgot it's like you know Misfit Island over here well they're just plain little blue and white aren't they blue and we holiday batters yeah that was the the cheap way out yeah okay we're working on it she still looking for this thing I guess don't worry about it I thought I asked only if it was easy we'll send it out next time making a really good one well we can come back to it yeah okay yeah all right let's come back to that um welcome back updates I did just I went back we sure have still have a lot cuz I remade I made like 10 and hour I think it was 14 I wrote it down 14 of the welcome bags I find a piece of paper I wrote on there it is there you are thanks um wow I just had to make it look pretty okay so there's welcome bags 12 12 12 welcome bags I hold for a while you gave one for every no beach towels I didn't count any beach towels do more Beach I think they're great I mean I've already I need sh I need to um see if I can find the same on we last time not um hand towels 14 baseball caps it was eight khaki and four blue license plates was three the Koozies are those something oh we got 200 of them we have lot of those I would I didn't put them in the wel bag I should get those yeah I can help you do that um water bottles that's new to me you have 200 PES yeah and 7 water bottles yeah water bottles mhm they're metal tooies were the ones that we got I think it was a couple meetings ago we were talking about yeah and John kept calling them something else it was cute yeah so we have those um how much where are we selling the water bottles too we are the water the water bottles are 20 the you know the price on that you know we didn't get them that cheap I me even though we got them on a discount but so we're we're going we we can sell them for 20 and are you selling the Koozies as well yes and what do the Koozies going for um that I have to check I think we have we put on the sign but I will what are these BBS and then the Christmas towels there were 16 ofir Beach set all right and one single right so do we want to do we just want to wrap those around next year and yeah I think we should take the candy canes out [Laughter] yeah oh those were the Christmas hand towels yeah those are nice are there how many are left 16 okay so really 32 actually 33 but you know it comes in a pair so 16 pairs mhm and what were those 15 were there still the Pilates handouts available I think they were 10 each 15 together does that sound right to you I didn't know we sold any of them separate no we didn't we only sold them as a set I think yeah I think we just talked about it then but yeah I think 15 the idea was they were 15 okay you type this up real quick yes sir impressive yeah Oh I thought you might have had it already in just fact well good job thank you you have the list that we had go forward list with the work in progress list that had all the parks the difference in the b beach logo and the welcome you know I just gave you all the logo right which one's pretty update oh this by far I love thank you so there you even that [Applause] little okay okay down Miami Beach a little bit hey what you pump the brakes okay um item number nine we already did um 10 is Beach clean up I guess we just need to verify and we already did the thing with Tammy she's we took her off in July 6 yeah M and replaced her with you yeah okay do we need to go further from August we we are only um through August right I don't think so at this time do okay yeah no no the the question I have about these cleanups uh for 14th is is it I get the donuts on usually Thursday or Friday for pickup on Saturday I mean do you guys just want to keep on doing Boston cream donut okay my suggestion is donut holes donut holes very few people eat a whole donut yeah and donut holes they'll take even the ladies that are real conscientious they'll take a donnut hole okay you know and one little box of donnut holes would satisfy cuz psychologically they'll take more of those and then I also would suggest 8 oz bottles of water okay all right I would too there's no sense in throwing money away we were doing those snack bars and you still got snack bar so they you're not getting that many people to come clean up either you're only getting about four or five people and same people every month yep which to me doesn't make it fun I don't mind Patty nothing at 8: a.m. is fun to me except the I am a morning person I'm a morning me too the toilet B yeah that's I want to be I want to be yeah I want to be walking from my bedroom to the bathroom I want to be on the beach I love it that's a hor of a different color that's so much Hol yeah the small B like big I was wondering about that and I mean and so you don't that ginormous cooler I mean that granted when it is hot but still they can have multiple of the little ones but they don't even take those half the time they really don't and and like she says five is a good number at least I mean when I'm there and which is almost every time cuz it's at 19 so I just run across the street um so always put a little fruit tray with some sweets well you could just have that bowl of fruit like Publix has in the summer that might be good because like with Lloyd with his softball team I don't recommend I always make cookies in the summer I bring watermelon and pineapple and it's that's what they need cuz they're so hot I would give out like um The Little Cuties or a banana or something like that but I wouldn't do any um fruit that you have to put into something cuties would be really good sum be a great little refreshment those little tiny oranges that peel so easy and then they're like a yeah another thing is we could quarter oranges like you're out in the sun I mean it is only an hour we don't have to feed people that much food know yeah just to switch it up I'm glad you mentioned cuz I had that myut H John and I talked about it at the last in February that the donuts you can't we can't give them away yeah well you took them I had time I found i g you the depes across the streen Don just aren't that popular yeah it's not worth a so unhealthy yeah it's not worth it like I'll eat a lot of things before I eat a donut ex I would eat 10 tacos before I eat a donut that's a lot of Taco they little tiny tacos still the Carree tortillas You' seen those right yeah that's I eat them all the time so nice back to the welcome bags do you still have the Pilates handouts I think I do you go check them no we okay we'll check later if you need more it sounds like I can't yeah it's like a whole hand out from the Pilates studio you ever seen Pilates and I don't know if I had plenty did you have not out but there was other stuff that I only had so many so I just yeah okay cool just keep using them when if you want more let me know okay we'll do welcome B done uh logo merchandise done Beach clean up we did that we only had the one change yeah and go from donut hes and small Waters gotta easy other business oh then ice in the summer we don't need that in the winter got it but when I guess maybe maybe April did you guys for the last cleanup we had that John I think it was John John did the last one yeah I was there but did he pick up the ice also cuz we paid for ice um he it was I don't know if he paid for it he had ice okay we did not even open the ice okay I don't even think the water was sitting on the ice I think what we should do is maybe just in invest in a little cooler with water and just do away some water and have people take a little cup I don't know like is it worth I don't know I don't know that's more wor because work filling it up although that I like the idea of cuz ice is in that cooler and then then they take what they want they took a little cup and leave and we could have it at but then they might litter then I would go after them out a clean up club right but I always bring the water and ice back and stick it in this refrigerator that's where the ice keeps are come from okay all right I I always wonder comparable it is I mean she's like the elf she looks in horable I didn't know that it's not mine I should keep it so okay so we're um other business which we have discussed throughout the meeting but any other others question about other business are we going to try to drum up some more volunteers for this committee so everyone could not have so much work to do now that we you lost a person or two how how many can you have in this committee five full-time two Alters okay and right now we have I think we do we even call John full time cuz he's not here six months out of the year but I don't know I mean he does come on the zoom so I guess he's full heend yeah heend on and it is important to have him for voting and he attends yeah you know I think I think it's important to keep him you know as a fulltime right um that means so we can Susan is going to become an alternate I can stay as an alternate Susan I really think we change that but I can okay whatever you want oh yeah we said Susan was going to become the alternate I was going to step up right and then um we so we need one more alternate and one more board member yeah has has anyone spoken to Susan lately I see her all the time I do okay yeah yeah when she's not traveling she she Pops in so yeah she's uh she just took a board position with the BBC look John you got lost on your walk over no I actually terribly it's a shame it out completely I oh there he is my perfectly curated calendar it's right there I've been looking at it they had the whole day set aside and I faced it out on that's okay where are we we are well we actually right here but we're going to go back I'm still here Mar Mark and present partially I got you he's so funny so we're going to go through this real quick all right and and who's going to do what two did they do we go through the election 11 yes and you weren't here to nominate me and I cried you cried we were thinking of asking you to be the vice president yeah well I hope you pick somebody else well since you're not here for we were thinking that might be difficult for you well anybody as disorganized as me shouldn't be considered anyway are you interested uh I'm not here all the time I think somebody would be if somebody that lived here all the time would be better I'm gone five months so I mean if there was nobody else I would do it but anybody who lived here fulltime I think would be a better think we have anybody else okay so we're trying to recruit new members do you know anybody in your neighborhood that would like to be on the board I I don't I don't the next door yeah I know some actually I could ask uh Craig and his wife I I could ask them if they would be interested I I've already asked my next door neighbor and um she just wants to do yoga so so I can I would you no I'm the secretary oh you're the secretary and de doesn't do anything before 8 so so you're you're going to be the vice chair no so what are you
