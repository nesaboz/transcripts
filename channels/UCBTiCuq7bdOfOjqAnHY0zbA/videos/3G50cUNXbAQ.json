    "transcript": "call a meeting to order can I get an approval of the agenda so moved second second okay all in favor aye all right any opposed and we have approval of the May 3rd um meeting minutes I've got a chance to review it get approval I'd love to approve the minutes that's for the prior ones oh okay so Jody beaucha second yes Mark seconds so all in favor aye aye any opposed Okay so we've approved the uh it's about the topic of the day is to review the draft of the budget I guess okay thank you chairman um so most of you you've probably been through our budget before too right yes just got on okay yeah pretty familiar with the setup of the budget um I'd like to start at the budget schedule on page one so where we're at right now is the we had one budget Workshop which is on June 19th City Council we ran through some changes which I can go over from the first draft so this is actually draft two this has been presented at the council for our next Workshop which is going to be Monday July 17th and the second budget Workshop is the meeting where after the workshop we set the tentative military and then the deal with that is whatever you set it at you can go down but you cannot go higher so that's kind of I want to make sure you plan accordingly go to page three I'm going to talk about what the village rate is um right now and what we've been at for a long time now is 2.0394 millage and last year we experienced increases in home values and property values and this year we did again and that's on page small um it's it's highlight so this year our official increase in value is 10.85 you say so change of total taxes that's a percentage yes um so um the way it works is if we stay at the existing Village rate um you know we'll pull in more revenue for Avalon revenue for the city um and then what the rollback rate is is the if we were to uh keep our increase in property value and we wanted to keep the exact same Revenue we we had last year and then we roll back to a lesser millage my recommendation is that we keep the existing food pads for some time when we laid out our budget projections looking at the bond issue we calculated based on sticking to what the current is and if you go back to page three it's a little bit easier to read the trend analysis so it's got us record from 730 million in taxable value to 800 9.6 billion yeah so the change for this year's 79 million dollar increase which is at 10.5 percent correct and then um Heather does a nice little uh overview of the taxes that you pay um per mileage and the percentages how much color each tax is compared to the other services provided that's the bottom chart on page four page four then we'll go into the budget itself on page of nine well once we get into general fund it starts on Page Six um the revenues for the the city um in the past we kind of had some some larger gaps between the actuals and the budgeted numbers I brought those up closer kind of line for line one thing I did since the last draft is increase our community center rental income took it all the way up to 30 000. I think we had a previous yeah 19. 19 300 where are we on the page page nine so that's up near the top the uh you know we've been um regularly pulling in more revenue for rentals Laura's been doing a great job so I just wanted to get that number closer to what it is okay am I looking at this right the revenues have gone up roughly 1.8 million since 22 to 23. total revenues total revenues yeah well we're amended budget was four eight and the actual revenues were three million for the previous year oh that was in 21. that was two years ago yeah yeah it was just saying I think that includes doesn't that include some of the financing and stuff though well we're looking at revenues it includes that that Bond issuance yeah it's got the bodies coming in okay so it's your billion dollars well that's so it wasn't just attack yeah that's interesting right okay because it didn't look like operating revenues that were down in the amendment about it possession had to come from someone you know the details are on the subsequent pages and I think a lot of it's the uh you know what you reserve fund balance appropriation yeah transfer yeah that's it because that'll ask the balance it moved over yep okay this wanted to make sure I knew where the numbers yeah when I looked at page eight at the top there's the start of the year yeah with cash on the balance sheet at the top total for balance yeah okay and then I just on the details just a quick couple of questions on the the license and registrations there's probably some more detail in here that I probably didn't see but that the drop of 50 000 on the uh that is rental property no that do you have draft two oh it's maybe I'm looking at it oh okay the limitation oh okay okay so this is second draft and then I guess my only other question on sorry do utility service taxes sir we're kind of keeping those all flat is that not gonna go up at all or um just a question I mean maybe it is maybe it isn't I don't know yeah we cut them flat based on the actuals okay yeah and we haven't seen we haven't seen enough where we felt comfortable too much yeah we did this journal today electricity he's a big driver for seven percent yes uh inflation rate Tampa Bay yeah yeah oil prices went down so that doesn't quite job this is how we create electricians it's okay okay peace 10. um our unassigned thought fund balance has being going up and in our budget for projections it will continue to um this just kind of lays out what is required um per our Charter that we keep in unassigned funds we have all over that as you can see page would back up there was I had a question on page died okay Parks and Rec we've dropped that by 63 000. was that because of the playground no that um that was we had a lot of money um I don't know why that was budgeted so high I'll have to check on that because we budgeted an eye but we didn't spend that much we had 69 500 and yeah okay and then uh below that transfers to other funds so we've got the ability to fire here that's just the fun capex oh yeah uh so other financing uses okay transfers to other funds is up a billion 263 so is that the Buddies we're going to transfer in to do the storm water and other things yes yeah for expenditures yes that's what if we go to the project pages page 16. um sorry just one one of the questions the interest on the Investments is that the fund the proceeds from the from the debt that we're just investing is that what it is or is it because it's up sixty thousand dollars two things uh so it's the proceeds of the budding while we're waiting to expect it okay plus we've moved the checking account where we were oh yeah that's right yeah have you guys in the process we got all the papers signed we turned in the papers we have a call tomorrow at 10 30. so it'll be okay here by September it'll be a place yeah but the true students like that they don't care big bags are they don't care Bank of America yeah I mean we gotta hold an account until we pay off that well that's good it's a good thing we found somebody that cared yeah we got South State they yeah because of the loads house they required us to put 250 000 and they were affected fed funds so they're a quarter percent less than Bali so it's still it's still significantly higher than 30 or 40 bases absolutely yeah okay so we're on page 16. well before you get there 14. yeah I just noticed but I saw the fifteen thousand dollar increase of the audit and so I assume that's because we have to do the second audit for the Arctic funds yeah we have well no that is because um we are set for one more year on our current contract and then the option um to renegotiate we've reached out to kind of get a number and it you know it came back a lot higher so this doesn't include the secondary Arbor audit last I heard from Heather is we don't have to do um that we're not required to deal with which was uh the eight or the 800 000 yeah she she got confirmation that I forgot the name of the type of audit it was a more detailed audit um I can't remember what it was called but yeah that that requirement so this is just salt marshmallow from 20 to 35. well that we don't we we're going back out the RFP because we're covered this year for for next audit but we need to get an RFP um we don't we're just estimating that's what's to come back and based on what we've seen so this buddy would be expensed based on the 9 30. 23 on it if that's still 20 000. so we'll pay the twenty thousand or do we have a budget for the year that's being audited the fees for that so we're already we're this is budgeting for not the next audit the one after so this is what we're anticipating we had a three-year deal or something yes yes this will be our third year at the audit discern yourself so that's a new project for the audit committee to be at rfps yeah it was a three year a fixed rate too or was it just have like six yeah there was increases okay yeah it's a it's a big jump and that's a pretty big job higher yes basically the numbers well for what reason it's not any more complex we just had one money and they want us and we're comparing we're pretty sure I said inflation okay and that's what they came back with yeah well that wasn't salt marsh I think on theirs theirs came back extremely it was ridiculous oh really oh wow but that's the contract they went with was in the low 30s so we just wanted to be safe yeah that was uh salt marsh as well that was awesome they came back yeah there are people who read things out of it people should come back and this is the lowest of the rfps right or in the middle of the ground this is a little bit higher than what we saw they were I don't know how many years they bought the company they bought the money firm that historically did the city so yeah okay and uh all right sorry you go to page 16. Okay the reason I'm on this page is because uh we had the part-time position for the admin assistant uh in this current Year's budget Council decided that we want to advertise for a full-time um and then it we're budgeting to continue a full-time position and that's at the same hourly rate of the eighteen dollars so that's part time so your salary rate in wages climbed up so going from part-time to full-time correct does that mean now we have benefits kick in or do we have to benefit no benefits and I see the insurance is brought up is that an actual quote Oh Yeah that is we won't get those numbers until August probably later August so we just guessed that's uh yeah that's uh foreign and that's mainly because of our asset um that's going up 75 percent of the building um no all the assets that we have added assets yeah so this is oh this isn't this is Health stuff this is health insurance all right when I was talking about down below down below we're talking about just The General Insurance yep okay um and then you know that includes if you go to your details that includes the you know building yeah yeah just makes all the property authorizes assets in the Parks um they stayed told us to project 10 on everything the liability the workers comp vehicle so that's it yes pardon me I just I just saw that insurance increase property insurance without a large amount and you say that's you're insuring more or reinsuring at a higher value from what I was told based on what happened from the storms in the state it's caused an increase all around just because of the damage in the claims what's the cost of reinsurance the last claim we made was the sign that was a couple years ago so we have it you know we're not making anything also the replacement cost the inflation area um right now I'm having another Municipal insurance company give me some numbers uh Brown and Brown to compare we've gone with Florida Municipal Trust Insurance for quite a while now which is is that the league of cities recommendation yeah yeah it's there's not too many out there I just wanted to there are some other municipalities used Brown and Brown I wanted to see what kind of what they uh what they had to offer okay um I think that covers everything on that non-departmental 17 law enforcement that contract for the law enforcement services 107.94 USC seven eight because we have uh I think it's 10 000 extra for special uh detail but I know that uh in the meeting the other night it was raised whether or not the allocation between Bel Air and Bel Air Beach is that I didn't quite maybe understand what the final rules were we going to look at that to see if there is a fair I mean we obviously got enter into the contract of course but it's been locked out we could do it again okay uh yeah I didn't it's kind of like yeah we we save a little bit because we share it up yeah we're right in the same area yep um based on the numbers that the sheriff calculates it they're I think it was one hour a day or one hour break I lay it all out yeah um there's some discrepancy where people think that they're doing more over there I don't know if there's value in trying to improve and yeah and go that far maybe more than a headache than it's worth I mean part of the two with the interlocal agreement we agreed to maintain those parking areas and so it is right okay and it's not just Bellair Shores they're servicing when they're at those access points so okay and has the the allowance or the way we divvied that cost health remained relatively constant yeah over the years yeah and we've asked them we haven't looked at that moment in the past yeah okay the Restriction is is uh there's really no other agency we go to except maybe Clearwater PD because it has to be an adjacent City that's that's going to work yeah a few years ago that was I think it's either before the established the CAC or right afterwards and again it goes back to the previous layer and there was an attempt to reach out to see if someone because of these typical increases every year you have that finance committee project and we looked at St Pete we looked at Largo and they all said well thanks no thank you no I think and I was here long before when we had our own police department and then when we made the change I think what's going on now is is really good service and it's excellent I don't know there's a lot of things that I think we need to be looking at because I see a lot of things going on around the city that don't appear to be being dressed by the police it should be but other than that I think you think it's police recovered person well it's both yeah I mean you don't you don't even know if he's quote enforcing or if he's policing either because I know I know I'm talking to the current and the previous code enforcement officer they're in a cruiser and they're on the frequency with the Communication Center and if they're on duty is code enforcement and a call comes in they're closest they will respond and they turn the clock off on Code Enforcement well I'm sure that's the case but I can't tell when you see the crews are going down the street he's responding to code enforcement or if they're well yeah you know and I see him pass up the events there's one event around the corner for me that's been going on for two years guy Parks his trailer Inside of his house boat trip he's got no thanks to no barrier no fence no nothing right down there at the corner of the golfing and Causeway got the open trenches and the weeds of this I brought it up last night and then the issue with um the deputy telling people that were riding bicycles at the water line if not in the water I heard somebody say that I thought that was hilarious next door but it's the high water line not right but they think they own infinite to wherever the water is right at the time yeah another case in point too that I've seen too about this I brought it up the other night those condos just north of the Belair Beach Motel they seem to have multiple commercial lawn services they're there two or three times a week they're religiously one of them every Sunday that's why I asked to point right is that does that not constitute commercial work and he said well yeah but we're kind of trying to break because of rain and I'm thinking all right I'm not going to believe it this way but I think in general for the money I think yeah overall I think we proved that we can't we couldn't replace it we couldn't get anybody interested I don't think we can replace it with that but I think we ought to be a little more diligent in holding their feet to the fire because I look at the code enforcement report it's it's huge there's a lot of things on that report that they're doing and then going back and things are being rechecked by that so it appears that they're very active but I see the same things lingering at the same houses for over a year and I don't understand where the leniency what deserves the leanings well I don't get it you know I was a little disappointed when they were discussing this the other night that we're going to reduce the hours of contract control enforcement and absorb some of that in-house and my concern yeah who's going to do that first question we all we all do a little code enforcement especially to you myself address it or you report it to the code enforcement person we and I represent every hearing for the city and Laura does a lot of foot traffic and she she's out of there too I didn't I didn't I did not realize that tonight and maybe it kind of says that in their contract okay but they there's benefits to the to the sheriff doing code enforcement presence but essentially any one of us because the way our code is written the city manager or designated staff can do code enforce and we could all do the exact same thing okay all right okay good so should we who do we report incidents to that we feel need to be addressed just call me yeah I know the train called me the other day about the message did you see what was going on there yeah they were all over but I was actually out there and I called the owner and I told the guys at New Park opposite each other yeah both in the wrong direction I said the police are giving tickets yeah just walk away who who said that one of the subs at the end of 22nd are there young kids and they just park wherever they want come on well when that fire truck comes through there and can't get through there and they just gently put them out of the way well exactly right and like two months ago Waste Management took out my mailbox because they were trying to squeeze through because all the construction trades management yeah but I'll tell you waste management was handled the whole thing so professionally it was unbelievable they had their insurance adjuster call me the same day and said just get announcement sentence yes that's something I didn't do it you know I procrastinated they called me back three times we're waiting for you to send us yours okay don't get that anymore no that's what I'm saying they they're very conscientious that's good report yeah let's move over okay oh you're not interested as far as yes we reduce the hours that went up 7.5 percent per hour rate we experimented with reducing the hours just current about a year up from 2015. I feel like we supplemented a lot with City staff and actually got a little bit more out of it and then this year we're going to drop down to three four hours I had no idea that staff City staff was killing the void if you will yeah so that's that report I prefer that City staff is very capable of doing code enforcement because again even when we had them here 20 hours there were just days and times and he wasn't here and I don't want to have to rely on 100 yeah especially if it's something that needs to be addressed quickly um page 19. okay this is uh this came up in the meeting on Monday I decided that we are going out to an RFP for our Sanitation Services I'm working diligently with our City attorney to get something out 20 [Music] . um you're going to see a high increase on the salaries and wages up in the personal services that is uh she was brought up in the first budget Workshop to put numbers together of what it would look like if you were to add a maintenance worker to the uh to the staff and I just kind of did it on a separate page to make it a little easier I understand and see it by itself because if we did plug it into the draft as a budget but that that is that uh staff and what it would cost on its own and how it would be laid out one ft one full-time so that's still to be considered I wanted to bring it up tonight because it was something that we wanted to take a look at is there a delay on getting some maintenance things done or we pay overtime currently uh we're not I try not to use any of the budget overtime and I usually save it for when we're in an emergency situation um currently you know we I feel like we work tight around here um ever since Lynn kind of took the helm we became very very efficient we'll always perform it what we're capable of what I have noticed is that we inside and outside it is tough for staff members to take vacations or have time off or you know it you know we do feel it a lot but we're we work hard and we deal with it um it was brought up I feel if we had another person in the field it would allow us to do better allow us to perform better Services more quality give us areas that they would be it helped us keep it up with the detail and help with every time we take on special projects and um you know just every every once in a while you got to do something and then you kind of gotta comp other areas have to adjust the thing is that this this goes a long way for towards helping with retention making sure that it feels as if the city's doing as much as they can do to give them help at the end as you said if it's difficult for people to feel comfortable taking vacations it's not a not a good thing it's not a good thing right too people from going in there so now we have Public Works employees yes so hypothetically they were out doing the sign work on any given day and an emergency came up they would have to stop at whatever point they're at on that routine workday deal with that getting a however long that takes puts it behind so my question would be bottled wine and Kyle it's factored into this right now yes and do you think is this an appropriate wage for this type of position I don't know so we have a lead worker and then we so that would be a either a service library in the budgets listed as maintenance worker three that's the lead and then the one underneath service worker tune yeah so I'm proposing another service worker too we don't need anything more is this you know do they get full benefits yes yeah looks like it will be full-time yeah some of their money of their earnings is attributed to the storm water fund yes 15 I just plugged it because you're not going to see it unless I put it all on one sheet that's like okay break it up you want a motion I just make a note we support an additional um it is it easy to find them at that rate it's a challenge now I'm just going to like the city manager meetings um everybody is understaffed it's hard to find labor yeah we have a lot of affordability problems with living in this County it's getting worse by my my next step honestly if we have trouble for fulfilling me seriously looking contractual Services higher out the lights that's what I was gonna say we still do a lot of our own landscaping right yeah almost all of it might make sense it's good and bad so I've already been looking at the numbers um we've been having trouble finding someone and retaining somebody in uh in the maintenance worker position um when I started experiencing that I just started looking at the numbers because that would be the next option and that would really be I'd aim to contract out like the things you can find everywhere like landscaping and then have this the maintenance workers to be doing all the little extra things that we have to do more so on the Utility side of the storm water special projects um obviously like beach raking um I would recommend if we were to contract out landscaping services that we did all the properties except for City Hall that I there's benefits to it right now we have a savings plan for two mowers in rotation the fear of Contracting and I'll I would only retain one mower but I would keep City Hall property I think that is a higher level of service needed and I would not want to depend because we all know contractors they may start out great but you do spend a lot of time chasing them around trying to manage them and I just went out a lot yeah there's a lot of our capability to if we had to but it's tough to continuously trying to hire people and it's a costly venture to bring somebody on board for a month or two and then leave let's find something else I don't understand it's hardly a living wage for someone who has to live close enough to be here to travel here every day and it's tough giving us I see why you're having difficulties here is that any program but like a p-tech where there's kids coming out looking for an apprentice from startup yeah we've actually had one of our Consortium meetings we had a p-tech representative there um there was a lot of discussion and trying to you know get people in these positions but even p-tech I don't I think the people coming out of there which they're going to struggle coming into this level of a job because this is I've used p-tech they have this thing I think it's called the Rocket something that I've used it I've advertised with them before foreign I really think that um what we're going to experience is uh people that work this level um are going to go to governments more like up where I live that you know Southern Pasco where there's still affordability to live um and then they can commute and be close you know it's just it's getting so hard that wage it might be too looking at the local churches to you know post they have some uh posting boards just an FYI if you're looking for something I know I've got some some tenants all of my tenants go to Indian Rocks and you know they all work maintenance and that sort of thing so yeah okay yeah okay um I want to check on on the uh the number brought up in our Park and Recreation under the Bowie improvements other than for the amendment advisor there's got to be a reason so once you get into the projects all of them stayed relatively the same the savings programs a lot of these have to do with just upkeep maintenance like painting copper replacement that that has gone up because of our new Zone we have out there to maintain that it's going to cost more um that also yes go ahead finish and I had a question you can ask your question what are the subtotal operating Capital wildlife uh the 5270630 the numbers uh you end up with a hundred percent am I reading this wrong or is there some reason it's a hundred percent no that looks like it's uh incorrect formula oh and maybe it's just because okay summarized I'll have to check the formula on the spreadsheet it looks like there's there's a mistake and that could just be because it should be plugging the you know the amended budget so there's got to be a big negative numbers okay we'll check that you look at the bottom probably carries through down there okay um so yeah you're welcome so I just had a question on the uh the capital stuff you know and the prior year is there's numbers in the prior years is it safe to assume that if we just take kind of what we have and divide those prior numbers how many years we've been kind of saving so for example yeah it's pretty safe is it is this um is this this is based on a quote I'm surprised to see it so flat and so even given kind of the inflationary environment that we're in and I was wondering if they're you know maybe this is anticipated at the end pricing that you may have gotten from somebody that so that those pricing we had a savings plan but a lot of these things were were not going to actually you know you know pull the trigger on it until it's really neat yeah so yeah some of this um there was a result okay that's what I was kind of guessing yeah it would be okay but that Reserve study at some point yeah so so yeah we've seen we've seen increasing on things like painting the carpet but we were kind of like reaching a number and anticipating yeah and we have we have so we're kind of letting it go but continue to save and that's kind of a compensating okay yeah I think my my question is probably more geared around the reserve did we you know we did it six years ago they're estimating to do a new in ten it's gonna you know it's gonna we paid ten thousand you know six years ago it's gonna cost us thirty thousand and 10 years when we do it again so on the cost of living yeah yeah just kind of would be like right what we went through with storm water yeah yeah okay what's uh what are we planning on a patrol boat yeah that's the newest addition we're saving okay much needed I suggest that we do it so um and like I said um we're facing issues where we were we have code issues on the water that we don't have access to get to it anywhere we have other issues where we have our buoys that take maintenance and kind of like these things every time something happens it's like okay thank you for telling us but there's only so much we can do there's a sheriff's gonna come down from 7-Eleven they'll work with us it's just it's not an easy feat uh what what is what is this boat I I know where the uh committee baby you said you looked it up so a program that's out there is just like that so what I did is I went through uh like government agreement like I looked for something that was already in government contract just to kind of Base numbers on and I mean and I came up with this I'm not I don't know probably nearly as much as opponents as some of you guys do but this is like you know it's a smaller style you know you know inflatable Hall Patrol boat something you know it has it has options um obviously I just wanted to based on something that was on the government contract that we could save for that um this is a couple years out it was good for um I know that if we want to decide on something maybe with lesser options we put it all together in an RFP all right I didn't want to make up a whole bunch of these but I just wanted to show you guys just for the spec sheet Coast Guard has those Inflatables yeah we don't we don't need every Bell and whistle but at the same time you know I I don't think it's a good idea to be really cheap it out on something used you know really trying to save money because I think that you need a safe vessel the main thing are rigid inflatable about business does it we replace the red oh because it's so many people use so many actions use such a cheap Village okay 80 of what we do is we replace the two okay but I'll have our guys look at this place and would that be able to stay on a trailer until it was launched it lose the trailer over here idea um yeah we launch here or I mean as long as we could yeah yeah which I think some of that size yeah that's what I was hoping that it would be a size just drop it in yeah I think it would be beneficial that we kept it opening over at the marina in case there was something we were working on until we weren't always having to obviously we weren't going to use a profile trailer but it would be good to have a spot that it could be more tough you know at the end of the day if we were doing something ridiculous yeah so if you end up getting it while you're making arrangements to either get a trailer or do something awesome yeah I'd almost like to see it a little more expedited just because I'd you know as I said when I first talked about this you guys every time we say anything about the water it's the course the point is we can't we can't monitor what goes on in the water we can't do anything about anyone anchoring out because we don't have access to it so um it's it's really just tied your hands for a long period of time I know not everyone agrees with me but I think it's something we should try to accelerate just like I'm on it I'm all for this I mean it ties your hands yeah like you said about especially about code enforcement it's always an option to finance it too if you if you need to right so that throwing out the 400 right up front well there's plenty of money in reserves yeah we we could just pull the money out I don't know um if you guys know but that they call it party island but that's our actual jurisdiction people do a lot out there which one is this one right here yeah yeah from around the back and also we should we can monitor the morning too right because we we can't do this to find violations anything this side of the intercoastal is really our jurisdiction so you know three boats here the two boats over there right yeah okay I don't haven't seen any of them get pumped out no that's my big thing is yeah they should have a pump out receipt if they're the anchor where's the receipt right having somebody pump you up because those boats are supposed to move every three days there's one that's in someone's backyard right now lucky it didn't it is I think that's the same guy that had a street light pointing at him for several weeks too you know well there was the other boat that went into the dock at that condo did thirty thousand a damage so it almost looks like the same level it probably is okay this is this is bull crap I mean I've been retired from the Navy a little over 30 years I'm going to tell you back in the late 70s we stopped pumping sewage over the side yeah important right we had to reconfigured our ports we call it CHT and we had to dedicate certain tanks on the ship because you could you can't you don't 12 miles of shore so every time you come into Port of an American Port is some foreign ports it's not just water and steam and electricity you're hooking up sewer right so I I just don't understand these people that this to our Inland Waters and it was arrested that needs to be dealt with so I didn't I had no clue yeah if you go I've been out there once because what happens when someone put up with just Santa's flag and somebody was upset about it [Laughter] I said sadly I didn't [Music] want American flag too because if you take down one you have to take down I remember somebody was seeing far think he always here to the door it was an American flag there all the time it still is I think oh the one tree island it's still there yeah yeah oh is it yeah okay so then so because I took down there I had people yelling at me and then um it caused a big uproar in any Rocks Beach because they thought it was anything wrong and then after that I was like that was not worth it yeah because I had to jump off the front of the sheriff's mode you know get someone or get out yeah and it was I was like oh yeah this is not the way I should get the wet huh oh yeah well there's an island over there off of Daytona Beach or something it's been in the news I I have um the uh one of the Orlando stations new apps on my phone and um there's an island out there people go to that party and uh they jury a multi-level tree house yeah the deputies have actually gone out there to tear it down because they've been doing drugs and blues and everything else I think it's called meth island or something yeah we're aware of it okay okay no you'll see that as a TV show yeah that's right that's probably what's next then we get into the capital projects fund this has its own Revenue sources that are dedicated for capital projects infrastructure so some of these uh these revenues like the infrastructure penny for Pinellas tax and we get our percentage on a regular uh every year that has to stay in this one bringing us so that's kind of why it's got its own um to go through some of the projects in here they've remain consistent we have you know some of the stuff is still like the uh for the building the roof replacement the H Ranch replacement things that we have to stand for some of the Park area improvements um our bridges you know those the infrastructure we have two projects one's for just the general repairs and the others for saving up for the replacement when it gets to that we've got to ask yourself a question yeah your bridge is built the Bel Air out of the states guns in there for maintenance when it comes time to replace that how are those people going to be able to come and go um there's some different strategies that I've the engineers have said that there's a way they can build the bridge to you know build one side or keep keep traffic um it wasn't a full replacement it was just a repair it can be done yeah that's what I was okay so it's not like we have to shut down the island yeah okay they put up a traffic light on this button that's 30 feet long unbutton what they're doing right now yeah it's a one-way or a single roller single road that took half the bridge and worked on half and the other half of the traffic light General Repair maintenance that we're we do have every two years because can we make it elevated enough to get the boats under actually 12 foot higher not this year okay all right too much to go around make sure you can raise it up 12 feet exactly I don't think the residents before the original they apply over past Mitch's house yeah but um as you look through these projects is there anything that is 100 questions I only had kind of I guess a question but I think the Golf Boulevard beautification that's the that's all going to be underground isn't it that's the underground current and that's both sides right yes yeah yeah the the west side is complete figures I know we talked about that gradually getting our site done laser started phase one right yeah but that is an expenditure that will be reimbursed that's half a little p is in and the other half will be reimbursed afterwards okay gotcha and that's all at the mercy of so right how about the condo and the growl and let's pray for no storms anywhere in the state because that will drop oh yeah um the way we're doing it now is we want to make sure that if possible if Duke Energy can get to the point when they're done wiring phase one it could be energized in case something happens in between completing phase two so we're not sitting there waiting for everything yeah I'm sure they could engineer that in but at an additional cost well they they're engineering it in um but we're making sure that it's done in such a way because we have two switches and I'm gonna once I have the work prints of where the socials are going to go They're gonna have to go in the right away off of a Causeway um and to make sure that it you know we can at least get that going as soon Street resurfacing um this you'll notice in this project account this is tied into our stormwater projects so when we're going through that that loan we took DLC and uh prior year funding that's the portion of the street from Pacific for the project that came in and then it's being expended can I ask a question um page 50. the city street lighting program I thought that this was brought up Monday night are they going to standardize the lighting throughout the city as far as distance be the goal is to bring the cities or the streets that don't have very many on them at least to what okay okay to kind of get more balance yeah um yeah it makes sense because say for example just on 22nd Street there's literally there's one double arm lamp post and it's like halfway between Golf and um baseball so you got some some dark areas but I keep them garage light on one of those Echo friendly ones and then I got a outlet that's on the wall so it helps write things up and then they across the street at least until midnight or so their lights are on and they got the same type of lights but there's I notice when you drive down Golf Boulevard at night you look down side streets there's a lot of there's some Stars dark spots yeah for sure on the topic of Lights this is just in a question and I probably should know this before the very long but why are some of them like purple like in this purplish color versus white it all comes back to whatever contract for the parts and the lights there's a defect that they will replace it if that goes bad okay that's what happens that's why you see them randomly yeah yeah they're just kind of I thought I had something to do with the turtles I'm like what yeah that would be the opposite yeah that's gonna say that yeah so that seems to be dark right yeah okay yeah you think there's something wrong with your vision anytime you see one though you can report it oh okay they came out and did our screen oh did that okay okay yes Enterprise fund so um is treated differently on everything that we have in our positive balance gets transferred back into our operating the um only project that exists is Project savings is the for the marina dock improvements the pilings you know slips and the catwalks right now we have some that are you know they're getting old they need to be replaced uh it's coming back up right now we have 52 500 in there um we came back for about 50 of our filings and uh I think it was 73 000. um that's a you know that's a big spend at this point they're not to the point where they're breaking you know failing completely they're just getting old um it's been talked about we have some slips actually the numbers Shirley brought up a question that we have some slips that have well a lot of them have lists and and we have uh you know typos that are just been there and they're not really needed so they don't necessarily need to be replaced as long as someone's using a little slip so it's a different way to look at it but when I saw that the number it wasn't something that I feel at this point we need to do but nice to have not a need to have I yeah and and Heather needs to adjust this because I caught it we were going to bump it up to the 10 000 just savings to get some more money saved for when we do want to do something things slips and catwalks and whatever it was like so I was looking uh page 66 the uh yeah the rattles by the slip so you bet you you'd like to be able to put something in like you can get the boat could you put it in Residence well that'd be slip one can you ever put it there it could be yeah because the history on that is um they'd stop doing it because they felt like there was some conflict with the outfall there um I guess maybe if you jammed a lift in there and then the county had to do maintenance it could become an issue but to just have something more about there that could be if not that was it how are the rates determined is it I mean is it comparable to others I might I don't know how many other um [Laughter] just curious yeah we're kind of we're taking a look at the whole process of the wait list and um kind of the idea of who we in the long term want using the marina is there a big waitlist yes well you know what that calls for non-residents are there yeah no it's actually a time where it was very hard to fill the slip and that's how they got it um and they've been there because there's value to those things but it's something that could be handled over time depending on what is decided you know we develop a plan the policy for it there's a slip something with the lift to include the electricity um yes collection the water and the electricity is included very recently I suggested that they had a fee for utilities and no one agreed with me on that yeah out of these rates there's been a a lot of homework and that's why the last resolution with the step-by-step five-year increase it was done it was agreed upon um you'll see all different things we'll get around but the the trick is try to it's hard to compare Apples to Apples because you know glyphs provided and different facilities on site that are useful to someone who's going to vote sure there's a wide range of services that you can pay for some places am I not mistaken that we're still doing a study again we're working on this again right we are working Stables is leading he's drafted another girl so what happened was the mayor worked on him he added some things he came with the idea of classing how um the slips so that you have three separate weightless or different size slips that the resident could choose to which one you want to be on um and then there was some more debate on kind of policy and then the members able took that and just come up with a draft so we are attending to have a work session on the 24th it's not set yet but that would be an item number it's hard to just put a policy in place because as you know like the width of the the beam of the boat is different we've only been looking purely at the length of the boat and said this slip will take a 50-foot boat this slip will take a 30-foot boat you know just instead of going well that might change because the beam of the boat you might be able to get a bigger boat in there you know on some of the center console uh both so you have weight restriction on the list yeah the lifts their responsibility not ours so you rent the space you bring your own lift you take it when you leave unless the guy coming behind you wants to buy it but the heavier sometimes they have to have double poles right like again it's their problem yeah okay so you know there's and so it gets really complicated I'm like you almost need a dock Master out there you know it's not a simple pick up the phone and call Patty can't just say oh we've got to slip open yeah yeah well that's probably good but anyway so so yeah it presents its own challenges um especially if we if we plan on doing some reconfiguration out there it's a different situation because you do all these years we've people slips and finance their lips so they're kind of invested too which in some cities cities always provided so yeah it kind of gives me it's just a challenge yeah yeah all right and then the last fund is the storm water fund um that assessment is the 15 per unit and it's billed by monthly basis so that's thirty dollars in your utility bill that's been consistent since the fund was put in place and in the revenue from that is budget is 175 000. it varies slightly um the way our code is written is if somebody demolishes the house and there's no longer a structure they're not required to have a stock market so if somebody demolishes and they could pull it off the utility until they do put something back yeah but they still have runoffs just doesn't stay away it doesn't stay on the property yeah well I mean you do have a lot more appropriate surface the chances of your rain water staying on your property but if they don't have I think the caveat should be do you have water connected at the site or not right so if they knock it down and their intent is to build and they put tempered water on there they should still be paying the fee yeah and honestly most people don't know that they can cancel the service um so usually between Demolition and I mean a lot of people don't even they don't even cancel their trash today I had this is a quick separate point I had somebody who was being built separately paying waste management for trash services for their property not knowing I think it was like close to 10 years not knowing that that's built through their utility bill they just got the information from the person that they bought from I guess that person would have been doing it too I don't know but they pay for a property over in Bel Air and uh the nice thing is once we figured that out it all got credited back and you know all those years of payments okay and then um like I said with the Personnel Services that's um that's from Public Works side this is the 15 oh that's it was allocated to this budget based on the um the amount of time estimated that they spend on the YouTube um one thing we've constantly been seeing in our storm water is the [Music] 460 account 538 460 that continues to go up it's just wear and tear on the infrastructure so whether it's cleaning out the Barnacles oysters that build up in the pipes or it's lining the pipes or using grout injections to you know fix holes the land is depressing and going wash it out so and there's these Street Suite is scheduled that is a monthly monthly yes um that kind of will vary different types of the month they always collect four yards USA services does it usually it's pretty early in the morning on this um page 61 538.0161 car allowance that's because of Personnel Services there's the community services administrator has a car allowance and that is and it's all split out in this whole Personnel Services from public works okay same percentage and this does include your second yeah okay yeah and then your two projects in stormwater are your Valley curve in your stolen projects I noticed there's a couple of places that we've paved and the water just doesn't run it's pretty hard to get those valleys all going in the right direction to the nearest storm drain it is in our okay this is especially on the island yeah has between Alita and where it makes the Curve just I was up there doesn't go really this direction and it wasn't an issue before the roads were repaved that's why when they repaid the Roses oh they didn't on Harrison so it's we have all kinds of issues over there you did it for us of course it depended on how bad yours were they came by and marked all the bad places and then I guess someone made the decision right but I I know there's a limited amount of fall you can induce yeah and we just it destroy it has to dry up on its own if it gets really really full of the train yeah you're going to get it moving one way or the other for a while sure it still sits to that point and then we have that really bad area on Alita that we had to actually stick it in let it in and you piping um so yeah again just just like the street resurfacing um where you have broken out by the projects it's the same thing alone came in this year it's projected to be spent in 2024 budget and same thunderstorm water Improvement products previous budgets had the stormwater recruiting the projects Broken Out In Street sections of streets by the area all those have been put together into a wonderful project to get it taken care of some saving and you guys probably have been flipping through your detailed budget but that was the other thing it was just the general fund operations a little bit more broken out see where the money is a little more detail yeah one thing I did through all of the all of these line items that I was really looked at what we spent over the last couple of years if we weren't spending anything or we weren't spending nearly as much then I tightened up the budget I know last year went through a process always had you know 25 000 Place keeper and a 50 000 Place keeper if you thank God yeah actuals yeah like if you go to especially in Public Works big our big extender to your accounts are the operating supplies you'll see that I dropped that 13.4 percent and then this on the operating supplies bar so I dropped I just tighten those up a lot just because we're always conscientious money for thrifty about it but there was a lot of questions it looks good yeah anybody have any questions it's pretty thorough to have any questions no thanks and thank you Kyle for the connection welcome to recommend adoption all right motion to recommended evaluation okay second I'm not gonna ask a question until I see what the next step is because we should be making a recommendation for the um we go back to yeah page three the tentative military well then I'll withdraw the uh and make the motion to adjust ing right as you say should we adopt the budget and then the recommended budget pass as presented and then recommend yeah the existing rate has intended rate I think that's why I said I said let me stop what you need to do okay yeah so go ahead with your we'll go in with the motion to do what to approve the budget as presented okay got it motionless I made the motion yes all in favor aye aye any opposed and then uh then we'll follow that up with a motion to adopt or retain the existing Village rate I think we should specify what it is 2.03 0.4394 . all right I'll move it a second second opposed okay good job chewy is that's a correct name or should we have another the audit committee because we have a resolution will review the budget right there's two things correct two things that we have to do every year I would call correctly and one is approve the financial exams right and then two is okay review the budget and then three will now if we're doing an RP then we need to be involved to make a recommendation to council that's the job of the audience not the citizens advisors but the audit committee is comprised of the citizens advisors committee plus one council member yes good job all these like nice little layouts and charts and other things yeah it's definitely stepped up our game on her but yeah business for discussion I move that we dismiss it"
