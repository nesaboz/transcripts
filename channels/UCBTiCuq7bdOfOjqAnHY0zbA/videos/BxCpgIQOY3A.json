project just joking yeah it's pretty good showing it is it's good need the insights yeah exactly yeah good evening everyone it's 6 PM January 20 9th now um 2024 and the city council work session will now come to order please rise and join me in the pledge of allegiance alance to the flag United States of America and to the Republic which it stands one nation under God indivisible liy for all Renee would you please call the role council member Frank Banker I am pres council member Lloyd Roberts council member Kim Shaw Elliot pres mayor Dave gtis here city manager Kyle reer here City attorney Randy Moore presid thank you very much uh we're going to move right over to item agenda item number one which is Introduction to codes uh review project and uh we have guest uh Lis Sara say that right yes correct okay all right I don't know how would get the share screen started the [Music] zoom it big yep all right there all right thank you all right thanks everyone um Louis serno with Calvin gardano and Associates and I've noticed it's been typing my my words and I don't know if you can hear the echo a little bit but I'll try to turn down my volume rid of that but um just wanted to do a quick introduction uh of this project that we're working on uh updating your Land Development code uh so we're going to do a quick introduction of the project uh take your input and your questions and discuss next steps in the process and of course uh understand this will not be your only opportunity for input this will be a process and I'll explain that through the next steps um but just really to get your mind thinking of what uh problems that you've seen or issues You' like address in the Land Development code update the purpose of updating your Land Development code these are just some of the purposes for consistency with your comprehensive plan so we'll be checking for that consistency with countywide rules consistency with Florida statutes for internal Clarity and consistency to reflect best practices and to refle reflect your local priorities so uh really that's where we're going to be looking for your input and input from the public on local priori ities just some things to think about when uh updating your land develop M code what are common complaints that you hear and uh you know as council members uh and we look to staff as well what what are the complaints that you're commonly commonly here that can be addressed through uh Land Development code update uh what are Varian variance requests that you get that are common that could perhaps be addressed uh through a Land Development code rewrite uh what are underwritten rules and interpretations and these are often things that are not clear in the code but somebody uh staff member usually says this is what it means and ra rather than um uh updating the code it just ends up as being a memo many times but um what we we really want to do is incorporate all those in the Land Development code and then uh no logical order just trying to order the code in a way that uh a user uh the public usually who doesn't use it on a daily basis can find what they're looking for easily uh things like where can I put a pool uh what are my setbacks things like that uh so it's good to include somebody with an outside perspective like our firm uh in the process because we sort of bring a fresh look uh and based on our experience R viewing other codes uh but it's also to have it's also good to have the local input and and your uh experience as well so what i' like to do at this point is really just uh touch on what's In Your Land Development code uh in case you're not familiar with it uh or just a reminder your code is in subpart B of your code of ordinances however we can uh go outside of that to the entire code of ordinances but for purposes of uh tonight's meeting and what we we'll be focusing primarily on will be we'll be focusing on subpart B I know there are things like swimming pools and docks there that are not in subpart B that probably uh should be uh but if there are things like that um we can certainly put them in the land of development code or update them as a part of the other portion of the code of ordinances so uh chapter 7 70 is your concurrency management section uh like a lot of communities in pelis County you're a built out town and uh you probably don't use this a lot it primarily affects larger development ments um that would have uh large public impacts but again it's worth looking at and I'm not sure if you've experienced any problems or need to uh but this is what's uh included in that section uh I did note some things that are out of date and not consistent with the county plans uh the County's concurrency requirements that would probably work to your advantage and probably should be updated so uh would recommend that you look at that um you do have a Parks level of service standard that is not is no longer required by the state but it's up to you if you want to consider that uh and with that I'll pause on this chapter if you have any questions on concurrency or questions or comments Council no okay please proceed uh flood plane management uh this chapter is uh uh needs to be consistent with State requirements they have state model ordinance uh really what we we'll be doing is making sure that it's consistent with the model ordinance we don't want to depart from that uh to get out of state compliance so uh don't know if you've had any issues with that but I'll pause on this chapter as well if you have any comments or questions on this chapter yes Mr Banker you say state requirements are we considering the FEMA requirements too I mean I know FEMA doesn't issue permits or approve plans but they do have set standards to keep the nfip yeah the the state requirements incorporate FEMA's requirements as well they just the state wants all the communities in Florida to have consistent regulations and yes they do need to be consistent with FEMA other questions all right uh chapter 78 is a very excuse me one one second sir yes Mr Kelly can I just we actually because it's a public meeting and it's broadcasted you're going to have to step up to the microphone name is Mike Kelly 2740 hibiscus Drive Mr Senator why do they call it Land Development code we don't call it the Land Development code is that just a broad um we going to change it the Land Development code well well actually uh that subpart b is titled Land Development code and in your code of ordinances and typically the Land Development code just deals with everything uh dealing with Land Development and primarily zoning you'll see is probably the largest section so we're not we're not proposing changing the title or anything like that it's just uh what What's not what's currently known as your Land Development code does that answer that okay um chapter 78 entitled planning like I said it's a very short chapter probably could be incorporated elsewhere in your code uh P this primarily just says what your local planning agency is U but that's it it's very short so any questions or comments yeah like I said it's it's a very short chapter maybe we can incor incorporate it in elsewhere in in the code satellite antennas you have a chapter on that uh I didn't see anything of note in that but I'm not sure if you've had any issues so I'll just pause on that for comments or questions does that include Towers uh no that's a that's a different chapter okay all right uh signs uh my understanding is the this council is or the town is in the process or has recently updated this section to be consistent with uh Federal uh requirements uh so I don't anticipate that we're going to be uh we we don't want to read recreate that effort or reinvent the wheel but um it it is a part of your Land Development code it is a chapter so if you have any questions on that uh are you at least gonna take a gander at it just kind of scan through and see if uh our our City attorney did his job correctly I'm sure the City attorney did a great job but yeah we will look at it yeah for any suggestions uh but yeah we definitely don't want to touch the the the changes made for legal purposes uh and again when well probably not uh since you don't have a lot you don't have a commercial area probably won't uh uh get into anything controversial but yeah it's a hot button topic many times and I just we will look at it and I just wish to add more broadly as um this is what what Mr CNA is proposing is entirely a collaborative process between um a city's legal department and the planners to harmonize those and his point at the outset is well taken in stating that it helps that have a fresh set of eyes not just of somebody who's not of the community but there sort of when you're talk about writing Land Development codes and when I spoke about this with Kyle there's sort of a vend diagram of a planner and a lawyer looking at these I'm looking at the legal things without often the complete vision of what is the planning outfall and the land development outfall of that and so bringing those both perspectives will help us to better harmonize the code going forward as I might be more sensitive to let's say recent changes in Florida Statutes and he with more you know growth management and things like that all right yes that's actually very good to hear so I'm I'm glad we're getting input from both sides and one thing to perhaps keep in mind is that the new sign ordinance at least as proposed is is rather prescriptive and is um might benefit from some readability just in terms of people being able to find something quickly and be able to kind of have a I I know citizens don't have to be lawyers to be able to present something but at least have a good understanding of how they can find things and and and be reassured of what the language actually says Mr cernon just for your benefit as we talk about the sign code where it stands in this community is there was a draft uh provided to Planning and Zoning the com the council looked at it once um but nothing has gone on uh first and second reading okay there just a draft and we can uh confer as as this process moves forward yeah and we'll definitely be working closely with the attorney on that um and yeah your point about it being readable it's good we we review a lot of sign codes and uh we have there's several model codes and things like that so yeah we we'll definitely look at look at it with that lens so could you look at the one that's in ADV band right now but uh for the towns there's one that's been put on well direct Advance or whatever but it's not being enforced but still in our immunity code you saying just looking at the code as it presently as opposed to how it may as as opposed to the proposed amendment okay okay yeah definitely we'll we we'll look at that all right anything else I don't think so all right your subdivision chapter uh very long I won't I won't walk through all the sections uh I don't IM you get very large subdivisions uh here but you could so I mean we're definitely going to look at it closely so you may not have had a lot of experience with uh with with the section so just uh run through what's in it uh process and applications um the design standards a little more uh to this section probably and then uh required improvements so yeah this is probably the the section uh you may want to focus on or or may be more familiar with you know with your street requirements sidewalk requirements and things like that uh but again we'll be looking at that and making sure that it's internally consistent and making sure it's clear uh and identify any issues but uh at this point pause to see if you have any issues with that that entire chapter on subdivisions all right um moving on to zoning uh this is uh another large chapter with a lot in it uh we'll be looking at this this is just um this is in general article one portion of it not a lot there just a lot of um well a lot of uh you know General language I guess uh including your definitions Administration how things uh how your public hearings uh work and time limits and things like that um oh this deals with Board of adjustments so a lot of this portion on how you make uh variances uh non-conformity section always a good uh that's something to look we're looking at closely uh that language uh because you know there's that's always an important section when you have a built out Community uh things that were built before the current code and what happens and how much you can add to those how much you can uh vary those what happens if they get destroyed things like that so we'll be looking at that I don't know if you've had any comments or issues with with that uh and then of course your District standards uh you know very important we'll be looking at that make sure making sure all your uses are covered and your setbacks are are adequate or adequately Ade adequately addressed and clear and then the district regulations themselves um and at this point I'll pause to see if you have any questions on zoning I know there's a lot to that section uh very important probably the most common section that's used in in most Land Development codes okay good so far um again this is still more zoning but uh and still more District standards garages or compressor units you'll see on this uh access to property uh I think the compressor units um we made a note and I think the uh the manager mentioned adding things like generators pool pumps to that list of compressor units where you can put those but that'll be part of the draft that we uh that we prepare uh detached buildings garages rentals docks Etc and then your supplementary District regulations F things like fences commercial activities uh city property moving buildings things like that um and I'll pause at this point if there's any comments that you see I I think it's uh I'm assuming you're gonna handle this section at a time and uh I'm sure we'll have questions as we go through the process um but uh we want to all be with you every step of the way so H how does that work the uh how do we know where you're at in the code and how do we know to focus our attention at that time yeah and that's Absolut that's a good question I'll I'll probably coordinate with the manager on that how we do this typically what we do is uh we prepare a report uh of our recommendations section by section and uh we can either I can present that to you again uh or the manager can present it to you and have you discuss discuss it section by section and uh once you have seen that report then we actually give you the strike through an underlined portion of the code that's you know a thicker document uh and that's probably that's probably the one to break up into sections or chapters probably okay to go through but yeah understand it's a lot to throw at you tonight so um yeah not not expecting a lot of com tonight but definitely yeah you'll have you you'll have more shots at this oh I have a question in the back oh yes yes hi am Jane Goldman 437 22nd Street one of the things that I usually do in business is I look at the stats and the historical um let's just say incidences that we've had over the last five years so I can say for the board of adjustments we regularly sit through um ad nauseum pool the pool thing right because the the old um rule was 18 inches above above the um middle of the street and blah blah blah so what I I've asked for and what I would like to see in I hope it would help you is let's look at some of the statistics right things that we've all struggled with and we've spent a lot of time on including the tower the guy who's got the radio tower and all that stuff and so he's slipping through a loophole that we would like to kind of fix yeah AB so we' like to collaborate with you but I also think we have to look at the past history in order to make sure that you're focusing on the things in in our community that have really started to bother us yeah absolutely absolutely and that's a good good topic for discussion how we can coordinate because yeah I think I mentioned at the beginning yeah common variances uh that you've seen in the past those are good ones to uh definitely address in the Land Development code what was the issue that keeps coming up sounds like pools pool Heights um so yeah I'll coordinate with you uh give you my contact information but that that history would be uh very valuable and and that's typically How We Do codes uh either through staff or through through the boards especially the the boards that do the variances uh getting their input on it so yes sir please come up Jerry Wi 3100 Golf Boulevard will you be addressing new technologies like EV charging stations and that type of thing yeah we we do try to use uh I think I mentioned at the beginning best practices and yeah there's a lot of a lot of these codes are very old and don't recognize things like that so uh yeah that that's a good that's a good uh I'll make a note about EV charging stations that's a common one um we we also see a lot of parking standards that were just based on an old economy uh probably not so much here because you don't have commercial uh activity commercial commercial zones um but that that's a common one and uh so yeah we we'll be looking to update things to address latest Technologies but yeah EV charging stations is a good one I think that's it for now all right okay uh telecommunication towers and antennas it's uh an article under zoning uh we will be looking at that um and I sounds like there's an issue with an antenna um and um again we've seen these in other codes uh hopefully we can catch a lot of the common things but we'll we'll be looking for input so any questions or input on that well the one the board member brought up it's he claims it's an antenna but it's truly an ant a tower on an antenna and it's an FCC our attorney who's been wrestling with their attorney for over a year now oh wow but it's still a it's still laying in the it's still in the yard where we're waiting I think March is the uh time he has till gets back to the county with a permit but I would like to see something substantially put in h our ordinances to forbid de going forward yeah we'll we'll definitely work closely with the uh with the attorney on that whole issue that yes Miss Elliott um I'm aware that the one of the adjoining property owners has some concerns about that one in particular about the the safety of their own house or pool that if that Tower fell what would happen and and what are the standards for securing the tower has me some sort of construction stand standard not like a you know project there there are in fact standards and that particular application is going through the permitting process with review by the county with specific attention towards wind mitigation and and other factors um I would caution this Council about talking about individual code enforcement matters but um just to say that that's going through review um when you're talking about as I'm sure Mr CERN is well aware when you're talking about amateur radio antenna Towers there's a different analysis that you have to consider in terms of the accommodation and review process it's going through that process nothing is a foregone conclusion as to how that process will resolve but that doesn't mean that there's not value in looking at our code and determining if there's ways we can set that code better for both recognizing that process of accommodation but also if there are restrictions that we can reasonably impose within the Contours of the law that this city explores them through this planning process yes thank thank you for that clarification and I wasn't trying to address the specific issue but just that will the code address those types of Standards so it's good to hear yeah hopefully if things if if you're getting things uh actions that are a result of the code not being clear yeah hopefully we can address those we we'll definitely be working with staff on on those issues and in these meetings I would I would caution the council I I think uh this is what Randy was was referring to but uh we should stay away from individuals and individual properties whenever we're discussing U potential code changes it's it I don't want it to appear that we're weaponizing our code please continue sir yes uh and just uh finally the the last chap the last portion of the zoning chapter is uh just the two sections that wouldn't fit on the other page variance procedures and appeals dealing with telecommunications antennas so that is your code um there like I said at the beginning there are other issues there are other things that um perhaps need to be included in your uh in subpart B the Land Development code that aren't currently um I just stopped the top of my head just looked at uh a section adding a section perhaps on development agreements and we can work with the attorney on that I know they're referenced in the code but the code does not specify a process for approving them um which you know we've we've added to codes in the past uh I don't know if there's a need for temporary uses or special events again these are just my thoughts um to get your your you thinking about things that aren't currently addressed uh as far as I know uh food trucks Mobile food vending I don't know if you want them or don't want them or don't want to address them uh but just something I did not see uh use of Synthetic Turf and landscaping that's something we're seeing a lot of recently for some reason I guess it's uh they they've come up with really good new material that looks real um but you know how do you want to address it do you want to address it um things like that swimming pools currently in chapter 10 uh typically something that's in the Land Development code uh and I understand there's probably some pool questions and issues that we'd be dealing with and the same with docs currently they're in Chapter 30 uh can just considering moving those in the Land Development code uh but that's basically it I don't know if you've had if you have any other topics or questions um like where is a certain issue addressed or something new that I haven't discussed that uh you'd like for us to consider I'd be glad to take any of your input on that would you uh let's see what's the best way to to word this every change we made to our code uh every ordinance uh requires an economic impact study yes um so every little change is that going to require an economic impact study i i i and and the attorney can correct me if I'm wrong I think we would take the ordinance as a whole and look at the issues that are addressed in it um and hopefully we would not have anything that would uh have an impact on on businesses um so uh like I said you don't you don't we we're not going to be dealing with a commercial use that we're going to disallow I don't think or something like that so those are the things I I would steer clear of now you know taking away a right that would affect a business um but yeah that's I concur that you don't have to provide an independent analysis for each change we will take it as an ordinance one of the things we will look at is certainly um consistency in our ordinances that we're not just saying an ordinance amending the entire land of velopment code would that be you know uh we're try trying to take it in in sensible um fragments chapter sections whatever may be most appropriate I've done a version of this in another Community for its code of ordinances not its Land Development code and in that instance we might have had you know three chapters in one meeting and then one chapter that's going to be three meetings long um and so you know you look at that that way as to the business impact study obviously in this community less relevant as you don't have a business sector um not altogether irrelevant as we have changed our economy towards and and statutory rules towards homebased businesses and all these other things that you know sort of change the construct of of what we what neighborhoods once were so um we'll have to look we'll have to have an eye towards those things but it's not as of much it is not as of as much consequence as it might be in other communities where you have a downtown a business district and other similar concerns right uh yes um our neighboring town in uh Indian Rocks Beach had a lot of sensitivity around what has been expressed to the public as losing their grandfathering um because of a change to their zoning so what does that mean for us and what does that mean in terms of what we need to be attentive to in these changes excellent question um we talked about that I know a little bit um when you were on um the last board talking about the comprehensive plan review the reference to losing I've heard I chuckled only because I've heard people say losing their grandfather clause and then it gets short into losing your grandfather Which con some entertaining images um but the the what what is at issue there is really specific to transient rentals or short-term vacation rentals and subject to whatever happens I think that's wood um this legislative session presently the state of the law is in 2011 the legislature uh preempted local community's ability to regulate short-term rentals at all and but they said unless you have something on the books before June 2011 this community has something on the books before June 2011 and it's able to and does enforce that then in 2014 they passed another amendment to that same section Florida statute 509 0327 B and that's since you're writing it 509 0.032 7B um and um subsection 7 subsection um but in that section they they walk back their preemption from Full preemption to just a community cannot reg cannot prohibit short-term rentals and cannot regulate duration or frequency um of short-term rentals in any way that wasn't already on the books prior to June 2011 so again if you have something let's say right if you have something right now that let's say says 90 days and you're like you know what that's not working for us let's make it 120 days it's void all together and you have no restriction um and so when you talk about the city of Indian Rocks Beach before I was their City attorney and before my firm was their City attorney um they had amended their Land Development code portions of their Land Development code coming into compliance with some of the county consistency measures referenced by Mr Sara and in doing so changed the regulations governing transient rentals and they did it a second time and sort of set it back but then sort of tacitly admits you did it um so with that they lost that um my analysis has been that they've lost the ability to regulate that owing to the statute and so to answer your question more narrowly as it relates to this code review we will have to certainly be diligent and I very much will because this is I I don't wish to have a series of six and seven hour meetings in this community too about short-term rentals um making sure that as we do things for consistency that we preserve do not modify in any way that is could be conceived as more restrictive or you know not already in your code as it relates to uh short-term rentals and so it's looking and and that's reflected in the more recent um comp plan amendments so making sure that carries through in the ldrs Land Development one second Mr McIntyre Mar McIntyre 3040 hibiscus Drive West uh one of the things that came up on Planning and Zoning along this same line was what's being referenced to now as I think it's recreational Airbnb somebody could rent their pool out yes somebody could rent their dock out somebody could rent their tennis court out if they have one so is that a modification that would put our restriction our our grandfather Airbnb restriction would that put it at risk or is that a modification that that's worth considering and does that come under this review uh recognizing first that it uh this is being recorded and second that I've not specifically have the code in front of me what the answer is have the potential to jeopardize it depending on the manner in which you do it and so we would have to navigate that um obviously regulating partial rentals of a portion of a property for recreational purposes let's say A you have a sound mixing room where you can do studio recording in your in your house um we would have to look at narrowly tailoring that in a way that could not be construed as falling within the scope of 5090 32 but I have seen that as something that communities have addressed and and I've and I've raised that with um staff cre it was an open issue when we went through this thought bit more understood Mr Elliot did you have another question no thank please proceed well so basically that concludes what I was going to talk the introduction of what I was going to talk about um I think what I based on what I'm hearing I'll work closely with the uh the manager and uh based on the direction he gives you we're working for the town so uh we want to do this in the way that works best for you but uh typically the plan is to prepare a report on your your um Land Development regulations uh present that to you and then work on the individual chapters or sections however you want to break it down uh prepare those and strike through underline for you to look at uh and again give you more opportunities to to have input so we're not going to prepare final draft and give it to you we're going to uh give it to you in our as our as we recommend and any other input you want to give us will incorporate into that so is it possible that whenever uh you you start moving forward on this uh you could provide us with a tentative schedule where we are what we've done uh so that we can focus our attention on what you're you're going to be working on in in the coming days yeah that's a good point that that way you can work ahead do do a little bit of homework uh yes well I'll work on I'll work on that make that a point to do that thank you anything else that's all I have well Lewis I uh appreciate you coming out yeah thank you thank you for your input I look forward to working with you and uh look forward look forward to seeing some of these much needed code changes thank you yeah I do I do as well all right so now we're going to move on to item two this was placed on the agenda by council member Roberts it's discussion on employee pay study Mr Roberts you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor so Kyle how long ago was it when um Rady's predecessor retired about is that about a year 2020 two okay so so when that happened um our at that time we had a service worker two and a service worker three were the two positions that we had that were filled by two people only um the three the person in the three position retired and at that point the right decision was made to um place the person who was the service worker 2 into the service worker 3 position and average ize for the service worker too what caught my eye at that time was it took an extraordinary amount of time in my opinion for somebody to fill that position leaving my working staff with uh one person in in what I would consider the field work which made Kyle spend even more time in the field than he normally did in his position so when I looked at that I said well what might be a reason the salaries didn't look like they were enough just just based on my gut and my experience in those type of jobs so I talked to Kyle by that time um Aaron was on board we talked about some solutions one was we added an additional service worker two on board giving us three field workers so we had to hire a additional person there also that took a long time to fill that position so and my my vetfield told me was this is because people really aren't attracted to that particular salary so I asked I asked Kyle a couple of times we talked about it by that time I think Aaron was on board and I said hey could could we do a pay study to see what other towns and cities are paying similar type employees so staff did a great job providing us the council with many similar type positions I don't know how many of you have ever been involved in a corporate pce study with the companies you work for I've been involved with more than a handful and you get overloaded with all of this data and the first thing you're trying to do when you're trying to help your staff is okay which of these jobs are really close to the positions that my staff do and you're filtering through all that and looking at the numbers and you're paying a consultant typically a fair amount of money to do all this work for you and they come up with a magic number it gets kick back and forth between HR and it's no fun we're not really in that situation because we're such a a small town which is wonderful and I think that gives us a lot more flexibility as well because when hopefully we make a salary adjustment here it's not really costing the city that much money because we don't have 30 employees in this job class that that adds to our budget withdrawal so all that being said I felt like again that the salary the uh current employees are getting is not sufficient I think the the demand of our citizens is such that we really need to get the best employees to to do this work and the fact that we only have three field staff makes it even tougher currently the service worker 2 is paid $18 an hour and the service worker three is paid $21 an hour the town that I felt was closest to our positions and closest to the kind of the size of our city and the makeup of our city in my opinion was Readington Shores Readington Beach both of them interestedly in enough paid kind of almost the same amount of money per hour uh the information that we got from Readington Beach for the public rounds worker they gave us an annual salary you could quickly do the math they're paying $225 an hour also um Readington Shores is paying $225 an hour their crew leader is being paid [Music] $28.35 so just on paper I feel fairly confident in saying that the $18 per hour rate that our field staff person gets is similar to the 22 of Readington Shores Readington Beach and the cool leader of $28.35 an hour is similar to the $21 an hour staff person responsibilities in addition to that from what I understand many of the tasks that uh Readington Beach and Readington Shores perform a lot of that is actually outsourced so they are basically managing the contracts of of the companies that are coming in that they've outsourced that par particular task so i' about getting to a lot more detail because I'm confident that probably most of us already looked through the various towns cities and what they're paid again they have a lot of little they kind of break it down most of the bigger cities like the St Pete Beach as an example Oldsmar they have a lot of Fe field staff out there doing those type of tasks so I have no problem and we can of course discuss this as a group of of uh jumping their current rates from those lower rates that we pay currently to the rates that um Readington Beach and Readington Shores pay which are the 22 and so that that's basically adding $4 an hour to the service worker to and if we took that same $4 and added it to the crew leaders current salary I think we would be just looking at some some dollar values there uh that would be about 16,000 for the two service worker twos in total a year and another eight so we're talking about $24,000 a year additional that will come out of the salary in your budget tile how are you set for that now if you had to pay an additional $24,000 a year in salary to the three individuals that are in those positions so we've been without a couple of salaries for a little bit of time that money accumulates for this year's budget what are your thoughts well we definitely would need a budget adjustment um and that's exactly what I wanted to hear um generally we don't get into the Weeds on individual employee salary and the reason why is because that employee reports directly to the city manager and um even our Charter states that we don't we don't uh we don't really get involved uh I don't have a problem with with uh an a pay increase certainly uh but it seems that really all we need is um is an amendment to the budget uh give us something to vote on and and there we go I I don't need a whole lot of justification because I understand that um inflation every I mean everyone I know that it's in business they've had to give salary increases to keep up um but um as far as your study I I appreciate it but I think it probably should have stopped at the city manager and then let the city manager come to us and ask for something because ultimately they're his responsibility okay I is George yeah yeah it it does um and so uh you can SE helped by the city manager but I would encourage everyone to not get too close with the staff all right but Kyle could come back with this data and information and then come to us as a request as a budget amendment yes and that's that's really all we need is because I don't personally I don't want to know I don't want to discuss any particular role because you're talking about an one individual you're talking about this individual you're talking about this individual and uh and I think it's okay for me to for me to uh keep the staff that I've got I would like to propose a budget amendment would you please vote on it perfect so we can discuss kind of the study and then I'll make a recommendation perfect yeah one more thing is uh I'm just curious have you on to the individuals in the staff and questioned them or uh have you been asking them about their feelings um I talked to Aaron because I knew he was the one that was collecting this data and um the other day I went back for the first time and actually saw their uh building back there with the equipment that's pretty cool back in the woods yeah but um I mean if you had discussions with them about their pay or anything like that I may have okay all right well and that's what I'm that's what I'm I I always want to make sure that we keep our distance because the charter that basically says you're not supposed to do that okay okay um yes Mr Banker um I thank you for bringing this up because I baren on this for three years with Council that our state has been underpaid from our city clerk to our city manag even our old city manager our old city clerk um and I've never done any direct dealing with for example working at the sandbag station people would come up and be thanking the guys and saying these guys are all underpaid right never dealt with the people directly they but I said these guys deserve more money and I think if one Negative they do but I really appreciate what you did here um I think we should be GRE City oh of course um the other thing that I would like to know the shower stin in my okay it's the best word I could describe but and I think you're right 100% right how many people are G to be drawn into that to take the job and that's why it's a long delay sure I would like to know what the other communities face when they have to fill you know what I'm saying oh yeah I know they have the same problem no I really I think you did an excellent job I don't think you went out of balance I'm glad that someone else has addressing good thanks yes um subject to the mayor's well-taken provisos and with full respect to your role as the manager these people just one comment I might offer is that as one looks at salary increases um these are minor in terms of total budget but they're probably 30% and upwards in terms of percentages and so other staff members tend to look at any kind of increases and and it starts looking for internal equity in terms of raises so I just lay that out there as a general supervisor I agree I think that's important to take it to factor when you're making these decisions yeah we'll discuss perfect thanks okay and I I do appreciate it all the hard work that you've put into this uh I really wasn't looking forward to having this conversation but I'm glad it's glad it's over with I can't take crit for the work staff did staff did the work so I just asked the question okay uh anything else on item two all right let's move on to item three this is discussion on city manager salary uh this placed on the agenda by council member bankard um when we brought on Kyle as a city manager was in agreement of two years at a fix grade um inflation has gone through the roof um I think kle as were review when he first came on which he did do a review all our council members we look at the reviews he's done an excellent job and I think he deserves more money today but we have a salary increase for our employees coming up what generally wouldn't March April when when you do the annual percentage increases or whatever oh that's on their anniversary date yeah but but we'll propose something to what we're talking about is adjusting the current rates um and the start like the pay that they're at now to do we do it on the anniversary of each employer so it's not done in March or April or May would I would like to see him get his increase for this year retroactive January 1 we have a young lady here C city clerk that's done an excellent job we had to bring her in at a higher rate than I believe um or old was getting I still think you're underpaid um I think she should get I think she should get a bump this year I don't want to lose either one of these excellent employees just gave him an excellent award um and I think it deserves it you got a bargain here Council yes when was your anniversary dat your original one so when I became city manager um that was November uh 21 November 20 it was Sunday was what we retroid I think I was given the the contract was signed on November 28th I want to say we bounced it back because it was mid pay week of 20 of 2022 2022 okay 11 of 2022 okay so according to the contract then on 11 so after after two years the third year yes you would be eligible so 23 so 1124 is when you would be eligible right according to the current contract yes okay and since we're talking about it the contract is through November 21 2025 right the whole contract the whole the whole contract terms through November 2025 okay oh the one thing that I did not see was any type of comparison I I didn't have any numbers to look at to compare how below or above he was it would have been nice to have that in the uh in the agenda we do a comparison believe the salary range was 128,000 don't you know what I'm saying well I there's a lot that's happened since we brought him and so so I would I would definitely uh like to see something um are there other comments about this I mean we don't we don't we don't even know what we would be voting on at this point uh other than a salary increase but we don't know what that what that even looks like um well I I I I didn't put no number out there because if you remember remember when we were discussing looking for it it was a round table discussion and that's when we came up with the 128 figure and all like that some were making 160 and some were making 125 but most of them were making well over 125,000 than do we know if any of the uh comparable positions received bonuses other city managers you mean right not that I bonuses is not generally speaking I mean it's a little different with managers in that they have contracts but um generally speaking bonuses are just favored for public employees and their statutory Authority that cautions against it um usually if there is a bonus it has to be based on um articulated criteria Merit based eligible to usually in an employment policy eligible for all employees those sorts of things as as for the manager sometimes you do see um performance incentives for instance if the clerk had a contract in some instances you see okay if you become CMC certified you get you know we'll we'll do this or something like that um but not not common in a managerial position thanks for that I just wanted to make sure we weren't missing any compensation that might otherwise lot of employees in Florida got covid bonuses and more other bonuses the teachers got bonuses you know so it can work but yeah that was combat pay well I appreciate yes go ahead um so under section four sorry page 44 Randy you have that sorry you're looking at the manager's contract yes yes page 414 section four salary SE paragraph B beginning in the third we already talked about this beginning in the third year of the contract term the manager shall entitled to an increase in base salary as determined by the city council then this next sentence is what I just wanted to clarify my own head the contemplated salary increase shall take effect on the anniversary date of this agreement clear the same annual percentage as other city employees yes was that like predetermined so if the annual percentage that the council had said okay we're giving city employees 4% thank you that's a cost of living increase is what that is right right the the the way that was contemplated short answer yes you the manager one of the benefits we had in crafting this based on time is the manager is his anniversary date is in November you will you should provided everything's working as it should have your budget adopted by October one um so by that point you will have established that all your employees will or will not get a salary increase of as follows in the budget and sometimes referred to Cola sometimes just salary increase I I get leery of the names because I've seen things break down over what people are calling it but um be that as it may um if you if all the employees got a 4.1% increase then it's to make sure the manager gets the benefit of that bargain and that was something that Kyle and I actually specifically discussed in the U in the negotiations process some manager contracts just say this is the graduation or no you this is what you get flat rate three three-year term this is what you get over the three years and so it was you'll get an increase but it will be in alignment with your with your um employees okay and so that was and again the contract is based on the terms we negotiated at that time a contract can always be uh Revisited if that's the desire of this body we can um develop an amendment um as as appropriate but that was how it was contemplated okay kle when was your original hard started here uh June 4th uh 2018 even graduating what scope that original thing would help you well we're going to need some numbers we're going to need something to vote on we can't we can't just say we're doing it without knowing what it is we're doing so uh uh we direct Kyle to find out what Indian Rocks Beach is paying de Readington the ready city manager no can bring that back to us yeah I can find it I'd like for you to go out and tell us how much you'd like to make blank check I think we had a spreadsheet on that Kyle when we were going through this process before it even gave in a column for example 10 years experience as a city manager Etc this is what they're making so no no no I get that yeah all right well um I certainly am open uh to uh continuing on this discussion with some hard numbers um while we are talking about that uh let's let's continue talking about pay the one you've talked about the staff and you've talked about the city manager you've talked about the clerk for some reason you you won't talk about the City attorney um I I don't blame you there um but uh you've not discussed the council it's getting harder and harder to fill our seats and uh so I contacted Renee and she did a quick study of all the communities around pelis County I don't think she got to all of them you get um buty gety I do Randy you're next I'm gonna try would you okay we're good okay so um as you can see the lowest other than no compensation uh which by the way uh the two no compensations you see there's 7500 population and 6382 population and then the very lowest uh that's giv compensation uh is 9,019 population so they certainly have a lot more people to go through to find possible willing uh candidates that are uh either eligible or at least willing to complete a form six and uh get involved with their local municipal government I think that going forward in the future we're going to continue having problems like we're having right now where uh no one's interested they don't want to do the form six um so I would not consider this actual compensation as much as I would whenever I look at these numbers some of them are large uh but I would look at this in these small towns this looks more like appreciation pay it's uh it's showing it's the city showing the the council that yeah uh we appreciate you being here because we don't want to do it um as the way that I look at it and whenever you look at what they're getting uh i' I would say that certainly some of that could be used to to help with filing form six uh could be used for an umbrella policy uh for for their own protection there's a lot of things that could be done uh for the council now if we were to select something like this and vote it through it would not impact any of us this would be um according to our code if we decided to move forward with paying the council um it requires two elections uh so I am all on board uh of moving forward with this for Council in the future uh and I think that everyone here should should seriously consider it uh because it's just going to continue getting worse the State of Florida is going to continue bearing down on us more and more they're going to make it harder and harder for us to do our job um and then of course also you've got the uh the possible dangers of frivolous lawsuits and all sorts of shenanigans that that uh that you know Target you so Mr Banker uh you actually made the comment last week that it was crazy and you you were uh um you couldn't believe it so I I'd like to go ahead and hear your comments now that you've seen this study first of all none of these were overwhelming pay BR council members I guess the highest here [Music] is shes I don't know if they get benefits I don't know what they like benefits but B Beller or Bell Shores I I don't see them one here I don't believe they get any they get any compensation how many other communities around here don't get compensation I think it's a privilege to serve the people here I don't think anyone here needs $400 a month $800 a month and if we have that kind of money let's give it to the employees that work here um we'll even throw some to Randy uh on the side I mean if I that's not what I'm talking about that's that's not the question this money should be used for the dedicated staff that comes in here eight hours a day five days a week this man here 24 hours 247 she's 247 anymore and I could never accept a dying from these taxpayers for doing this job I'm privileged to do this job I feel privileged I thank God for the privilege of doing this job to represent this people um you can't put a value on I mean this is really just picking the pockets of the taxpayers we have that kind of money to give out every month give it to the employees that deserve okay yes I feel like if and of course well we would never know the answer to this question how many people out there in our city were maybe on the edge of deciding to run for a seat on our Council coupled with the infamous form six felt like well goly now I may have to hire an accountant and or a lawyer to assist me with this to make make sure it's done right that's going to cost me money if this small compensation would help and having other people run to want to sit on this Council I would be in favor and that as the marriage has said this is not going to impact us because we'll be gone before any monies come our way um I I don't think there would actually be people out there that would say wow now that I'm going to be paid I'm in I don't I don't think that's that's the type of person that would run I do think there may be some people out there that are reluctant to run because they feel like they have to come out of pocket to deal with the form six information and data Gathering and if this would help them to want to run and help our city I'm for that it'sot if part of the purpose is to fill the vacant seats that we have now now um maybe if I could ask our attorney to address can can that happen can we act fast enough and would it would it impact new people uh the I think the mayor's apply spoken to the the restrictions in your code and otherwise by statute on how um certainly you could not make it for the here and now today I think by Statute the soonest you could make it as your next commission I believe your community has its own Provisions to say not just the next but the one after that um and and um you know we're also incidentally looking at changing intervals by which you elect those people um so that might also push that time even further out depending on what happens in the charter so um no you couldn't do into entice anybody today or in 2024 for that matter um oh so for the election that's held in March well never mind there will be no St a competition with your names Alone um see see right now we're in a situation where we are having to do something new we're having to um contact our CPAs we're having to pay money to serve on the council and um even though Mr Banker completely disagrees with this um I'm I'm hearing right now that there's possibility that even though we can't uh we can't vote even if three of us vote Yes he still blocks it okay but I'm having this conversation because I want to know where the council stands um boy you made a comment because you reviewed form six tap and this is a two-part question and my way was an account I don't think it's that dramatic to fill this out like that but you even said it doesn't that hard it's not g be that AGG fill it out but do you own a business well if you I'm asking you a question do you own a business yeah okay Kyle you know just about everyone in this community how many on a percentage how many would you say own businesses in this community over 50% it seems like okay and uh a lot of them are property they have mult properties scattered around the country um I got M these These are difficult that it's a there's a lot involved if if my wife had to fill out a form six it'd be awful you look at what Brian Scott is having to do right now with the county now he signed up for that he knew he was going to have to do a form six um but if you go and you look every stock that he has ties to whatsoever is listed everyone and so he had to go into his mutual funds and he had to go and get granular and fill it all out so if you look at if you look at other people such as U tasse people they don't seem to fill out much of anything at all but what I've noticed is that uh at a municipal level we're small everyone knows each other and they um the last thing they ever want to get caught up in is lying on form so at this level we are going to spend the money and we're going to have to pay somebody to help us through it in fact um we're I'm having to do it myself you know it may turn out that it's pretty simple whenever it's done but this first time around I need to make sure that I'm covered uh so my going back to my original question was what what's the majority right now I'm hearing maybe two yes okay and how about you am I a business owner I'm just talking about how do you feel about uh appreciation pay for the council I think it's a very interesting idea I if if we can't impact anybody coming in soon there may not be any urgency well there is urgency because we're about to have an election there's a difference between three and six years help me understand that then because the election the election is in March if we don't pass this before March then you have to wait two more elections so let's say we hamha around about this and finally we decide let's move forward with it it could be up to nearly what seven or eight years before uh the the council is eligible to even receive the minimal pay that that I'm proposing oh that was part of my question then so thank you so it can't impact anybody that we might attract to the board soon correct even after the election right but the following election it will impact them yes and um and honestly if if the council has to be done before March to impact those coming in in five so the language referenced is in the just I think at this point in the discourse it warrant just an apologies for the interruption but section 2.03 of your code um rather of your Charter um States the council by ordinance shall determine the annual salary if any of council members the mayor and vice mayor but no ordinance establishing or increasing such shall salary shall become effective until the date of commencement of the terms of council members elected at the second regular election following passage of the ordinance a little dense in that last bait there but the way it would be administered is technically there's a regular election in March of 2024 um and then provided Cycles didn't change the next one is I think March 20 25 um and so it would not be until after that um the mayor's saying well first in the first instance if we don't do it until August let's say now you're going to have to wait till the 2025 cycle in the 2026 cycle the other issue is that one of the ballot measures you have proposed and this is a whole another web of of the Multiverse here if you will of options is there's a proposal to change your election cycle to November if and only if you also extend council members terms to four years and so you would be going out to 2026 and I think 2028 and 20230 would be your election Cycles so potentially this could be your next election cycle wouldn't be until after 2028 um if we if all those things are approved and so that would be the soonest that I think it could phase if I'm remembering all of the right of the interplay um and so I think that's what the the mayor's sense of urgency is to this trying to explain that and contextualize it so it would have to be a change in our ordinance correct yes you would well you would have to do it by ordinance yes and so um yes and so doesn't that require several readings and two readings uh first and a second reading um which we are at the end of January um depending on how much this Council again it's at the RO of the council if it was a priority for the council let's say all of you are in agreement and it's a priority this we could conceivably have this done before the March election because we could always call the special meeting um which we've done in the past in other contexts to you know let's say first reading as soon as next week right you you're you're technically scheduled to meet next week um provided you intend to do so so you you have a meeting next week you do first reading then and then if it remains a priority of the council and it passes first reading we could schedule something probably as soon as the third week our limiting factor there is an ordinance on second reading has to be advertised in the paper and so newspapers not being what they used to be in terms of cycles and print lead times Etc usually want to budget at least 14 days so the soonest you would probably get is maybe the third or fourth week of February you could have a second and final reading if you so desired so it is possible to achieve um enacting it in that timeline if that is the desire of this body is it possible to draft an ordinance in such a way that they will be compensated in such amount as the board May determine uh at some frequency or or at some event so that we don't specify the amount now we certainly don't have to specify anything today unless you're wanting something on first reading next week I would need to know but the way the language reads it says the council by ordinance shall determine the annual salary um so to me that would justest as written that the ordinance would have to State what the amount is in some other context you might have for example um let's say we're talking we've had a lot of discussions here about your Marina you might say um there shall be a fee required for the marina that shall be set from by resolution and we do that later you can't do that I don't think that would be appropriate here where it says the ordinance shall determine the salary um and so I I would reading that by its plain text I think the the more precise reading would be the ordinance itself must State the salary amount if you're inclined to move in that direction and it looks to me like uh if the council decided they weren't getting paid enough this is always the big fear I'm not getting paid enough we we need to vote we need to vote to increase our salary well according to our Charter even the increases apply the same way is that correct yeah it's anytime it would be an ordinance determining the salary and so it would still be subject to the B based on language the charter would be the two election Cycles two more election cycles and and so my point is is that I don't have a problem setting up the council uh of the future um to at least get some compensation I hear it over and over this is a thankless job we all know that it's a thankless job this is the one way that I can think of that hey you're getting a little bit of of cash to offset the expenses we all spend money money doing this job um I I don't think I think there's been twice that I've turned in uh mileage I never turn in mileage on my car and I you know I go all over the place um meetings and uh events and uh yes sir it's not this this not really the same Forum but I since you're the only one here I'll take your under dwellings with a 709 Harbor Drive So to that end you just said like almost treating it like a business expense could any of these things be submitted as expenses to the community what's that now like you said you wanted to you you wanted some help with um having an accountant with the form six instead of trying to deliver it as a salary to somebody could it just be an expense that you submit I think the problem is is you're you're having to audit it's your personal finances I think that that would be misuse of uh but if it's for a state form that's required you know it's like you're trying to you're trying to meet the requirement of form six and that's the only reason you're doing it it's like a no that's not the only reason I'm just saying that you're not doing it for personal reasons you're doing it to meet requirements on this is not for me at all this is for future councils no I understand your request to do the salary thing I understand your request for salary I'm saying could you even do could you not do it as a salary proposal just expenses and just submit it as an expense and you're not subject to these waiting you know two terms before it could even be oh you're talking about the just in general how do we all right like yeah like if I were to consider to be on this board you know like you say I had to say all the concerns you just mentioned you know there's like okay so uh let's just say that my uh form six is simple right but Mr big bucks businessman over here right it's thousands uh to create that report um because you see what I'm saying so I see yeah but like you said your salary wasn't going to be full compensation maybe I don't know maybe you could come up with some I'm looking for I'm just thinking of ideas that might allow you to do it earlier not wait for two terms before it could do anything you said you submit mileage I'm imagine you travel anywhere on on the behalf of the city council you kind of submit an expense report you can at least right you may or may not do that but could you do that as an option for this scenario you could get like if you needed a Cota lawyer or something to help you with just feel uncomfortable that you this form out properly you're saying turning your accountant fees for form yeah and and maybe like to say if it's thousands of dollars maybe if there's an unrealistic limit there is some realistic limits that maybe you'd have to put on it I don't know I'm just throwing options on the table for you well there no I I I I think I'm sorry how about Randy answering could we do that legally so if I'm understanding the gentleman's comments the the question on the floor is rather than set a salary for the position if one of the more acute concerns is compliance costs form six would have you have make provision not for a salary but for a reimbursement scheme for example whereby you say each council member shall I mean let's say because I'm a lawyer and I'm just going to make it easy on the math I'm not explaining I'm not suggesting an amount if you said $1,000 a month well that goes to $112,000 a year so what if we said you get you're reimbursed uh for those costs not to exceed $6,000 a year um upon presentation can we do that um I think we can do that the how of how of of how it all works I hadn't specifically considered that before tonight um I want to make sure you know we made it clear it wasn't a salary if we're going to you know pull it out of there of course nothing's an issue until someone makes it an issue so there's always the possibility that we say we're going to go down that road someone challenges it um but um I think we could I just I I'd want to see how that may be done in other communities if at all to make sure we're we're looking at Best Practices um I'm not aware of something that specifically prohibits it yeah I as I sit here now I appreciate your in input sir and uh I think we're probably over complicating the question I I just just again I'm uh I really think that the council should be compensated for their time well Dave let's bargain okay okay I want the flooding issue addressed s sincerely aggressively we haven't got to that yet well there's a thing on the table right now that was the ter turn down by one vote SE this is another another situation well I'm going to bargain with you then all right so if you're even willing to consider it um I've already had a conversation with Kyle and I told him that if I couldn't get this pass that I would not vote for his raise so I just wanted to throw that out there and um it's in your court well if you want to put Kyle in that predicting that that's up to you but and Kyle could be your job and go through this whole git again well I'll take my board okay all right uh any other comments or questions about that again I've already said that I would be in favor of that in the hopes that that would bring other people into the um movement to be on the council I think the citizens recommendation could also happen especially for the first time because that was a comment that was made by one of the leaders of that U session that I saw online and he felt confident that the first time every council member or commission member went through the form six it would be a struggle even if it wasn't complicated finances but the following years just like it was with the form one you know the first time I did the form one I had to pull out files and look at stuff the next year I pulled out the old 401 and said would anything change no you know so it was pretty simple to do the follow-up form once he was implying that the form six would be similar once you once you've gone through the unless of course your business has changed tremendously or something like that all right all right well um any other comments Miss Elliott i' I'd like to brainstorm that a little bit in terms of uh a reimbursable expense whether it be a cash reimbursement or it could be uh everyone to ensure our compliance as a city and and our personal our own council members are in compliance maybe it's you get up to three hours of Consulting whether it be with Randy or someone else to just how do fill out form again you're talking about private personal finances that and anytime that you do that um there's there's a possibility for scrutiny uh I think that what that what you do with that form six is on you and uh yeah it's nice to have some compensation to help pay for it if that's what you want to do with your money well I'm thinking maybe even if it's not compensation but that the the and it's it's not a reimbursable expense to the individual but it is a benefit available that the city pays for so for instance the city's going to whether it's a CPA whether it's Randy whether it's someone else but you come in and say okay I need to disclose my car is that a is that retail is that is that trade in value is that uh you know personto person value because you know Blue Book uses three different ones which one is it someone can help with those questions and and almost a walk-in situation where you can have some Consulting time with someone and would that help relieve people's concerns that hey if you're considering a post now I think in this community I wouldn't think so I think in this community the the U the pay uh or the reimbursement I I don't that's not the problem here the problem problem is is people don't want to reveal their personal business that's absolutely that's that's it in a nutshell that's why people aren't beating down our door to uh to join the council um again this is just something to show the council that they are appreciated it's it's not a lot of money and we won't get it but I think that if somebody doesn't open the door uh of eventually we're going to be in a vulnerable position to where the State of Florida will start looking at us because we can't fulfill our Charter and uh and that's the last thing that I want to do and whenever I hear people say it all the time it's a thankless job well yeah that's true it it really is you know um you feel good about it on the inside but on the other hand whenever the phone's ringing and people are complaining and they're not happy and and uh the council is arguing and yeah it's it's uh it is a thankless job I disagree I think it's a thankful job I get a lot of thanks way do it well you're one I'm paid I'm not getting paid and I'm here so paid this morning working for the we're helping out in the county I'm not getting paid now I and I thank my Lord I have the opportunity to do that all right uh well here's what I'm proposing is uh I would like even though we don't have a majority I would like to have placed on the agenda um a match for Indian Harbor Beach uh as the uh compensation for the city council um after the time delay uh after it's approved and uh I would like that placed on the agenda Randy can you draw that up I certainly can mayor okay I I understand Frank is not going to vote on it he's going to vote no but I would still like the opportunity to vote on it and I would like that to uh I would like to that to be presented before your pay is your pay increase okay all right now let's move on to uh item number four discussion on the storm water project just one quick question on that last issue if we were by some miracle to get two people to come up before the meeting and say they want to be considered for Council seats and from a timing standpoint would they actually be appointed prior to us voting on certain things or how would that work typically in the agenda well currently um uh we are not accepting accepting applications uh for nominees oh okay yeah there we every time we open it up there's a deadline and we kept extending and extending and extending and then it was uh getting so close to the election that it was pulled got it so what's the process if applicants come along what would be the process to open it uh well it's just a matter of um notifying the the uh the city clerk that we're now accepting applications again but we have to give a definitive star and stop time so if if applicants are interested they go and pick up the form or download it from the website and and fill it out then present it then we know okay somebody's interested we might open up that process that that could work okay okay all right uh item four uh this is placed on the agenda by council member Elliot um do you prefer Shaw Elliott or just Elliott it's Elliott all right uh discussion on storm water project possible solutions and Engineering estimate yes thank you very much um obviously um there was a lot of disappointment at the last meeting with the failure to pass the stormw project and if I can begin with just a little bit of background here um I was very excited when I first learned about this project um and knew that it was part of our strategic plan and watched it for a couple years for the progress and waited for my street to come up and checked on the progress and the budgets and thought oh good it's happening and then it didn't happen and then um the idea was floated for the bond issue which I thought was a a tremendous idea I learned much about of it as I could um I came and testified before this group my support of that bond issue for all the reasons that everyone else identified the idea that we could get better pricing as a group The the idea that we could uh address the change in our weather conditions or climactic conditions with the intensity and frequency of the storms growing uh so that we could get it done quicker um that there'd be less movement of equipment throughout over a period of time so all these wonderful favorable things interest rates were great um but as part of that I did say that this was an opportunity to look look at improvements to not do exactly what we that was done before but to look for some appropriate improvements um that we can incorporate into this project that didn't happen and so with my first meeting as a member of this Council this came up for vote and I understood Frank's frustration because there I felt that there was an opportunity lost to be able to bring some improvements into the project at least evaluate them examine them study it see see what's there um however I was also faced with the situation that you have the facts as they are that study hadn't happened and it was important to move the project forward so I voted in favor um and so here we are now that it's been um declined mind so what can we do as a group to move this forward because I think we all feel that it's important and that and this project needs to be completed we don't want to lose the pricing we don't want to have a storm come through and have devastating loss in our community if it could be prevented with this now um so I ask that we move this forward and and we were trying to think of ways that we might do so and agree as a group so one of the ideas that was was proposed is let's study it let's get a study of what would it cost to bring some improvements to this project if the study says don't do it it's not feasible we'll know that but we don't have those facts right now and I think it's a mistake to make the decision without having those facts before us so I would suggest that we look at this proposal we can tweak it we can we can we can Improvement improve it if if need be but I would suggest if we as a group can agree to to have that proposal conduct the study and approve the project as it is now but add this study for uh an immediate tag on Frank well we have a resident right there has got flooded out December storm um he watched his neighbor uh bailing out water or pushing out water out of his garage but he just redid after aot and uh I went around and decided to run again and thank you for your signature okay but uh I was also told try to get this fixed and I pledge these people I'm G to try to get it fixed right thank God I didn't get no more but you know this is bad okay you know that you know when we said this will not resolve anything why would we spend $4 million to go forward I have a real problem with that and I voted for the budget or I voted for the um bond issue I made Crystal Clear it's on the record only if we do it right and I was told we're going to bring the engineer in and he's going to present plans and we're going to design things that going to go the first set of plans that he came in during the work session I said how does this alleviate flooding well we're going to put a drain in here he said and I don't want to repeat myself and mean I said but how does it reduce flooding because once that drain fills up with 300 gallons of water where's the other in the street in your home and the only way to get rid of it is using a forced meth method whether pump or whatever and he set it twice on the floor this this where he said during a work session he also said it on the before and you were there you make great arguments so my question is why would we do this again with why would we spend $4 million of the taxpayer's money we're going to repave a few streets how many pipes are we actually replacing in this whole project it's only a handful from what I see yeah most of the we're lining the Cure in place so we're not even replacing what 60 70 year old concrete bites that would probably when they were poured had a lot of bash in them now yeah concrete puges can last 100 years these are 6070 years old 100 years in great conditions that's fresh water these are in so right who knows how they were put in with chains binders and whatever where the outsides cracked you can't see theide just my understanding was that the pipes although may not be fully replaced they were lined weren't they getting new liners right um the the pipes that were damaged um Dam we we proposed to clean and line them um because again it was looking at the overall systems if most of the pipe is good why are we going to dig it all up and replace it so that was something that kind of came up in discussion with our last project 12th and 13th um and debating what needed to be done so when we went and designed this project we really took a lot of time to inspect those pipes to say hey how bad are they you know where where where are we actually experiencing failure and what can we do to fix that and you're only doing the inside you're not doing the outside yeah and I mean I I agree with you I I would have liked this thing to be structured differently well wait a minute hold on structuring the you can't structure the whole thing differently you can maybe make some modifications in certain areas but there's the the design plan I mean why did we even hire an engineering firm what what was that for and and what I mean we've paid a lot of money to have this looked at and this is what they came up with is there a possibility that there is a better solution or in this neighborhood there may be we don't know however all the work that's in that $4 million plan still needs to happen when I said structured differently I meant the project not not the plan that is there so I would have liked to have had that study to see what improvements could have been made but as I and and and and I I agree with you that um and if we the facts as they are it didn't happen so let's do it now at least another study to let's get the project done because we still need the project but let's see what else we can do as phase two as any potential Improvement Mr Roberts I would say that there were things done differently with this project as a result of the tasks that were done on 13th and 14th Street there were improvements made and Direction given to the engineering firm that are replicated on the construction plans so there were improvements I was kind of sitting in your seat when the 13th and 14th I mean 12th and 13th Street project came to be so I asked a lot of questions at that time and didn't want that to go forward but it did and then we made changes after the fact on some of those things I don't know the exact percentage but Frank if we took a look at the actual costing for this $4 million project I I'll run the numbers but I'll bet you 95% of those costs have to do with the street improvements that would be needed to be done if we didn't have a storm water pipe in the city this is a typical typical maintenance project that every city in town does for their roads I have that understanding now and that that was uh mentioned at the council meeting which frankly was somewhat disappointing in that such a huge percentage of the major project was just Road Improvement but that's again that's the facts that we have and we do have to do the road Improvement um I understand also the argument that why go through all the road Improvement if it's going to be washed away in a in in two months but again where we are now is we need the curbs we need the the resurfaced roads um we need the pipes uh refurbished to whatever extent they need to be the ones need yeah to the extent they need to be um cleaned out uh because the drains can't work as efficiently as they might otherwise if they're filled with a bunch of Gunk and goop because I I know what's going through the drain in front of my house it just all sorts of crud is running in there all the time so I'm asking that we approve the project in in the state that we have it now let's let's get it back on the agenda let's approve it but let's agree to look at what kind of improvements there might be and also authorize that study this one that's in here yes or again we can tweak this if people have other ideas but it's a good proposal and it's a good place to start I will be more than happy to vote to approve the uh the study I saw the numbers was like 22,000 and it's actually as as Kyle mentioned a little can be a little bit less than that and if you want to address that yeah the I mean if you look at how the tasks are laid out the task one is really where we need to be um which is going to be a lot of just the investigation and feasibility of this of this proposed project um if you know it's proposed and the numbers seem like we're going to get a good benefit for the cost it's going to cause us uh it's going to cost the city then uh we would move forward with task two and actually start the design okay so again I would be willing to vote for this and approve it however you're going to have to convince him to approve the $4 million project and we'll just start on your neighborhood later because there's a possibility that it'll change so we'll just go to somewhere else and start working on the streets on somewhere else because it's I believe the project was supposed to start down here and and go that way um but if if there's a possibility of something changing we we uncover something that's going to benefit you you don't like the design it's it's down here that's impacted that's this is where the flooding occurs go north it's not like that and and uh North go north it's not that way um and so I don't really believe that plan would change at all well I have to agree with you 1,00% here okay because why rip up the street when you might have to re RP it okay never want to put the shoveling twice um and if the plan needs to be tweaked or we need to to go back and uh find out another way to to finance a a larger project in your neighborhood uh well then so be it but uh we don't know what we don't know and we've not had a study done uh that proves that anything will help uh this this are area of the uh Community uh but I think holding the rest of the city hostage uh while we try to work through this uh is a bad idea and I've I've heard it from many people already they're not happy we may find that based on certain assumptions on what happens with floods that there is no solution we may find that there's an easy one and and I just think we need that information so I would ask that we approve a study and we approve the existing Plan before we lose that pricing I agree yes Kyle how much of the current project actually involves anything to the South you know the bridge um like the the Cedar Street off paying maybe like 25% how much 25 to 30 okay that much yeah because you got Ninth Street you got Harbor and then you got Spruce palm and guys here okay yeah it's a guess okay very and how long does it take if we uh we vote to approve the project what's what's the lead time for getting started on the project oh talking to the contractor he starts right away you know as soon as we get all the paperwork in order how long uh does the project last we gave um a whole year um but that was you know factoring in bad way weather and um it sounds like he'd want to get started right away and he'd want to get it done before you know we start getting the storms from Hurricane Season so I imagine' is it possible to do the project in Reverse start on the North End and work your way backwards a check with the engineer um and talking to the contractor because I don't think we have we we'd have to request um because I think the way the bid was laid out we didn't specify that so he'd had to be an agreement okay there should be a problem and talking with him he's very reasonable change orders seems make sure I understand that what's the proposal that we reverse the order of the repairs go north to south instead of South to and the point of that is to do what in case they need to make a change because you're you're wanting a study done of are we doing it right I see what is the timing on that anybody have any idea the study or start in the middle and go back but not all the way see I I thought the reason why I say that is that this this is this is our primary streak I understand I do I feel that it's really at risk I agree but but but just so you understand Kim okay if we do the plan the way presented to you no study involved you're going to get the same results in a storm what he's proposing is put your street on hold okay which isn't going to result in no difference if a hurricane comes in or not start on the Northern end because that's all repaying which I I I'm against that that but if I can get this thing moved I'll do it because I with one inch of black blacktop is still going to come up with crashy because there's no skin code under I I don't need a lesson on on how we're wasting our money what whatever what I'm saying is and then hopefully we come back as MWI said use one or two streets start with one or two streets see if it really works see if you're happy um and then go forward see I I believe that the project will not be as different as you think it is I think there will be an addition yes uh there will be a a well uh somewhere in one of the existing pipes and the the pump will go down in there and pump it out over the seaw wall as soon as the storm water recedes below the edge of the seaw wall I get it I I understand what you're looking for what what we're trying to avoid is that if we went if construction company started here and did what they were going to do and then the studies completed and they say well here's the change and that that involves tearing up stuff that was already done yeah that would be sad yeah that was one of the question we rais you're G to rip up fresh black top one way or the other if you have to and it would have to be a core very uh carefully uh orchestrated set of events to happen because of timing because you the contractors come in and they're they say we're knocking at this whole town in a month instead of a year well you've not had enough time to get your study done what uh and then you you run into more cost because they have to stop with their doing and then you have it would be you'd have to redo the the whole contract can you live that what what was the timing of the original project as proposed nine months so we for construction when he gave a year so the contractor gets a year they could do it sooner they want to do it sooner trust me they don't want to take a year they wouldn't be done in a month Mr fluty you know he's got task one here for one month to get that's probably one to two months I'd say to get through this this first uh you know investigation of everything the utilities to ground and and kind of draw up what his idea is yeah what what I'm getting at is that if the construction project takes a year and we reverse the order and start North then we probably have six to nine months before we get to the decision point for what do we need to do here yes it's possible yeah possible and okay but Kyle's going to talk with the contractor talk the engineer the contct what's your current logistical plan because they have one that's where they're going to start and hurricane season is going to start June 1 June 1st so we got there's our six months or a little less than that now hurricanes in May yeah well if you could get this study done before started really this shouldn't take long this is I don't think it would and let's talk about that study because um as written it relates to to only one solution right or or do you read this as there's could be an assessment of any other solutions that might be there we haven't talked about other other things well I think when we've done all Stone water designed we've looked at everything always that could be done um this is specific to the pump you know because we need the invest instigate what what is what it will take what it's going to cost and what it's going to do and whose property it's going to go on and how easy it is to get easements it's like that and your street probably go in the city property the Pumped water you're talking about yeah oh yeah he's talking about we did the whole Northern end we have to wouldn't do anything on the Northern end I'm sorry southern end so do we have a deal well D if you're sincere about this I'll even vote on okay right now what kind of negotiating was that because I promise these citizens that we would get serious about getting rid of this water me I promise you I will vote to get the study done and if it's doable I will vote for that also so all right we all do that of course we all would do that okay any other discussion on item number four and thank you so much for putting that on the agenda I really appreciate thanks to all of you I just felt like there's got to be a way we can we all know we want to do this let's just find out how so thank you all okay uh now we're on the general business do we have any R is everyone ready to go home just one yes sir I'm sure this is truthful that our Deputy rescued somebody few weeks ago two weeks ago kayak over yes I heard about that think it was a cersi I was sure I heard 70 something I heard he went in the water okay I think we should give him some accomodation recognition was there only one only one deputy went in the water I heard I heard there were two I heard Deputy Robert Shaw and chief Davidson both involved I know I know Robert Shaw was that's what I heard I don't that's great yeah we should that's certificate very good news like certificate frame certificate or something like that right um would you find out sure and um we'll get it on the agenda I heard you say something like if he was 70 something are you implying that that's all old something no it's just one of the details the first thing that got rescu s he was in the 70s and actually Deputy Robin Shaw knew him he didn't know that until he get out there good is he all by the islands here or where was that side on the gulf oh really and Rob would y' swam out there and saved the guy so someone called this dispatch and then he responded and in that time I think the fire chief overheard it too responded so then they both went pretty cool and as soon as they got out there he went oh it's only two feet we deter the water was in the 50s really that's what I saying would day to I don't know why he was out there but thanks for bringing that up that we definitely need to recognize that okay well General business just there we go yes yes yes"
