seventh day of November 2022 Community motion against America Vision not for accomplishment thank you for everyone to served I greatly appreciate it next we're up to item number four we have a law enforcement report Sergeant McKnight with Pinellas County Sheriff's Department foreign the UCR property and friendship crimes there was no reports of any any crimes on this page the second place research which is highly very highly agreed usually there's one or two zero is awesome for the second page is the arrest report there were a total of four people arrested and fellow Bistro in the month of September 2022 on seven different charges and all four of those were traffic related stops the third page of the reward is the Deputy activity page there were a total of 754 events in the city of Miller Beach during the month and 879 deputies responded to the defense the final page is the crashing citation analysis there's two crashes for the month in Beller Beach and a combination of 195 citations in the mornings this year for months remember any questions Council yeah okay I guess we're all kind of willing to find out what happened in October with that massively Halloween part huh from from what we found out giving you a brief description some I mean most of the people that we've talked to have talked about that some may not know what went on sure sure so from what we found out um I I believe the address was um Bellaire Shore there's a juvenile high schooler that lives at that residence and that person invited a few friends over and like high school parties started it starts small and then other kids talk especially on social media which tends to blow things up very quickly so that it ended up being around 200 or some kids showed up for a party on the beach and their Halloween costumes and that's what the problem was with all the parking and everything else going on at the beach accesses and the side streets will that be Perez and I uh our president here and I were working that night and we came up here with about three or four other deputies and did the best we could to quickly move the kids along and get them out of here I have a question were there any arrests or tickets there were some parking citations uh issued there the exact number I do not know there were no arrests yes sir um I live on 20th Street and first of all at the command the response by the deputies and how they handled the situation I actually got a call from the neighbor across the street and said Lord you see what's going on I said you know what's going on put it on my porch and there were literally every east side of my street is far gone and hundreds of kids were walking like zombies watching their phone but it was an interesting situation to handle like I said so the 19th Street parking area was completely packed and that's where the first Deputy went and I won't give you all the details but I thought the way that that Deputy handled the initial wave that was coming through and then like deputy said there were three or four other cars that showed up and I just thought it was handled extremely professionally and they did a phenomenal job of being able to get rid of more than a couple of hundred weirdly breast people walking around the street so thank you very much any other questions or comments thank you very much I appreciate it thank you next up is Code Enforcement report okay good evening Council staff and citizens of Governor Beach Steve clacker for the record again if you look at the log that was submitted um had a very busy month mainly working a lot on some ordinances dealing with the weeds and the brush and the bushes um myself and Kyle wreckler are working diligently with commissioner Roberts on on getting most of these problems resolved Kyle and I spoke briefly before this meeting and what we're going to do is we're going to go Street by Street and we're going to start working on a lot of the complaints we don't receive too many complaints as far as the weeds that brush are concerned but we do notice a lot of or I do notice a lot of the bushes that are over the foot Mark so we are going to be working on that very diligently and trying to get that result as quickly as possible one other issue that we had last or this past month was I had checked out on a Third Street lady was having some work done unlicensed contractors and basically they were stopped work and told her we're not giving your money back we're not going to finish the job I ended up talking with the contractor she got all of her money back she got to keep the materials that they were doing for the house and they came to a nice agreement so that was actually turned over to our economic crimes division they are investigating the construction company to see if there's any past practices that they've had problems with so as that develops I will keep you all informed I had another case where a lady had put down eight thousand dollars that work done contractor never showed up made one phone call the next day she had her eight thousand dollars back and again that also went toward economic products so they're aware of that other than that I'll stand for any questions thank you nice job yes um first of all I've used no pack on you like what a class you want about 804 bar Drive uh action in our packet I don't know if you've got this primescape an evaluation of that tree um I can't direct you on these suit bag you can do an area is it I don't know if you can answer this question Mr Mayor or maybe it's a City attorney is it proper to put a motion on the floor right now to invoke section 22-31 under definitions of hazardous conditions and distances it hasn't been specifically the passions tree Provisions in that and have the deaf people go out and start studying that what I would like to do is to write that question uh to see the attorney more because he's probably a better person no no no that is not this body's job you've passed the code um separation of powers dictates that the executive branch in your form is the city manager and code enforcement inspector they are they've clearly reviewed it they've done diligence they've and however they choose to proceed is is that the city commission is not direct whether when one man our current person occurs Beyond allocating resources to it and setting the policies under the interest well it can I know the city chart in front of me but it's citizens Council cinematic without question so we also have the pleasure of the citizens and in my further reading of it we can direct the city back to council we cannot direct any of the employees under the city manager but we can give direction to the city manager and or secretary that's the way I read Detroit am I incorrect there uh no you've you certainly direct and you see the manager on a day-to-day basis your direction is to see an energy to enforce the city's code um visitors doing that has done that has confirmed me if this Council so desires to involve itself in code enforcement in the manner of delineating when and what men are particular code measures will be enforced it may do so with all the attended risks that come with involving yourself in that um in that scheme I would say ordinarily is the province of the council to say we have passed this code we have tasked you with doing with enforcing our code and um and then that's a performance issue but if I would counsel against the council or commission involving itself in particular matters um and for a number of concerns they could extend to protecting new folks not just not just the the ordinary separation of powers but also protection is important to you in in the city and and what your function I I appreciate you for attacking us but in this letter it cites about four to five pounds or this could cause a catastrophe okay so I'm going to use the word catastrophe that I'm familiar with the document well um severe risks all right so I would be more I'm more concerned with the citizens that lived around that tree than I am in this Council uh maybe overstepping his family's a little bit not not getting into code enforcement or with the city manager I really do believe emotion properly when you're telling me that ultimately this body conducts its business however wishes you're asking for my advice I give advice you don't need to um to conduct yourselves in Conformity with my advice at all times ultimately that's it's this body's design um we this city moves by the willow device can you master my advice on that given in our perspectives may not always aligned but I respect that I do in fact work for you folks and whatever you folks to direct about we will we will receive a corporate hopefully this wind storm coming doesn't take this tree down it should be going on now for months all right I'm gonna ask you a chance to consider that being said Do we have any other comments for they have a question we spoke about the economic crimes you know is it possible that they have a list of contractors that do not need the law that we can keep here at City Hall too if anybody asks we can't recommend contrary right sure show you a list of people that are operating equally right if they go under the Pinellas County Construction Licensing Board website there's a they think that's not easy for our people I write I mean is there possible to have a list here um I would I'd have to check I would say no because again it depends they would have to pull case numbers and stuff but I will tell you that going under the licensing board website is very easy and all you have to do is search contractor put the contractor's name in there and it comes up and tells you if they're active and active suspended I've showed a few people how to do that but um that would be the the best place if possible how can we like just keep the the I guess a listing up there to say here's the website if you have questions about it your contractor just go to this website and type in the name of the company yet they can do that I mean it's very easy to do I'm just saying for the citizens right you know they can't pull them out of there I think that that would be an actual topic to put on the next newsletter just to get that lean out there so that everyone has it and then I mean just about everybody in the house get our emails yes do we have any other comments thank you very much thank you everybody even YouTube all right speaking of the City attorney yes thank you Mr Mayor we'll briefly uh one of the to address a point that was raised earlier this evening at the last meeting this body gave authorize the city attorney's office to begin negotiating contract terms with Mr reefler we had exchange iterations of that contract I have provided both the initial draft and revised draft to the council with a summary of those points again I always whenever I provide a summary I just wish to reiterate The Source documents and control of the summaries there for your ease of reference so you're not enough so that process remains ongoing and ultimately once the parties reach mutually agreeable terms the Mr Aretha would present presumably we reached nutriently agreeable Insurance Mr referral we'll send it back to the office it's on my face as the beginning of previous reports I continue to remain in a daily contact with Kyle and Patty on on an array of matters otherwise I'm happy to answer your questions at this time all right what I would like to do is uh we can wrap this up there I'm assuming you're getting paid back I've not received any feedback in ultimately from the if you mean as it relates to the internal manager's contract to be manager I've not received any one-on-one feedback and since it will ultimately be a contract that the body would approve it'd be best to have that feedback provided in in the public hearing setting so that way if if members able for example gives me a number and you give me a number is just saddle is the easiest thing that I'm not trying to reconcile conflicting things I can get a consensus I don't wish to get a consensus outside of the meeting so it's my understanding that there were talks of a workshop in the coming weeks whether either next week or three weeks from now I think there's supposed to be potentially three meetings this month and one of those would be it that was when I when I briefly spoke to Kyle this morning we were talking about what that timeline would look like ultimately of course it's at this body's discretion I think that next week would be a great time any uh so so and to avoid any you know just confusion or the way that assumptions kind of filled avoid this wasn't brought in science and that you know you folks put a lot of thought into the contract that was a book for another candidate obviously those terms were very specific to that candidate but the mold was there they were you know I shaped it based on present realities in anticipating comments obviously Mr riesler framed and based in partner in his perspective as an employee and also the difference being that he is an assistant employee and so you know somebody coming in may not have a crew believe for example and how that establish that and so those sorts of elements are are in the draft of ultimately I I don't wish to get the impression that I've you know that this has been a you know Gilman's job or something some incredibly difficult task is just time and ultimately getting the input of the body of Mr Roberts I was just going to recommend at the next Workshop any other questions or comments for Mr Moore thank you very much Mr Moore Next Step RMC managers report Mr Creek Rivera thank you mayor council to start off the 12 13 day from our projects we have in our agenda item tonight possibly change over to Upward Google by Council that still has a delicious day in Jan extensions that received for the hurricane age the Gulf Boulevard undergrounding project we are still in the face of going door to door to the houses that require easements for Duke Energy I put together based on the information from utility Consultants of Florida giving more information about the projects what stage we're in with the project what was involved and a little bit about the easements that we're requesting so I apply an appointment on the website just so that may be available for people to referencing if they have questions on their company these seven Street Renovations associate program at 16th Street Seawall graduation we are more than the pathway to complete to complete that project the it still has a January completion date based on the time we getting for the project I went ahead and started soliciting bids for the fishing dock so hopefully as soon as that sequel is complete I can get that position without no recall so you know some residents are wrong uh the 17th and 18th Street star Water Project I currently have a whole and the reason for that is that we have an assistance advisory committee looking at possibly a bank loan to following five other projects all the time we're putting together a report and proposal for Council to consider um just get criminal rates are worth looking at for the future the code enforcement analysis project we just met on November 4th we pulled in all our results for the survey the team discussed analyzed the results we kind of came up with a game plan on how we want to address what we've heard from the residents uh council member Roberts and I are going to try to get something together on the November 14th session agenda so that we can get something consensus from Council on what our ideas are and then our plan is to disseminate the information back to the residents to let you know what the what we heard from them what our plan is and then if you have a follow-up time that we've talked in a year what we do the um City Hall generator I recently touched base with the company that's given me a sourceful quote based on materials labor costs our project buses increased so we budgeted I believe it was two years ago 240 000 for that project when I was looking at another so that's something I know we've talked we're talking about the improvements to Emergency Management this kind of goes hand in hand with that possibly it came to feedback because we want to spend money in the court by to pursue or if you want to read a sitter this kind of money or instead of in all their aspects of Emergency Management I think we should go back and record we can uh we can go back and recall we might be able to get something a little lower that's why we Collective forty thousand dollars yes um we did see an increase facility I can get some new fresh clothes this company specifically looking a lot lower of imaginary figured out having to verify that sometimes we get close so we sometimes I'll tell you one number and then the numbers a lot higher numbers can we explored Hawaii's hospitals businesses that have generators they will terminate them after a certain amount of years because of their insurance net caterpillar and big generator company they take them back they rework them they re-guarantee it when they were warranty important we looked at a huge generator option which would probably be about at this cost because I don't I don't see the big need for it here I mean of course the power we've ever made it but I mean it's going to work just as well as a new generator we can say you have the money it's what's the issue it's my knowledge we haven't looked at any uh you know the refurbished generators but that's something I can ask you to the main vendors if they if they knew it or if they know another social studies again because if you're coming out category or tear them down journalism here in my opinion as long as they uh okay um City Hall Sea World I am beginning uh budgetary number or quote from the current companies doing their seawalls now to see where they come in and then another company that has historically elected Christ so I'd like to make sure that our thirty thousand dollars foreign requests to get it to uh a minimal impact City traffic and the time that they may impede each other and hibiscus So currently we're at stance we have a whole production of the whole operation taking place in less than two hours in usual feel more shocked that they're going to tour it involves a a person bicycling town down the road and a band mining by taking the shots also passing maximum for 90 seconds so when they do it they're just going to do it sorry to help get their footage and be done with it we'd ask that they they originally requested I think was alignment that sounds right on the parking on the Belle Isle right away on Seawall we got them to get down to two Vans and a box truck and they asked them to pull off the road so if they're not so much traffic on it at all the express concerns of the box truck maybe you tilted too much with the equipment so then we could agree that they could drop their equipment and Parks truck in the marina but we don't get fans off of the road I spoke with him today they uh they seemed like people that were going to communicate with all of our presidents they got put tags on the doors I got one call from a resume which is inquired about what it was as soon as I explained that they were okay with it so I'm hoping that you know this goes positive so that we can sort of figure out some parameters to work with if we could get these requests in the future so that would be supportive local economy finally the I handed out that tree assessment I was able to get it completed by an independent arborist he did it on Saturday so I had to report late this weekend I just wanted to share that with you for a year to read this what is right because you know big decisions [Music] there's things we can discuss further [Music] from in talking to the arborist and how they how they do it um having people off of the private parties or property so that he had to do his assessment from the easement property um it's called a level one assessment um that's about you know they can tell you some basic information about the truly computer with us yes what I gathered was um [Music] there's a somewhat likely uh uh chance of failure but that is um giving weather typical to this area and then when it comes to Hurricane force winds the take I got from him to say any Tree in this area could potentially fail either it was Hurricane force winds so that's kind of not something that they try to actually put a number two so it's I wanted to get that report because we talked about having a report done by the city that was you know where they independent of anything else you heard um I feel like he did a pretty thorough overboard starting to get analyzed so everybody I think we think it would be beneficial to the council just to receive them what's what's next what's what's the procedure for any any creatives in this condition the way the city with us and and if we uh if we if you determine that we actually don't have a mechanism in place to deal with this and the council needs to get the work immediately and come up with an ordinance that will address these these problematic trees or a homeowner but if there's not something in place already we definitely should ask right and I for talking with people who are cities that have more aggressive ordinances to our senior attorney I currently don't believe we have enough to act based on what we could what we can analyze from about a drive-by survey of a tree we really can't dive deep into like what they call a level three analysis of a tree if it was are all really good but I think where we're at now it's going to involve a little bit more language in our code to accomplish what would make a conversation it sounds like a perfect item to add to the next work session Okay so that's questions for history yes uh under 22 31 hazardous tree shelving any tree that is injured normally diseased or dead the danger of falling or adjacent Properties or any tree that interfere with utility services creates unsafe Vision clearance for the cause and damage to the public aquariums there's utilities we've got three controlling there's at least three houses maybe four I don't know what we really need and I'm reading right from uh I think maybe in a more accessory we can compare on the city codes and sort of the language they use and steps that they take so that maybe review our code and modify it to be something that might be more successful in accomplishing their roles I understand and it's just uh the longer this weights and the more risk it is any other questions or comments yes sir yeah I think I think it's a great idea that the citizens advisory committee is going to combine those multiple projects for obvious reasons it's going to save the city money um clearly there's going to be some interest involved which is money we're going to have to pay but my I'm confident by combining those five projects a we're going to get more contractors bidding on it which has always been the safety money it's more competitive I think there's a great benefit to the citizens because instead of dragging out the construction for months and months and years possibly will all be done but he was here one time it was just a great thing also getting it done under one contract instead of stretching it out which is going to increase costing as well so great idea my question is off the top of your head you know the streets if you don't know then I'll just talk to you later but you know the streets are going to be combined clearly we've got 17 18 17 18 19 20th and then Morgan the 25th and lastly first 14th verse 16th president but we have we'll get all that together right [Music] and we have some other numbers and some other assumptions that we're making based on uh I've called some contractors that we've worked who didn't work in the area and kind of pitched it on board you know what would be a a reasonable Assumption of where we could say that we were to put these companies together and another thing I calculated is all the street surfacing to be included with each of these projects in that area based on our street index and curving but so we kind of lay down a lot we're working with this stuff is going to uh we want to get all the low numbers together but we'll have something to present to you sort of events and uh I just want to give you an update the uh we had a storm that's copying the counties reached out in one situation report so far they're uh you're going to go partner called tomorrow the storm system Nicole so we'll stay tuned uh um and then as an update for the tower we uh we did get a applications submitted I have an engineering so as we have what uh the engineers comments are on that apartment when you data application came in a week before last show as our towers that Tower was arrested where the magistrated hearing was about two months ago once again and it was there was a fine one for that for that time once we got the complete application submitted I held I held the fight for now okay if you have a question no I was I was just going to clarify the streets but the streets that are going to um try to lump into this stormwater project remaining if anyone's interested in 17 18 19 20th 9th Street 22nd 23rd Morgan and 25th 1416 Marina and Bella Island developed States we did not go as far as you have there was a national vfps in our master plan but there was one for the arena but we felt like or probably focus on now and then when we talk about building a lot of the space kind of public season was our BMP we needed to the next stage of having to take place it would be very nice to have a few years but we didn't discuss stolen water projects so I hope you're able to work it out any other questions or comments for Mr Reaper thank you very much thank you I'm seven I just have two updates one is the appeal that was made for the home to be built with three animal floors and that is how I uh Mr Wheatland Mr Moore were quote that that hearing and then the update on the satisfaction of leading for 16th Street and that we didn't receive the confirmation that it was released and released so that's complete Mr Gentry I have a question about the uh notice that there's no ownership most of them I can pay I can take you out but um I just noticed that there's no ownership of items that's something we can get turned back on in the next team here most of them I I didn't think were had a sponsor said before but definitely yes of course I appreciate it any questions or comments or okay yeah you understood what is a three weeks ago resolution um so it's already on the workshop for November 14th that agenda it's on there anyone else thank you Greg all right and we are up to item number eight which is the public here consideration of ordinance 22-04 which is a second reading Mr Moore probably Mr Mayor this is importance number 22-04 North Mississippi City Council

okay since we only have one candidate we used to do a role called hey councilmember Baker yes council member noter yes council member Roberts hi council member Shirley I'm sorry yes vice mayor Shirley aye mayor Dallas hi so the passages endlessly and congratulations at World item 13. consideration of change to order options on the 12th Street 13th Street in Bayview Drive stormwater project do I have a motion to proceed ocean motion made by Frank Baker do I have a second second by Elizabeth material Mr reefer would you like to explain this to us Okay so we all started uh under the correct paragraph there is a pipe we discovered I mentioned it to calculations ago it was a 15 inch elliptical RCP pipe that was discovered that was not indicated survey or previous engineering plans with the design stuff the sensed the discovery on this plate determined that there were two other students that it's directly underneath the curve on the north side of 12th Street and there's only so much room to work with the camera that pipe and I sent the link to each of the council show the tradition that I can find that we've discovered what it looked like inside so the engineer has come up with two possible options you can do in the situation object one involves removing the controlled linear feet of the existing 15 inch RCT that involves a cost of 3468 and you know part optional regard to install a 12 inch c900 PDC for the estimated cost of 14 000. or fourteen thousand forty dollars uh so that would be the total total estimated cost of seventeen thousand five hundred eight dollars the other option is to solely just remove the pipe and if you have a place uh the engineer uh dual Associates which is a novel under 70 Incorporated their recommendation was achieved to do option one and to remove the bike or replace it with the tape which would be the 12 inch point I mean that is sort of the I do have the engineered animal carrier who made the recommendation or his his tournaments and he's here to answer questions uh specifically looking Focus representation and then I put together the numbers that were added in the project this can be paid for on the 10 percent contingency budget would be applied for the project current American tendency balance is 44 297 project do not participate unless we're going to continue to see budget but that it cannot be guarantined because allowance service lines so that's kind of where we're at like I said Mr carrier is here to answer any questions you have and I included the approximate Pike location that was Far easier to see a professional document but uh the rules of recommendation for this for this uh countries and then the two proposals that are presented by the Construction Company all right sir would you mind giving us your name again I don't know carrier with uh Stephanie incorporator we were dueling Associates and um were purchased by Sethi back in March of this past year we did notice the um the dueling Associates at the time took over the project from your your former engineering firm um kind of Midstream the survey had already been done by a local surveyor and he did not pick up the extra pipe that was in the ground the system drains through What's called the CDs unit and you guys like pulled a permit from Swift Mud I think about 20 years ago when we reevaluated the system we're looking at getting rid of the CDs unit but there was still some life to the I guess you received some great dollars at the time from swiftwood and there's still some life left in that CDs unit so we the districts with mud would not allow us to remove it um all the plans that we had seen did not show that extra pipe it's a parallel pipe to the CDs unit that takes water off in the sea wall when we discovered the extra pipe um we didn't want to we didn't want to go through a process of removing the pipe and finding out that the system didn't have the capacity to take all the water through the CBS here so looking at it we're thinking it's there for a reason let's not upset the apple cart we're just going to leave the pipe or the Integrity of the pipe conveys through the pipe let's leave it there and leave it attack the existing pipe I believe you all looked at it as Kyle mentioned it's some pretty core shape it's got a lot of cracking you can see the the joints are displaced slightly and then um there's rebar showing through the pipe when the pipe was actually set years ago they used to call lift holes they would leave a little pocket of concrete out from the top of the pipe expose the rebar and they've used that to grab the pipe and locate it and then using a contractor would come back and patch that pipe that hole almost all those other souls are either deteriorated or getting ready to fall in and so it's our recommendation to go ahead and remove the pipe um we're downsizing it slightly to a 12 inch pipe the pipe that's in the ground is an elliptical pipe and there's only about four inches of cover which is probably another reason why the pipe's cracking there's not enough bedding on top of the pipe to um securely um protect the pipe from traffic the curve that it does go on there's only about four inches in the thickness or typically it's between seven and nine so our recommendation let's let's put a new pipe into c900 pipe it's a 12 inch bike it'll give us add-on cover over the pipe that we're composing and we'll still have that conveyance that the secondary routing for the water if needed thank you uh questions from the council yes sir um you're going to remove concrete and put a PVC pipe in there c94 C9 and you're only going to have four inches of a overlay on top no the reason why we're putting the 12 inch c900 like this because the existing pipe only had four inches of cover with the c900 we'll have about eight and a half inches of cover because you have three inches of outside diameter all the time plus plus the belt okay and um here's a strange question why can't we use C9 plate for total range you can but it's expensive it's a more expensive option to just using concrete layer it's more expensive than that yes It's Brazil yeah I noticed uh going through the estimates price does not include palm tree removal and replacement I'll be looking at Entre foreign [Music] deflection device so what the Stormer gets in there and Spins and the solids remove themselves from the flow screen and settle into the bottom of this song that creates what they call head loss right so it takes energy to to remove that those particles out of that so much screen the system is so shallow and so flat that I believe that during bigger soberheads it's going to back the water up into the into the streets Upstream of that um cdsu what makes me kind of think maybe that secondary pipe was there for a reason maybe it was part of the original design maybe as an afterthought because it's not on the original planes but somebody might have gone out there and put that in at the same time thinking going out of issues they might have saw the issues during the construction I don't know it's just my gut it's just from what I've seen from experience so in your opinion removing it entirely it may be a safer path into leaving it as it is you don't want to leave that interesting pipe there you can be putting in new curbs new asphalt I don't know what the life left is in that pipe with construction activity around it there's obviously more damage that's being done to it heavy equipment going over and not being impacted on all sides it's been exposed so my suggestion is get rid of the old pipe put it into the pipe and even if it was plugged eventually the street would start it will start sagging is that right you could you could plug it typically um my recommendation was never leave a pipe in the street even if it never abandoned it we always flow we'll fill it we can't remove it so that is an option um not my recommendation my recommendations get it out of there and put a new Piper because you're seeing a lot of my belief is you will do that it's like I don't know you I don't know your qualifications sure briefly go over them um graduated from University of South Florida been in the business almost 30 years now I'm a registered professional engineer in the State of Florida I'm also a registered Lancer here in the State of Florida um purchased dual Associates from Secret duel back in 2006 and we recently just sold the company back in March I've worked for the city of Clearwater for almost 10 years I was an assistant director of engineering oversized stormwater and Environmental Management section um I was with a couple of private firms before that with Hillsborough County for a short step um honestly I didn't like the drive so I left Hillsborough County went to Clearwater and then was at Clearwater years and then at the Dual Association since 2006. okay CRP is still current yes okay before I go to the citizens any other comments yes well last time we talked a little bit about the possibility of errors in emissions Insurance did anybody get an opportunity to speak with anybody about that I spoke with the City attorney based on what happened the way the contract was transferred it didn't seem like it would fall under that comparison issues so you guys stand there as an emissions Insurance yes did you have an opportunity to talk with the insurance company but it wouldn't in my opinion it wouldn't qualify for errors and Emissions the error wasn't done on behalf of our work our expertise it was um the pipe wasn't seen by the surveyor we relied on that information there was no atlases you guys didn't have any atlases of what was in the ground at the time we did just hadn't discovered their infrastructure is that something you could take a moment and contact your insurance company and see what they say sure what would you be looking for I'll be looking for the insurance company to cover the costs of course we have to do now because they want to wear that again in my experience um just because the pipe wasn't there or wasn't seen in the Forefront um even it was okay let's go back if it was seen we would recommend that you remove or replace it so you would have occurred that cost anyway um this isn't something that's above and beyond and I don't want to talk them you know the fact that this is a change order you're saying you don't think the change over the cause had this been inclusive of the original contract bid your your feelings would be the exact same cost then as it is now no for what I understand what you're getting at now if it was on the plans originally then the cost would have been more in line with the other prices that are on the on the bid sheet at the original time of of um so what we would want to pursue then would be the Delta so if you were able to say is five dollars initially and now it's now it's eight because it's a change order because we didn't know about it and we like three dollars back and to the extent legal was asked to confirm with the city manager on this my insight wasn't that it's impossible pursue those sorts of things under certain circumstances it was factually understanding that and as I understood and explained here as well the engineer that we were speaking assumed the Project based on products based on work performed by a different company the different entity that surveyed Affairs and so their insured is unlikely to ensure the work of a third party and so worthy to pursue that it's not that I couldn't possibly never be pursued we'd be pursuing it against another entity and then the resources expended in that regard to identify pursue and potentially make legal claims against that was not at least as we initially discussed it not where we thought the resources were best to identify that form or former form of surveyor whose work was done submit a claim to them have been pursued it the amount of resources allocated to that was not seen as approaches to cost about analysis of that time well we can sometimes let me know with insurance companies and we all love them which we um you know you you filed with your insurance company typically they didn't say well that's not our deal they would go after the other insurance company we don't care who they go after just as long as we get something like that I swear I think the bottom line is how many hours would it take your your professors matter if you had a good report I didn't quantify if it was in excess of right just going forward with my initial impression in speaking with a manager so the question is yes thank you Mr Karen for providing all this information I don't I don't know how anyone can have any liability when the city itself doesn't have to go around there's there lies the problem um I've been in your shoes many times trying to construct something with no documentation from the city and it always comes back on the contractor and uh you know there's there's no way to foresee this um but my question is along the lines with Kyle we've got the money in a contingency fund already we haven't we still have remaining 20 27 000 in that fund um does that budget also include our Paving and have we gotten others for painting to complete [Applause] [Music] storm system running as it was more efficiently with a smaller pipe possibly and so we still have nearly twenty seven thousand dollars sitting there for other errors other we should have uncovered anything else that might come up at this point would you agree Mr Perry anything else at least on the one side there's a major increase in the price of something right right so that the north side of the project with the contractor has gone up has verified survey we had submissions with the survey on the South Side the invert elevations or the inverts the elevations of the pipes and the inlets and stuff were a little bit different um the contractors get different information about what's actually done in the server we went back and we checked um I just found out from TNR construction inspector this afternoon that she got verification that the information they got from the contract was doing their survey is pretty consistent with what the server has there's a little there's a few nuances little differences but it looks like it's something we can deal with and you have a little more fall if you will on that side of this the street so we have a little more play to get the pipes in the ground if we've come across some conflicts um but we're not we're not anticipating another concept like this any other questions for Mr carrier so the uh we had the next video right so in my mind I'm having a difficulty understanding whatever the dude is riding around inside the place out in the world they have not seen the other time so we had to go in on 12th Street they were only able to get into manholes on the south side of the street okay and then look at the cross pipes they were so false sounded they couldn't get over that way they couldn't pull the rates on the north side of the street because they were afraid that they were just probable and we weren't at that point yet where we were removing the boxes of structure so that's pretty much all the package so the the video equipment never actually win that area they never now and and to their knowledge they thought that it was only crosswise so they looked down in each of those pipes okay they saw the settlement that they never they didn't want to go down into place and spawned hard okay all right we've heard Mr carrier's opinion is recommendation Mr what is your recommendation I support the engineers decision all right before we get to it but we need to take this to the citizens would anyone like to comment on this so all right I'm going to come back here for the last four years I agree uh I went out and looked at that job before being the third and some of these call virtual collapse I mean you couldn't even see that it was just full of debris uh foreign all right so apparently what we're going to do is we're going to take a roll call vote and the council you're going to have to vote for option one which is a complete removal and replacement I have 17 580.18 or option two a legit removal only at the cost of 3 468.18 okay please follow council member Baker one council member Notaro option one council member Roberts um council member Sable option one vice mayor Shirley option one mayor goddess option one so option one I had six votes option two has done is to refer to your authorized to proceed with option number one thank you thank you very much all right we're on to number 14. let's do authorizing interim city manager to execute assignment and assumption agreement with Novation before we begin do I have a motion to authorize that material do I have a second second second by Frank Baker Mr Reaper so uh this this uh execution of the assignment was uh based on the fact that uh transitive corporations recent recent purchase at the engineering and Construction Incorporated this is very similar to what happened semi engineering purchase and Google Associates in 2000 26 years earlier this year the original engineering service agreement was as early as our students September 6 2019 foreign to go on a paper on November 16th which is Wednesday thank you Mr Rayford next time you speak you might be a little closer yeah all right the motion was made by the Legislative would you like to open this discussion um [Music] technicality thank you any other comments from the counselor I was here to the citizens foreign [Music] example concerns and Senator Roberts all right I'll put this one again with the help of pain the procedure document you have in front of you is pretty much the same format that was used the last time there was a vacancy of the field Council has a right to select a replacement member just about any way we see fit two so long as we get real method I'm asking for approval of this method to be used on the November on November 28th and every week left a replacement council member for the vice America well we've already we've made the motion to approve it and now we're just going to have a little discussion about it because everyone on the same page as a technical matter Mr Mayor we made the motion to happen to start placing that one table for discussion the member Baker is moving to approve the produced movements right I apologize there's a motion on the table to to approve this we have a second necessary I'll give that to Lloyd Roberts I think we'll be just doing all in favor all in favor of apologies you're right you're right I'm sorry kind of got a little weird citizens yes sir John Hanson 22nd Street I'm a little confused if you already have a procedure of replacing and appointing a city council member why does it even have to be discussed again if it's a valid standing instruction or policy procedure in a currency look I don't understand why you're even having to have a discussion with both of them Eric I think I can if you might be my guess the your Charter sets forth at the city council the city council has the ability to determine how it will fill an agency under arrest Administration they selected a policy during a precise vacancy it was not established by sustaining policy it's not qualified as a resolution of an ordinance that composition of the council having changed this council is well within its discretion to determine how it wishes to proceed you've said you've recognized that there was nothing that was problematic for your purposes about that procedure and we wish to endorse it for this instance but it was not a standard qualified policy in your ordinance's resolution it was an informal series of documents adopted by our previous Council to proceed and go for it again so had you folks decided by way an example that you just wish to do it by drawing Lots or taking uh you know picking names out of a hat and ignoring their prior proceeding you could have done as much as well on the fact that you that the policy influences early in your distress of course and here's it for me too I mean I was just a little confused about how it went and learned something tonight thank you thank you okay so we uh I'm a little confused about the procedure here because we have a motion to approve the procedure that then we moved right over to [Music] it's actually it's it's and forgive me I'm doing a lot of lecturing on parliamentary procedure there do not speaking any like traveling and speaking and educating um the way you folks operate as a body you move to discuss something in the first place which is perfectly valid within reference rules in a way to do things so you place it on the proverbial table for discussion this kind of came up with a transition here where you guys should say motion so you said we're writing about this issue motion second and what you're saying is we agree that we still want to take this up because it has happened in my tenure here where you get to an item and it dies to the lack of emotion saying which is functional in the body saying we don't even want to talk about this much less decide on a propose solution so what you've done is the original motion was we want to talk about this and then you say okay now that we're talking about it I come up with a proposed procedure that I think works and then a member maker said yeah me too so I'm going to move to just use this method and so it went from a discussion to a proposed solution um and so that the motion on the floor as it stands now is to endorse the solution you brought forward all right so we had a motion to approve the method uh Frank Becker if we have a second any opposed all right we've got a plan here and we will uh we'll take care of this on the 28th is in a special city council meeting that will be a special city council meeting there again I'm sorry date again uh November the 28th it is the last Monday before our regular passing week because of Mr Roberts um so Patty is that the day will that be the first day that we receive the names and the resumes or we get that ahead of time foreign [Music] this month we're going to make it for the last month we're going to make it for this month with special meetings and work sessions but we'll get caught back up I don't really think we're that far behind I think we're [Music] all right then what we're talking about yeah can you just talk with her and tell us because generally it's all on the last page okay so next Monday is our work session and then we won't have another one until the 28th which is a special council meeting whenever we elect uh replacement correct yes all right I am 17. Council comments I had so much fun letting the computer generate a random order last month and did it again so uh this month we start off with council member Roberts you have the floor don't mind so just um kind of a numerous comment here that again going back to that in the Saturday night prior to Halloween one of the deputies who was to me because he was over there's too many people in the parking lot on 19th Street and of course many of the youngsters these days don't seem to have been I'm starting to say have you been raised properly and so one guy came up with a police officer and said um and I'm going on the beach and the deputy said nobody's going on the beach we're shutting this down party's over go home at which point the young man said hey I'm on my ways I'd go on the beach and I was going to walk past you and our work with deputy said uh say that again it was point the young man but otherwise and turned around with his friend and they left so again I just want to praise the deputies that were out there that night I'm not sure how I would have responded it was just overwhelming you see I don't know how many people would have seen like three to four hundred people just walking around there that we've been out of control and it was within 30 minutes they were all wrong I think it's a safety item a year ago this Council voted six to one to for the few buoys in the Ballard Shores approved from my first first degree to 17th 17th Street Dollar Stores um wondering if this Council will do that now because I went over the total dollar Shores or the Mariners are very gracious about an offer when he wanted to wait until after the election the elections which is March Council would be willing to do the same if they were looking at the school I'm going to respond to that because I think that I may have picked up on I may have makeup and I remember whatever you presented it and I think that they were more worried about making Cherokee they said it's once there's a buoy out there it's no longer and so this Council would have to I believe to get and to agree to that if they were able to do it at all would be to agree to to assume I mean I said I'll keep all those movies also we have we actually still have it in your local agreement and installing from about first year to quarters to happen and we will always be sitting at stolen maintaining replacement and I just think that the people from First Street and 20th Street deserve the same protection of the funny Street did of course there's another something else to consider on that also they wouldn't have to go through the same permitting process they will have to yes there is a point of order we shouldn't be discussing this during Council covenants that this should be reserved as a known for working session I'm good for that when it comes would you like me anymore thanks to all the ventures uh the elections today I remember the one Senator saying about staying for the national anthem come over to Arlington Cemetery I'll see 400 000 reasons why she's staying thank you Mr Sable okay um on that topic I just want to go up there and ask Chief happy Veterans Day people kind of tend to forget that there's Memorial Day and that's for our quality Veterans Day for all those guys that look around I also want to point out he recently uh was elected to a national office for the naval Reserve Association so investor congratulations until I know thank you pleasantly material vice mayor Shirley just once again to thank everyone for attending the meetings we really appreciate participating we definitely appreciate what our citizens are doing rallying together and stepping out to serve on four for the same house or the city staff thank you thank you I'd like to remind everyone our next four sessions on Monday November the 14th I'd also like to remind everyone that the park and rec board is hosting a chili cook-off on Saturday November the 19th between noon and 2PM I wasn't kidding whenever I said I would bring my chili however I will only be there to uh as a as an exhibit not as a competitive that I will be serving too in that day to check the interview as an exhibit yeah let's see here November 28th we'll have a special counseling meeting to elect the council member to replace bling guy if you haven't applied and want to you do it by Wednesday is that correct Patty yes bye-bye all right and uh also we're expecting another storm I'd be lucky Ian but still they're predicting possible 50 mile per hour guys inside [Music] I'd like to thank everyone for joining us tonight and uh do I have a relationship to return motion yes just one more thank you for the parks and rec committee I don't know how many people there had a chance to attend but it was on the Halloween costume for the youngsters and the dogs as well I thought they did a great job and the judges were extremely intelligent had a lot of wisdomen as a result of avoiding the first prize for my granddaughter so it was a great time thank you do I have a motion to return groceries motion made by Frank Baker do I have a second [Music]"
