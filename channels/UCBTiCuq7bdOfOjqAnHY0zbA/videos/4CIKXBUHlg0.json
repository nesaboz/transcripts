    "transcript": "good evening everyone it's now 6 P.M Monday August 21st 2023 and the Bellaire Beach city council work session will now come to order uh let's do the Pledge of Allegiance please stands one nation under God in this world thank you Eric but you were pleased to call the office council member Frank Banker council member Belinda Livingstone present councilmember Leslie notero here council member Lloyd Roberts yeah vice mayor Jody Shirley here mayor Dave goddess city manager Kyle wiesler here City attorney Randy Moore president and councilmember Mike saber was unable to attend thank you Patty well let's just move right on into agenda item number one which is to review the storm water Improvement project plans uh I believe we have a presentation by Gemini engineering and Sciences Incorporated uh just uh so everyone knows this agenda item was uh was placed by city manager reefler yes sir okay thank you I'm Larry flitty I'm engineer with Gemini and with me tonight I haven't introduced themselves but I have Barbara and Justina and now they're they're engineers and they actually are the ones that put plans together and so between the three of us we've got uh the answers and what we're providing and then of course what comes out tonight we'll be able to continue and and prepare bid documents okay well uh starting out I will review the plans and then answer any questions you might have and then we can go into what we think a construction costs we can go through that and get two so everybody should have us set in front of them I think he's going to pull it up on the screen did you bring a magnifying glass for you beautiful thank you well the uh start off at 9th Street and uh on that project Street we're proposing to uh mail and repave with sheet is that on yeah it's about four or five in there T1 got it right okay okay sorry let's see page numbers yeah I've seen one all right where every time everybody time to get there there we go everybody good yeah we have the uh president when I'm on the computer screen so anyway I'm on the street the uh the project is to [Music] um uh from uh demonstrate the harbor and then up even more cul-de-sacing um by the uh the by the building and uh so I'm not uh looks good so we'll be keeping with that replacing the code and the project what we're doing is cul-de-sac or the elbow where we've been in north on uh on Harbor Drive he uh we're preparing that comes to put some inlets on there and and also further up to the public I will be doing some improvements but what's happened here is the reason the waters bombing up so high on particularly on high tide and Rain events is this area that I'm circling is a low area so the street comes down to this point in each Direction so we got flow coming in both directions and in it's puddling there so what what our plan is is try to capture the water before it gets there and allow water to overflow particularly when the tides up so much you know kind of get a Surface overflow uh to to an outlet at the um actually hit the pond down here where it uh discharges out to a little swell but not a little slow but the pilot there I'll go to the next sheet and you can you can see that we're proposing too many limits here that's we're existing now from the for the pond so these these inlets right now may water is captured on that road so we'll be able to capture before it gets down to Ninth Street and the uh what I've also seeing it during the survey you know the inlet I don't know what the the inlet that's up at this cul-de-sac here it's full of silk sand and so it's not working properly so part of the work we'll be clearing that and cleaning the discharge out so that the water that's accumulating at the [Music] 9th Street uh will put uh some inlets there so this will take care of getting uh that's that can discharge when they say flows it comes to his point but he has a way out now divide and I'm not as well so since this is so that's that's the what we're proposing meaning at a curb inlet that doesn't have you know it's just kind of clothes over the top we'll put in a great top you know there's silver circle square can get to it and can get into the pipe system and do start job I think that would be pretty much the the items that we can uh take care of buying doing uh rewriting of this cul-de-sac three with demand and raising it but that would be that would be pretty prohibitive and we figured this this I think will will help I think the intercept the water and then alluvio what's happening down here when when the tides up it rains I think that would be a better benefit that it was now yeah looks like on that top plan view that you have up there as well as the bottom one there's some additional information on your your drawing that we have the shading that I don't know what that represents I can't see it from here but but clearly that top so you're still on scene one right yeah okay looks like there's some additional information some drawing differential there okay and then what we have yeah but it looks like driveways or uh pavers are going on and uh on YouTube that's that's the first thing that we noted okay um it's probably the way that it printed versus versus uh working with renders and trying to get this out uh you know when you want something done you know I would I understand but it's there we will make sure on the web on the PBS of the plans that that we give out and print them out okay that all of that is is clear okay so I was uh I was listening obviously you're adding several inlets how many total are you adding we're adding one two three four four okay and uh how many are in ninth we got one two two okay all right that's fair we should have had all this time and we in the history of a city we've never had a proposal like that so okay uh if Frank yeah um you're talking about raising the grade on the uh I call it the spoon um right now born high tide bad rain that water actually floods from 7th 8th through the um easement into 9th Street because the of the pitch um so you couldn't really raise that because I think you'd be pushing more water back into 8th and 7th Street um we're putting as you said two more inlets in yeah what are they going to really do if the order is already backed up trying to get the water that's in the low spot out as quickly as we can I understand it but if it's high tide you can put yeah you could put 20 in oh yes yeah yeah is there any threat process of putting like a catch Basin and a pump in there you could put a neoprene tank in there and what I'm saying is some you're talking about a below grade thing yes yeah what I'm saying is these Popes are 75 years old probably I mean um yeah and the system don't ever really worked 75 years ago right and concrete has life expectancy of 75 years and then starts deteriorating and that's not counting the saltwater contamination if anything's broken you realize there's pipes out there that are 125 years farming Corps of Engineers supports that number just so you know I understand that I mean I've got tree trunks in Philadelphia that were still being used 10 years or 20 years ago being powered out but what I'm saying is when a yeah stormwater pipe is in there and especially silver it contaminates faster and if it's ever if the pool's ever broken the rebarb even contaminates scriptures but what I'm saying is if we're going to replace a system that really doesn't work have we looked at a system I'm not playing on every street maybe we should do a prototype of 9th Street you know right yeah okay well you know that's the thing that's really been kind of bugging me is that this is you know dating back you know trying to what can we do you know with the water and and because of the tide and that it's low and uh and adding in another Inlet I can see I mean what good is that going to do if we still if we still have the same problem and I think you know looking at I'll look at the below grade what what additional storage would do but really what needs to be done is that bottom that cul-de-sac that needs to come up so is there a way we can raise that enough to where it's not doing any interference with the existing driveways and and still get it in there that's right you raise that then you have another problem down the road yeah I mean yeah well we don't want to create another problem but what would that would that work if it works then what's it going to cost and how do we Implement that and uh I would I would say that would be more uh advantageous to look at than putting in another Inlet so I I agree with you there I don't know about an underground tank I'd have to look closer to that how can we make that work has your firm ever done pumps underground catches yes yes the uh so that that needs to be taken look at and we'll we'll get back and let you know okay okay let me ask you one more question about just this particular Street um but obviously whenever you look at it you were trying to you design something that was cost effective uh would would Aid with the problem right uh you can't solve it all because we are right next to the ocean but um did you take into consideration what happens to the other neighborhoods like Frank mentioned that that you could create a problem that you just send it somewhere else okay you fix this problem it's not flooding anymore but now somebody else's house is now actually underwater yes okay the uh that's really Our concern when we don't have the two callers or push the ball down the road on the problem we need to take care of the problem and that's the answer I was looking for I just wanted a little bit of verification sure all right other questions about uh Ninth Street on 9th Street has already been a time in the recent history where we where we did replace the pipes no pipes have not been out but we're not recommending to change any of the pipes on 9th Street right now no why is that because they're all in good condition at this point yeah they're in good condition and they uh their capacity is what's needed and so they're not under capacity so we already videoed all the pipes on 9th Street we have I think I know on the outside at the uh at the outfall you know there's a bunch of uh Barnacles and it needs to be cleaned up but I had to check to see if we got the video I can't recall nine straight up from the top of my head if we have it the reason why he's bringing that up is because we did a project on 12th and 13th Street yeah found out that we had big problems yeah and uh and it was uh dramatically higher more expensive than what we anticipated uh but if it solves the problem then we consider it worth it so we just want to make sure that if they're uh if you're recommending not replacing the pipes that they have been thoroughly inspected and we have nothing there's nothing to worry about right right how old are the parks do you know they're quite old I mean they're these pipes down here I think the construction plans are like late 60s early 70s so basically in the early 60s and I'm falling apart yeah hell do you have anything you want to add on this one um yeah but I'll get you there and and I think uh certainly we'll we'll take a look at the what we know in videos of Seventh Street make sure that the pipe is okay and that if it needs to be replaced and then we'll make that recommendation yeah and we did look at um the possibility of trying to increase the size but what thing is coming with the elevations is this uh piece of pipe that runs from the West western side of 9th Street down to the cul-de-sac area is is very very flat so there's very there's not much room um to put anything larger in there right um because we were talking about the head pressure on the valve itself and trying to make sure that emptied out and you know and we did determine that one of the most crucial things on the in this location in this system is that that valve just continues to work because if you look at some of the elevations right down in the cul-de-sac they're like two feet in change um which is extremely low um so it doesn't take very much for the tide to come back and and start filling that area with water right um another thing I don't think was mentioned was that we are trying to install a check valve at the of the Swale because we have noticed over time that the retention Pond fills from this whale and then backs up into Cedar and uh spruce so bad is on the plans as well so that's over here okay that is the swell right right over there and it runs into that system any more questions right in here you're talking about what is he pointing what's up no he was saying right in here he was pointing I think yes um just some just some general statements um so when we did videoing previously nobody came out here they videoed they gave us their product they gave us was the results of the videoing I would feel a lot more comfortable if they gave us a report that basically said this is what we found a written report and here's our recommendation because I still believe the expenditures that we went through on 12th and 13th Street uh did not need to be as high as they were probably more familiar than I am with repairs that can be done to the joints right if you have gasket failures there are companies out there that specialize in that I don't know how many you guys and ladies went out there and took a look I looked at the pipe that was pulled out of the ground it looked great to me most of it from 12 and 13. I looked a lot of that in a lot of bells were broken well they broke them of course the video from Supply us again with a written report saying this is what we found at X distance and at the end of it here's what we recommend with respect to either replacing pipe or repairing the pipe because clearly if we can get by with a significant decrease in expenditures to repair the pipes if there's some you know gasket failures out there there are companies that specialize in that they come around with the inside and the outside uh you're probably familiar with those I would hope would they take care of those as long as the pipe is structurally sound and from what I saw the pipe we took out on 12th and 13th structurally sound most of it so you know again all you need is a little bit of a gasket failure at the joint and the sediment starts pouring in there and if it's underneath the road you're going to have a big pothole sinkage area things like that and people think well the pipe must have collapsed no not necessarily it could be a simple gasket failure that could have been replaced from the inside and the outside the pipe was structurally sound saves the city a lot of money if it can last another 50 or 60 years that's a long time yeah I think you know in reviewing the videos uh we got a pipe that are you know really encrusted with Barnacles and some look pretty good and not a whole lot of cleanliness that would be helpful for us uh we're gonna I'm gonna kind of get us through this your presentation sure what might be helpful is if you have video recordings of every street that we discuss it'd be nice to put them someplace to where we can actually just take a look because normally you'll see there's you know the they've that little diagrams up there oh here's a problem here's a failure here's a crack here's the same message um and then that way whenever we're voting on this then we know whether we need to it the council will have more information and really you don't know what you don't know it's just going on on what you're saying but um this Council likes to see things sometimes oh yeah no I I don't blame you the uh you know we have videos but we don't have them on all the streets so we have to look at that and and do that and I I would feel much much better if I could see what it is that we're doing if it's in good shape and we don't have to do a lot then let's just see what's necessary uh if it's if it's in there and it's good that's that's great and we've got ways of fixing those and and uh besides slip lining that the internal uh bands and and jackets and then you can externally if there's access and not a lot of vegetation go down and grout some polymers to kind of uh close that seal as well so yep okay thank you all right any other comments on 9th Street am I good all right please continue sir okay thank you well the the other next uh group of three streets we'll show you is uh the ones that are uh behind here so there's uh Cedar and uh Spruce and uh Palm and in those streets these three streets which are on sheets read the number but they're the next is what those three sheets were Mill and uh and replacing the curve so there's no drainage uh needed but uh that's that's the primary job for those three sheets right okay any questions about the those three yeah and I know they do have some backflow problems Kyle you probably know better than I do from maybe citizens contacting you when I first came on board there was a gentleman that called me and again high tide boom comes back this way and goes to the pond and then backs up and I don't even know what street it was I think it was probably Cedar probably yeah um and then the water comes up into that cul-de-sac and just sits there of course and through the my tie goes down and then it comes back out again okay so obviously we don't have um you know a concrete outfall there that we can put a check valve on there right or yes well I was talking about with the check valve so it all runs through the same system um it didn't prove when we dredged out that Retention Ponds okay um but having a check valve at the outfall as well beautiful okay they're all draining into that swamp into the retention Pond behind the tennis courts yeah going high tide to check that I would stop that yes and that's the one over on the 9th Street system right okay any other questions or comments this is pretty straightforward yep all right the next sheet uh we'll start on 14th and 13th we're uh well and uh repaid along with the curb and leaving uh the uh we're leaving the inlets and uh and the pipe Theirs to remain the pipes where I'm sorry the pipe the the existing pipe though those are those seem to be okay but we're going to verify that okay and uh so those those pipes and those inlets uh will will leave those in place and mainly it's it's million repave all right well Kyle have there been any uh any questions or comments or discussions about the uh the center of the cul-de-sac I know that this comes up from time to time and I didn't know if their the residents had a problem with the uh the median whatever you want to call the little island in the cul-de-sac um you know occasionally that does come up yeah we had that on Henderson I remember we kind of came up with a solution um not on any of these from 13th to 18th have I heard any issue or the only thing that was asked um which we've done on 15th is um kind of cleaned it up put some more drop drought tolerant plants in there and and some rocks to try to prevent um certain trucks from trying to drive is it a general thought we want to keep this thing or or have you do we even know I I haven't heard of one way or the other but it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to ask the residents in that cul-de-sac if they still want it or not because if we're doing this now is the time to change it is that correct yes so um uh thoughts on that expensive but you think it'd be way more expensive or would it just be a little more expensive it's not huge is it why would you want to move remove it well that every time that we have this conversation there's always someone who gets shafted with their driveway I don't know if I don't know what it what it's like here what happened over on Harrison was the driveway was uphill and big trucks would come in and they can't make it around this feature okay and so what happens is they get so far and then they back up and and they and their bumper hits the driveway now that may not be the case here but I it could very well be that there's no issue at all but I think if we're as long as we're doing this and we're going to turn it all up anyway let's uh let's make sure that they're really happy with it if we don't need it then that just makes it makes it easier in the future mayor it's Jody can I say something yes why would we create an issue that's not an issue right now I mean it's not part of our strategic plan is beautification and uh Paving over landscape areas I don't think is part of our strategic plan and if no one's bringing the issue up why would we yeah you're probably right um wasn't there a resonate I'm not sure what street he was complaining exactly what you said um yeah it's Harrison that's Harrison now I thought it was another one see I I uh I agree with the beauty um but um but it's probably not a bad idea to at least ride down these neighborhoods that have this and just look at their driveway and see if it's chewed up and if it's not just don't worry about it and move on but um I actually had a couple of residents that were um a slight bickering over one of these features in uh city manager reefer remembers that problem um again I'm probably just overthinking it but we might as well at least look at it and make sure that there's we don't see evidence of trucks backing up and running all over their curb as a traffic calming device when you're driving down that road you know it it slows you down which is a good thing you know so you have to slow down to go around that turn if there's nothing there I mean I could see me just doing all sorts of crazy things coming around I come to do that anyway but you can't I mean I've gone down to the streets many many times and because that um item is there whatever you want to call it you you slow down you definitely slow down as you're going around that Circle that cul-de-sac and you come out the other hand you know the biggest trucks that we um continually have are the garbage trucks um I I guess they must get around that thing fine garbage trucks too far okay because they put a little more care it's usually the trucks that aren't there every day uh that um are the ones driving over it's Construction Construction doesn't happen often construction trucks right I mean all this stuff's built out I'm sure there's some things that go on with somebody is paying for some work done in their garage or something that could have a larger vehicle there but for the most part is the garbage trucks and just like you said they they're careful they go around that and there's no issues and I get what you're saying Dave every once in a while there might be a construction it's just a matter of riding by there and and deciding whether it's really a problem or something we want to discuss further and uh thank you Mr Livingstone uh for um your point of view Also may I add one more thing it's Jody actually but um the resident at the end of Harrison that fought to keep the landscape Highland was fearful of people driving straight into her driveway because the road ends into her driveway so it does although it might solve some potential issue for a truck turn around it does give people direct access into those driveways at the end of the cul-de-sac just something to think about when we're looking at it that's true and the uh the solution we came out with on your street was to actually just reduce the size a little bit to give trucks a little more room to make that turn around was good this could be better anything else on the street oh all right please continue sir okay 15th Street just a quick note on 14th Street that the from the north out to a sea wall um is lined with the Cure in place so that right that has been repaired as gonna hold up well for a long time and then the nice thing about the Karen place is we don't see the Barnacles accumulating on the plastic as as fast as they do on the concrete so how long ago was that done that was done in 2000 is it the 18 or 19. pretty soon and we have a video of that as well thank you okay okay now on the 15th okay 15th Street on 15th uh again we're we're milling and and repainting and uh from the main road down to the cul-de-sac all right and here we're proposing clean Barnacles uh out of the pipes and leaving the existing pipe in as is because uh and uh and then the existing inlets those will be remaining in place as well okay so this this is primarily a military pay and we talked about each in my on on these streets and the ones they're in good condition and there's not any signs of uh of flow issues so that's the reason we didn't feel that it was necessary to change it to the great style Inlet right because one of the benefits that we found with the newer grades that we put in was a lot of the debris you know was going down into the pipes as opposed to the newer Grace we put in there prevented that but then sometimes that gets plugged up right there at the great but you guys maintain it well yeah as long as it's maintained right there's a gentleman that lives there on the lower one uh the lower analyte in his driveway is completely underwater at times why because it's clogged or I I don't know I mean the residents should be cleaning those out themselves too it was great I've seen residents that put down all their tree trimmings on the top of the grates which is brilliant anything else on this one yeah that's it and we'll go on to 16th right 16th that one bedrooms into depart but it's again it's a will and repave and uh and replacing the curb uh the curbing the existing pipes and the inlets they they remain as is so pretty much like 14. yeah okay any uh questions or comments on that one all right all right 17th Street uh again Maryland replay if they've been curb replacement uh leaving the uh the pipe in place and uh also the the inlets the middle is in place and uh pretty much repaving uh and replacing the curbing on this one as well okay so this so you know we're getting close to my street which is the most important Street in this whole project so oh we got a lot of stuff going on there didn't we recall that street may I ask a question this is this is Jody can I ask a question yes okay well we're leaving all these um I can't see you on the screen or anything so I'm just having a just chime in whenever you'd like yeah I know I keep raising my hand and because no one's paying attention so sorry um but where we're leaving the inlets as they exist is there any way to add a great to stop like the palm fronds from from flowing into them that's question number one question number two is will we be replacing any of the concrete covers to them because many of those are failing they're the ones that were replacing there'll be a brand new Inlet with a great type top the ones that remain uh we we've looked at we think if they're damaged and of course we would replace that Inlet if they're not damaged then we just left it left it in and utilize it but how do you determine whether one is ready to be replaced or not what what's the just I'm curious visual inspection okay yeah uh corrosion or well you know they're concrete you know these tops so they'll last for a while but if they look like they're spalling you know maybe the rebar is getting rusting and expanding and you'll see the traction you'll see the red who's coming out of it but that's we look for that if it looks like it's like a a fresh but not a fresh but a poor piece of concrete with no damage then then pretty much it's it's intact okay we had one's on 12th and 13th actually collapsed right into the end yeah so was that a was it was that a no on the grate being added I didn't get an answer for that all right could you say that again please is there any way to add a grate to these um inlets that were leaving in place that don't have great so we can eliminate some of the Palm fronds and yard debris that flows into them adding a grade at the existing Inlet that's my question like seeing the concrete top with a great top now she's keeping the same style like the curved style Inlet but putting some sort of great to keep debris out of going into the box okay I well I think the short answer is yes but uh I'm not sure if who we can find that at what what's the dimensions can it work without replacing the box that's that's what this case these things kind of piece together you'd have to pour a new box yeah yeah we don't want to have to pour a new box but if if there's no top that's going to fix it I mean you have to pour a new box so 12th and 13th they've had greats don't they they were different styles I have great um kind of like a almost a hybrid of a curb inlay and a great Inlet but the grades are so deteriorated they're just falling through okay so you had to put the grates in you would change them to the F-type the reason I ask is because some of these the opening is large enough for a small child to just fall right into they're very they're extremely unsafe it's you know we're talking about Community safety it's a problem and I know it sounds kind of like a Larry you kind of acted like that was a crazy statement but anything can be done um you know I know in the construction business I would just bring someone out there and build it for me it just isn't a big deal to add a grade to something but it's something we probably should look out for for safety purposes yeah I agree with Jody I think two things it would be safety I take my grandkids off of my street we walk across the street to the beach and we're going past that I make a conscious effort to make sure that they are not even close to that because I have two two-year-olds and I'm confident if they fell they would they would go into that they're small enough to fall into that so so you're visualizing what we're talking about that there's some type of a screen great for lack of a better term that would just go over that that would do two things it would stop a lot of the uh pom-prong stuff you know from going down in there from a maintenance standpoint do you see that causing much of a problem so I just keep the openings big enough but it's not getting blocked up too easily by debris right um but once that goes into the system and then goes into the pipes does it ever get jammed up in there which you typically is when the Barnacle oyster build up gets to the point that debris gets caught where it'll pile up and plug um I think the biggest inlets that we have that are well not they're not ours but the counties on Gulf Boulevard would be the biggest ones that a child could fall around to yeah just but that would definitely happen if we put some type of a grade over that it would sound great it would stop uh debris right there similar to like the new greats that we put in on 12th and 13th Street that you guys have to go around after a big storm and make sure you're you're cleaning that off otherwise the grade just gets plugged right yeah and I've seen that kind of design where they put some kind of great in front of an opening curve Inlet okay yeah I think I think the better of those uh it's uh okay to have to clean out a great but it's not okay to have to clean out a pipe right I agree yeah so right now a lot of that stuff is going into the system right A lot of it a lot of it does come out um but yeah that's when usually when you get that build up enough that it gets a full plug from like organic material like branches or something that's when you get that back up um and then and typically what we do is the vac truck has to come out and blast it okay so we just we just contract that out have them yeah take care of it okay doesn't do that for us or do they well okay we could steal it thank you can we just comment yeah can we come here can we just take another look at those grates and maybe try to wherever we're doing improvements look at trying to be uniform throughout the city I know on Harrison there are there's one that's a huge I mean there's got to be 18 inches or greater that you could lose an animal down it if there was a heavy you know rain storm and um you know I know we're not focusing on Harrison but I'm just saying if there's one on Harrison there's got to be many throughout the city maybe take a second look at those Inlet boxes and grates we're doing this let's do it right so we don't have an issue yeah one of the issues that we may run into is if whenever you're trying to install permanently install a piece of Hardware like that into an older Google name it may start crumbling and cracking um so it would have to be some kind of a hybrid device that so heavy you just lay it on it or so I don't know I don't know what would be the answer but I think you understand what it is that she's recommended and I think everyone agrees with that's probably something we should look into that's it yeah I think we can put together um some options of whether we're you know buying a device to go in front of it on what that would cost suppose is changing the box out itself um and then you can just line up what the the cost of all that would be okay you know those drains that are right there on Golf Boulevard Kyle so those are those owned by the county those are the county grants yes so if we ask them to they would probably take that on right yes so we say from a safety reason we want these things taken care of well this is this is too too completely separate projects one is you've got something that you would like to see resolve at the county owns and then the rest of it is what we're trying to resolve tonight and whatever we come up with you know we may not get the same solution from the county but we can certainly ask okay anything else on 17th Street vice mayor are you okay with that yes I just asked that we take a look at it and try to resolve those issues okay 18th Street 18th Street uh same work uh Mill and replace and repave replace the uh the curbing and here uh at the end it be called the set where uh we're replacing the inlets and uh and also the uh yeah huh we're also removing the existing check valve there as well what's the purpose of that why why are we removing a check valve well I think it's one of the cases of relocating it much much more than just removing it and I think of the issue is uh that the city is saying that when you have the check valve in at the inlet the but it doesn't stop Barnacle growth and debris on the downstream end and they would prefer to have the uh those check valves out on the sea wall so I say now so you're effectively moving the check valve yeah exactly and the the reason it's in the box right now is because the pipe that's sleeved at the sea wall is a metal coordinated pipe that is falling apart and it just was impossible to get a valve in there um the way that the actual outfall is shaped so we put one in the Box to prevent the title backflow but it'd be much more beneficial and they have it um to repair the you know how fast so that the valve can be placed at the end of the part um and that it also gives you more holding capacity for the rain water and that's also a good point is that there's some Alphas that we are replacing in this being one of them where the the CNP pipe is just totally corroded and so we'll we'll be replacing those and then then they would be in shape to take the the check valve at that location okay foreign s on the 18th beyond the long expansive plant that's gone from the south England to the sea wall that's going to get a slip line because that one has been inspected to have infiltration yeah it's damaged okay so that it is it is leaking in to that pipe yeah that one that one there uh we haven't you know plan to be slip line you know out from that Inlet out to the Seawall so on 18th Street the only Inlet that is there now is there's just one right two there's two yeah okay so that other one is existing but so it says um so the 18 inch pipe that goes across the street there that's already there as well yeah okay and that needs to be cleaned out because the camera was not that was full of debris that needs to be cleaned out okay well let me make one clarification I'm glad you brought that up it's a 15 inch pipe now we're going to replace it with an 18. Jack it says proposed 18 inch pipe okay okay got it you lost me I thought you were putting a slip line in there no that's this Emerald Down to the CEO okay okay any other questions or comments on 18th it may help just to put that existing 15 inch pipe on the drawing okay so we know there's an existing pipe there and you're proposing to replace it with an 18. yeah the part of the plans would be the survey and the survey shows it does the 15. okay and uh but I'll we can add that note into there and also refer them to the survey as well okay good all right 19th [Music] okay 19th Street uh there were no and repave along replacing the curb and this is where uh it makes a jog to the north uh and that's uh the existing uh I probably remaining and the inlets looked okay so those will be remaining as well okay okay questions so what about Bayshore that's the next 19th and 20th is that being addressed at all I mean it looks like that was done that was a newer asphalt and curbing um so no that that scored higher on our street index okay so we you can see where we ended the asphalt and it varies per Street that's Crossing Bayshore um and that's mainly of the the way that the damaged curb and asphalt that you know we took it to where it made sense to stop got it so this one bends around um on the Bayshore rule just because that curve was damaged yeah that far down the road okay please continue okay 20th uh on 20th this one uh ends at the park as well but it's uh mail and repeat and they're replacing the curb there are no no pipes on this this stretch and uh I think it's that's pretty much the work so it stops here the the paving just before it gets to um right I have a question and some most of these streets up in this this area of Bel-Air Beach um but they're not really your normal gutter uh the street is the level with the grass and then you've got a concrete maybe just a little bit is anything changing on that or we're just doing the same thing again well it it's going to be the uh the valley type curve uh that's then so the the edge of the curving uh of the concrete will be the edge of the pavement so it'll look a little different but another uh depending on what the elevation is on the back side of that between the curve and the lawn there'll probably be some sodding that we'll have to do in there to make a better it'll look it won't look like it was now but it looked like you you see the the valley curl Ranger next to the road and then saw it okay a Smurf sidewalk okay ready for the next yes okay 21st 21st here is uh we're doing and retailing and curved replacement no Plumbing no Plumbing and and then the plans at the end you'll see some Alphonse because of the pipe are kind of in between the streets up in this area and so we at the at the end of these we got out fall plans to show what we're proposing for those outfalls okay okay any questions or go on I think you can continue okay 20 22nd I I brought up 22nd this is um that south east corner um we're really milled and repaved it was it's part of the curve that's sunken in that kind of puddles more so than any other place um it's optional but I thought we were out there because it was brought up when we did resurface why we didn't take care of that spot okay good let's just is that okay so it's sunken I do I know it it makes a puddle it actually covers more than half the street at times is that going to solve the problem um but I will make sure that we don't uh I can't answer that straight on but it should okay and but we'll take a closer look at the survey to make sure because where it comes around that corner it's going down to those inlets that's further down the street and so uh let me check the grades on those but it should do because it should fix it right and probably it's probably a combination of events happening but it's it's always in a torrential downpour yeah there's a brief period in time to where that intersection is underwater okay I'm making my notes Here I'll make sure that works thank you any other comments on this one all right 23rd okay 23rd it's railing ring Paving along with currently basic so basically Bayshore is taking care of all the runoff from these streets yes okay that's correct right there's some out there like on 20th Street our street basically from the midpoint of the street going towards Bay Bay Shore right yeah yeah there's no point it actually flows towards go pull the public school I think all that water goes into the counties Inland drain there good and then the other half goes toward the Bay Shore so you got a double Outlet yeah why can't we have an account I mean people said that wasn't it uh you know some people I talked to up here they said no it all goes One Direction I said well no it doesn't watch it flow ours does it yeah most of them all right any questions uh about 23rd all right moving right along okay 24th on 24th Street it's same thing Mill and replace and replacing the curb and uh no drainage pipe at the end of this street as well dude also no all right 25th thanks Brad on 25th we're doing my same thing we're doing replacement and um also replacing the curb and here there's the park at the end of this street and the intersections is it hibiscus uh there so we'll be curving around that as well and repaving okay excellent Council yes all right Morgan Drive okay morning same thing we're doing the mill and replacement of the pavement and replacing of the curb and uh available use terms two two hibiscus and then at the for stocking just short of Bayshore and also I'll just squeeze my eyes but there's the drainage improvements on this one the uh I got a thing here this whole I got something in here sticking up stop [Music] now anyway the uh how can I get this back up hit that yeah there okay all right there we go well let me look up here because this has got a thing yeah what we're doing here there's an existing pipe that goes down from the intersection of uh hibiscus and uh and that uh that paint that pipe is remaining we're also keeping in place the existing Inlet there and on Morgan and then it turns and goes out to the intercoastal to the north behind between the property lines that that is remaining as well what we'll be doing is uh it's it's got indications of Barnacle so we'll be cleaning the molecules out of that and uh that goes out to the sea wall it goes out where out good to see one on was it at the intercoastal okay no new pipe in there no new pipes okay and I'm seeing uh that that we touch Victoria uh Avenue and uh on boat I believe looking at this correctly yes are we doing anything with Victoria um Kyle Victoria this is Victoria Avenue I'm not Victoria that's hibiscus that's high business I was trying to figure out where is Victoria but it's on everything that's on the survey we're getting that fixed okay well actually I'm at hibiscus I keep kept reading Victoria but yeah we're doing anything with hibiscus no just stopping everything at the radius return yeah hibiscus was like Bayshore where um especially those segments the condition wasn't horrible on our street Index right we were more up in the green okay that's fine any questions or comments on that one and how we got Victoria found it I thought I knew the city somewhat I understand before I was like never been there well yeah right I knew where it was I didn't know who it was okay um we're on the next page go right ahead okay now we're at the uh the outfalls and uh here we've got 12th and 13th where we're uh indicating clear ing the barnacles and uh but we may want to you know we're also looking at at possible slip line or something uh to help the joints Yep this is um left on the last project where we talked about um right you know we come through when we're doing the other slip lining come back and hit these streets so do you recommend a slip line where my understanding is another pipe would actually go in there or cure it in place a slip line or a carried and paste what you've been doing okay yeah and uh at the the outlets there at 2020 Bayshore in 2015. uh then the main thing is to clean clean out those pipes and clean the Barnacles away yep and that these are these two we know that there is damage um where washing into the pipe and that's why and from the inspection yeah right okay yeah I think I don't know if it's at 2020 it will be uh at 2205 yeah the that that video will be when we get there but it's it's interesting what happened there okay are we ready to go to the next sheet sure okay on uh 22 05 2307 and the other uh outfall stairs it's cleaning the Barnacles and uh the interesting thing uh that we're seeing on 2205 and look at the uh in the video there's some kind of video uh you see where the pipe takes a turn and goes out to the sea wall yep well the concrete pipe ends at the straight part and what they did is they bent the CMP to come out to the Seawall and and that uh you know that that outfall I've uh needs to be there from that from receivable to where the concrete pipe means it either needs to be slip line or replaced but it looked like it was okay and slip lining that small section there would because uh it uh really something needs to be done at that at that turn is there a way right there at that intersection of the corrugated metal pipe and the concrete pipe yeah can it end there if we just remove the CMP no because he's behind the Seawall okay so why didn't he just go straight it was this shorter property line yeah okay what is your what is your recommendation you say something needs to be done here well what's the best solution my uh judgment on that is is verifying the condition of the CMP so the CMP in the middle there's it's not rusted but it's in it's sound then Sublime would be uh what we recommend if that pipe is not sound then replace that section as CMP with the same material and then out the existing hole so keeping the pipe the same just replace that section of height okay so um you just didn't uh you didn't Point anything out on the drawing that's why I'm asking no I this was a late night study okay making sure that you know we you know we're leaving this and what what we're showing and that's that's one that popped out last night in reviewing it in that uh uh looking at that section we need we need to determine the pipes structural soundness and then then we can decide what to do from that point okay it would be possible to see pictures of this also whenever you yeah I have them here I just fill them up yeah nice yeah yeah SC is there is there a junction box there where this is they actually connected organic metal pipe to the concrete pipe yeah uh and then put another concrete pipe replacing the corrugated metal pipe out to the wall this is somebody's yard I think that's the problem there's a towel is equity but I want to get to my Zip drive you don't waste that one Flex Seal yeah yeah exactly there we go take a look at it I mean is it functioning now Kyle I mean does it get pretty good it does function I've seen it yeah obviously it's essentially going to be a problem so I think you know we should do something so we don't have anything connected to the end of that pipe no just stop the background we got pictures of it I had it I just gotta find it ah here it is there it is can you see that on the screen what you're seeing right immediately let's see right figure here that's the end that's this joint section of the concrete then you got this pipe that goes out and what's happening in here is kind of hard to see but that's where the Pipers CMP is bent and turned towards the sea wall so it looks good up until that point and the uh you know the video went out to the opening of the sea wall but we just got to make sure that pipe there this section of pipe that's in here that it's in good shape if it's in good shape then the solutions are either slip line up to the concrete pipe or uh replace the pipe replace the corrugated metal pipe yeah with what CMP uh but you have to look at the existing opening you know if it's easiest just replace what's there uh looking at that section of piping not giving CMP I think that they bent that metal pipe to make it fit through the home to put concrete would have to put a manhole in and so it could turn and go out all right do you think that cotton Sports you think they're cutting space that plate yeah how far back is it from the opening uh about 12 feet it's not far so are there bushes there Kyle I mean if we if we did put a manhole there junction box type of a deal is it is that area sort of covered yeah most of these areas are called not in the middle of their yard obviously they wouldn't say heck yes that's right on the property line there's a lot of plants um is the metal plate on the property line or is it going on well there's a there's a utility easement that exists on the plat um but most of these around the property line people either have walls fences shrubs all stuff we can get to that without going through illegal um I would have to check with Randy and we haven't done it yet but theoretically yes you know just to pull 12 feet out wouldn't be much you know and do it right especially if it's a better place that's really the only one that's uh that has any uh real problems to it everything else looks pretty straightforward yeah all right um vice mayor Shirley do you have any comments uh no I'm in agreeance with Frank that if we can if there's any way to uh remove that pipe and put a uh a junction box in there I think it would be the best way to go but short of that you know that's I'll leave that to the engineers to figure out you don't know how old that is dude probably as old as the other late 60s early 70s you know we can look at you know junction box or maybe a great Inlet and uh and then make that turn at that point so there's I'm just I'm just thinking that if it was cut and bent it's got to be rotten that cut um that's my guess yeah yeah because even if they welded it back then if it's if it was galvanized it just popped and down that more than likely it needs well it needs to be really replaced okay all right uh Mr reefer do you have any comments my only last comment is on a lot of these especially down Bayshore where we have notes of clear Barnacles and Breeze um I wanted to make sure like when we thoroughly clean out these pipes that um that we have is an option to if we find that there is some damage um to put like a gear in place pipe at that time [Music] 13th and we discovered it just to have some money continue to see money it's set aside so that if we do identify a problem then we can while they're out there okay but and uh just curious uh from beginning to end what time frame are we looking at on completion of this entire project they're both for construction over the year yeah we wanted to go to it for the construction all right starting when pending as soon as we can get it up we're good well you know once we decide and bid it out we wouldn't stop before November though hurricane storm season just right here at this point it's going to be closer to November yeah because we gotta you know we're gonna need at least a month for bed but we're still kind of redesigning a little bit for considerations well it looks like we're uh the city will be in pretty good shape at least much much better than we were in the past and uh I think that this was a good idea and uh I'm looking forward to seeing it get kicked off and get started any other comments on this yes so there's very little pipe a new additional pipe that's going in is that an accurate statement if you like right okay yeah um was there any consideration for um that little pipe that we're going to be using for maybe a um for HDPE as opposed to concrete pipe and uh short answer is yeah the hdp can be particularly in these areas where we're not underneath the pavement I worry about HDPE underpayment particularly here because it would not be if it was deeper but it's not that big of death and you got the big trucks that come down I just wonder I worry about how the HDPE will respond to those loads at the depth that they are so sometimes look at that I know there's certain companies and certain um types of HDPE that are approved by fdot right that they put out on the highways so pretty pretty large trucks there I don't know specifically what they require with with cover I know fdot's got it I'm not sure if they use it underneath the pavement yeah I'm pretty sure if they do then great that's then uh what is the double wrong yeah you know double wrong so it's it's pretty strong it's been tested a lot well I can check that and and for that but maybe we could hang out when they're uh when the contract is submitting a bid was the term I'm looking for my blood sugar's getting low approved alternate alternate bid yeah they can do it all big for the material just to see how that costs down yeah we can do that right yeah that'd be great yeah and the assets yeah I wanted to talk about the asphalt because I'm a big reliever and you know we don't want to be we want to do this to last as long as possible so what what's the best asphalt we can put on those rows clearly most of our roads are automobiles however the biggest um the biggest product that causes the most problems is the garbage truck because it's stop growing stop goes stop go and if we have uh I mean I could drive on the roads now that were just done on 12th and 13th and there's a lot of heating and stuff going on on there I'm sure it's from the garbage truck especially when it's as hot as it is I mean I don't know what type number they used for that but I I know like on Gulf Boulevard when you see where it meets they have a lot of granite in that so I don't know what that grade is my only I would like to see us use the best and strongest possible asphalt or at least get some different bids you could put it at you could put air air airport grade down there but it looks like crap well I mean look at that Boulevard where they tie into our streets and that's been there for a while I'm guessing I don't know when they resurfaced golf but like you know so here it comes comes off of gold boom they cut it off and then our our payment starts and their payment is it has a lot of granted in it I mean you can see it and that that really is strong stuff because that's an fbot right right yeah they're using super pave okay is is the type of materials I think it's what that is and uh and that's I think the dot started improving it like in the mid 90s 96 97. okay and uh but there is a topic is they call it super pay okay now I don't know how much it would cost how much more is it different from the county standard pavement section and which is the dlt's asphalt asphaltic concrete you know that what's the difference between that and the super pave or any any other brand uh but uh I'm gonna have to find out what the yeah maybe again that would be a good fit for an alternate bid right you know that's cost of this if you're going to put in super pave it's going to cost this yeah and then perhaps at that time you guys can tell us you know what's the benefit yeah what's the what's the lifespan of wondrous is the other so at one last 20 more years just to pick a number but versus that information's out I can get that out as far as okay and and uh actually the the difference between asphalt and super fave is how it's mixed how it's not a hot mix it's mixed a little different and so and it's got uh it can either be course or find uh grains material right depending on how course you want your surface so we can we can research that out perfect yeah appreciate it can I just add I just want to say though the fdot requirements are much different than what we would need in our interior streets and uh typically what you're looking at there is that big rock and it's a lot it's a lot different mix you're right but it also is built to accommodate heavy traffic flow and we aren't dealing with heavy traffic flow on our interior road so I don't want to I I think it's great to do the research but I think we just need to be careful not to spend too much money on road systems that that aren't required yeah right exactly and that's you know when we're looking at pavement you know what that kind of Alternatives you know it was appropriate for a residential Community Street in the type of loads and traffic that we have there you know it's it's a lot different than I-275 and the payment that they put there it'll be a different pavement and the entire process is different it as far as different Machinery right they're set up for a long run it is different machine it's a different differently asphalt so great for these streets and that's that's what I got to figure it out right I mean I didn't see that laid but I'm sure it was not very complicated for them to whatever pavement they put out there on Gulf Boulevard yeah and it's it's strong and again I I get it if you have big 18 wheelers going on the interstate or some of these other roads but they're growing you know 65 miles an hour they're not stomping like these garbage trucks when they go stop go hit the brakes every 20 feet that's a heavy load that's pushing on that soft asphalt right right and that's what creates heaving and then you have potholes and then you're wondering three years later you just did this yeah exactly that type of thing right I don't know if you're gonna really like the asphalt really I mean you're underlying your bases with your whole and I'm sure the technology they change they asphalt is continuously changing you know the different grades and they're working on it people are way smarter than me and yeah asphalt going for today compared to your with the yard of concrete 200 a yard now I mean uh now see asphalt [Music] y guys a good better best is that what you're looking for and see what the causes of course it is yeah because we know what we already used like on 12th and 13th Street so that you know that costs X yeah if you want something that doesn't work out you concrete it but I mean but it wears out too yeah but not like like Jody was saying I mean if uot says you have to have it has to handle over a hundred thousand cars a day at least or three hundred thousand depending on what it is but Concrete Street if I would last you know longer than us yeah yeah the asphalt's gone uh just over 400 a ton asphalt yeah and concrete's 200 yards yeah concrete yeah concrete is less than that so probably somewhere around upper 200s to 300. now what's our average life expectancy on this project after it's done as far as the roads um that means you look at some of our roads they you know they were paved in the early 2000s they're still in good condition so I mean again I guess it just depends on like where like some of the base factors underneath and um just kind of things that we were only resurfacing so some problems are gonna you know gonna exist and they're gonna come back but I mean I guess I guess I'd say at least 20 years for the for the payment or more um but again kind of like we got some other factors too you know when you know this thing's changing and the long-term the planning of um kind of again our stormwater system and so one of my fears is that if we ask for this various grades uh how do we know that they're quoting the same thing and yeah so but I understand where you're going you want something that's impervious it's going to last 50 years if we could get it um but at the same time I don't want to skew the bid process by asking a question and their interpretation of what we're asking for is completely different so I don't want to get too far in the Weeds on this uh I'm sure that a general job like this they're all sourcing their asphalt from probably it probably would have been long ago on Starkey Road is that right yeah okay and they only offer one type of asphalt or do they do a couple mixes a couple of different mixes yeah and usually you see what's the most common mix used to do for cooking on the Pinellas County mixes the DLT from saying they those guys know well and and they're all living close so okay oh well I guess in the bid process we should specify what mixes we're looking for [Music] [Music] rights that you'd like to look into like like the super food but the I I really don't think that that it would be appropriate for me residential street that um at that of asphalt we got to take an account oil jump 18 in the last month per barrel I mean it may just cost us a fortune you know unless it starts dropping all right uh do we have any other questions or comments for uh Mr Fleury you might be able to I mean there may be able to estimate kind of he's already done for this project as is um for the asphalt you know so you can kind of see the difference between and not actually go out to bid unless they're you know serious about doing that cost increase for the the higher grade asphalt you know he he should be able to estimate based on that mix what what the cost of roughly is going to be just like he estimates the rest of the project yeah what I'd like to see is it you know the same mix that we used on 12 and 13. which would make sense and then see an alternate bid for an improved mix um that our engineering firm would think would be adequate and usable for our city streets that's better and that way we can judge the cost differential if you're not doing something like that you're just walking in blindfolded why would a city not want to see a better product that they could get that would just be a little small incrementing costing and the only way you're going to know that is to bid it out and include an alternate bids so you can see it in black and white I say no we don't want to do that is a misuse of funding of the taxpayers that live here I think a lot of people are gonna a lot of contractors in this economy are not going to give you a fixed price on asphalt because it changes all the time unless you're going to paid it tomorrow morning or within two weeks now they have to give us a fixed price for a certain amount of time experience for a very very closed window and they'll probably have a disclaimer in there if oil keeps Rising it's going to go like it you can have that and I was involved with a lot of projects when the China Steel Fiasco yeah yeah he paid the con we up well we pay them because that was the right thing to do I've been involved with anywhere from parking lots of streets oils just goes crazy you just can't rely on it all right so can we just reach a consensus on this you want to you you want to have an uh a regular doses of premium grade quote correct yes whatever our engineering firm feels isn't a good alternate bid to the same type of asphalt that we used in 12-13 because we've used that more than a couple of times right yeah yeah so then what uh what another upgraded asphalt would be to be used on our road so that we can see what the cost differential is and make a logical educated informed decision I would also like to know what we get for that for that enhanced cost of course what's the life expectancy increase and uh without that we we won't be able to make a good decision right so I'm okay with that vice mayor Shirley uh would you like to weigh in on that conversation I agree we should have some comparisons and comparisons and competitive bids for asphalt all right and do we have any um any questions about these uh numbers uh that we're showing on the cost here for each Street anything like that so that's a cost estimates per design currently I'm sorry say that again so the cost estimates post um Street area for the current design yeah what was the total [Music] with a 20 contingency which is more they're not past projects we typically did 10. um right now we're at uh 4.08 million okay and what did we get approved by the The Lending two and a half um it was two and a half roughly like 2.3 but that was on top of what we already budget so we're good we're currently we're on the estimated budget servants great as long as we don't wait too long and watch the prices go up okay um do we have anything else on this discussion before we move on Larry thank you so much thank you and uh thank you to your team also uh for uh giving us a great presentation and uh and detailed documentation all right all right thank you thank you okay um I'll tell you what it is 7 32 why don't we take about a five to ten minute break and then we'll come back and continue deconstruct here okay all right it's 7 33 we're uh we're back into uh The Rook session and uh we're on item number two discussion on strategic plan objectives for fiscal year 23-24 this was placed on the agenda by city manager Reaper take it away Mr Wheeler thank you so this is the succeeded plan uh we went three over two meetings um through each point and uh uh made some notes and modifications what I did is I took um budget Workshop that we would come back and figure out some new objectives and that takes you to the last page of the of the agenda packet um where you got the green and the red um some of them but there's there's objectives that we're still working on for each goal and then um you can see in the Reds for the objective twos we just don't have another objective currently um and and the idea when we come up with these objectives is we want them to uh fall in line with our budgetary planning for the upcoming year so each council member would you know go home think about it and come up with some ideas for to fill in some of these blanks but we started goal one you got the health and safety we got two weeks to have start two react ends which was the uh addressing the hits through flooding issues which is what we're currently doing we just did and uh the developed the street light plan so we have morning 77 for street riding um like I've said in previous meetings I'm going to work on uh coming up with a a kind of a standard throughout the city where we can improve our street lights um focusing on our city streets so for about two um that's that's the best value for the taxpayer um we kind of said we constantly revisit the economic impacts on uh Capital Improvement um graduate and the reserve funds um this is a you know another objective best best value for the expectations any comments questions um I'm I'm looking at objective number two and I'm also looking at uh the entire uh tax dollar value goal two and basically what I'm seeing is these are things that are we're currently doing now um are we looking are you looking for uh a new idea to add to this or um that we have to add it's just um having the objective set gives me a goal or a point to get to for in the next you know fiscal year of reaching the Strategic goal so I don't know if you have anything that falls in line but we feel would be in the goal to well we were I know that um council member zabel has uh he's still working on the marina plan uh and that is definitely I don't know if that would actually fall in in this category I see it's listed here but is that a an objective that we should be able to add or is that considered something small um well so so far the data hasn't been that small of an issue I think we've I mean we've kind of I'll sit around quite a bit uh right and I think we are I mean is this actually at the end of the day is it changing our tax dollar value or is it um or in enhancing our tax dollar value or is it just streamlining the process okay I'd say more so streamlining the process make it more Equitable resident I mean because it's definitely an objective for us but um I'm uh I'm not sure if it would fall under the tax dollar value as an objective right now if I just had to pluck something out of the air and plug into this I would say well that's what we're currently working on um but uh is that really where it belongs anyone else like a chime in on that or am I vice mayor Shirley yeah I don't know that we can um that the marina is really a tax dollar objective in other words I don't know that there's much more that we could squeeze out of the marina fund as far as revenues go so I look at this goal as a way how do we how do we increase revenues am I I mean maybe I'm off base there but um and and I think that looking more towards City Hall I think the marina we've kind of tapped out as it stands and looking at Grant so you know I I know there's been a lot of discussion about setting up Grant policies and maybe this is where we put that object that objective and goal two of setting up a grant policy and procedure yeah I would definitely agree uh grants have are have always been one of our weaknesses uh since I've been with the city is uh they're few and far between and whenever they do come along they're not huge grants um but I've always wondered I guess we all have are we overlooking something because we don't either have the skills the manpower to actually pursue these grants and maybe one of the things that we should be doing I think we've already briefly touched on it in a past meeting was leveraging the uh the services of the Florida League of cities because they have they actually have a service that we we can tap into for free to help uh evaluate all the grants that are out there and see what's eligible for us um that that seems like it would be low hanging fruit if somebody was uh was able to spot it and and would know immediately if we were eligible and have we no I have um we recommended I have signed up and um I want to see if they offer something more dialed into what we're looking for because I did sign up for the program it sends me at weekly emails of pretty much every possible Grant nationally um and there's ways to kind of search through it um Lord I have not seen aspects of the program kind of like what you're saying where where they'll actually do some some work in looking for your community if that exists I want to say I I wish that I had the guide with me but I want to say that they actually do have grant writing assistance uh as part of as part of one of the benefits that we have it's just a matter of um I guess making the contacts and and uh staying on it with the Florida Legacy yes yeah which is yeah can I just add um and maybe grants um in general may not be the ideal item for that but alternate funding for renourishment and some of those projects that we know are um items that are on our goal list that we don't know how to fund and we don't know how to make it happen so it's got to be on that goal somewhere and that tax dollar value is probably a place for it to be so the the uh you're talking about Beach renourishment yes yeah the the problem with with billing it along on beach renourishment if we had to do it ourselves without our neighbors doing it uh it it doesn't last very long um and that's been some of the pushback that that uh that I've received whenever I've been overly vocal to the county but um so since you're going to bring that up I I can go ahead and tell you that um Janet long announced it my first TDC meeting uh the the county is moving forward with planning and permitting to do the most uh needed areas for Beach nourishment and that would include Belair Beach so that that should be something that we we won't have to worry about but unfortunately whoever we did it or they did it uh or or the FED did it we're still looking at two years out before anything actually happens um two years yeah and hottest hottest uh year on record for I think since like 33 or something like that and it's a powder keg out there um and we're now in in the most danger that we've ever been in as far as the setting for The Perfect Storm because two entities were waiting to see who was going to Blink first uh so it's uh it's it's sad that we've gotten to this point but I do think that um the county is now they have their eyes on bigger projects that uh they consider far more important than Beach nourishment such as the Rays stadium and I uh told them I told Janet long in the meeting that um if you want to even consider talking about that you're going to have to show the county that you're moving forward with a speech nourishment project otherwise I think people are not going to approve people are going to completely disapprove and and uh be far more vocal than I have been so hopefully we've got some relief coming soon so totally ridiculous with this new stadium raised role on an average of 18 000 a night unless there's a another team that people come down here to use the beach to go to all right I hear you yeah I mean well it's it's uh at the end of the day we know where all that bad tax money comes from and it's a minimal investment I I hate that the county is having to take their bed tax and reinvest it into their sand but if they don't do it I don't think anyone else is one more thing on that and then I'll uh we'll continue on the Army Corps of Engineers is coming down to do a small presentation and Q a down in Treasure Island and I will be attending that so that I can what is it uh I don't have the exact date but I will send out the date and time and all that good stuff I will I will I I don't know who's invited if it's a regular public meeting or not but I will find out okay all right uh Bryson is Shirley would you like to continue I'm sorry I got on my little beach nourishment ramp there no I knew that was gonna happen but um I know it's a hot button so I thought that that might be something we added in there into that section okay um so just as alternate funding Maybe okay grants an alternate funding or just you can we can just call it alternate funding is objective to you know everybody agree with that city manager yes okay so uh go three um that's the communication and Community uh goal uh we currently still have and we're you know we're looking at it is just just studying the intersection that kind of um you know backs up it's you know there may be nothing that can be done to it but it's just uh you know the county offered um to do further studying and uh we'll take them up on it just to see if there's any kind of solution to make things better for the residents so we still have that on there and like I said they they have their numbers in the uh firm that does their uh their actual study and calculations is they told me it's probably about almost a month ago there was a couple months so we'll see what kind of what they come back with after the change um was made which was I think 2018-19 or so when they when they kind of restructured the lanes and maybe it might have been as late as 20 but um kind of see what results came back um and see if there's any other way we could improve so that being said I know when we talked about uh communication the website has been brought up um there was you know some checking into uh reduced attorney more with the um uh just making sure everything's uh uh I guess ADA Compliant but we did talk about uh the possibility of putting in more uh firms online uh requests functionality with our websites to make it uh like with the uh street parking um so yeah once uh attorney Mora is uh you know kind of checked out and reviewed what um what he thinks where we need to be at on what we can add and what will keep us compliant um that's something I can continue to to grow on the website is is that is the online form functionality of it for people that don't always have time to either come into the building or call in during office hours to get things done uh speaking of that are you um are you satisfied with our web hosting company or are you having to figure out tools on your own or are they are they making suggestions um they do it to improve on that because there A lot of times those utilities though you know the the bolt-ons let's just call them uh for your um uh what's the name of it the the core uh we're impressed yeah so add-ons to Wordpress a lot of times things are just out there but you don't know that and you shouldn't have to uh but they certainly should and so I'm just all right going back to my question are you satisfied with with the level of service we're getting out of them or do you need something better well we talked about um town of bel-air's website and I did reach out to Civic plus because that is who they use I I spoke with Tylenol O'Hara Staff first um and I found out who they who they worked with to design that website um that person is no longer working in our area but I've have a meeting set up with someone from Pacific plus to discuss what you know what it would take to reach a design more like theirs um and you know see what see what their price points are um so I want to I want to see how that comes back and it comes to our current um website uh provider with WordPress uh you know I think it's probably it's a local option I'll be there in St Pete Beach and it was probably an economical option but as far as really giving ideas to improve our website I I don't they don't do much of that now if you ask them specifically I'd like to accomplish this task and you know how can I do that then they they will work on it for you I mean they build you for it but um there may be some better Solutions or companies that bring us more up to speed okay so that that's a that's a good example for goal number three objective two but I'm wondering if objective one is really should actually be in that category um because I don't see how your description of uh credible timely and transparent information and feedback between the city and residents uh engendered pride of ownership including inclusion and civility I I don't I don't see the connection that was just under my goal I don't know how it was connected previously um what do you think that goal will go it's it's uh you know this is this is uh could be objective three of goal number one okay uh it just doesn't seem like it belongs there so I can see where the website possibly revising doing some revising on the website would be a good objective but I don't know about uh once that one the Gulf Boulevard is moved out what would you move in anyone I I think a utilizing the website once it's redesigned for communication and then utilizing um any other means we have I don't know we're not doing any text messaging or anything like that but there's certainly um some and I know we don't want to get into the social media aspect of things but certainly there's a lot of bad information on social media and a way to combat some of that to provide the city Side of what's really going on versus what the gossip is on social media so I I don't know how we tackle that but I think it needs to be an object objective because it is causing a lot of extra attention when it's not necessary if people have the right information didn't work out I agree I don't know if it's I mean we we know we know there's one general area where this miscommunication is is a uh this I won't call it miscommunication it's almost a uh uh disinformation and also just uh uh awaited to indirectly try to steer the council um but I I don't know if it's actually worth trying to combat that any more than than we do in our meetings um no matter what you say there's always going to be somebody that that will take those words and turn them around but I definitely like the idea of uh doing more on our Facebook page than we're currently doing currently I think all we're doing right now is announcing our meetings yeah I'd say uh plug-in through the website that anytime that we're putting something up officially it just automatically gets transferred over to Facebook um I I would like to see uh whenever we complete these projects I would love to see a picture of 12th and 13th how beautiful it is I'd love to see every time one of our streets was redone how beautiful it is you know um showing uh the community that progress is made in our community um and um there's more than just announcing the meetings because I'm sure if you looked at our meeting right now what do you think there's three people watching yeah probably right yeah there's two I just looked you got two yeah and they're both in the same household I will say this that it's I've noticed that it's much easier for people to find their information on Facebook is it personally is is that in your house I'm hearing I'm muted okay it's all right it's right okay um anyway uh it's one change I've noticed that the habits of people it's much easier for them to read something real quick inform their opinion rather than listening to one of our meetings or listening to a recording or watching it on a Youtube video um I I don't know I don't know how to combat that because anyone can take whatever they want and and turn a Twist on it but I think it's probably not a bad idea to have uh uh some kind of a summary at the end of our meetings what did we discuss is kind of like the minutes uh but uh maybe maybe you take 20 minutes after a meeting and and give uh the city manager summary or something like that um and then that way there's another location that people go can go look and get the story because that's what's missing in this communication problem is that there's only one source right now and it's the source that doesn't like anything that we do um and that's that's just what it's turned into voicemail surely no I agree I think that's a good plan is to try to have some recap or something but uh certainly if we can put something on a social media post that would be helpful the one thing that I don't want us to get into and and uh I I wish uh councilman Xavier was here because I'd like for him to handle this is is that if you decide that you're going to be the messenger for the city uh in a public forum uh where it's it now becomes uh Records requestable um you may be setting yourself up for something bad in the future so I don't think it's a a at all a good idea for anybody on the council to be the official messenger for the city of Bellaire Beach um and and I I hope that um maybe if once you come up with something uh Kyle that he won't have a need to do that anymore because I last thing I want is for him to wind up in some sort of a legal battle because he's having to go find something that he's he doesn't have so uh just my two cents on that yeah um we have our city email list now as you know not everybody voluntarily signs up to be part of it I think mainly because of the public records aspect of it um but then again where you know I think that the thought behind some of the email blast is they're trying to reach more people but we can't necessarily do that because we have to have them sign up and they have to be voluntarily doing that um when we talk about the next door platform I I like to do more research especially with some of the larger uh government organizations on how if they do get involved on that I I would not recommend hitting on me yeah is more controllable Facebook and on a website I think that that would be that would be more than enough and it doesn't require responses it just needs to be yeah definitely coming from somebody a a city official um um can we try to some of the success element stories we try to capture a good newsletter and I think Patty does a good job at doing that I don't want to um I write the idea of like meeting summary I think that um could help people maybe give them something shorter to follow um on a regular basis but that does make sense um I just don't want to try to um like I said she does she put so much effort into the newsletter maybe we get that somehow out there you know so we're not redoing kind of the same thing in multiple ways I think certainly the meetings would be would be playing uh just so I mean we have these lengthy conversations and back and forth but at the end of the day we we reach a consensus on something and this this is the direction we think we're going on this particular topic and uh it doesn't have to be in depth of who said what or anything like that but just a general gist of uh this is it looks like this is the direction like tonight we talked about the drainage plan hey we discussed the drainage plan there's all the streets that are going to be impacted stay tuned okay you know things like that yeah and uh uh I know it's last thing you want is more on your plate but I still think that uh it's something that would help the city dramatically right last thing I want is anyone to look at next door as their primary source of news about Bel Air Beach all right and we go on we don't want to get involved in something that we put you know factual you know evidence or news out there and then how to be a forum where anyone can tag on no you know because it will never yeah it's the endless battle and I agree with this if I didn't add here the the challenges here first is no one's I don't think in the history of ever been persuaded by a railroaded social media post um but the added element for you folks is a challenge is the as you explain the platforms being mindful of the public records UH responsibilities and challenges that come with that whether it's just it's enough to retain your post but if it does have a thread element um to it or a comment threat element your ability to retain that as a dynamic record because from Monday to Wednesday maybe nobody comments on Thursday somebody does and then nine months later somebody does again and what is our ability to to retain that record and so that that can present a challenge it's all its own I think that the more you stay within the um the platforms that you're can control and on are more accustomed to that may be best understanding I'm coming at it from the legal side and not the political side of trying to reach the most people the easiest way thank you Mr Moore all right so um back to objective number two then for goal number three do we have any other suggestions other than the uh um other than website uh which actually would include your your platform do we need to revisit this later give everybody some time maybe email in their ideas yeah no I think I got yes go three objective one being the website um that you know we're going to continue to look into uh you know who we're using and how it's designed and see if there's a better way to do that and then also what we can do in-house to make you know when it comes to like the online forums and okay things that I would I will say that um Patty's newsletter nicely formatted always looks nice very nice and professional thank you very much what's that I said sometimes I can help and I appreciate it I mean I feel like two I have like we just talked about kind of coming up with a quick uh just way to recount meetings um to get you know the facts directly from the city of what occurred yeah I think that that would work a little revamp on the website and then uh just Master delivery of what are we doing what what did we talk about last night vice mayor sure later you're okay with that yeah that all sounds good to me okay I just keep calling on you because I don't I don't know if you're raising your hand or if you're uh uh not all right uh continue Mr reefer okay so uh go for that's the aesthetic uh goal and this uh is create a vibrant wrapper involved maintained appearance for the city that donates our sense of community or denotes our sense of community and our quality of life and our first subjunction objective we have is the Golf Boulevard beautification project of which we know is underway it's going to take um some more time obviously for the to get the complete design completed um but we are looking for a second objective um to relate to the aesthetic factors um and goals of the community first thing that comes to mind for me is uh continued code enforcement um I mean it's uh uh that's what keeps our our city beautiful now and cars not parked in the streets Lawns are nicely manicured trees are trimmed and homes are you bringing that up reminds me of just last year um which was October when we went through this we talked about coming back around doing another survey as the follow-up to what we've done so yeah okay like that can I add something you sure can can um can we also add the just reviewing the ballet curb I mean I know where we went through and we repaved some of these roads the roads are beautiful but it created ponding and all of these Valley curves and we've got issues throughout the city where the paving has been redone um so if we could just maybe assess that and add that as a objective under goal for I think it would be important and this is for repair yes after Paving we created issues with standing water in those Valley curbs throughout the city so that would be an objective three then or do we want to just toss out code enforcement and uh and make this art because we're doing code enforcement all the time anyway uh I think it needs to be an objective because I know of several areas where we've got slip and fall potential where the water stands so long that it's creating slime in the valley curve and potential problems for residents does that come under the storm water Improvement issue talking about slime well I think it does for what we're currently our project now and if you go through the plan you'll see and I made a point in our meetings that I that we need to stack out the curbing um really Define what our expectations are um you know you're always going to have given our elevations it's it's going to be hard to have the most perfect system um because they work with a lot more fall in a lot of the newer developments but we still can spec it out in a way um to show what we want our end product to be to make sure that we minimize any kind of bonding you know it's interesting also that um I I actually see the resurfacing of our streets as part of beautification because you look at one that's just been done versus one that hasn't been done in 20 years and you I mean it's night and day it just pops whenever you see this done so it's it's funny how this uh storm water project actually does a lot for the beauty of our community by fixing the curbs and the uh um pave in the streets it could almost fit right in Aesthetics also and I think go ahead yeah the one problem I see is that we just there were unintended consequences of these Valley curbs work fine until we came and paved the streets and didn't do anything to the valley curbs that were existing and now we have standing water so we've created some problems on some streets that haven't been corrected there was this Aesthetics or would you consider this public safety and health oh and and then I I would challenge to say that that what you're talking about Falls right into the address and mitigates Street flooding issues it's just a different type of flooding I I would agree it's just wasn't discussed when we're talking about flooding so I don't want it to be overlooked because we think these roads are done and they're not I I got you okay so then we would strip that out and go back to code enforcement I guess uh because what can anyone think of anything else that we could plug into a Statics for objective two foreign just continued code enforcement if anyone thinks of something else let's say email the city manager okay so the last goal is to go far Beach water which is preserve and protect our City's natural Beach and Waterfront environments and we obviously have the B3 nourishment ongoing and uh I thought it comes the beach and water um you know I think of the Beachside and the harbor side and this has kind of been something that's come up in the last couple of meetings where the the discussion of you know saving money up for a for the city to purchase a boat to do maintenance on the harbor side primarily and that's uh that would become useful for the maintenance of our Soma Health balls throughout the city and as well as our markers that are out there for the for the uh wake zones and the uh also the piling signs that we have in the south side of the city so I mean whether or not what our ultimate decision is on that uh purchase uh I think that that kind of when we talk about strategic planning aligning with the budget the budget aligning with Street strategic planning um that kind of comes to my mind Council well Aesthetics in the beach um it was brought up about breaking it more often um but there's no beach that's the problem you know um it's it's uh it's an ongoing project it has to happen every six years uh I think really the I thought the original plan was five once yes that's from the 50s yeah that was in document um I I will have more information uh once I get to hear from the horse's mouth at this meeting but um it's 10 counties that are being um that are basically having this problem and uh um I spoke with representative Luna about this and um wanted to get her take because she's been working really hard trying to get the Army Corps to change their mind also and in fact she said that now this is her number one priority more than anything else this is what she's focused on is uh getting the Army Corps to change their mind and the way that she's planning on doing it is there's a way that um I believe it's next year not this year but next year they're going to change some language in uh on the books that will prevent the on it'll basically take the power away from the Army Corps to do what they're doing um in the meantime this year uh The Big C Mayors voted all together to allow her to do forget what the name of the rule is I can't I can't remember the name of the rule but it's it's basically it's a tool that they have to strip the funding of people that aren't doing their job correctly and so she's actually going to see if she can if she can send that through and defund uh the the individuals that are responsible for making this happen but I don't know I don't know I think at the end of the day we're probably not ever going to get that funding again because until the federal government can in 100 on our beaches and no and no one can say all right this is my land and I'm not signing an easement I think that they're just not going to do it maybe she'll have good luck with it but um uh I I think there's too many Supreme Court cases stating that you know property rights on the beach for some of these residents and this supreme court I don't think would ever yeah but the problem is is that is the the line that they're drawing in the sand to from where where they want the easements to go some of them are beyond the mean high high water mark or mean high water line and there they come right up into people's backyards and they're uh they don't want to do it because it's perpetual if it was a two-year thing or something like that they might might be more receptive to it but and and the problem here is the the last time they did an ecl line was probably 15 20 years ago they did it you know and you've had so many Beach storms and abortions taking away sand these private owners have never established or replenished their sand their Supreme Court cases stop the Beatrice nourishment it was right across our state saying hey you lost your property rights because you didn't take care of the thing Scalia wrote a decision on it and and I'm telling you we live in an area where we don't have 19 blocks re-nourished since I've been here and way before I've been here but you look at the topography two years after the beach re nourishment and it's all leveled out all that sand just fills right in and our neighboring Town gets free public sand at their news and um well the reason why that happens is because they don't the reason why they don't get it is because they didn't have any public land to give for parking and I say that's argument can be addressed because we there's three beach access lots I'm not I'm not going to get into that Uber buses and everything like that that have access to those lives and meanwhile and meanwhile city of Bellaire Beach gave up all their rights so I'm sorry but we you know and we should not have but we did and that's where we're at today so I think the biggest problem is that um the Army Corps should have just done it anyway all the way down the beach yeah and not skipped Bel Air Shore but that's that's another story and uh that's something much bigger than all of us uh vice mayor Shirley you were gonna you were gonna chime in on something yes I just wanted to add on the beach and Waterfront that we need to when we're doing code review review our code regarding our Mooring policy and restrictions within our jurisdiction of Waterfront we live in a waterfront Community both intercoastal and Beachside and we need to put into place in our codes some restrictions to boat Moorings and um things of that nature and I think that should be part of our plan our strategic plan is it enforceable at all absolutely if we put the right code in place such as pumping proof of pumping out your boat that's been sitting there for three months rather than you know those boats are just pumping overboard so there's feces raw feces on our Shores and no one's doing anything about it and that's where um I I understand what you're saying I say the same thing there's a giant houseboat out there right now that um that I'm pretty sure people are living on and then there's a yacht uh just adjacent to that the houseboat and I know I see people on that one every day and I I don't see them leaving so they're living on that boat uh and and you're right they probably are pumping out right into the uh into the ocean um so it's only been there what a couple weeks though even two weeks is too long oh I'm not saying yeah that's because there was another boat out there resin brought up to me and I think it's moved now I said it's been there for like two months we're slowly becoming um uh Bellaire Bluff uh is what's happening they're they're slowly filling it in over there and we're gonna lose control of it it's what's going to happen if we can't figure out a way to stop it but um I don't know I I have yet to have to hear uh a good solution I can tell you and I've met I've mentioned this several times in Key West they require proof of pump out weekly and if you don't have it you need to move along and that's but we have to have a boat to reinforce that code and if we aren't able to enforce a code we put in place there's no point putting in place so I'm just suggesting that we start getting serious about it before we have a problem well that would be a sheriff's enforcement not us both there is well serif does our code enforcement right so how much do we want to bring them on what I could what I could add to this dialogue is as a you know especially as we um have so many communities up and down our beaches there are practical limitations to enforcement however those be first just jurisdictional or they are waters you know even though we can see them from parts of our community are they in fact our Waters to patrol and enforce upon if the area around us do we have the resources or um to the extent we rely on Community Partners do they have the resources are they willing to commit to doing those things sometimes the answer is no or it will eventually that's just not the highest priority and I'm not that's a no impuning pcso I just mean in general um you have you have when you're working with Community Partners they have their own priority lists Etc um so I can tell you other communities have approached this I'd be interested um membership to know more about that Key West example and we can talk offline because one of the challenges I've heard in in other communities is the issue of your territorial Waters where you're enforcing um it's one thing if you're talking about somebody Mooring just off of your Marina or your morning fear that's another when they're just out in the middle of the intercoastal and what your ability is to go out there and say Hey you know better beach has a problem with this even if you're not in Miller Beach proper so uh just some concerns but as far as you folks go with their own objective setting you do as you wish and we will of course um provide you whatever information research you need to make the policy that flows from your goals and objectives all right so as far as verify what what we should actually do I I don't really know if beachway nourishment is uh is something as much of a city issue as as I mean it definitely it impacts us all but as far as the day-to-day responsibilities and what city manager reefer is having to uh accomplish in in his list of goals uh is Beach nourishment should it even be on this list uh or is this something on the outside that that we're all trying to deal with to help the city but we're not we're not funding it we're not we're this city will never get a drop of sand uh on its own it's just not going to happen uh you'll never get to permitting you'll never if you wanted a jetty or whatever you're never going to get any of that they aren't because the permitting is required by the Army Corps uh and even now with the county designing their plan they're basically copying the Army course plan and they're going to have to apply for permitting to the Army Corps the difference is is that we're not asking for any money instead we're going to have to do it ourselves you know ourselves with our bed tax um which I don't have a problem with because it's tourism and so you know if that happens uh if we have to fund it that way well then we just don't get some things and we spend our money wisely on on our cash cow and uh and keep it alive and fed well um so my question is should this be objective one or should it be something else I think the boats are really becoming a major issue and I agree with uh vice mayor Shirley is it objective one or is or uh should it be an objective too yeah the big tree nourishment I think goes in addition to the beach in the natural Beach it goes under the tax value too if we don't have Beach the beachfront property and the tax value goes down considerably um but it's true it's for my goal for the city is it anything that we can accomplish yes I mean we pretty much are at the mercy of what happens between the fed the state and the county yes absolutely but I think it's still a goal yeah same way with red cotton we can only handle a minimal amount of fish pick up I mean we only have two people I mean we rely on the county to do a complete sweep yeah they don't they didn't sleep us no we we typically do it all um the one time that they did come through we had already picked up it was this second third waves that they kind of helped out with yeah because I saw contractors on there yeah right I'll tell you firsthand by the time they came through it had already been picked up I'll tell you what the county was for whenever you look at um Treasure Island St Pete Beach the fingers in those areas you you could walk on the fish there were so many and that's where the county came in and that's where you get your that's where you get some of your tax revenue back whenever they're cleaning up a disaster like that they didn't spend a lot of time here because it was manageable and we were able to actually do it I would much rather them be down there helping those people than coming up here and plucking the fish here and a fish there but um we're we're situated in in a certain way to where uh geographically most of the the big catastrophes it seems to be south of um John's Pass seems to be what and I drove my boat through there one day I'm not kidding it looked like tomato soup the water coming out from behind my boat as I drove through it it was thick Orange I mean there it wasn't a skimmer it was all the way to the ocean floor everything was orange you couldn't see through it at all it's terrible uh and and that's that's what the County's been taking care of um so yeah they we do take care of our own uh in that case but I'm sure that there's always a possibility they can be worse you know um so back to goal five uh Jody would you like to be objective one the boats well I think um yeah I mean that's fine if that's a objective one but I think we still need to keep the even though we can't do a whole lot with regards to beach renourishment it still needs to be a priority on our list and um and so I think it should stay on there as uh something we should focus on okay we'll remove that one on there and then we'll make the uh the boats uh as objective too if everybody's okay with that I will say this is the beauty of Bellaire Beach we've we've got goals but they're they're modest you know we we don't we don't have huge problems in this community uh that's that's one of the blessings of living here is that I if you if if you put this same list in front of clear water or St Petersburg or the county it would be overwhelming so we're very fortunate all right is that a good start for you yes uh would anyone else like to add on uh add on to this conversation before we move on to item number three going once going twice all right so we are on to item number three which I believe is placed on here by Mr Roberts I'm looking there we go uh yes discussion on maximum parking time limits take it away Mr Roberts thank you sir yeah many of you may have received an email from a gentleman I can't even recall his name doesn't matter and then that was followed up with a uh [Music] yeah so I actually had a phone call with him and it just just the conversation uh brought up my question which is I know when we it's always good to kind of like take a look at these things we put in place to see if we can tweak it if it makes more sense or just leave it the way it is right and I talked with um Kyle and he checked on a report and the question was do we have very many people that are parking at Morgan Street and then once the three-hour time limit expires they jump in their vehicle uh and move it down to the marina because they can the where system is set up so it's three hours at each location not three hours period which of course we could make that change so we thought that made more sense we could just say you've got three hours at either the marina either Morgan Street or city hall right we could do that if we thought that made sense so the real question is do we think that three hour period that we decided because I started thinking as I was talking to them I can't really remember why specifically they went with three hours so that's really the question are we good with three hours do we feel like we should adjust that or do we feel like we should leave it at three hours for our total City so that they can't move to another location yeah I I can I can kind of recap what happened um basically we have limited parking for our community correct we have the three air uh the three uh Bel Air Shore areas then we have Morgan Morgan Park we have the uh the marina and then we've got here correct and what people were doing was they were parking here at a bargain rate walking across the street and filling the parking lot up and uh uh residents of Bellaire Beach were not able to find a parking spot over so they go to Morgan Park and be full well then they would have to go across the street to find parking and uh we decided that really uh we're we're doing what the minimum requirement to offer public parking for non-residents and so according to who what's that according to who the three hour men a month well no I'm not saying that it's it we're just required to give public or to provide a public parking that is three hours or something I don't think we would actually I don't think that there was a this is from Beach we had to have so many Americans that's what makes a Salesman for Beach nourishment okay and so what happened was uh you had people that were that were coming here they were paying a minimal fee and they were going to the beach um and the parking lot was filling up and even whenever we allowed an all-day rate uh or you know you you were able to fill the meter um or but originally we had a limit in what was happening was uh I think we had minimum three hours and then they would just walk back over and they put they fill it back up with three more hours okay well we just didn't want that right and so we tried to figure out a way to make it inconvenient to come spend the day at Bellaire Beach if you want a resident if you were not a resident now this gentleman sent the email and he said he's a resident and So I responded to him and I said fine go to City Hall pay five bucks and you can park all you want year round and I didn't hear another peep out of him he's not arrested I specifically asked him he didn't say it in the email he was a resident he used something he said be residents yeah he he didn't say like I I agree with you right he didn't say that on residents yeah you would take it so I specifically asked him are you a resident of age he said no yeah and I I talked to him and I said a nice gentlemen I explained the whole thing about featuring nurse and us giving up to Morgan Park and he goes and I said you know a lot of our residents don't go to the beach till 11 o'clock 12 o'clock the parking lots filled up by that so he said to me says well did you ever consider the first come first serve I said yeah I said that's why we put the three hours in there because our residents pay for the parking lot pay for the upkeep the only reason we open it up to the public was because it beats renourishment and now we're not getting it and it's actually been on the table to pool in that uh public park you know I told him to go down to Sand Key Park all day for five bucks yeah you know but you know if we look at it like we have um Sixth Street right and 12th Street and 19th Street those lots I don't think I've ever seen them fail well that's different they're under a different restriction and you cannot open them up ever for public parking no no I realized that I realized that so Morgan Street is the one and and I get that the people that live on the uh more northern part of our city so they want to pardon at Morgan Street because that's where they live and some of them would like to walk I mean you know drive because you're deep or kind of into the intercoastal area and drive there so now you drive there and it's full right I I would say that if they're driving over anywhere they probably should drive over to Sand Key Park um just because again there's if you look at the North Side there's very little there's I mean there's nowhere to go and uh I hate to say it but they live in Sand Key and they have a giant Park that thousands of parking spaces and a big huge wide Beach yeah and it's not it's not disintegrated their beaches pristine compared to ours really yeah because they have a break wall they're right there they have a break while protecting it it was all the sand flows South and there's no water knocking it down so whatever it you know we've lost ours but they've almost kept all of theirs you know it gets it's a little thinner as you get a little more North but uh you start getting anywhere near there near that Park and they have plenty of sand no that means but so really my question was is this something I just wanted to toss it after that we want to change the three hour to a different number or do we want to even go further which I guess doesn't make a lot of sense because then we're you know cutting up our nose spider face thing we're we're telling people three hours period so you can't move to the marina and give us more money I I don't really have a problem with them moving to the marina and the reason why is because um uh it's not full that's what I'm saying but I don't want to give them all day parking either so right how's her how's her Revenue with what since we changed it is it still coming in yeah the same spot up yeah that's why it doubled out and that's the only reason you don't care I mean right I mean we're not here to service I mean I got one of my friends um came up to me he lives in Largo he gets his way to drop him off now the sheriff jumping because your wife dropped him off at Six Strings the sheriff said hey this is for Valor B transplants you know right so we're good we're moving it the way it is vice mayor Shirley would you like to chime in on this topic I would agree to uh potentially extend it another hour to four hours with the caveat that we reserve two spaces for City residents like we used to at Morgan Park since we're not getting Beatrice nourishment and they're not keeping up their end of the deal why are we giving up all of our parking yeah unless you have a sticker but if you park in the meter's spot and it's full there's no reserved spaces for Bellar Beach residence like there used to be and always had been up until a few years back the last re-nourishment I I I'm fine with leaving it alone and just keeping it the way that it is what about let's just do an informal survey Frank leave it alone you guys have two spots that would say better Beach citizens only because if you park there you'd have to have a sticker I don't I think you'd have an input correct absolutely we already have an enforcement problem in the regular we all 6th and 12 and 19. people Park in there that don't have stickers yeah Jody is it okay if we just leave this one alone I'm still in support of taking back two spaces and I have been it's been a big issue for me that we do not have reserved spaces for residents at Morgan Park and I think we need to go back to that okay well right now the majority shows after the two spots well now now we'll change so it's a it's a 50 50 oh just here I think the council member of living is is Belinda yes I'm here I um leave it to how we uh have it currently the minimum of three hours you've been pretty quiet all right you know I I thought I was talking to you at the beginning everybody was uh saying what I thought so um I just kept quiet as they were speaking up on my behalf okay all right uh well uh we will we'll just move on in this one and uh right now vice mayor surely I'm just curious this is periodical my own information are we are we completely filling nothing that was paid um with with um certain residents parking tickets I'm sorry I don't know what I didn't hear what you said I'm just wondering how often are you going over there and it's completely full anytime on Saturday and Sunday if you want to stop there you cannot there's not parking for residents and it's the only uh lot with facilities so if you have small children with you it's kind of important yeah do you think that it would be impossible it was that way for many many years I've lived here for 23 24 years and it wasn't until the last renourishment we gave up all those spaces in Morgan Park okay so um do you think we could just get away with putting two signs and call it a day yeah it's no different than what Indian Rocks Beach does they have they have Reserve spaces for their residents you have to have a sticker to park in those places on the question how much would it cost for a fine if I if I put one there I'm from wherever I park my car how much would a parking ticket cost I don't think um I I don't think we could set it but it's right now though probably cheaper than uh yeah it's probably cheap so I'm gonna put on that spot I'll pay you 55 dollars okay I'll stay there for six hours and I beat you for five bucks if you um if you if I mean we have directors we can issue a directive to uh to the police to patrol those spots well but I'm saying is if I get a ticket I'm gonna stay there for five to six seven hours and then I'm gonna maybe just sit it depends on how soon the police detect you there uh but uh because you don't have to tell him you know yeah they still only give a ticket though and I'm gonna give one ticket per day see now in those spots we could enforce Towing we could make those throwaways always be a big ticket well he should but I mean are we going to do that is what I'm saying because if I if I go there once and I get a 50 dollar take a 55 I think I'm saying hey come here for the whole day well that would be really to make sure that it didn't happen a Tollway Zone Bellaire Beach residence only and uh uh did this change anyone's mind if we do it totally don't dollar Beach residence only I think that will really messes up for Bee Tree nourishment well that might be it it would definitely break the contract even if we even if we said Baylor Beach residents only yes hurricane we did the thank you we raised it ten dollars it was hearing an issue and then no no it doesn't matter it's perpetual it's done we never will get that back we can never get out of those easements okay yeah we're done so that being said um you're I like your idea Jody but I I think it's not doable I think that's the problem and that's that must be why it went away yeah I would give her I would give uh the whole right side to Ballard Beach residence I mean yeah I would too but um I think Leslie made a good point yeah um they're not giving us the Army Corps is not honoring their side and this might be his question I I agree but um you know once you sign something away whether you made a bad deal or not uh it's there's literally there's no obligation on therefore to continue doing it I would like to see how many parking spaces we committed versus what we have out there because that's what it is it's how many parking spaces have we committed through the city for public parking yeah I can provide that I have notes um I think it was first brought up when Lynn was here um but there's notes and emails but I can I can send the documents to everyone so that they can call the county it's there it's their isma it's it's I don't it doesn't belong to the Army Corps it's the county that got them the agreement the uh the Perpetual easements on our land yeah but the the agreement that was it specifically says that we have to provide so many parking public yeah that's what I'm saying I'm sure for signing the easement there's something somewhere that says this is what you must do it does yeah um and send that to you okay all right yeah uh well I'll tell you what we'll look into it and then we'll discuss it again at the next work session and see uh See if we've changed our minds or if we can do anything to uh to help up there on that end everybody okay with that yes all right cool sounds good all right now we are on to um General business uh so um yes I got some things whenever just to let you know go ahead okay um so I put oh I I sent an email out um it was on August 8th it was uh Hillary Pinellas reached out to me because during our comp plan uh review with the plannings on board uh it was brought up that some of the annual traffic counts they were concerned that that the way they did the counts that um it possibly didn't reflect our Peak um hours during the day when when our traffic is the highest because their cows are more focused around the uh commuter traffic in the county and um people members that were planning a zoning board felt that as our traffic patterns could possibly be different in violation they requested that if possible if Filipinos did some specific counts for the Long Beach to to make sure that um that it falls in line or just that we get the correct uh information so uh Linda Fisher who you know has come presented here for a comp plan reached out to me and asked um if we do want these studies done that we need to make a requests uh to the the plan he's the executive director for Pinellas and they'd be happy to do them um so I sent an email out to the council trying to just get a consensus if that was agreeable to each member of the council I heard back from three out of seven so I just wanted to bring it up um because I I I'm interested in doing this um Corinth I think it's a something that they will provide for us and it might give us some insight into the traffic patterns here at baller Beach I uh I I don't have a problem with them doing a study however I would greatly appreciate this city having the opportunity to um agree or disagree with their ultimate decision of of what they think is best for us because they may be wanting to they may come out with a plan that we absolutely hate and don't want to don't want to consider it um such as maybe something we've already done in the past or you know that didn't work out so well or say they come back with yeah we need to rip out this island and uh uh and the crosswalk uh you know those are some things I think I think I'm one of the ones that responded to you and said yeah I'd be interested but yeah so they know we don't yeah and now we've never brought up in this discussion it was it was more along the lines of just making sure that our patterns uh were in line with the rest of the studies that they're doing um and and if you remember in the in the statistical section of the account plan it gave uh ratings on the kind of congestion of the major roads which um Causeway Boulevard and Golf Boulevard and we were pretty much the worst rating and actually I think North Gulf Boulevard instead of an Africa like it was like the second to worst wedding which didn't actually line up with what you would think so it was kind of requested that we wish student studies and and see if um if they are rated that bad and then and give that information and try to use it for improvement but that had nothing to do with um with them recommending us uh how we you know change our road our lanes or traffic lights or anything good good all right well I'm uh so I heard back from um member Livingstone and member Roberts shame on the rest of you [Laughter] I didn't see them there read it I'm big with it yeah okay you want to go around or no play uh Mr Roberts you okay with the uh the study well yeah I responded and said he was good okay right uh Jody yeah I'm good with it I think it's a good idea to take another look at them all right Belinda yes I'm still good with that yep all right Frank active futility but go ahead okay right any anything else Mr Weaver yeah uh we got our uh insurance or not so I put in front of you today came in um late last week but I was notified today um if if you go through Lima Ryan uh you start with the general live on coverage that increase a premium of 17 percent the Cyber liabilities only five percent the rli then covers one of 12. the other physical damage cover went up further um the big one like projected was the property coverage that went up 98 so that you know we we plan on 75 that actually went a little higher um workers compensation actually just went up one percent uh so over you know a total premium went up 44 and is close to what we budgeted based on how we spread out uh 10 on certain line items and the 75 on the property um but this is this is the quote and they provided some material with some explanation but they I did talk to the representative from the battle League of cities and she is willing to come and answer questions and talk about it and I I feel um you know we should probably take her up on it um just to bring her to a meeting and hear an explanation I think that they they feel as Justified to make care and they you know they're offering to answer questions so I'm sure that Mr Baker has plenty questions uh concerning Insurance um this state's become an almost unbearable to live in I mean uh from homeowners to everything I mean I just read that lawsuit again today with this little flood and um I talked to that woman you said he was going to come yeah she told me she'd come in here too but she's saying you know the rising costs and materials and everything like that yeah it's true but how do you explain 98 percent okay a two back four is a 98 higher than it was two years ago um this is this is price gouging 101. I mean I I talked to our State Rep um she hasn't gotten back to me on the win insurance and everything like that it's just is it's becoming uncommon yeah I mean uh some of these prices have gone down and and these rates have just keep going through the roof what I can tell you is the insurance is one of the number one priorities of uh the league of cities and also um with the Florida League Mayors the uh Suncoast League of cities um everybody's everybody's hurting in the same way and so uh uh you have 40 percent of Floridians are not picking up Insurance yeah and I don't know how a new homeowner who buys at home here unless they have such Deep Pockets because your insurance bill is going to be if you live on the beach it's going to be fifteen hundred dollars minimum just minimum a month more than your house payment yeah you know I'm not talking about taxes or anything else I mean it's just I I and I've Had State reps say to me well this is going to kill the property values and that's going to kill us because we rely on the tax base yeah yeah so I need an answer what's what's the solution I don't think that there is one uh not any not anything that I can think of I don't know I have to get the Ouija board out I mean uh um so that the explanation I got was we kind of got a double hit uh when it came to last year being when they we surveyed our assets they have a five-year every five years they survey the assets so we kind of were up for the what did you guys get now that we have to insure um so that kind of hit us at the same time that we have these storms I hit Florida that cause a lot of damage and they're seeing the claims go through the roof um and I'm not another factor is um they are offering a uh specific uh asset service um per asset and then also a blanket coverage and I guess in some of the situations in the cities that got hit they had specific asset coverage they weren't updated enough where um they had the proper insurance to cover what what hit them so they foreign municipalities with a blanket coverage to in the future prevent that from happening what I like to ask her if she came here is you know this is property insurance okay so if a storm hits okay when you have to have a win insurance policy we have to have a hurricane flood insurance policy they would say that's not our responsibility okay it's property you go see your flood go see your win all right but they're still gouging the hell out of it just like just like a typical homeowners and no one's explaining this to me saying well yeah we have bad storms here yes we do but you don't pay out on those bad storms now you jump on the bandwagon of you and I'm not yelling yeah and you jump on the bandwagon of FEMA and you jump on the bandwagon of citizens or whatever like that but you're not showing me actual hello class is what I'm saying because of these damages now I'm sure there's going to be a lot of uh people lighting up their homes that just have homeowners insurance that they feel uh what's going to come in and uh well that's fire risk and if that insurance fed absolutely but that's the way will work I mean but that hasn't been that hasn't been the fact that's what I'm saying right now it's just really there's no need to this that's saying that this is actually what is costing us money to raise these rage like this what are we going to do here not insurers well we did we talk to the other oh yeah we have seen some of our Market I I'm glad you for doing it I will say that um so whenever I was walking around at the league of cities event I I had this it was a bunch of ribbons for all the programs that we participate in and the different classes I've taken and yeah it's a little bit embarrassing um because there were some people that had like two you know but what I did notice was the very first one I believe was was fmit and um not everybody there had that was wearing that ribbon and so that tells me that not everybody's using the league of cities insurance and um it's probably in our best interest to reach out for other quotes just to see you know I spoke to an Eric Hart and uh he's with the fmitas and about what percentage rates for um all the other cities like Indian Rocks they're not covered under F MIT the deer ain't and I think he only had one is Us in Bel Air Shores with them so you're right yeah a lot of them not and I think he said we had some mitigating circumstances where people didn't want to underrite us right now but maybe they'll clear up in the future and they just told me that they they knew they couldn't compete right now with fmit well and that's I mean they're they're way uh it's just a giant fine a giant pool of money that they're collecting and they're self-insuring is what they're doing you know they're I mean they're they're not in it for I don't believe they're in it for profit I think they're in it to cover their butts make sure that in the event we have something like what happened down south they have the money to cover us you know but uh uh I would always you know be willing to look at other quotes if they were cheaper and and had the same coverage at minimum but it's ugly I'm I'm paying one of my insurances tomorrow and it's astronomical but I'm having okay yeah just paid all Minds that's right I thought it'd ever become maybe September who is it um Lindsay Joe Henson and she's the account executive West Florida okay I think she recently took over you've got some other information that you can get to us looks like we had some other papers there that worked with students run supervised um what I did is I took the uh the uh invoices that I calculated the percentage of the increase per line item okay but I could provide whatever you'd like yeah just a quick note we can respond in fact I mean Indian Rocks beats not covering any shorts not covered horse riding can not covering Madeira Beach not covered Bel Air sure is an experiencing 90 property coverage increase by this group everyone I say is not only Us in Valor short he's covered by this list but the other the other ones have brought somebody on somebody else okay well some it may be possible that One-Stop shopping is not into our advantage we know we can do a quick uh clerk survey possibly to find out who the other I think it's the other you know the problem is if you leave there and you go to a new one are they going to gouge you right off you know I've seen companies uh they they rear you in one year and now you've been actually even worse cancel you right that's that's the letter through we will say you won't have to worry about it with these guys right um because they our interest is the league of cities is uh very helpful anything else you'd like to add uh it should be it Joey or Belinda would you like to say anything uh make a comment on the insurance situation I have nothing to add this is Jody um clearly insurance rates are going up I don't care what segment of business you're in and that's just the time we're in right now things are tough all over okay um if there are no other comments on that I'm not finished yet all right we're still under uh uh General business so I'm uh did you have anything else by the way I just want to update we have the deadline for the RFP is going to be this Friday at 2 p.m I had a um are immediately um down of the proposals and sent them out I have right now three members on the evaluation committee uh myself uh Community Services administrator and the chair of the citizens advisory committee ronce again uh we're going to review them well independently and then we're going to meet on Monday um kind of got to see play by year see what comes in um and we know you know we're under kind of a time crunch here so we're to evaluate to give a recommendation for a negotiation to council um I did reach out to waste management and got a women's proposal to extend at our current contract rate plus the four percent CPI and shipping fee increase for which is minimal for October takes it so because currently our contract ends in September but that'll take us to October you know it people are saying right um by this time but if need be um I'll bring that to the uh September council meeting for approval by Council um just so we can get it done all right cool all right uh if that's it uh I spoke with um Winnie Grimes today at the um election Capital uh headquarters in Pinellas and uh just asked some general questions um and Patty correct me if I get these numbers wrong but uh whenever our election aligns with a large election uh we're roughly running 1376 dollars per election okay if uh our election falls on an odd cycle to where there's just a few municipalities and and they're really just doing it for us our elections are almost four thousand dollars so there's a substantial cost savings uh not only by aligning with the general and the uh the midterm elections but also we would reduce the number of Elections we have so uh rather than two every six years it would be two every eight years if we if we made this change and um so I wanted to to give you that information to give you some more to think about also the next 11 uh next election is March the 19th so if we decided to move forward with this um it would we would have to have the plan uh and the language turned into um Pinellas County on December the 19th uh so uh before I I go around the room for opinions on this I wanted to give Randy the opportunity to kind of speak his mind on what it would look like to move forward um thank you Mr Mayor as far as what it would take to move forward we would do an ordinance that would stick call for the issue election with the resolution setting forth the ballot language to accompany that and so I would draft and prepare that I I have begun the process of one of the questions I was posed at the last Workshop was a meeting on or rather a memo on what you can and can't do in that process in terms of advocacy during the 2022 election year and changed what a city can pay money for um or contribute towards in the ways of advocacy on issue elections so substantially limiting it and so I'm trying to write that for you as well but as far from what I said it's really just you know what are my marching orders where we left last time was there was a general consensus to move in this direction that people have sort of let it run away and see if that changed in the interval as far as from when I said I believe I have I was reading quite for this morning but I believe I have general or rather the August to September meetings um you would have a hearing October hitting in November and send it to them in send it to them about language for the December hearing December deadline but I want to have that process done clearly in November 11 if we needed to redo anything before the December 19 we also have the benefit of oops we got to fix this one okay so I um I gave an assignment to the council to speak to your constituents and see what the general feel was of the public if they thought it was a good idea a bad idea I I have had a few people say they didn't like the idea but it's the same people that don't like anything um so I I realize that's going to happen and I have to just because you okay sometimes I have to I have to weigh which what they're really thinking or if I even need to take their opinion into consideration uh everybody here that votes has an opinion and so I try to not form my own opinion about their overall uh what their motive was but uh I had personally I had um very good responses uh whenever I spoke to to people around the community I spoke to probably 30 people and I've had numerous emails and phone calls and uh whatever and uh I think they all like the idea but I wanted to see what everybody else what your feelings were and if you were serious about this or if uh it's lost its luster Mr Roberts I think it made sense I did talk to several people not 100 but most people felt specifically aligning with the general election in the midterms absolutely made sense um yeah I'm good with it and uh so we were what we were talking about just a quick refresher moving from three years to four years um aligning with the general and midterm elections reduction of council members from seven to five an increase of terms uh by one additional term and so what that would do is if you were newly elected you could serve up to 12 years before you would term out and then you would have to go back do to take the year off and then or now it would be two years uh that you would be required to take off and then you could come back and um and do it again if you wanted to and to be clear uh to add Clarity to that what you're talking about is putting that to the voters that would go to the voters in terms of a charter referendum it's not if you're saying here that like I'm in favor of that being put to the voters it's not so much I am voting and this will happen correct and that is one of the um one of the this information campaigns that's going on out there is that certain people think that we're dictating this and and that's not the case uh we're just giving the public the option to say yes they like this idea and they want the city to move forward or no they don't and we keep things the way that they are but so Leslie uh I would be in favor of moving forward go in favor but uh vice mayor Shirley same answer as I gave at the last work session I'm in favor of moving forward I'm not a huge fan of the three term okay all right uh Mr Livingstone I'm in favor of moving forward all right and Mr Roberts he's not here Mr Banker um keeping the status quo I think 12 years in August come a dictator rather than a representative okay fair enough all right uh well uh I was I was really hoping Mr Roberts would have been here too but uh he's right there yeah um no wonder it's almost 9 30. okay so uh yeah I would uh still like to hear uh Mrs Abel's comments but I guess we'll do that next time so the question is is uh do we want to uh move forward and uh and get started immediately with drafting this up I will plan to draft it up okay good deal uh I don't have anything else last call uh would anyone like to add in is that a quick question so what's the status of the full-time uh admin do we get anybody of mine in an offer they accepted today awesome good good thanks two to three weeks hopefully okay uh well if uh nothing else ocean do I have a motion to adjourn all right the sunset for you my favorite hi good night yeah"
