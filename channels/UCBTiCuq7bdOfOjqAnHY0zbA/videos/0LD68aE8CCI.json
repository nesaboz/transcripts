raise your hand and wait to be called on we ask that you limit your comments to them more than three minutes any council member Floyd respond to the citizens comments please hold your responses until we reach Council comments at the end of the meeting before I call on anyone in the audience I already have one card of living choir from 111 14th Street please step up to the police and to my understanding the daily mom had yielded her good evening mayor Janis Council men and women thank you for serving our community my name is Vicki Dwyer and my husband Russ our marine son Peter and I live on 14th Street we moved here just one year ago and mostly love our community I'm here today to address a topic from the February 25th email will come where councilman Lloyd Roberts is looking for solutions to traffic on the gulf and Causeway two-way turn his proposed idea is to remove the two lanes turning left onto the causeway restore the blinking yellow light use the two right lanes to proceed straight the left outer Lane will be the only turn laying onto the causeway remove the existing Island and palm tree but the crosswalk would remain the existing Center merge will be the left-hand turn lane supposedly ensuring that North Sound traffic is not affected with the proposed changes 170 or more driving residents from the 85 houses on 12th 13th 14th and 15th streets will be affected after living here for a year I see these traffic patterns because I drive in and around them multiple times a day and I use the crop the crosswalk on a regular basis the amount of traffic turning left to the causeway always far outweighs the traffic going straight what would be the purpose of creating two lanes to go straight toward Indian Rocks when this is not a traffic problem and we're just quickly into one lane anyway as I dissect this proposal I will agree that a blinking yellow light turning left is long overdue the rest I am completely in disagreement with with a res as a resident of that immediate area I can attest that there is always a backup of traffic turning left on the causeway during the heavier traffic times but cars are able to condense into the two turn lanes and then make the turn having a flashing yellow light will absolutely allow them to keep moving currently to turn left I have to sneak out into traffic and wait in the center lane until there is an opening or the traffic clears up with the proposed changes that center lane will not be available to any of us on those streets for this purpose making it very difficult to turn left because of the fact that there is still constant traffic coming from the south whether it be Bridge traffic or Indian Rocks traffic cars though coming from either direction rarely slowed down for cars pulling out it would be much more difficult to get into that turn lane no one it will be even more difficult to cross through that single long Lane of cars to get to the far Lane to cross toward Indian Rocks removing the island and the Beautiful palm tree would definitely take away a part of the charm of Bel-Air Beach and would absolutely create a greater problem with pedestrian Crossing currently it is still not safe to cross toward the beach because cars in general do not pay attention and the flashing yellow lights aren't bright enough to stop the cars as evidenced by cars still running through flashing lights when we cross by removing the island and changing two lanes to three lanes of traffic will only make crossing a greater safety issue we can all predict that National the natural response for drivers to speed up in order to make that light since there's only one lane and they won't be paying attention to light flashing lights for The Pedestrian Crossing after talking with many neighbors within the community no one can understand why this change would be made moving forward with this proposal would be a mistake and a complete disservice to the surrounding residents and will highly restrict our ability to get out of our streets the only part I support is the left turn arrow to a flashing yellow as I close I would strongly encourage this Council to maintain a focus on our community to make improvements that centers on the needs and the conveniences for us the tax paying residents of Bel Air Beach and to be careful of changing or fixing things to accommodate the traffic increases from visitors and tourists as long as we are a thoroughfare for tourists we will always have heavy traffic which can never be fixed with these proposed changes it will only a portion of our own Community thank you for your time thank you Mr Warren yes please come up and give us your name and your address my name is Kathleen Glaser and I live on 21st Street 106. tonight we're still engaged in City Council on two items of conservatively both deal with disability accommodation I would like this need to reload the rich connection from Gulf Boulevard to the beach just north of the Miller Beach Motel I bought this up to a council member last year and had heard nothing perhaps together you can come up with plan that doesn't exclude the handicap moving close by I'm using this path to the beach this relatively new great structure does not be the requirements it is a safe residence location last year at the end of the summer my son and my handicapped grandson took the bridge to the beach my grandson rides in a canvas wagon as he is unable to walk and his motor skills on his right side of the core my son of grandson reached the edge of the bridge where it meets the beach and because of the core design of the bridge the wagon tipped over my grandson and son with Hospital ground my son failed trying to stop the wagon from Code attorney soon after my son tried it again approaching the beach at a different angle and then once again the wagon was tossed and the handicap branstoned stars with his dad into the beach my grandson is now afraid to get to the beach using this path I walked the bridge to see what the problem was and as a disabled veteran I found it challenging to walk up the bridge and in especially when it's Sandy the handrail is too wide to get a grip and I was afraid I was good the second disability accommodation from the 199 to your attention is that my grandson has learned to walk with a small dog and since we have no side Works he walks in the street I would like to see if the city can put up traffic signs or warning drivers to be aware there's a small disabled child on the 21st Street thank you Miss Glaser yes John Hendrick Chung is at 22nd Street I'd like to speak to councilman zabel's suggestion or thoughts on this traffic issue for historical purposes when we moved here in 2015 there was only one single left turn lane with a flashing yellow light um because how I've been involved in safety in my military career and I will look at what we have there proximity of that crosswalk to this traffic light did not make sense only because there's a parking lot over there um the councilman suggested that the island go away and leave the crosswalk you're still here regardless of going to have traffic jammed up no matter how many left turn Lanes you have and again previous administrations for historical purposes have attempted to work with the city of Clearwater Beach to no avail we are because of their problem and rotary we're the um default to get to the beaches I don't know what the solution is but if I were in a position to help make decisions I take the crosswalk and the median out all together traffic being what it is I understand it can be backed up all the way to 22nd Street unfortunately we've learned in a time we've been here we get our stuff done Monday through Friday and limit any vehicular movement on the weekends only because you can't get in or get up that down the Gulf Boulevard and even when my wife and I will walk to the uh to the beach over there by the hotel it's next to impossible for traffic to yield three lanes thank you thank you Mr Hampton yes sir Mr mole okay hi everybody Roger maul115 Causeway Boulevard across the street I just learned about this island proposal to A bash of so I thought like the previous gentleman to get a little historic perspective originally when I came it was over 20 years ago that we and at that time basically anybody who tried to cross go pull over it was a Target because the same traffic that you see now was there without any kind of controls and especially since this first of each access is so close to the turn uh people take that turn and then just fire up and so when they put in the two islands that basically helped solve that problem because of the flashing lights now with the flashing lights I think they'd be more effective if we changed the color just because every construction truck in the area has Amber lights but you know for you guys I can see where it's frustrating for the people who live farther around the north trying to get in that light whoever it was when they made the double turn lanes that came up with the idea that it would be electron only that was I think a poor decision because the poor people that are north of the causeway you have to wait forever because because you can't turn when there's no traffic coming the other way so doing the fat flashing light would make a huge difference and I see that as really being the only remedy for the people turning left because if you take out those islands what had happened before they had the islands in is not only were they rushing and not paying attention to our citizens but it back all the way up even during spring break weekends it almost went all the way to Clearwater so that would affect everybody getting out on the Gulf Boulevard and we're basically trapped inside our community because people won't let us in in order to get out the Gulf Boulevard so I would suggest that you rethink taking out those islands just because I remember the headaches that we had before we put them in and and the this downgrading of safety that was there by not having those islands so so I would suggest that we keep the islands and maybe even go on farther down so that the people that are at the north side of the city can get out there from people trying to get to Clearwater Beach and make it so then you can't get by appreciate it thank you Mr Mall anyone else yes good evening everyone um Tammy lavender 97 Harbor Drive um I'm here tonight just to give a couple of save the dates for the new Belair Beach Community Foundation our new

apartment record hat on and say if you like the yoga classes that we're currently doing on Monday Wednesday and Saturday a Tuesday class was just added in the building and then if you've seen them we have the embroidered Belair Beach fanny packs we only have three left and we're probably like not getting any more so if you're interested in one of those please make sure that you stop by city hall and we did get new embroidered hand towels in they were upset anyway that's all I have thank you thank you anyone else yes sir Randy lettuce 13th Street I think the idea about removing the palm trees and the island between 12 and 13 is a really a terrible idea there's non-stop traffic going northbound to Clearwater I live on 13th and we can't get out it's so bad for the people on 12th that they loop around and come out on 13th just to give them a little bit better on the shot okay I sent an email last week extensively detailing a lot of issues with this plan I don't know who saw the email or the video I took a video out on the street of all the traffic I don't know if anybody saw that I I saw the video either I can't ask here because you own a lot of questions a number of months ago I came here asking about three more benches at the 12th Street access like we used to have six now they're down to three or nicer now but they're down to three and cleaning up the real high weeds that were blocking one of the Southmost bench and getting a bike rack so the bikers don't change their bikes to the benches that we have so at least we could sit there uh Kyle who did a great job I thank you I appreciate that I have no idea on status of getting more benches or a bike rack and I can't ask now I'll reiterate again that this policy of not taking any questions from the public is I think is really messed up you can say why don't you email your questions in I did last week regarding my issues my concerns about this uh Crossway and taking that Island down no one responded so I have no idea where your your head is with that if anybody even saw it or they care okay I can't always make it here during the day to meet with Mike zagel during his open Office hours so I get no answers I under I understand your concerns about things getting out of hand like they did maybe in the past but there's better ways to deal with things than refusing to answer questions the constituent the public that you're you're here to serve uh I I like to say Bel Air beach has implemented the Walla Walla management technique okay I go to Wawa all the time I used to go with my wife for breakfast and lunch and we they have tables we could sit out there and enjoy our lunch and breakfast and whatever while I had a real big issue on Missouri Avenue where all the homeless homeless coming from all over the place taking up those tables so the Wawa management decided they get rid of two-thirds of the tables that way to the homeless one everywhere to sit okay so I think there's other ways to deal with unrolling people or people that are you know out of line or asking crazy questions or doing something but just to say that you're not taking any questions where's the public to go to get answers to these questions other than trying to squeeze in a date with Mike the thing or sending in an email that you don't know if you're going to get answers thank you and have a nice day thank you Mr Logan does anyone else like to speak yes good evening Jennifer would help 523 Ohio um I actually for the first time just learned I can't ask a question so I do not have anything prepared but what I wanted to talk about is the ordinance that you are reading for the second time today around setbacks I wanted to well I get a better understanding of why we have arbitrarily chosen pots and land sorry that is one of our agenda items and I'm going to let you continue but normally if there's an agenda item we give you the opportunities okay so you can continue now or you can continue doing that again they serve you better if you absolutely and my understanding is that we were just going to read the title of the envo so if we're going to actually have discussion on it I'd be happy to wait yes thank you any other comments yes sir yeah um Campbell hitch is a 1021 Palm Drive right over here on the causeway as far as uh removing the island I just wanted to bring up some more of the safety issues with that that is my way of getting over to the beach because I live right here on the causeway so what I have found if that walk is taken away is that when I go across the street and I'm at the light and I go to walk across the street there all the people that are turning right there that have a right turn on red they're not paying any attention to the crosswalk they're not paying any attention to that little link that says I'm able to walk they're looking to the left to see if there's any cars coming I've almost got hit probably two three times after the lane of change walking out across the street at that light I'm talking the traffic light so if we remove the crosswalk it's you know that's crazy so removing the crosswalk I think should not even be on the agenda um removing the island also I believe is a bad idea because the island actually triggers people to see that there is a crosswalk um and I almost got hit a few times even walking across the island with the lights flashing um you know I I totally will sit and wait and make sure that the car is slowing down because the cars you know they they tend to not even slow down unless somebody's standing in the middle of the road so um just wanted to make that safety issue brought up I think thank you very much any other comments all right citizen comments are closed all right now we are on to item number three this is the presentation Pinellas County Sewer Rehabilitation project and mayor and council member of my news Dennis Simpson I'm at Pinellas County Utilities engineering Division and I'm in charge of the horizontal assets and uh the lining projects or under my jurisdiction I have here Joe Boggs he's with for The Works inspection and he's in charge of inspection and also how uh inline contractor and his name is John Sutherland cured in place um lining contract gravity sewer is a translucent technology and it's basically for rehabilitating deteriorating gravity sewers and that is done by the lion and what is they do is basically they take aligning thing and put into the pipe and by I'm ear Steam and ultraviolet light they expand the lining and therefore stop the fields are gone infiltration of water into the sewer presently we have a contract which is a construction year Implement in Bel Air Beach and um from what I understand there are some issues and I'm here to basically respond to those issues sure what what would you like to review the issues the complaints that uh or a city manager Reaper would you like to explain what the issues are sure yes ma'am I welcomed up Pinellas County Utilities because they got underway with the project he's referring to which is the sanitary sewer Rehabilitation project who's a contractors of minor Solutions we did not have any knowledge of a project which is you know going to be a couple months long spanning the city when I first found out about it I didn't know I heard about it happening on Fifth Street and I started trying to contact the County to find out the extent of the project turns out it was it was pretty much the whole city so um since then I've been in contact with the county and they've provided a continuing information to me which has been helpful I guess at some point um we just kind of drop the ball and notifying the city that this was coming up um and I just got covered with the county you know how important it is for us to know um because the citizens will call us first but I know what's going on so I I then since being in contact with the county I said they could come out to the speeding and just kind of go over the project and address any concerns that the citizens might um due to this little bit of project and I guess the biggest concern was why weren't we notified and and I I understand that door tags went out and it was the day before the price and uh here they they just were unaware of the project completely yes we normally um would notify that we have decided on large projects like this because I think we're doing about 60 to 70 percent of the gravity sewers in Miller Beach so for a project this size I think from irons noted by the city to let them know that we're coming normally what happens is that the project gets bid it gets awarded and then when the constructions start they to clean it at that time we wouldn't have notified the residents but before they do the lining because with the lining they're basically going to be blocking this lateral flows into the line and that's usually for a segment say 400 feet it only takes about a day of work so they notify 24 hours before by putting door hangers on the on the residence to let them know that they're going to be doing the lining in that segment and as they progress they'll do more door hangers have you installed any lines yet Miller Beach or or you only doing testing yes sir as right now I'm sorry sir Showbox when Pinellas County Construction Administration so at this point so far we have roughly about 80 lines left to blind we we started out with 100 32 I believe so we still have 80 more to go um we're trying I understand with common was affected by I apologize about that that is from cleaning the line like Dennis was saying would rewind that's when the notices go on because your sewage is actually being backed up so the little water you use the more chance and we've also learned that if you give out a notice a week ahead of time people forget about it 72 hours and people forget about it so normally what they do is on Friday they put out Monday notices Monday they'll do Tuesday Wednesday notice there's about 48 hours is what they've been doing know some Wednesday or Tuesday they'll do Thursday Friday notices and then again like on Thursday they'll go back and do Friday's notices again because it was more than 48 hours we try to try to keep it around 48 hours I don't like 24 because that is a short notice you know some people they're like oh I had big plans for tomorrow my son's birthday party they don't work on the weekends but you never know who's doing what during the week especially if something goes wrong it could be a very late night thank you just curious what's the maximum rolls that are that you've encountered that will be in my cleanings it's really hard to say because some of your runs might be a 200 foot line cycle someone might be a 400 foot um depending on how many homes you know how big your lots are you know you might only have well some of the some of the runs here that we we've done the size tree right over here there's five block holes on it so you know that's 400 foot shot curious about what's the time span for that one that one line that you did this the one right next door right here what is the name of the street here right right on the other side of the parking lot Theater senior um that day their day was done by three o'clock they started they they started televising at 7am and they were completely done and gone by three o'clock okay so you came to my street 22nd Street and we didn't know if you were complete it looked like you were in one hole over here for a while that was probably the cleaning crew okay and then we really just didn't we had no clue as to what was going on other than hey uh don't run your water 7 A.M something like that I think that's what the notes had but we really just had no when we were a little afraid that we would go home to what um for sure came home too so I think yes especially if it's a it's possible it might not be a bad idea just to bang on the door or just say hey we're starting or something like that because I'm sure there's some people that won't even know that tags on their door and that's one thing that we run across too the the gentleman that's here now his name is Johnny if anybody if you've seen out he's the foreman of inliner he's great when that normally when the liner goes in he will go to each house and say can I get your phone number so I can put you on a group text and let you know hey okay you're free to use yours you're free to use your you're free to use yours you know he does he does do that if we're only on a street that's you know like over here in the theater it's only got five he'll just come knock on the door and say you're free you know but when you got a lot of time we they try to do double shots meaning 800 feet so you might have 10 15 Services all together um that's when he'll do a group chat with the neighborhood and then you know he's on site walking back and forth the guys are on site my inspector's on site if you guys ever see you know somebody on the street look for Pinellas County truck his name is Trevor Logan he'll be more than happy to answer anything it was Kyle Kyle has my contact information my phone's always on I always answer emails so if anybody's got any questions just just reach out to me I'm more than happy to answer the email great thank you very much do I have a question I just want to have a couple of things and that is I mean I think I voiced my concerns with you over the phone but we you know the day I came home you were just cleaning pipes on on my screen I had no idea this was happening there was no notices no no information provided um came home to an absolute mess because cleaning and just blew through my toilets um I'm sure and I was not the only person on the street I'm sure probably several other residents have dealt with the same I called Pinellas County Utilities it was told that you guys were not providing any service out there there was no instruction going on there was nothing being none that cause and what they told me to do was talk to risk management that was their only answer they would not even research they talked they I made them check twice with their service technicians to see if they were doing anything out there insisted nothing was being done certainly I called Kyle because at this point now it's after five on a cell phone I'm sure he's probably home he had no idea foreign s but they run through our city any work being done in our city needs to go through our city manager because he's going to get the first phone call yes ma'am and then all of us will get the call too and there was no communication with any client that so that's got to be addressed and moving forward then as we move forward to this project you must know today where you're going to be tomorrow it would be nice to be able to for packing to send an email at least to our residents to know hey we're working on you know whatever streets these three streets over the next three days expect to see a door hanger or something so that we're aware of what's Happening that on my street I guess we've only been our line has been cleaned there's not it has not been aligned so I don't know what kind of habit that's going to cost but I'm really not happy with the outcome of what happened I apologize about that I was not aware of that day that the cleaning crew was even in the city I was not informed of that which I didn't create the other question is how safe are our utilities and anyone can come into our city and tap into our lines how safe is that as a resident it's not very safe it's causes concern to me well yes it it does but like I said I I was not aware of the cleaning crew even being in Delaware Bluffs my understanding they was on Largo you know so I that's not my jurisdiction I just nothing else I can do um as far as getting the problem with giving you guys the schedule it's a schedule it's it says okay we might be for instance today I can't remember what street the guys was on today because we had two Linings here today one of them has a offset joint in the pipe he wasn't able to work so I so I don't know when if I tell you that it was your street today and all of a sudden you come home thinking oh gosh it's over with and I'm gonna water my bathroom it's done oh nothing happened so we're going to come back but here the point was I said maybe you hadn't sent an email me projected in these streets watch the door hanger all right you're not going to hang a door hanger unless you're doing the work right or no the door hanger was up when they went and created video this morning they found that the pipe was busted so we could not put a minor in today so you know and that's and sometimes you know when when the truck comes the liner that you were supposed to do today might be on the very bottom those guys who aren't going to dig through 2 000 feet of liner to get that one off I just I'm in I'm not I find it incredible that you're some contractor you can do a better job communicating with our residents to say you need to get everyone problem any other comments regulations for the council you're just like understand correctly you're just doing this main sewer line you're not doing the branches from the houses right so how would that back up I mean of course Edward put it back up but when you're cleaning and you're using like a sandblasting tool it's on it's a jet nozzle on the end of a hose yes but if the if your Y is on backwards when they when they pull back it will push water up you know they will if the pressure's too high it'll do the same thing if you're descaling which some of these older pipes you know they do have build up on them they do need to be descaled before we put a liner if not you're just you're shrinking the pipe down even smaller so sometimes you do have to use high pressure and it does it happens you know I don't like when it happens but it's a flat tire it's like a flat tire yeah the pressure you're using is probably under 160 PA spies and your branch tail plate coming off the house there's got to be at least 15 to 25 feet so that if you can't I can't see how much you were going back into the House John what do they normally run pressure yeah and if it's a straight you know a pretty flat later on it's going to blow it up there council member Baker I was home whenever they whatever whatever it was again on our line and it made it made the toilets bubble we heard things in the sink it very disturbing I believe I believe they did our street over here professional out there they start three minutes before seven which isn't allowance [Music] professional you tied up our screen you didn't even time for Street you can block half the street and we can always go downstairs look you guys are very professional they have the cones out everything okay thank you any other questions or comments from the council not thank you gentlemen for coming out and answering some questions and I'm trying to clear things up no problem we look forward to it thank you all right I'm bored you know presentation from Pinellas County Sheriff's Office beginning for the law enforcement monthly report good evening my name is sergeant Roy Switzer Mills County Sheriff's Office and tonight I'm presenting the activity for January of 2023. under the UCR property of person crimes impacted a report there was Zero across the board so there was no criminal activity in the city that month however there were five people arrested and that resulted all from traffic activity so traffic stops DUIs porn arrests and some drug paraphernalia moving forward for Deputy activity there were a total of 683 events within the city leading that as usual were the direct controls and then traffic of course there were no crashes in the city so I think that should make everybody happy here in that and then lastly there were a combination of 174 citations and warnings issued for the month and that is all I have Council thank you very much thank you and um would you like to give us a summary on the uh enforcement report yes sir Emily uh so we did this is our second time going around with this new format of the code enforcement report Steve's been working with the template that we put together and um this month we had 51 uh listings in our report uh some of them were closed out some of them are still ongoing again I did did some pie charts to switch over the categories that are being covered we also the distribution city streets our outstanding code violations on developments the the dangerous structure we had a hearing for the board of adjustments scheduled for March 9th um after any turns of any contact with the attorney representing the resident it was advised that we postpone to to attempt to make a reasonable accommodation for the structure so um intend to to work forward to trying to come to some kind of something that's acceptable to a city that is within July and we'll give you a call where that goes the we had a hearing since the last meeting on February 23rd for the resident they had some promoted our areas so overgrowth so that that was issued in order to find and some work's been done on that property and uh it's not quite done yet I'm meeting with someone tomorrow to follow up on one still needs to be done the unpermitted remodel construction loosen so it was a roof on the whole of RV they've actually done work on the roof right now we discovered that they've never pulled apartment property so we're continuing to follow up on that that's not closed yet I did talk because that house is under its standardized for sale there's a title company that's being Acquired and I have talked to them to give them an updated where we stand uh we have a short-term memo hearing that took place in early February um that was given then uh you know a fine like we typically did with the short-term rentals and um the uh another hearing which was uh just recently on March 2nd for another overgrowth and uh invasive species so that was that was issued in order we have to find out what we started right now we've been told that you know we contracted we cleaned up Council any questions or comments yeah there's a hearing back in the late September on a tower recognition Street um that's not never been in my view in the code enforcement I mean there was a fine assessment of 150 a day I will leave the filed for an appeal I don't see anything in a certain court file anything there was an email sent to Patty that he was filing an appeal but why is I don't think I can explain that procedurally procedurally or correct that there were code enforcement proceedings in September that important was issued by the magistrate and Magistrate's decision was not directly appealed which is why you do not see anything in the Circuit Court the the decision of the magistrate at the time was that the responding party had to submit a a permit application the a I believe a preliminary permit application was received and projected a second attempt was made and in that in response to that second attempt uh you're seeing manager found it was insufficient and not and not did not from a special basis for the relief if you will requested in the form of apartment that is the decision that was appealed not the Magistrate's decision in the course of after uh informally declaring a desire to appeal that decision the party retained legal representation who is certainly well-versed in the matter I've had few conversations with their Council and we're the legal boundaries around that process and whether or not a permit is a possibility in that context understanding The Limited preemptions provided by federal law and otherwise so that process is being navigated with the city of the best footing where there to be a legal challenge to ensure that all administrative Avenues have been addressed sufficiently and that's where the process is but to your narrower question as to why there's nothing within a circuit court they do not need the the responding party did not appeal the master trans decision so the Magistrate's decision is in effect the Magistrate's decision was that a permit application need to be submitted and the parties are working to resolve that submission yes sir okay but there was a hundred fifty dollar fine day and the magistrate found that the party had complied by making a submission later in the fall but I was told that day permeation but it was deficient it was an administrative decision but whether or not the magistrate comments sufficient for the purposes of fulfilling the Master's requirement as a sort of a separate and distinct analysis or application let's start from the ground up before you put the tower up he had a poor pad which violated our setback rules so why are we not why are we catering to a hazardous condition here we're now I guess this tower has been up at least at least nine months um and we're approaching another hurricane season um he has done nothing to remove that Tower I get emails phone calls addresses every day I walk down that street for the Neighbors surrounding that house how much longer are we going to give this guy another bite of the Apple before we do something thank you for your question I would say your question is phrase presumes a few things but what I would say to answer your question is as why are we still engaging in this process on the city is the law mandates are dictates that we should and my job is to mitigate the city's risks and in their totality not just from the perceived risks of the neighboring Property Owners but also the the litigation exposure or legal requirements that's set forth by prb1 and the other applicable leading Provisions so we're navigating the process as I know you attended that code enforcement proceeding my my argument to the Mastery on behalf of the city was that the property owner was suggesting that a permitting process was Feud was a futility and was some kind of charade if you will and there was no point in applying because he would be denied automatically and my response to that point was give us an application give us an opportunity to evaluate it and we will evaluate it on its own merits and that's what the parties are going through his own legal counsel has has stated that the permitting profit submissions can be more detailed and robust and intense to make a more robust submission for the parties instead of the parties in this case the city's consideration so while it may be um well the timing of it may be frustrating I would say that we are going through the process as it has addicted it's my also my my added understanding of that is that there's been Towers not necessarily the precise one there over the past few decades in you know so this is not the first appearance of this structure and we are trying to make sure that as we deal with it we do Improvement well again um there was no circuit court file from what I can find out what you just said confirmed okay so the 30 days it elapsed six months ago um he missed the boat that a lot of people of the magistrate assistant Okay so that decision is didn't just say as we filed the opinion the refiled for the permit the way I'm reading it uh and then he's off the hook second of all again that Tower is still there correct all right and we're not doing anything about it disagree I I detailed what we're doing it may not be a solution to your satisfaction but as it relates to code enforcement I work at the direction but the executive of this city or the city manager I would advise the city manager on our legal Solutions options and resources and as your City attorney and taking the course of course upon advice the manager is in agreement with I I don't submit my the current plan of action May satisfy every party but it is in keeping with the requirements of Florida Statutes Federal guidance and otherwise in resolving this American well you said you said in a case when I found this case to spendo versus Marion County and it's clearly says in the infirm the FCC has determined that local governments do not have to make reasonable accommodations for ham radio enhancement structures for Destruction are prohibited by residential subdivision governance conditions and restrictions which we restrict again why are they pushing this issue I don't think I can answer lower I can remain calm because I don't live where it's well maybe it will fly down my stream but you have four residents that are very concerned about this and they all supported you dating all right so why aren't we enforcing our walls pouring up orders what's the point the point is is that you're now you're attacking our mayor I'm not attacking America no I'm not I agree I'm pulling a voter you are attacking anybody what I defer this to the presiding officer I would say only uh member Baker I I think I've answered your questions I understand you're not satisfied or any reason for those answers I think that holding this photo goes a little further than that and it's not specifically the well that quoted language is certainly in there it's also couch in the Pro the other caselon it's progeny uh governing this you look to these federal guidelines there's a limited field of case law on this I've reviewed it I'm not coming just from a place of I don't want to get people upset I'm looking at the case law and trying to get my residence photo the this photo opinion I've read there's two two major dependings out of the 50 CA there's an opinion there's a few other opinions that all speak to the notion that a government need not simply yield to any request or any application can enforce your codes but that must be done on an analysis of a particular antenna at issue especially in amateur hand radio which you cannot prohibit full stop you have to consider whether those things can be accommodated in keeping with the aesthetic safety of other measures and I'm saying we can't consider that until we have a proper and complete submission that allows for the parties to evaluate that I'm trying to develop a factual record that the part that the city can stand on whether or not you think that's a proper course of action I understand but I as it relates to code enforcement I'm working with the official in the city responsible house sir I understand what you're saying here that there's a proper procedure this is erected this is already there okay if he submitted to perming and it got bounced out and there was nothing done I'd be 100 agree with you but you're telling me I can go build a house okay get caught building the house and then say well I'll submit a permit at my will no sir I would submit to you that a house is quite different from a Nintendo it's still a violation and I I completely understand your position sir I've been working through oh I I can't change where we are at the end of the day she's going to be fine 150 for every day if he does not there's an outstanding fine now for 150 150 for roughly nine days that fine is outstanding whether or not that fine is resolved through the process of me working with his legal counsel to mitigate the city's risk and analyze the situation I can't dispositively say that nor do I have the authority unilaterally to either impose or or remove that fine there is a find a place very impactful stuff how that process resolves is ongoing I had a nearly 90-minute conversation or roughly almost 75 minute conversation with his attorney just last week at Great length where we talked about the balance of the case law where the issues go and generally the parties were in agreement that a permit is necessary that the city needs to provide to provide its request as to what data is requested this is not a common infrastructure I will tell you that my firm does this works for municipalities and nearly a dozen municipalities from Port Richey home speech and in speaking with all of my colleagues ham radio antenna towers are not exactly the most common issue and that you have community community we're navigating a very very Niche and area of Law and trying to make sure that we do so properly as good stewards of the public Trust speaking Mr Moore I appreciate it uh yeah well that's actually Morgan admit um student manager that's the dangerous structure I think number 105. yeah assistant okay so it has been listed here okay thank you any other comments or questions I just want to add that I like the new format thank you for your award of course I thought put this together and it's so much easier to follow them rescue District normally it's Chief Jeff Dickinson but this month we have assistant chief people good evening it's uh assistant chief hingley but that's all right good evening council members vice mayor Robert Gaddis um Chief Davidson does send his apologies and he's not here this evening to present to you however he is at in Tallahassee at the Florida Association of Special Districts annual meeting where he is uh taking some classes and learning some additional stuffs about Special Districts so that he can provide uh you know the highest level of service that he can to Our Community Partners including Bella Beach um last month in Miller Beach there were 17 calls for service there were three fire alarms and um 14 or 13 medical calls and one other 70 six percent of the time we met our um call times for ALS and 90 of the time these calls were responded to in eight minutes or 31 seconds or less with that being said last Monday we had the pleasure on February 27th of having a presentation here at the city hall where Chief Davidson presented a proposal that we have submitted to Pinellas County Emergency Services to further improve the services that we provide to the residents of what we consider North Indian Rocks Beach Bellair Beach and the residents of Bel Air Shore that proposal that we have provided to them would to be apply for an additional two paramedics in a ALS transport capable rescue that would we still have not decided if if the engine would move closer to here to our new plant station or where we put the rescue up here many of your folks here talk about the traffic issues and they have not gotten any better so when I read to you those times that only 76 76 percent that we were making our our scene times that is unacceptable to the district and we want to make sure that you know we can get those numbers up in as a 98th percentile and the plan that we have come up with and we have presented will enable us to do so um if you have any questions we did a full presentation that is public records and only some cards here and we can give you that information to the residents here community so they can kind of be informed we are looking for Community feedback and I believe we have some avenues that we can do that and again we can provide you that I'll put that request and I'll link those cards um following that there's a process in place so the next step in that process is called the data driving the focus group that meeting is on Friday and I will be and again presenting to the fire chiefs and some other interesting parties on this committee about our request and there's about 15 other requests throughout the county that have been unfortunately we all kind of present our case so the next uh step in that is if they approve or recommend that it goes forward there will be what's called What's called the msac committee the emergency medical service advisory Council which consists of some local political leaders and other interested parties those requests will go to that and they will vet them and again they'll move those forward up up the chain and hopefully within the next few months we'll have an idea of whether this idea The Proposal will come to fruition and again we hope that the citizens of the Bel Air Beach who are would fully support that because our number one goal is to make sure that we're providing you these fire and EMS services that you pay for every year for us um over the last couple weeks uh the men and women of our district we were able to obtain what we call a required structure so if any of those dogs or any Rocks Beach uh 40404 which is called golf towers and too much structures next to it are going to be well they are pretty much demolished and making room for some new condos however we were fortunate enough to have the party representing the owners allow us to trade so how does that benefit you and in these real world trainings that we have um you know we we train like we do in real life so the men and women got to flow water in these in this mid-rise high rise structure we got to do some firefighter safety and survival and some rescue stuff in a building that's similar to many data in your community obviously the beach side and not necessarily residential but it's still it's great training for our folks as far as district is concern we drink a couple of vacancies we've added two little paramedics to the district one is a transfer from Seminole fire rescue who does approximately three years of service to Pinellas County he will be put on the truck and right away will be able to treat folks the other one is they transfer from Hillsborough County there's a several month process depending on when the classes can get in that way be a full accounting player pyramid those folks will be starting by the end of this month and it will be providing services to again all the residents in our fire district so we're welcome to have two paramedics and it's a very difficult thing right now hiring in firing AMS is a Hot Topic right now there's not there's a lack of qualified candidates that we've got over the last few hires we've obtained some Stellar men in this case we had a woman in the last one but that will be providing the Top Model care that you folks have come to expect lastly Kyle and I had a small hurricane expo here in this room and we have gotten back together this year and started playing for what we hope to be a bigger and better and annual event within um higher Beach and I had suggested that actually since we have other Community Partners with the town of Indian Shores and the City of Indian Rocks Beach that maybe we would make it a district-wide event in that every year we can rotate it you folks have been gracious enough to offer up for maybe our next first annual event so him and I will be working towards getting some speakers and providing a little bit more robust event within the community that everybody that we would like to invite you know whether they are in our own career or any rocks area in Shore so we appreciate you folks allowing us to do that as far as the fire district concerns that's all that I have for you this evening again I'm renovation cards and if you have any questions please feel free to reach out thanks do you have any questions [Music] explain what it is you're asking for for the people that did not attend the meeting and and you could maybe make it as great as possible okay so briefly for the folks here in the community when I started from Palestine Coast 17 plus years ago we always used to respond to our fire engine and our well let's put our engine down to the northernmost end of our district however that was a disservice to you folks because of the humanity that it takes for us to get from any Rock speech to the northern and excuse me bail Heritage um and finally we went to closest Union dispatch so unfortunately uh for you folks I would say the majority of the time you're getting a unit from Clearwater Beach right at Sand Key or Station 43 um yeah you'll get a Largo or clearly Clearwater in because we do want to provide the highest level care and the majority of time in an EMS call you're going to want closer is better so what we're planning on doing is regardless of what happens we're we're constructing a new fire station in hopes in Northern and Rocks Beach with our projected day now we'll be able to hit the benchmarks set by the county and we'll once again be able to service the residents up there which Netcare pay your tax money to us so if your EMS as far as EMS goes you only pay our fire taxes and we do as long as we're available we do come to those I just want to let you guys know that but EMS is pointed to the county but we feel as if since you are our residents you do support us you do pay our taxes we want to make sure they don't remember weapon are responding down here to you folks what we've done is together every year they open up what's called an enhancement you can even put in for an enhancement and chief Davidson has been what I feel a godsend to our fire district and he's been working hard to provide the you know a higher level of service that we have in the past so we put in for that advancement again basically it's two paramedics but it actually turns into about seven folks because you have to have two every day and we have three shifts and the rest here so speaking of that the county is getting busier the traffic all that stuff so we just went on it the other day it's called 3M basically it's like the world is falling apart all of the fire department Goods that have transport capable units are transporting their own patients to the county this was not like that when I started it's so busy that the fire department has to take up the slack from the Sun starting units that we have going around the county and I can tell you the closest unit of Transport rescue is in Clearwater Beach Rescue 41 which is downtown Largo and then the other one in the only other one on the beach is in Treasure Island so adding a transport rescue to our fire district We Believe will benefit not only the folks here but our other partners in Largo and you know down the South where we're needed to be and again it all comes back to you being able to be you know as helpful as we can to everyone in the community we're all neighbors regardless of whether you live in this town or or up in Clearwater over in Largo we want to make sure that we take care of everybody so again we have a lot more information that I can provide you we have lots of data and facts and figures and stuff and we'll be happy to email that stuff out but we would ask that you email one of us the only other comment that I have which really um a plan that does not included okay so no this is a this would be a completely County funded unit that we are asking for so again this is an EMS unit we're asking for it's two paramedics and a transport capable Rescue all out of the existing fund that you folks already pay into so without getting into some additional specifics you folks pay a lot of money and you don't necessarily receive all that backing we just want a little bit of that back to make sure that we can provide not only you folks the rest of the county an elevated level of service thank you very much are you asking our residents to request this from accountant are you asking our residents to account to the county to request so um so we we have submitted the request however just like you could email your state senators and say I support this and I support that we do have the contact information for these um decision makers within the county that would be happy to provide to you I have to be careful when I say at the meeting I guess publicly but please by all means if you're interested you can email you this information and give you a little bit more on that so we will look basically just to say hey we really support what gee David said in the middle of psychos fire rescue district is asking for and we hope that you strongly consider it and I served on that Council and so I will be speaking that day thank you thank you very much all right now number six council members so uh it's not uncommon for council members to to attend one of the courses offered by the Florida Legal cities every once in a while we get an overachiever so I have two awards for the same person tonight I say the first one is a certificate of completion for the online orientation class for newly collected officials awarded to The Honorable Belinda Livingstone council member city of Bel-Air Beach congratulations and we also have a second one which is the certificate of completion for we affectionately call it emo but it's the Institute of elected Municipal officials and she completed that in St Augustine Florida January 20th and 21st 2023 presented to Belinda Livingstone council member of city of Miller Beach right [Applause] all right we are on to agenda item number seven uh consideration of accepting the annual comprehensive financial report for the fiscal year in September 30th 2022 and it's presented by salt marsh Cleveland and Gunn Certified Public Accounts sure if you uh good evening my name is Chuck Landers I'm a sophomore's Cleveland and guns I want to thank the mayor and the council for the opportunity to once again serve as the audit firm for the city we're also thank Kyle for his assistance through the audit process and a special thanks to Heather and Andrew as well there's no way the audit process could be completed without all the work that they do provided a draft presentation of the financial statements if you took the time to read through that draft you would notice that there are some pages in there that say this information is not available that's mainly in the statistical section and it's also where the gfoa certificate will give the statistical section information we have this the historical information from 2021 back to 2013 but we do not have the 2022 information yet Heather has requested that most is being held up by the county so once that information is available we can put that in the report I point that out because the statistical section of the financial statements isn't covered by our audit opinion so Our obligation is to look at that and make sure that it materially agrees with the financial statements the basic financial statements of the city and then if it doesn't agree then we have to modify report I can't imagine that it's once it's there that it's not going to agree the city is going to have to make the decision of how long they want to wait to receive that information before finalizing the audit there there are a couple of options that we can discuss when that time comes the the gfoa submission is the the unextended due date is at the end of the month you can request an application for extension which the city did do last year at our request because we had set issues not able to meet the debt at the time for that but this year it is really just in the gfoace hands waiting on them and we do not have a timeline to understand when they will issue that certificate or enrichment thing it wouldn't be but again it's we don't have any timeline there so we have until the end of the month to really make a decision on how the city wants to proceed with that so that it's not super urgent at the moment but something that does need to be addressed in the next couple weeks so with that what I brought to present tonight is the anticipated opinion I wouldn't expect it to change so we have the anticipated opinion and the basic financial statements here the to like to take the time to just go through these in summary it's you know over 100 Pages we're not going to go through it in detail but the the important parts I'll point out the most important part of the financial statements that I will say is on page one this is the opinions the auto search report so you have to go through several Roman numerals before you actually get to page one about 60 feet of an inch into it so on page one the second paragraph We Do cut to the chase now there has been changes in the Auditors report passed down so we do get to the opinions here at the beginning instead of making three through four pages of Auditors report you need to be made but you'll see that in the second paragraph on page one in our opinion the financial statements referred to above present fairly in all material respects the respective financial position of the governmental activities the business type activities each major fund and the respective budgetary comparison for the general fund of the city as of and for the year ended September 30th 2022 and the respective changes in financial position and where Apple will cash flows thereof for the year then ended in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America so this is the first opinion that you're concerned with in your financial savings there's going to be a few more opinions as we get to some more reports towards the back but before we get there I'll just point out a few of the financial statement highlights on page 17 this is the statement of that position this is what's most comparable to a balance sheet that you would see in a for-profit entity there are there is technical statements in here called balance sheet but they don't necessarily represent between CM for-profit business so if you're in a for if you're used to looking at for-profit entity financial statements this is going to be the most comparable you see that in the middle of the page and this is as of September 30th 2022 total assets of the city were 19 million 555 795 dollars total liabilities of the city were two million 667 thousand dollars leaving net position of 16 million eight hundred eighty eight thousand so of that net position 6 million four hundred and fifty thousand of it is unrestricted and 10 million four hundred and thirty eight thousand is a healthy Mountain the next page would be the comparable income statement for a for-profit entity but this is called the statement of activities it starts with the expenses on the left side and then goes to the program revenues but really I'd like to just focus on the numbers let's just get to the bottom you see that the change in that position for the city was a net increase of just under one million dollars for the year 994 000. so that's the second up from the our third up from the bottom line from the bottom right corner begin about a million dollar increase year over year from the year before giving a net position at the end of the year of the 16 million eight hundred and eighty eight thousand I did mention that there are balance sheets in the statements the very next page would be considered the balance sheet of the governmental funds the city has two governmental funds the general fund and the capital projects fund folks point that out that you understand you understand what is there the the city has two more funds that would be considered proprietary funds or business type funds the next page I would turn your attention to is Page 23. most people are very concerned with the budget and budget to actual and that's what this page is is the budget actual for the general fund the middle of the page is the final budget the or the middle column on the page is the final budget the column next to the the right is the actual and then the far right column is the difference between the two so you can see that total revenues were budgeted at about 2.5 million they came in at a little over three million for favorable variance of just over half in the middle Pages or middle part of this page you can see that total expenditures were budgeted at just over 2 billion they came in at just under 2 million for a favorable variance of 118 000 for a total favorable variance of 625 000 on the year when you have higher revenues and lower expenses the uh the favorable variance there I'll point out that uh that line where the favorable variance of 625 has shown it currently says deficiency of revenues expensive they're under expenses that needs to be changed to excess of revenues under or over excess of revenues over expenses it was net income why is that wording the I mentioned this the city has two additional funds on the next page that's this saving a net position for the proprietary funds that's the storm water fund and the marina fund you can see that the assets for those two funds combined were 2.1 million and the total net position is also 2.1 million roundings there's very few liabilities in those two funds that's on page 24. the next page that I would point to is page 25 this this statement of revenues and expenses and changes in that position for the proprietary funds it's basically the income statement equivalent for those two funds you see that the charges for services and the storm water fund 177 000 the marina fund 82 000 for total of 260 000 between the two proprietary funds the total operating income for those two funds netted out to 8 800 just under nine thousand dollars between the two there were some transfers in so the total change in that position for those funds was an increase of 33 000 after the twenty five thousand dollars was transferred in from the general fund the next several pages are the notes to the financial statements there are a few that I would like to point out Kylie in your report you were referencing the Hazardous structure and so legal correspondence that's going on with that I would like to draw the council's attention to page 44. in the middle of the section there is a no disclosure that currently reads accounts receivable for the general fund includes 196 915 from a resident of the city for code violations for failure to meet construction schedule timeline ordered just ordered by a special Magistrate on May 19 2021 the city has no intention to forgive these fines and believes the balance will be fully collectible therefore the city has not reported an allowance as of September 30th 2022 that is our understanding of the city's position if that is not the case I would ask that you do share with us to see if there should be an allowance recorded there the reason in my allowance what I mean is if that's not going to be fully collectible and this is the number as of September 30th in essence Rome it's on a daily basis we need to considerably the collectibility the realizability of this asset this is a concentration it is a material amount for the city both in every aspect of our material calculations so on a on the government-wide basis for the for the city as a whole this is a material number in an execution you said that's the antenna this is not the antenna for the not this is not the tall structure or antenna this is a construction that's notes it does not does not have to do with the ham radio okay so anyway I'll point out that paragraph because that is something that you have never seen in your financial statements before it's new and we want to make sure that that is correct that is what's being conveyed to us and so we would before before this is finalized we want to make sure that that's still the current intent on this same page page 44 Note 5 this is the changes in capital assets as municipality the infrastructure is a big part of what you have and you see that this carries the beginning balance forward to the ending battle so at the end of the year the total governmental I'm in the middle of the page or the middle of the table there there it started the total governmental the capital assets at the beginning of the year were 12.4 million and they ended at just over 12.4 right so not a not a big increase there you can see that the assets continue to be depreciated so that the governmental net assets started the year 10.8 million in the after depreciation was done they ended just under 10.5 million at 10 million 400 so that's the governmental activity then the next two table or the next part of that table or the proprietary funds you see that they started at a net amount of 1.7 million and after depreciation they were 1 671 000. with no additions as a municipality lots of times people are concerned about the debt that the the town is carrying or the city is carrying on page 47 this is note 9. you'll see the schedule with the different loans that the city has outstanding and when I say loans on the debt alone or Bond and on the far right column you see that the total governmental activities had an outstanding debt at the end of the year of a million seven hundred thirty eight thousand the proprietary funds had outstanding debt of 23 000 for a total of a million 761 000 of at the end of the year now we're going to jump forward several pages about a quarter of an inch or more to page 85. let's get back to the opinions page 85 is the independent Auditors report on internal control over financial reporting and on compliance and other matters based on an audit of financial statements performed in accordance with government auditing standards the sentence that you're looking for on this first page is the very last sentence the last two sentences where we say we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we considered to be material weaknesses however material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified but again that's what you're looking for on that page you turn the page there's a paragraph titled compliance and other matters the the sentence there that you're looking for is the last one the results of our test disclosed no instances of non-compliance or other matters that are required to be reported under government auditing standards those are the those are the phrases that you like to see there turning the page to page 87 this is the management letter it's a couple of pages long the important sentences that I'll point out here again the very last one on the first page there were no findings or recommendations made on internal control and compliance issues during the preceding annual Financial audit then turning the page to the section called Financial conditions and management the last paragraph in that section section 10.5441i2 rules of the operator General requires that we communicate any recommendations to improve financial management in connection with our audit we did not have any such Communications the next section of additional matters last sentence in that paragraph in connection with our audit we did not note any such findings and then the very last page is the independent accountants report on compliance with Section 218.415 Florida statute the important sentence in this page is the third third paragraph in our opinion the city of Bellaire Beach Florida complied in all material respects with the aforementioned requirements for the fiscal year ended September 30th 2022. and that gets through the Auditors reported that page that you reference with regards to that hard time yes sir are you looking to us for some feedback I mean you know we made clear that that needs to be right it's so from a financial statement reporting perspective we're concerned is so the asset exists there's there's no doubt about that the fines are being occurred is there going to be any negotiation of that and a right now so if there is anticipated negotiation and that all of that isn't going to be collected we would need to take that into consideration to see if that asset value should be lowered we call that other one once against it because it's grown down to 235 000 yes yes you know I we never yet collected some opportunity and so as we although none of us want to I think that that's the reality is we we and so therefore we are asking from the city through city manager and Council what is the anticipated realizable value of that and and that's we need you all to give us a number and then we have to audit them do you need the number tonight no sir but it is something that that would need to be finalized before we make the decision of is it is the report going to be submitted by the 331 deadline for gfoa will it be extended it is something that will have we'll have to solve for the audit is finalized but no sir it does not have to be done tonight any other questions for the council no okay so um city manager reefer this was placed on the agenda as to accept this report it doesn't say anything about draft so are we should we table this or or are you asking us to just accept the draft one for now in I would expect us that we're going to receive a final copy layer yes I should have including a draft in the agenda itemd we wanted to get the salt marsh to come in and present with the audit where it is now it still needs to go to the audit committee which we need to form with one member from Council so I'm going to need a motion for November to modify this agenda item to to say draft uh annual comprehensive financial report so do I have a second second uh all in favor aye all right so we're going to change that to uh directly and then uh what I'm going to need now is a motion to accept this draft report all in favor aye aye can you post okay okay you sure can I understand what um Sanders said was that we need to our friends and council member to our [Music] audience a council member I let the council room yeah with someone else like the second and a second all in favor all right Okay so so silence I'm thank you for standing I'll try to make sure I can't wait emotion on that I'll make a motion to let the council I say to me vice mayor and Shirley and the representative to the audit committee all right we have a second all in favor aye aye any opposed all right congratulations thank you for stepping up again is that satisfying all of your requirements tonight yes I will deal with the CAC to schedule a meeting to get started unless and figure out our timeline if we pursue an extension or if we'd be able to get it reviews and broke okay do we have any other questions for uh Mr Landers before he um thank you very much appreciate your reference sure Lots again 22 1999 regarding to be buying not a material it's an acid of the city but it's not a material acid to the operations of the automotive operation of the city correct so in the in the audit in the financial statement audit we have to determine the materiality of a dollar amount and we have to look at the different reporting opinions so there's the government-wide and funds each one has their own materiality that has to be determined and this number does mean the materiality threshold of all of those materiality components so is that asset going to make or break the ability continue no but in financial reporting it is a material amount based on the numbers here and it is a concentration in one individual value okay thank you any other questions in your comments nope thank you very much Mr lambers thank you thank you for coming here with us all right we are on to number eight um thank you Mr Mayor I continue to work with your manager on array of issues though I was not in attendance at your last work session I'm producing the revisions to The Limited revisions the sign code discussed we have a resolution tonight concerning Arcane charges over my office and my heart mobile contract review and other similar issues otherwise continue to work through issues and remain contact with your manager I would say on a daily basis if that doesn't really do adjust two or three times a day but any issues folks have questions about an applicants Council yeah what is the next process on 105 HD what is the hearing would it be scary is that the same topic we were discussing earlier the last the last places we're left out I had a discussion a lengthy discussion on Thursday with his Council I committed with his legal counsel I can commit it to him to meet and discuss this matter with the manager this week and provided him at least from the city's perspective room to understand we need to determine what the applicable restrictions are with occurred if any as it relates to permitting and also what what questions we have substantively about this particular operation on this particular antenna and the specifics of the program so there's not a hearing date set at the moment to answer no sir that's not true about this but I've already told as I've stated I intend to speak with their attorney today if you're asking me if there's a code enforcement hearing schedule there was not if you're asking me if there's a board of adjustment hearing scheduled there is not what we need to determine is what best what procedure is most appropriate and the procedure will be determined by the work product that comes out of our out of our exchanges and not everything is predetermined that'll be by week 10. my aim is my recent to have a path forward I've committed to get information as his counsel the process is not as fixed and concrete as your questions seem to desire to be other questions or comments from the counselor Mr Laura thank you very much for uh for your patience and uh and we are hearing [Music] are moving on to the city manager's report ing mayor mayor and Council we are grabbing up the 2017 and day uh stormwater project the last thing we did was uh called out the contractor and subcontractors or redo a curved segment on 13th Street which which was not producing proper quality of the water engineering that is complete the contractor has requested the delivery so that they met heard the advantage and we are closing in that project this week once I get a confirmation that all the leads are released for the city the develop all of our underground project we had another progress meeting on March 1st Duke we keep pushing Duke to tell us trying to get an update on when the material is going to be delivered and the Duke representative did state that they do not have a game but they will keep checking so we our permitting is running on to be ready as soon as the material shows the Gulf of Mexico blue replacement I actually didn't find a cheaper solution from American underwater contractors going back to the helical anchors they've done it in the past for us in talking to the contractor the felt confident that they would be able to locate the majority of the existing years from their experience and you know that would be a minimum charge of what we needed to install another anchor I think that's the best way to move forward and I remember 2018 was the diver team was the more expensive route we've been doing the concrete blocks but now it seems to have changed so that's positive the stormwater Improvement projects we had a meeting on with this citizens advisory committee on February 22nd where a presentation of an issue and some term sheets plus as a positive and negatives of where we stand as a city and our ability to take on data the CAC and we had a actual assistant president attended meeting as well they were all in support in making a recommendation for the chair and myself to present in March 20th I presume the third one work session so that that is the code enforcement and Allison analysis private uh continue to move forward I continue with the change in the reporting I am getting our community services administrator and Warner up involved with doing some of the day-to-day I feel like the making him familiar with the code enforcement process and the codes in general given the amount of time that he is in the city in a full full-time job that you will assist in producing more efficient code enforcement also looking forward to keep going with that I haven't heard a change on the April 14th shipment date from the playground set um so we will search for confirmation the water park parking lot it was completed on February 16th I plan on dropping that off of this list as well as the we finally closed down all the POS for the sea level replacement project the I'm scheduling meetings with departments this week to go over proposed budget changes I'll be doing a work on the budget I will turn that into the finance our Financial Consultant at the end of the month to move forward we have had their scheduled with our Financial Consultant for the April will be to present a an overall report on where we stand at the close of the last 100 year and what the what changes and Things We Should recommendations that they should look forward to when we start the this next year player process and then last these you're probably aware that we've been getting some more red tide in the area the health department provided us with a flyer notice on Friday and we posted that further recommendation there were very many fish on the on the beach on Saturday it was reported that that the fish killed an increase in there were fish on the beach we went out there starting this morning to at our best efforts with our staff start cleaning the fish picking them and I think they did a bottle decide what others they actually had residents that collected fish in their own bags they picked up those bags at 11 on their own full trash bags luckily when I went out and checked on it and Lauren Park in about 1 30 this afternoon the tide was washing up and it significantly did decrease the amount of fish that we're still laying on the beach and they did not see a larger mouth floating in the water but that all could change by tomorrow just depending on how to end up with more fish or or continue to stay fortunate the staff did work from Morgan apartment down south so if the fish numbers do not increase we expect like a fairly significant 55 clean up by tomorrow but we'll continue we're committed to continue to keep working on picking up the fish and the fastest that we can I have been in contact with the county um they have not started the outside contractors to be picking up the fish at this point and they have not started their rollout dumpster program that they did in the national Publishers for collection just as uh precautionary action that we did order a roll of dumpster's line specifically for fish from Waste Management just to have ready that's all I'm getting the council's attention then there's a disabled child around 20th anniversary I know coal court is cameos Street excuse me we put up a sign there through this city you know identifying trapping that there is a disabled child they do make those signs and I haven't seen them so it can be a small it's called why our city but I would say yeah it's our discussion so definitely a recession um there's no major objection maybe we take it to the workshops and just for a quick discussion to see if there's any uh other opinions but if not I feel like it's something that would benefit would a motion be suitable foreign [Music] ERS and disabled child handicap job between 19th and May 23rd Street second online table all in favor [Music] okay um are you proposing on the board or on the actual Street between 19th and 23rd no you put it on our private streets unless I get permission from the county I can reach out and find out their stance and minimally we can put it in England so let's at least as well right yeah any other questions or comments yes but yeah on the other topic is well can we look at maybe installing a movie map and then if you can coordinate uh with our assistant out here about specifically what's wrong with you know the handrails and Tracy what we can do to you know make the accommodations and again basically just hits the it's where it enters the sand and the bridge but it goes out so you can actually take wheelchairs out on this matter with them so you can move right clear water so if you can check those out and then report back to the council that you've coordinated with to integrate with council member Sable I will uh we actually have the opportunity to have those visits and whenever they came and they survey our or maybe it was something completely different but I just want to keep keep that in mind we'll look into it and see what we can come up with the photo it may not it may not be a Good Friday yesterday um kind of this the city hall generator I may miss it did you bring that up I I left it on there there's been no change since I received the last quote from the U I mean I think that's a great idea what was the original budget line item right it's been a pleasure 250 000 and then when we first started looking into this that I um presented to you with the estimate I would not feel about like I think it was 260 30 that's great do we happen to know the specs on this particular one in regards to how long it will run a full tank at full power I do have the specs so I can present that okay that's good and also I know we discussed previously the lining of the two pipes on the 12th and 13th Street project what's status on that uh status on that I'd like to build it into the next stormwater that we do to get the most competitive pricing whatever so that would be the one that we're going to go out to Define processes okay thank you any other questions report no report this month no report I have a brief question uh Patty I don't have the handouts for tonight pardon I don't have the handouts over on the table all the city council members received handouts I did not receive handouts okay thank you I stole the mines no problem now appreciate y'all thanks any questions for Mr Gentry okay uh now we're up to item number 11 this is a public hearings uh this is a consideration of ordinance 23-01 Mr Laura would you please read the ordinance America [Music] materials this is a second reading of the ordinance as as stated earlier within the hearing a second hearing we are it is the final hearing for the purposes of the legislative body thank you this is ordinance 23-01 an ordinance of the Seattle Beach Florida I'm in section 94-220 pertaining to the table of designated living areas and housing setbacks providing for severability and providing for an effective date this is a second and final reading ordinance 23-01 thank you Mr Aurora let's go to uh citizen comments foreign my name is Mark Pope and the resident of 523 Belle Isle Avenue um thank you Mr is able for the detailed notes from the last council meeting we were able to attend the reading by title opening of this ordinance my comments are going to cut across a couple of points real quickly first of all after detailed analysis of the table I could not understand the kind of arbitrary nature of the setback by lot different and secondly I did not see any commentary that we had done any benchmarking of similar setbacks of other beach towns as well as in alignment with the setbacks recommended at the county level so as a personal note our lot I measured today based on the table and my house already is over the limit my house was built in 1974 there's been no material changes and I would just like to present the council that maybe we take a pause on this ordinance have a more detailed study understand how these setbacks are actually calculated and again benchmarking and or subordinate deference to the county standard thank you Mr we're going to be discussing this uh right after citizens comments and uh maybe you'll understand anyone else would like to um I just wanted to add on to um the purpose of setbacks are essentially to preserve our reviews between our neighbors and as we look at this I'm just looking at the fairness perspective because there are some that are seven and a half foot some are 10 foot we actually are the ten foot and so arguably we should be because we have 20 feet between our neighbors but our Lawns aren't that big and so if there was an opportunity where we simply wanted to add cortico something that prevents us from adding anything to a lot of we want to do any kind of improvements when we don't need 20 feet in between ours and our neighborhood our our lot in our neighbor's Lodge children's on Broadview which is really the purpose of having sent back to between your neighbors thank you Mr any other comments from the citizens nope okay before we go any further I'm going to need a motion to approve an importance 20 23-01 to evolution made by box spring surely do I have a second second bye Floyd Roberts uh vice mayor you have before um the way I'm looking at this I think we're just bringing up some language can I maybe debates but I'm curious to know why this this is thank you very much for the question and manager asked a question am I interested the setback amounts and in each of the areas identified in the table remain the same we are not actually altering any of the setback proposals by this Origins what we are trying to resolve is confusion caused by the previous layout of the table and the scriveness errors concerning the spelling of Bellevue states where it was spelled with the bue versus the v-i-e-w format of the organ sets forth that and the form of Strikers and underlines given how much content was in that table is actually called out in red text additionally which we don't typically do but we've done ears fix the spelling and and fix the formatting to make it more clear so that the way it was reading previously Bellevue estates had different setbacks for Lots certain lot numbers which is still the case and then further down within the table it's at Bellevue Estates Island and had something else and then there was another row at the very bottom of the table that was not consistent with those and then that was leading to inconsistent results in engineering analysis and staff analysis applications and in some cases those inconsistent results resulted in variances or other administrative solutions to to bring a property has to individual properties that were constructed before these Provisions those are not important structures those dating back to the 60s and 70s since it's we are not proposing new setbacks be imposed or the definition of any existing structures this was really to clean them the table sort of a way to further confusion in future applications and that's what you have before USA thank you Mr Moore any other comments or questions on this topic so to clarify this is just language change it's commonly described in many ordinances as housekeeping it is an attempt to clarify and economy the existing code not to impose new restrictions exactly in fact as the citizens brought up about lunch set packs it's not going to encroach on that as it relates to somebody's structure that has been in place since the 70s no it does not have an impact however comma if they are applying for some kind of new structure on their property those setbacks as established will certainly apply so this does affect residents with intending to approach new development and the intended impact most directly is that they have a clearer understanding and expectation of what they should develop there was one instance in particular where a property a property owner sought development approval staff looked at it and reached the conclusion as to one step back the engineer looked at it another approve something and that approved item was not consistent it was consistent with one part of the table but not feeling it and so to avoid that kind of confusion this that this was again I was raised last time somebody said uh after which one of you suggested this was a good catch within the code and where did it come from and I came from your city manager in the course of administering applications and saying we can't have this kind of confusion prioritizens and uh again nice nice catch on that let's see manager reefer uh if there are no other comments or questions according to has paid to call the road council member Baker council member Livingstone yes council member Roberts aye council members Abel vice mayor Shirley I am mayor goddesses unanimously performance 23-01. thank you for your foreign right now we are on to the Casino agenda items 12 and 13. this is for approval of the February 6 2023 city council meeting minutes and a proclamation proclaiming the month of as problem gambling awareness month do I have a motion to approve the consent agenda motion to approve isn't motion made by Frank Baker do I have a second second by Lloyd Roberts all in favor I am host all right in Central Virginia all right now we are to the regular agenda item number 14 consideration of resolution 2023-01 parking rates at city parks City parking lots Mr Mora thank you Mr Mayor this is resolution 2203-01 in resolution city council at the city of Bellaire Beach Florida menu parking Page station hourly rates Bayside Park the community center city hall City Marine and Morgan Drive Park and establishing an effective date first and only reading of resolution 2023-01.5 lonely this resolution as it's been moved before you is is what product resulting from your work session held late last month just a couple weeks ago and this memorializes the terms of those um a lot of hours the parking fees of five dollars per hour on weekdays in the respective lots and then ten dollars per hour on weekends and holidays and and the intended maximum limits and any free parking times I will note during your work session unless as I understand it's some discussion concerning um corresponding parking fines you already have language in your code in section 58-37 and 58-38 concerning fines civil penalties a resolution cannot supersede an ordinance so we cannot do it that way if we are to change those we will do so via ordinance so that's why what you have here is just the parking rates not any penal element to it as to what happens if you're if you're not in compliance and I've spoken with the manager were we to do that what would be done by Ordinance one of the things that we're considering in the form of Staffing should that come before you is at least an informal rate study increase in other communities as to where they are so we can make sure we're in line with that and with any due consideration over the course statutes or illustrations thank you commission Laura before we begin a discussion on this let's go to the citizens for comments but even would like to speak with us yes sir please come up [Music] very very 108 12th Street as far as parking in this lot is this the consideration that we're under is this what I've been included yes yes um I have a problem with the park here they go over to the 12th Street beach access there's umbrellas and by the time we get out there you know running out there at nine o'clock there's no place for us to go it's been taking over by people who are trespassing so um I'm looking for remedy I think this parking lot of speed closed off to any type of outside you're you're including us from having enjoy the new viruses it comes great any other comments from the citizens yes 115 Causeway I I would agree with Barry gray with his comments I think we have to have parking here though I believe from Beach for nourishment is that correct so perhaps we can at least on the weekends make it more expensive um so that we deter people from two different things they come here they'll Park they'll take their relative things and they put them up there and then they will go park across the bridge one person mode and then come back come back or they just leave them there the whole day and as Barry said if we're not down there by 10 o'clock you aren't getting an umbrella thank you any other comments from the citizens no all right now we are to counsel before we get started on this conversation this resolution so the second let me make the first one Mike this is able to give him before uh just yeah absolutely addressing your comments so you should be four dollars and five dollars we moved it for excuse me uh five dollars during the weekday to ten dollars so basically more than doubling it um to basically try to find the pain threshold if you have a parking decal you're good these are for the outside people and also want to clear something up right here for everybody we're not stopping on street parking we'll always have that just call you know City Hall will arrange it but uh again we more than doubled it to ten dollars an hour so that's I I don't know we've talked about that it's more than uh area parking charges you're saying they would typically through and go back across the bridge so okay so you're saying that even if we made it uncomfortable they're typically going to find another way to do that by dropping off the crew with the umbrellas out going back across the bridge getting somebody a bicycle or getting a taxi or one of those other companies to bring them back over and they're still going to steal the spots on the beach so okay yeah and then unfortunately there's really nothing we can do about it because we we gave up our rights as a private beach to accept future I might disagree with that statement I don't think that we shouldn't be incentivizing people to park in our Lots and use our accesses and by keeping our part our parking fees are considerably less than the beach at Clearwater Beach by doing that we are incentivizing people to be able to care instead of theirs so if we make it whatever the pain threshold is it will at least deter them I realize we probably can't stop everybody but I think we can reduce the problem to some extent can I just add I think that's what we're trying to do is kind of deter people from having communities because we have the same issue at Morgan where you just can't think in a parking spot you know that's where we have facilities that you want to go to the park with the grandchildren when you have a restroom facility they can use you can't get a part of the spot there and we don't have any reserved residential spaces it's the same problem up and down the beach so we're trying to raise these raids high enough to deter people from the United States too long to we're bringing some time limits on this but I noticed I was a proposal as as we talk about that do we need to have the limits on basic parking at city Halls will want to make that suggestion because we originally did we didn't we were really aware that it was a problem more than you know 10 bucks an hour all day long I really I mean being here all day long before hundred bucks it's like maybe work with someone what does the council what is the council thing on putting limits on it just like we have with uh people from bringing their tents and coolers and staying all day which I would say yeah yes sir Mr Gray they're going to get there I think the solution is like Belair Shore has importance that they can have they can ask these people who are setting up behind their houses whether they're in the uh below the wet sand or whatever um if they're residents if they're not they make thinly yeah if these people from who knows where they come from set up in our lot are we about able to call the police and have them prove that their residence here I don't believe that's the case because we have public access and it's not that that the public access in our areas is not a 12 12 of that but maybe even in the 6th Street 12th Street I think once they get onto the beach there's not really anything we can do about it what if they're sitting up in the area that is now been designated in our area to set up and have an abroad but if they're now sitting in what has been designated I'm going to interrupt you right now I don't think that we're prepared to answer those questions I think what's going to require some more research and maybe we will we'll have this discussion in a work session and see if we can get more information from our City attorney and uh it was just not a topic we're prepared to discuss at this moment right now we're trying to focus on parking rates and securing a new metering system for parking so I very much appreciate your comments and I would like to move on so if we're back to the to the Limit the time limit on the on the on the apartment I'm going to need a motion if someone wants to reduce those motion motion made by Frank Baker do I have a second I'm sorry Mr Mayor what is the nature of the motion is to amend the resolution I'm sorry I should have that's what that is the patient three hours has to be safe assistant I think that that would be uh you know across the world and I don't mean I understood that's where you're going I just want to clear the record okay and then we have a second made by Jody Shirley uh Mr Banker do you have before um I think this helps I don't think it cures it I mean I I agree with you Mr Mayor about an award session to address other problems the electric bikes are a big thing now at 12th and 6th Street we make our presidents pay for a city today these electric bikes is the one resident says pick up parking benches and everything like that it's a matter to be discussed more or the next day but um I think a three-hour limit will help I agree you know and also this will definitely be a good trial to live for their pain threshold as as one of the citizens said and also as Mike say Alvarado if it continues to be a problem and we're just completely overwhelmed with people that uh pay it thirty dollars and then moving on we may raise it even honor so we'll just see where that is any of the comments changing the limits the hour limits of parking at Lakeside at Sea so I know we've discussed this at the workshop So Divine amount of cards in my three hours are was anything to prove me if I'm coming back and paying organizations where you wouldn't come back because there's no physical machine you would just open your app where we with this resolution we will be blocking the ability of to what you do there every hours so three hours and then you know truck thing on the tire move it up before it's your luck exactly exactly with the current system it would not they just come back and put more money in correct but can they move their car to a different parking spot and nope I think their license plate yeah driveway okay so any other comments on this question before we continue forward okay so my my motion's still on there to go to her okay yeah so uh all in favor of manding resolution 2023.01 all right leave your posters all right so uh you're making those changes and now we're back to uh we we don't need any motion to for the amended we're still I was already Evolution on the floor to adopt the ordinance you've now moved and approved to amend so you revert back to them ordinance with the understanding that it would be approved okay perfect okay any other discussion on approving this resolution as amended nope we're going to be a major cold world thing council member Banker yes councilmember Livingstone yes councilmember Roberts council members Abel hi vice mayor Shirley aye mayor goddess aye message now we are on to ion number 15. this is to authorized city manager to execute the piggyback agreement with parkmobile LLC was replacing on the agenda by City management take it away sir this uh this is a follow-up of our discussion we had in the work session um this uh I put in contact with Park Mobile they were able to provide the piggyback agreement from Saint Petersburg I worked ill assuming with a Attorney Morris colleague we revise the contract to to the attorney's liking they were agreeable with all the Amendments so we so we are comfortable with reviewing the contract to make sure that legally suffices for the city's needs there's a whole background we've had a I couldn't find the exact date of how long we've actually gone to Airport Community I know it's over 13 years doing our financial system and we're we're operating on a quick looks and only one fact that far without searching through some of our records so we've had that we own all the meters we have four meters you know we own and we've purchased them in order of Bayside Park the marina Morgan and seeing all those the monsters and I know that one in 2008 so the uh the manual parking meters uh you know throughout my experience with them they uh they require frequent maintenance and staff time they just do not hold up well probably be better in some virus that aren't so close to saltwater air but we uh we constantly are spending time replacing parts and troubleshooting them so this was presented in the work session this is a recap and we did an analysis of the revenue and expenditures showing at least that we break even in about from work we're quite certain that the prophet will the margin will increase now that we've approved increasing the department rates um and then I just wanted to include if this is approved I will pursue selling the existing assets of which of the parking meters matter to the vendor um thank you before we bring it back to the council let's go to the citizens for conference and I'd like to make a comment on bringing in Park Mobile and replacing our our existing parking containers nope all right thanks for the council Devotion to authorize the city managers and executive agreement with Park Louisville so it's all right and the second was made by Frank Baker this was able unit okay going back uh Park Mobile we and all voted unanimously to select cab was our city manager but many didn't know is that he was spending quite a bit of time doing the maintenance on these machines including running out finding Parts trying to get it repaired and we all said we want to give them all the tools available to make them successful and one of those was removing excess work that's what we're doing with this part Mobile plan he just alluded to yeah we did the spreadsheet we're looking forward to release a small profit but that was based on four dollars an hour coupled with the sa against stood with four dollars and they were talking the increases to five during the weekday and 10 during the weekends look forward to a pretty solid uh profit off the swimming so again thank you Kyle for hitting us up we're adding down all the numbers and uh your diligence on this map any other comments from the Council on this yes yeah I just want to clarify I think this decision with Mark mobile is a great decision but I don't want to confuse people by the fact that Mr Sable just talked about increasing the prices clearly we could have done the same thing with the existing systems so the profit would have been there as well but the departmental mobile decision is a good decision I just don't want people to think that well wow because we got the park mobile we think dude yeah the uh the key at the park mobile though is yeah you can increase both but under this system you can you could stop like we just said Max hours we can't do that with the other system yeah we're just clarifying as possible yeah thank you though but we actually did that on actual hours but you you use maximum even think of meter yeah and and it just so happened to work out that was fast at the time right any other comments before we take this to the low all right hey would you please call the roll council member Banker yes council member Livingstone yes council member Roberts council members Abel aye vice mayor Shirley mayor goddess so again the passage unanimously um you are authorized [Music] before we proceed to the agenda if I may ask your individuals on a procedural matter respectfully requesting to be reopened hearing on resolution 2023-01 on the parking fees do it or notice I noticed the state's in the title that it provides an effective date and transmission that that language fell off and I would just like to indulge the commission the council rather to amend the resolution further to State the resolution shall take effect immediately upon adoption so that there's no misunderstanding as to that fact so um I'd like to make a motion to place the effective engage on the amended resolution check it I should leave I might save the seconded by Frank Baker all in favor a year before we go since we have to take public comment as an official I specify clarify members label your your suggesting that resolution 2023-01 has adopted the further amended to add language stating that it would take effect immediately upon adoption is that correct that is correct there's a motion in a second on the foreign um council member Banker yes council member Livingstone yes councilmember Roberts council member stable aye vice mayor Shirley aye mayor Gaddis hi and so the amended amended resolution passes unanimous thank you councilman right so we are now about two unfinished business 2016. any unfinished business can I just add something that I think was created as a result of this is creating the important importance of modifying to find citizens for a parking um is that is that we can have a vote on that in the next meeting or is that something you could compare with the next meeting would be agreed Point what we wanted and I think it was the gentleman that was yours she was actually actually was recommendations for neighboring communities and in as much as there were representations about increase funds and specifically in New York speech that I don't believe that to be overly accurate he provided some insight on some figures I think ultimately the community some of these structure as part of how the parking discussions that said we can move as quickly as this body wishes to me what one we just could not supersed in my resolution and then two I want to make sure whether that takes the form of Staffing on first reading I know this community likes to to work session items in the work session you did have a work session on it I've had some discussions with the manager since I'd like session I'll defer to his Direction the sound a lot more timeline with the juice per product and what the Staffing on it looks like something I already had a discussion with my staff about collecting the local rates that are being charged and I'll put them into that together so that we can have that discussion and then move forward any other unfinished business so okay I will it's now time for Council comments went to the computer and then open randomizer program and this month the okay council members is able to start I love the brand advisor hey I want to call out uh councilman Roberts uh the invocation is going well so thank you for your recommendation and carrying it out all right next up is council member Roberts first I want to thank everybody who stayed this late that earlier made comments about the the traffic issues that we have up there I know there's one thing that we can all agree on I hope which is the current scenario that's going on up there is not perfect we all know that back in the day I asked the city council in one of our workshops because this has kind of been my swing plane as a civil engineer a professional engineer if I could pursue taking a look at what's going on out there today meet with the county and talk through some different options so if we did that I did that I met with the director of Transportation At Whitman county and ICL man uh Tom Washburn one of the things that he recommended that we're going to do in O'Connell is just working on it is the study that was done a few years ago that resulted in the infamous double left hand turning it's up for kind of a renew they typically wait a couple of years to go back we do it again honor another outside consultant doesn't cost us any money at all and their objective is to see how well is that current system working based on the original study so we're going to do that we talked about many things there's many many options available out there I can assure you the following typically County transportation departments will do this I'll make sure they that before any decisions are made they will come up here and have like an open house sometimes multiple open houses because they're not the first one to say after the study after receiving input from the citizens and trust me when I talk about some of the options it was because citizens called and taught me about what's going on up here so those type of an open house will take place where the citizens have an opportunity we'll probably have it right in here they don't have big white boards up and things like that to show you graphically what some of the options are where you will have input to say hey I like that or I think that's terrible why and then they'll talk to it it'll typically come back with another one with updated data and information unless the first one everybody said that's perfect which is unlikely um so that so that's where we are that's where we are today I feel I feel bad that some of our citizens like you guys got um uh rolled nuggets it is because of some emails that went out by a council member that kind of gave opinions and summaries it would have been better for them not to happen now the council member says hey um we're talking about these things and if you want to refer to some of the videos out there the tapes I recommend you look at minute 11 or something like that it may be interesting to you that's fine but when we're saying things out there that may or may not be completely or completely um finished with regards to what's going on that causes problems and it causes citizens to get excited about things that they don't have to because nothing's going to happen I assure you until we've studied this thing and have come out with better ideas I know for example I've got comments made about everybody loves the blinking yellow light as do I mostly can't have that with two left-hand turn lights cannot happen it's against traffic rules the only way we can get back the Blinky yellow turn line this is a single terrain plane so that's just one fact that's out there so there's multiple ways to take a look at this and we will do that and that's what I'm doing now I study it every day every day when I drive through there I left up coming from Saint Pete and heading north it's interesting to me the last couple of times I've had I was the first car to stop at the traffic so I get to watch this and typically be about five o'clock by 30 lots of vehicles coming to the South both of them turning to the left nobody follows the white dash line everybody's cutting this way my biggest concern is it's not even the potential traffic crash problem in the vehicles I'm thinking more of if somebody's on the right hand side as you're making that left you in turn somebody on the inside bumps them and God forbid there's somebody walking on that sidewalk with a child or by themselves and that vehicle jumps the curve that's what I was concerned about so I I know there's a better solution out there there has to be and that's what I'm working towards but again you have my Assurance we're not we're not going to make this blindly I don't know how the current scenario was approved previously you know I asked the county I said well how did you guys do this before I think he told me when you met with the city manager and the mayor they discussed it and the decision was made so we're going to do better than that this time we're going to make sure the citizens are involved and see pictures they know what's going to [Music] tell us whether or not that meets your desires thank you thank Mr Roberts and we move on to council member living so thank you councilman Roberts for that explanation I think he did a very good December thank you very much um thank you for coming and seeing me and thank you for your comments when you get those very seriously I want to say [Music] thank you very much thank you now we are to council member Baker for the record I was not attacking the mayor to actually go to the impact of residence and support and I believe in attack before I go to the talent fraction and it is a tower it's not a antenna we discussed in late toilet water quite clearly in homes both can be messy but this is a nine month problem that kills them and that's why I was passionate eventually there was no attack for you you've got nothing but the gentleman to me since I since you came in office hopefully I've been trying to say you want to really she laughed but I I really wanted to thank the Parts director uh last month we had a pet supply drop off with Pinellas County loaded up my back and they were so grateful for all this stuff find residents hopefully we'll have another one it was very very touching that now I don't want to be the Cockroach on a Christmas Turtle here when anything that we do to offset this traffic problem tourists it's only going to make it worse okay if you have tourists coming from Clearwater and they see an easy way now out of Belair Beach we're going to get more tourist views matter this is a this is about a 60-day problem we face every year come may we want to be talking about this until next march a little extra February leave it alone just leave it alone that island is beautiful that crosswalk is very necessary I tried Crossing at that Causeway a number of times I have a council one there great actually she knows it's a hazard closely crossword thank you all right now we are up to cashmere Sherlock thank you um so I attended the um mayor's luncheon in the past week in the native the Florida Legal cities did a legislative update as they enter into That season and it was they went through a number of bills that are discussed right now and several things to kind of watch for and one once again is the SB 714 is short-term round which is actually being supported by distinguia so just kind of some things that you know I'm naming these bills just some for residents and other council members to take a look at there was one they talked about which really affects um every community is staying and it's an HB 617 excuse me 671 and SB 682 and it's the league is recommending opposing but it's regarding building permits and they're requiring that building requirements uh be approved in a very short amount of time really and if the city can't get it done then there's there are consequences so just some things to look at there um all sorts of things to Land Development code and then I guess just for Council Members this is important that the the league is now offering Monday mornings 9 A.M a call-in um called the lineup day and what's happening really probably a good thing for all of us to take a look at and then this is something I would like for maybe planning you can have available to Residents and it's um you can scan it but it's the league of cities has put together quarter Legacy to put together um Citizens Voice information so you can go on here take a look at a battle look what you are going to scan give you updates and information on what we can do to keep governmental decisions in a local level to get the cities more autonomy to make their own decisions rather than state level and there is a big push to take City rights away from cities and put America at a state level so um maybe you've had a few good things I'll leave these with your padding and then you know anyone wants to scan now it's a technology but that's uh I think oh I guess I just one more couple other quick comments is um bike racks I know there was a question about whether we can have bike racks I know we talked about this before getting more event park benches at the beach accesses I mean I know it sounds like a great idea maybe if we put them out Gates or something and not down where the park benches are because this then just gives those same umbrella users at that beach access more access to them and you give them a place of time to write down or bring them on carts they'll bring whatever they need in the beach for that day and then now they have full access so I don't know if we're creating a problem or not but we might want to look at bike racks and have some discussion about them at the next first session thank you I think that's it the reason I thought that we were moving the bike racks into the parking lot away from the beach and Ireland did that not happen remember that we were going to add more benches and according to the gentleman that I'm serious nothing has been done is I thought we had we had dances we were just going to relocate them I remember I was discussing I never got approval from Colorado Shore so I'll reach out of you to tell them when as far as active benches there's milk like rack there okay I know we talked about possible locations foreign [Music] bikes all the time bench that's the problem so then the bench had Frankie and sit on the bench because they've got them right absolutely yeah I just wasn't sure if that was us or if that was either you know right it's not contacting you know all right so last month I uh I mentioned the beach nourishment and problems we've been having where it looks like we're not going to give each nourishment at least not for the Army Corps of Engineers and the uh the Fed so I have been working with mayor from North Readington Beach Bill Queen and also the mayor from Indian Shores Max Arena and what we've been doing is we've been meeting with all the County Commissioners to say you're collecting the mayor tax and it's reserved for us for each nourishment so you're saving all this money so I need you to start coming over the plan B because right now what they're doing is not they've just been sitting on the money and I'm hoping that they don't have to spend it instead they they get money from the federal government uh the truth is I don't think it's going to happen but uh anyway I met with Dave Eggers today he's on board with with trying to do it ourselves rather than relying on Army Corps so whenever I say our sales I mean the the county so he's on board I spoke with Kathleen Peters uh I've met with her about a week ago she's on board Janet long she's slightly reluctant but she is on board also the day that vice mayor Shirley was at the mayor's Council she was suing him for me because at that time I was meeting with Senator Ed Cooper to find out if what the appropriate path would be to get more State funds to sweep the pots of accounting to so as it stands right now we the FED would do 60 percent the county does 20 the state does twing and what I asked Senator Hooper for was to continue matching whatever it is we have to spend although obviously we're not going to get that but you always ask for more and hopefully you get some of it instead of none of it so I know that Senator Vasily is not exactly our favorite person because of the short-term rails but he is also another person that I'll be meeting with soon to have the same conversation about State funding and and then also city manager reefer join me and we went to the tourist Pinellas tourist Development Council combined with a Pinellas Florida County Commissioners meeting and that gave me the opportunity to to speak to every one of the Commissioners one by one and introduced them to our new city manager so I think that we're making some progress on this possibility of the county and actually stepping up and doing what's right which is to protect the cash cow that pays for baseball stadiums and sports complexes and things like that which is uh where a lot of that money goes to so if you reinvest into the beaches then the money will come back and not only just for right now the the keep hoping that the FED is going to do something and actually say nah we'll give you another pass and we'll do your investment again that's plan a and I don't believe that's ever going to going to happen Plan B and if we're discussing and now I'm actually getting people to say Plan B which is really kind of cool is that they look at the emergency spots that means sand where one of them Belair beach has won North Redington Beach is the other on Sunday and it's only Santee that's being ignored right now by there's people that will never ever sign those easements so then there's a plan C also which would take a serious look at targeting our beaches so that we don't need reneurship as often it's always going to move but eventually if the county will do the right thing and actually give us some already instead of every five or seven years we may not need nourishments maybe every 10 years so we'll see how that goes but anyway I have a couple more meetings coming up with various people and we'll see if we can see if we can get them to to get this project started also speaking of the tourist development uh the tourist Development Council it was recommended because I attended that meeting that The Big C actually has a delegate that's supposed to be going in that meeting and Reporting back to the Big C but they're not doing anything and so I believe they're going to put me in place to go and sit in on these meetings so that I can actually make sure that same fee is nationally being taken care of because normally the the County Commission they're going to do on whatever recommendations are made by the tourist Development Council and um that's enough about me uh Beach nourishment I don't think that I have anything else to discuss at this time other than I'd like to thank everyone for coming out tonight and for those that if there's anyone still watching on years at home thank you for attending uh with that being said do I have a motion oh sure motion made by Frank Baker and do I have a second yeah all right all in favor aye any opposed all right good night everyone"
