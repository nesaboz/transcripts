joging on the beach there was a transient n neither of them live on the beaches um they visit at the area but um there was a transit in begin Faller then a battery occurred um thankfully it wasn't a sexually battery um but the guy took off she was on with 911 whole bunch of charges came out of what the end of it all was she was okay at the end um and we were able to apprehend the person we had K9 and flight out here and they track and CAU thankfully not of them from the area but yeah it was uh wasn't a good crime to be in the area so to speak well I can't begin to thank you guys for all the service you guys do put yourself in the line of fire every day you guys are excellent you're blessed to have you and you're and you're all under right we we appreciate that thank you so much any other questions or comments one B one the motor vehicle effect um did that occur in some of these driveway or on the street or do we know I don't I can get the answer for you C just specifically was the motor vehicle excuse me yeah I'll get the information C get thank you yes sir I have a question uh I was out of town over the weekend and I heard that there was a traffic accident where a car overturned uh down around 12 13 near that Island think is that the plan the palm tree yes um yes I believe I believe that one was under the influence one right so typically what we'll do is I'll send the stuff in the morning to the city manag just Just J you all the questions when you ask him they have it in this case the deputy actually sent it um it was a it was a driving Under the Influence related thing I can I can't tell you the number of times that somebody a pine or palm tree out here or something on your medians and every single time they've been a t and I've been doing this for seven years in this role so they just always seem to hit the medians and they seem to hit the palm trees um this time I don't think there's much damage I think they scraped it but the last time they hit Indian Rocks they took the whole thing out it's just luckily no pedestrians or injured or anything like that even in this case driver wasn't heavily injured typ so but it was a DUI related crash with an overturn car do you know about how fast he was going I did I haven't seen any prelims on the investigation so I answer but when I get the answer regarding the mot people I get you that answer as well I appreciate any questions comments thank you pleasure all right now we're up to the monthly code enforcement report good evening sir Deputy Richard Trump I apologize I'm not in uniform tonight little private business going on right just after we leave here so I'm just glad you're here thank you sir very much I appreciate it so uh it's actually slowed down a little bit for the uh last month as far as code enforcements we um have been doing a lot of patrols a lot of area checks and trying to make sure that everybody is uh staying in check here um we actually just 18% of the time has been unpermitted remodels and uh that uh has to do a lot with some of the follow-ups and everything else and but we found a couple of houses that were getting some solar just as an example um it was a good company that was installing the solar but unfortunately they got a little overzealous and they started getting things installed before all the permits and everything else were in place they eventually did get all those permits and the stop work orders and everything were lifted off of those houses so everything went back and up closed then we had one other house that has stop work order on it again for the same permits it just for some uh slight remodel so other than that uh things have actually been slowing down a little bit um you'll see in the chart the other enforcement we added that that's a new category that I asked Pyle to add that was just so more that I can document like my extra patrols uh my beach patrols that I'm doing on the Polaris cuz I'm trying to get out there to watch for ordinance violations and everything um as far as the beaches also so then a new category but I've been spending a lot of time as far as the area checks and everything so other than that with the weather it's a little bit but things seem to be kind of slowing down people are hopefully getting the idea that you know just do it right and get your permits like you're supposed to I'm sure the word is out we're we're trying to do that any uh questions or comments for the Des all right thank you very much sir you thank you sir and enjoy your party well thank my wife out for lunch oh

Kyle on looking for a home during these hours that this unit will be in service at First it's not going to be a 70 we 24hour thing uh we'll slowly phase it in and I believe one unit or another will be located here in the meantime until we get that other station constructed more than any Rock Beach as far as the calls were concerned we have had there was a total of 11 calls for service in Beach

thank you Chief all right now we are up to item six which is the City attorney rep Mr Mo U thank you Mr Mayor I don't have any significant report apart from the agenda items tonight I'm happy to answer any questions you might have um we we are forging ahead with the legislative session of course that concludes March 8 so we're just about at the halfway point of the legislative session um for those of you who are tracking leue of City circulates uh Publications and we periodically update you the memoranda some of the Bills moving through right now one that could pre local jurisdictions on short-term rentals um they're looking there's been some traction on the bills to increase Homestead exemptions which of course will affect cities and revenue streams and the like but uh if you have any specific questions I'm happy to answer your questions Council all right thank you Mr Mo I'm sure will be discussed more short now we're up to item seven the city manager report Mr brither thank you mayor uh run through the project quickly the uh Golf Boulevard undergrounded project um the latest from duke is the utility Consultants of Florida our project management um Consultants that are working with us they need to go and U request each uh property um that Duke is wanting to put equipment um to see if they would consider signing off on an eement um give the size of the RightWay on golf P um we feel like property owners are not going to want to sign that e but we are in the process of um checking with each property own to see if it's something want to consider otherwise the plan will go back to the original request which was to put the uh switch boxes in the um in the um name the whatever the other think um I Transformers okay yeah the Transformers on the RightWay cuz on Golf Boulevard you you have about 8 ft to the sidewalk and then you have another 8 ft after that it goes to the property line so there's plenty of room um for some reason um Duke is insisting that we request easements to put it on the property um we did s on south portion and we couldn't get them all so end up put it back to the right away just like keep you in the look of what's going on uh I I suspect that you know it'll irritate some residents to have this request but um it's part of the process right now to to go through this um star water Improvement project uh we have on the agenda for the award uh along with the the star water pump system design which is discussed in the work session so that two items coming up on the agenda the code review service we had the introduction by Lou Cerna um and he went over kind of the process that we're going to be going through we're going to divide up the chapters that he mentioned um into different groups the first group is going to be on the February 19th work session and the chapters that are going to be covered are chapter 10 22 30 and 50 so chapter 10 is building and building regul regulations chapter 22 is environment Chapter 30 Marine structures activities and facilities and chapter 50 is Street sidewalks and other public ways and the RFP for auditing Services next month's meeting we are going to have salt marsh our contractor for our audit come in and present draft act for which is the uh the annual copy of financial report um then the draft will go to the audit committee who will meet and at that time we will go over selection criteria for the RFP so we can move forward on next year's audit contract and that's all I have any questions Mr yes up kind so the gold Boulevard underground what what streets does this particular phase address so this is going to be North for cos Boulevard um and they're breaking is phase two um which we've talked about in the climbing process phase one was South the ca buar Phase 2 is north but the breaking phase two into two parts from um Causeway to 22 Street and then 22nd Street to the okay so this is the causeway to 22nd Street days uh what's both they're they're they just got to go down the line to each each spot where they design to put equipment and ask um if if the property owner is willing to Grant an easement okay um for this um naturally there's push back because people look at their yard they know wow there's a lot of space why do I need to put the equipment on my private prosity okay thank you that's timeline timeline yeah timeline that oh we're they're completely done um and the equipment is covered on the south end so that's we have all the materials in the marina that should be happening in a matter of months for phase one for phase two um optimistically hoping that we can get um rolling with utility Consultants of Florida is part of the job which is installing a conduit 3 to four months um throughout this project they they move through everything they need to do and then we kind of wait for for decisions to be made and if you can't get the eement what's what's the uh what's the backup plan backup plan is just put it in in the right way put any uh questions thank you m Freer appreciate it thank you all right we are on to the city clerk report I included my monthly summary in the agenda packet and I don't have anything of significance to report it looks like business as usual yes any questions or comments for I wanted to thank you very much for the complet of the agenda excuse me the um the minutes meetings where you actually do more than just record vote but a little bit about the discussion I find that very helpful sure anyone else thank you appreciate now we're on to consent agenda items 9 and 10 this is for approval of the January 8th 2024 city council meeting minutes and approval of the January 29 2024 city council work session minutes do I have a motion to approve motion to approve motion is made by Frank Banker do I have a second second also all in favor I any oppos consent agenda passes now we are on to the regular agenda item number 11 this is for consideration of appointment to the board of adjustments current alternate member Mark Mariano if Mr Mariano is here would he like to introduce himself to the council well I guess he's not here uh would anyone like to any citizen like to uh comment on this appointment again Drive Mr Mar has been an alternate member and so he's a great fit for the slide to do a voting M thank you all right uh Council I'm going to need a motion to appoint Mariano to the board of adjustments motion motion is made by franker again do I have a second goes to Roberts Mr Banker do you have the floor uh he's already aled it as gentleman said it's just a slide position all right let's do a roll call V for name council member bankard yes council member Roberts hi council member Shaw Elliot yes and mayor gtis hi so it's unanimous congratulations to Out Mr Mar and see thank you for serving our city all right now we're up to item number 12 this is for consideration of awarding project bid B 23-01 for Street grage improvements from N Street to Morgan Drive placed on the agenda by city manager Reaper Mr Reaper Flor thank you mayor um just to recap this project is uh to wrap up the rest of the stor water master plan it it expands from the uh 9th Street in the South to Morgan drive all the way north um most of this is uh necessary uh maintenance and um repair for our aging storm War system um quickly is a 26,000 Square y of Mill resurfacing for the streets 21,000 ft of curb replacement and 1,700 uh Cur blaz pip lining the uh there was two bids um that came in on demand star where we advertised and they were Kinga and R VZ Incorporated in Harbor Contracting LLC and harbor contract came in lowest um significantly by close to $500,000 and uh we uh checked on their projects checked on their work experience um checked on how they feel about getting the project complete in our timeline and everything came back great um they have AC good jobs with our neighboring City to the South Rock Beach um and they have um you can speak highly of Harvard so um it is my recommendation that we award the uh b 23-01 um storm water Improvement project to the uh liser Harbor contract [Music] LLC okay before we go to council comments and debate would any citizen like to comment on awarding this project a harbor contract yes sir up John Hans 22nd Street I understand the city manager to say this is primarily maintenance and repair so if somebody can refresh my memory my understanding that the remaining storm water system was supposed to be camera to determine whether or not new pipe needed to be done so I'm based on what you just said assuming no pipe is going to be replaced is that that that's correct only only Cure place lining for repair okay the other thing I want I I'm in favor of this I mean the citizens advisory committee worked on this very very hard while Lyn was still the city manager and we came up to try to cost reduce this to where once we started we would finish it all the way at one time instead of in phases moving equipment off site and then bringing it back because of the expense I'm assuming that's what this contractor is going to do to save the city money so I stand here in favor of this being approved we're into February hurricane season going to start in a few months it'd be nice to get the majority of this done before hurricane season we've already had two storms in recent months that have created havoc and it only going to get worse if we something hits us again so yall need to vote on this and keep going on it thank you thank you Mr any other citizens like to comment on this topic right citizen comment you closed Council going to need a motion to award project bid b2301 to haror Contracting LLC were you making a motion yes Roberts and second Mr Roberts you have the floor thank you mayor we discussed this um obviously the last meeting at which point it did not pass so there's been a lot of information available for this project the benefits why the city needs it uh I think that the U City manager did a great job of explaining the details and the cost it's time to move on this and get it done other comments from the council yes um well I Ved go last month I'm going to support this this month because do a war session some people done actually me agreement and I like to thank my colleague here coming up with an idea and a study pumps to affect her neighborhood F the whole city so I just want to say I think that's the way government should work things out come to an agreement and benefit I'm very happy to support this me thank and I'm very happy to support both measures I'm glad we were able to work through this uh so uh if there are no other comments I'm going to ask Rene to dooll council member Banker yes council member Roberts I council member Shaw Elliot yes and mayor gtis hi so it passes unanimously the contract is awarded to Har Contracting to help LC and thank everyone for working through this all right we are up to item number 13 this is for consideration of ordance 24-1 this is a first reading City attorney Mo would you please read the ordinance Happ Mr Mayor this is ordinance 20241 an ordinance of the city council of the city of b beach amending chapter 2 Administration Article 2 city council Division 1 generally to create section 2-31 of the city's code of ordinances entitled compensation of council to establish an annual salary for members of the city council and guidelines governing reimbursement providing for the in implementation of administrative actions providing for modification providing for separability and providing for effective date this has been a reading of ordinance 224-1 by title only on first reading council members this is a this ordinance was uh produced in direct response to um at least uh potential consensus Direction at the work session last week um I I drafted this based on the discussion you have as we are on first reading I want to underscore if this is not what you have in mind please let me know we can revise then as appropriate um the numbers used the the mayor during the work session provided U backup materials on what other communities compensate their count council members I believe the sample that was recommended to be used for this draft were the numbers from Indian Harbor Beach um and so those are the numbers that you see reflected here that's where those numbers came from in terms of the 350 uh for the mayor and the 250 for uh individual council members there was a somewhat lengthy discussion about expenses and a general understanding and agreement I think this is in line with your current practices that where you for example to go to the league of City's annual conference the registrations and things like that are typically handled by the city this memorializes that I would suggest that there was a discussion at one point that um it perhaps in Li of or as an alternative to a salary perhaps having uh reimbursed expenses that are directly associated with the office such as preparation um and completion of financial disclosure forms be accounted for that is not explicitly provided for here if that is something that you intend to provide for I would suggest that you make that explicit so that there can be no misunderstanding and there's not a question on trying to fit some you know the the proverbial square peg in the round hole but since that had been disc discussed as an alternative to a salary and this uh and the proposed measure was a salary I did not include that here nor do I is it my opinion that that would fall broadly within this I would prefer that if you intend to make something that distinct that you do so explicitly uh to avoid any any issues but that's the you have before you as far as the effective date you will see here because of your Charter it the ordinance shall become effective immediately upon enactment by the city council that's the ordinance itself but pursuant to section 2.03 of the city of Beller Beach's Charter the portion of this ordinance establishing a salary for Council Members shall become effective upon the date of commencement of the terms of council members elected at the second regular election following pass of this ordinance beginning first with the regular March 2024 election sign so that would that says that the first of the two the first one will be marched provided we have this adopted on a second and final reading for thank you Mr Mora before we go to councel Citizen like to comment on this proposed ordinance all right C comments are closed Council we need a motion to approve ordinance 24-1 so Mo motion made by Lloyd Roberts do I have a second second second by ellot Mr Roberts you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor personally I couldn't care less about receiving the salary my comments at the workshop were the following if this minimal salary that we're going to give out if it's approved would assist any of our citizens that were interested in being on our Council and the one thing that may have been holding them back would be the cost Associated for them with regards to the form six by having to hire someone to assist them and that varies depending on the complexity of uh the finan situation of some of our citizens but if that if this one item will help people feel like they're more comfortable in running for a Council seat than I'm in favor of and that's why I'm supporting thank you Mr Roberts anyone else like to make a comment I would Echo those remarks that's the only reason why I would support this um um I think that um as Mr Banker explained at the meeting it is an honor to serve on this committee we're not looking for salaries or for salaries for future people but just trying to find a means to help fill this board with all life people and and and try to eliminate any barriers that they might have thank you any other comments um I'm I'm dead against this but the word with Mr May I'm going to go for it um I don't think $250 a month $300 $350 a month is going to make anybody's decision change the council or not I totally believe this is an honor to serving people B our beach I think this is one great community and one of the reasons is because so much volunteer and while I'm going to vot for it I'm also going to Hope because this doesn't go early effect until 2027 earliest at the earliest and and the just for for the benefit of all when I say at the earliest that depends in part on how your election Cycles May flush out following the charter votes at the election Su and it can always be be repealed by the next Council every ordinance is subject to Amendment okay thank you all right and uh my reason for uh for bringing this to the council was um you see right now we have four we have four council members uh it's bad enough that the State of Florida is bearing down on us forcing us to do this for six uh I don't I don't see it getting better I only see it getting worse and every time that I meet with other Mayors um and we trade stories they all they all say you know we're not in this for the money but whenever they hear that we're getting nothing for what we're going through they they don't understand why we're doing it and I'm not going to say that anyone is is better or worse than than b beach everybody has their own set of values but what I will say is that this is a very very small in fact I'm pick the lowest salary that I can find in all of vanis County to compare us to and so I matched that salary and instead of thinking about it as a salary it's more of an appreciation pay for what we have to go through every day in the city um so that's why I propose this and that's that's uh I'm hoping in future we're not going to be where we're at right now but we have the full Council and we have people that are willing to step up and and join us in this fight to keep our city what it is um and that's all I have to say any other comments before I call for a all right Renee would you please call the RO council member Banker yes council member Roberts I council member Shaw Elliot yes mayor gtis hi and the first reading of ordinance 24-1 passes and we will vote on this again next month thank you once again to all my fellow council members all right now we're up to item number 14 authorization to execute a purchase order with Gemini engineering and Sciences Incorporated for the investigation and design of a storm water pump system city manager report you have thank you okay so this is the uh PP station design project that we discussed in the last work session uh engineering has put together a scope of services um the beginning work of this project is to uh look at some of the existing surveys we have also get information on the Underground utilities throughout the area of 9th Street um do some technical investigation and um explore what power is available to um run a pump that we're uh considering and um once this information is collected they're they're going to come up with a design um they already start started communicating with the pump company the Mi pumps that came to the presentation here in December and um they're going to uh find out give us a good estimate of of cost for the project and um what to expect how effective a feasibility study um would be to to install p and and what effect it'll have on the area of 9th Street so um that would be before we move forward with any um actual construction so it built in um B of the timeline provided by jni engineering um they estimated about one to two months to together this information and then uh we would have them come in to do a presentation to the city council um to um to explore if there's any revisions they want made or um just explain overall what they've discovered and um so that the council can make a decision on at that point um again the overall cost of the PO is 22,000 um but you know that'll be as we go throughout the project um how how we build out so just wanted to lay that out um again I include the proposal that uh work with engineer Larry floody and designing for what we need so that is all thank you Mr Reaper let's go to the citizens for comments uh Mark being Louis Drive unless we do something like the Netherlands did to block any water from the ocean coming in what pumps out there when we have a an incident a few times during the year to me is not cost effective and it's a waste of money just my opinion eventually I think we can change the name in the city in another 100 years none of us will be around probably call it Venice Beach because we're going to have flooding of every street and probably have gondolas going up and down the street it's just a matter of time thank you thank you Mr Mr hon John H Second Street you know several meetings back when we had many more residents here and we discussed this issue of flitting a statement was made and the reality is folks we're surrounded by water that's it's just like the previous resident you want to illuminate water build a wall and even that isn't a guarantee uh yeah I understand people down at the South End of the city which is lower than where I'm at complain a little bit but we have these check valves I'm assuming they function the way they're intended to I'm an old US Navy engineer I know about vales big time I fixed them all the time in pumps so I don't get the point and the other thing is um the estimated cost of this um research is $22,000 um when we went over the budget last year I don't know where it's going to come from it's not in the budget so somebody needs to Enlighten us as to where in the budget that money lies and I tend to concur I don't know that the Pu is the wise deal if everything else is working properly and in conjunction with that on the storm water system these receivers at the rain gutters if you will I can tell you that two or three of them there at Bay Shore in 22nd Street are two dad G small to accept the amount of rain sometimes they're too small and we're not doing anything about that either so that's probably something else that should have been considered initially so I'm just bringing it up again I spent 24 years in the Navy on seven different ships I know about these things so appreciate it thank you thank you Mr H would any other citizens like to comment on this topic all right citizen comments are closed before we continue I'm going to motion to authorize the execution of purchase order motion motion is made by Frank Banger do I have a second second second by Kim Mr bener you have the floor well we did bring in one contractor uh back in the summer at w pumps um and I gave him a bunch of scenarios uh and it's true when the water brings the seaw wall it's going to consist the flooding the problem is on the south end of this island um we don't get rid of the water until the tide goes below 2.5 ft therefore back door nalia we had water in the street till 5:00 people had it in their house uh National Guard didn't come down our street till I think 3:00 4:00 in high moving the vehicle because they couldn't get down the other thing is we just had a bad storm in December as mentioned which nobody evacuated it came in around midnight with 3 and A2 4 ft of water in the street we don't really have any someone had to get down these streets during an emergency ambulance or whatever you'd have to get a special unit to get down those streets so this is a matter of safety this is a matter not doing the same thing we did 75 years ago by putting replacing pipes that never really worked um clearly as MWI pump was the flu he said if you had no water in the street before it breached the seaw wall even after it breached the seaw wall that would vacated through the pumps and it would have stay being vacated for a long period of time uh yes he agreed that there might be water in the street it would be in your yard it would be in the driver you go down the First Street up to 14 15 Street it's a mess and we can do a lot better just by repaying streets replacing pipes uh when we did my street um six Street the check vals are too low okay they don't open up until I think it's down to like 2.3 ft so that water just lays and accumulates for hours and it needs we need to correct thank you Mr other comments it's my it's my pleasure to strongly support this measure and I like to emphasize that it is a feasibility study and I believe that it is our produ share Dy as being uh the the trustees of the money in this community to evaluate all reasonable measures that are available to us and uh that's what this study is designed to do and I Mr Roberts thank you Mr Mayor um like like the two citizens that spoke I think any time we have an opportunity to spend money to support our city we need to ask ourselves a few questions one of which would be a project that we're going to do does this support or Aid or help a majority of the citizens in our city so we have to ask that question we also have to ask you know the the amount of money we're going to spend for example if it doesn't support the majority of our citizens but it's a very small amount of money for the actual fix not not this particular study then more than likely that would be something we would probably want to take on that expense if it's a large sum of money and it only really helps or supports a small portion of the city we don't like to say no to anybody that are having problems but we need to make smart decisions with the money we're spending we don't know right now what that cost is going to be for the potential repair so this is a feasibility study as was stated earlier I'm trying to approach this with an open mind because my gut tells me the solution is not going to be inexpensive in order to try to keep this water out of here and that's what we need to rethink about how we're doing it now there could be multiple ways to to pay for this it may not even be the city's money you know perhaps the residents that live in that area could take on some of that cost or all of that cost kind of like when part of our city put in underground um electrical stuff so they paid for that via an assessment on their tax BS so things like that we need to consider so another citizen I'm sorry um we close citizen comments and we don't do back and forth during these debates I apologize but uh that's that's our standard practice um are you finished so we did we did talk about this at length at the workshop and for this feasibility study so that we can at least have an answer as to what a solution potentially can be along with some Associated cost I would say sort of reluctantly I'm going to support this but I am going to support it so we can move forward all right and uh give you a little backstory if you didn't see uh the the last regular council meeting uh we're in a situation right now to where the only way anything can pass because of our Charter rules you have to have a minimum four yes votes everything has to be unoun um this feasibility study was requ IR for us to be able to pass the storm water drain project uh there was no no other way around it it was killed by someone sitting up here and um uh this was through negotiations this is what we came up with this doesn't say that we're going to spend millions of dollars on pumps what it says is that we're going to do a feasibility study and see if it's even possible will it work and if so then we'll go forward from there and we'll have to vote again but this is the way that sometimes in politics you have to get things done and so uh I am all for this and I actually hope that we're able to do it I hope that it actually works out just one more I contacted the state and I'm also contacting the FED there are a lot of grants that support these some studies okay um pump replacement pump installations it may cost us very minimum to do this NWI pump C don't do it the whole city at one time do a couple streets we got nth Street we run to rip up let's do nth Street even works eight take take some problems away from the city hall it doesn't work maybe it doesn't cost us that much money until we do to study on we have any other comments from Council all right we're going to do another another roll call note on that's just for the record this is to authorize the city manager uh for the execution of the purchase order investigation and design of a stormw comp system okay council member Banker yes council member Roberts I council member Shaw Elliot yes mayor gtis I Mr reer you were authorized see all right we are on to item number 15 which is consideration for Public Works pay increases this was placed on the agenda by city manager Reaper Mr re you have the Flor thank you mayor uh so this is a pay study that uh over the past couple months uh Public Works uh Department had Community Services servic administrator has collected um some information from local municipalities um cities throughout and County this um was brought on by the fact that we've been experiencing increas in costs um especially cost of living for um this area of Florida and we wanted to compare the uh the wages to what other municipalities with paying employees so once we uh gather all the information I uh the community services administrator compiled it for me and then I evaluated I included a uh chart of the see nine municipalities that we were able to get job descriptions and varable um wages from try to arrange them in order um that you could see um in comparison we have two positions we have a service worker 3 which is the functions of crew leader and we have two service worker two positions um when you go through other municipalities depending on the size um and what uh you know what work they do whether they have different utilities Parks um facilities it's um you know you have to kind of look at um the different job descriptions try to find something comparable um I lay them out uh one thing I tried to um focus on is that you know I'm looking at a position that has um like lead responsibility for um service workers which uh in our city it actually stands across you know Parks maintenance utility maintenance storm water um and actual facilities um so um in doing so I uh laid them all out I couldn't find some some cities didn't have exactly what I was looking for as far comparable but when I did lay them out and average them I used that average um which is down at the bottom of the she that put together um to determine what the recommended minimum would be for each position that we have um the last piece of that is um we have two fairly new employees um that have not put in a year of service yet um so I believe that it is um you know recommended I recommend that it stay to get a starting salary but we do have another position that has been in the in that specific um Ser service worker three position for over a year and I made an adjustment um based on that based of what we typically do for our annual um Nar rase so that's how I arrived at the recommended adjustment and to restate the uh I recommend that we increase the hourly w AG for service worker 3 which is the crew leader um from $21 per hour to 2468 and the service worker two position from $18 per hour to $20 per hour um and I also asked that if we do move forward with these wage increases that we started at the current pay period which um began on January 28 thank you Mr rer let's go to the citizens for comments on this topic yes sir please come right Mr John Hansen 22nd Street where in the budget are we going to get to se money over and above Merit pay graes that were approved in the budget for fiscal year 24 so answer that question if this is approved um the calculating out the Personnel cost it would for a full year um we're looking at an increase of $18,000 in the public works budget um because we're about 13 into the fiscal year um currently it's about a $122,000 increase um that can be a budget adjustment that we can make at the next regular meeting or um typically we could um see how rest of the budget plays out with expenditures and find out if we if we need to even move that much any other comments from the citizens all right citizen comments are closed need a motion to proceed with the public works pay increases made by Roy Roberts second seconded by Frank Banger Mr Roberts you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor the short time that I've been here I know the city has had difficulty in replacing staff that have moved on for whatever reason in coupled with the fact that we have very small crews out there in the field when I first came here we had uh two service workers and obviously if one of those workers are sick or injured or go on vacation there's many tasks out there they can't be done by one person so it's imperative that you have from a safety standpoint and an efficiency standpoint at least two people there we have since then brought on one additional P person so we have three which is great but again I reiterate that the times that we have had one or two of those positions vacant it just took a long time for anybody to step up to the plate and apply first of all and a lot of it had to do with the salary so that was the I think it's a great idea that kle came up with to raise those to make them competitive with our other Beach communities down the street so that when and if we need to fill a position with at least be competitive and be able to fill them so that's why I'm supporting thank you Mr Roberts comments yes Mr manager if you could confirm please please are we Poli back or do we have any open positions we currently have admin assistant position open which is under the non departmental PL right this this department is fully staffed yeah correct it's been fully staffed since um the beginning of this later and I wanted to thank you for the charts and the comparison it made it made the data very easy to me understand so thank you I'm good with the all right and based on what I seeing our neighboring communities and uh and you know it's kind of hard to compare Apples to Apples because we do have employees that wear so many hats but uh the last thing that I would want is someone to have an easier job and make more by traveling 5 miles away or 2 miles away to go to another community so I'm for this and I will be more than have to vote on budget amendment whenever that time comes in it's absolutely necessary we have any other coms this you have the last word I say V all right would you please call the RO council member Banker yes council member Roberts I council member Shaw Elliot yes mayor hi Mr Reaper you are authorized to proceive please tell your staff that this Council greatly appreciates all their hard work is be happy do thank you sir item 16 is consideration of a second agendum to Employment contract for the services of Kyle reer as city manager of the city of b beach uh City attorney MO is it your it thank you uh Mr Mayor again this was done um in response to discussion held at our last work session um the general discussion contemplated a potential um function salary renegotiation with manager or additional um salary compensation what you have before you is a template um that reflects what it would look like were you to agree to a salary adjustments and proposed language and and in what that addendum would be the blanks are blanks because there was not a substantive discussion about the figure um as this amounts to a negotiation of sorts um I did not want to put you at any one figure based on you know any idea of mine or any single council member and so um I believe this measure is is more better understood as Mr bankerts than mine as I believe he uh initially proposed it so with that I would yield except to state that you have language here that we would conform to whatever uh this Council agrees should reach an agreement thank you Mr Mo citizens for com see is there are no citizens you'd like to comment on this uh we're going to close citizen comments and councel I need a motion to proceed with the second addenda motion motion made by Frank Banker May a second anyone like to Second this at this stage you're just seconding the discussion not not a second that uh to approve the final document right correct did I have a okay second Mr Mr Baker do you have the floor well first of all thank grenade for giving us all the work for the research that you did and I was alarmed a little B when I saw any insurers currently offering an inter inter manager position at 13649 out we only paying Kyle believe so Kyle's actually been doing this job in my opinion for 3 years come March he's well underpaid and if I was him if I didn't get some kind of a B I have my resume s that IND is tonight so in order to be good business people and reward our city manager and dedicates 247 to us I think $138,000 Sal very acceptable Mr Banker could you repeat that please 138,000 138 uh just for the record we also budget $180,000 and we're out looking for a city manager so we're still well below that Mark and if you look at De Beach 140 and de Rock Beach 159 uh we are still very very L Council may I ask a point of order here in that I understand that the city manager's salary will be a public record but are the discussions normally held in public and cir be before the candidate yes short answer um all of this is no it is in fact public record your question is well placed let me start from there your question is well placed but um salary discussions uh for even were I to come to you with a proposed amended contract for attorney terms um all of that is and all of that is uh takes place in the public because it's an official act uh which the Sunshine Law requires that any official Act of this body happening in the public the added complicating layer here is uh the position of city manager regardless of whether it's occupied by Kyler or anybody else is a charter position there are three positions in the city that you folks directly supervise that's myself the clerk and the manager and so those discussions happen in the open and should we ever come to the unfortunate place where you desire to have those positions vacated uh that would also happen in the public um I think your Charter might have some procedure set forth but generally speaking all of that is in the public and and I can and I I appreciate that question and I want to make sure we keep an eye on questions like that um um with with all respect to Miss Rose is she's starting in this position she has Decades of experience as a clerk in another state and even as we've started to handle some of the public records requests coming in there's things that in Florida are open record and in other states are not and so navigating that um it's it's totally normal for it to sort of rub up against s abilities but yes that happens in the public we don't have the ability to tell Kyle he must leave um during that discussion or that he should be excluded from the public he thank you thank you for that clarification I'm a little bit taken it back because we didn't talk about amounts before and I think all of us here are incredibly pleased with Kyle's performance and feel that he's imminently qualified position and and very very impressed frankly with with the way he's navigating through this and the breath of his knowledge so all of that's very good I think the fact that Indian Shores may be an outlier in terms of the size of the community and the amount of pay there um and I was just going to try to run a number and math is not my thing so I'm slow and pulling up my calculator but it seems to be a fairly large increase in a single amount um and there were negotiations for this position initially um it was an agreeable point at that we're off schedu that it's it's an acceleration of um a pay raise again fully support one it's a question of pay thank you Mr Roberts I think there's possibly two additional columns on this chart that that would help me and Randy talked about some scenarios with the city clerk but if I knew how much experience these existing city managers had with the city that they're currently the city manager in addition to how many years experience they've had as a city manager in total cuz they could have had 15 years at a different city albeit it could be different if they came from South Dakota because of the different rules and regulations there but it would still be they sat in a position and work the position as a city manager somewhere else that type of thing how brings a lot of value because he's been with the city not long in the city manag position but in a previous position where he's had an opportunity to learn about our city know our citizens and know the things that are that have been challenges to our city so that's very B but those those two additional columns would help me and I think Kim as well when we're seeing these numbers that somebody may have you know 185,000 that's a much bigger city Madera Beach 140,000 perhaps they've been in that position for 15 years I have no idea and maybe prior to that 10 years in another city but when we're just trying to bring it down to Apples to Apples any additional information like that I think helps us understand where Kyle's number needs to be if my math is correct that's an 18% increase and K did bring up another valid point which is we discussed this number uh way back when and it was agreed upon in a contract form and Frank also brought up a great Val point was another individual that we were willing to pay a significantly High number um which means we do have money in the budget uh for Kyle's scenario as well as some of those other positions that we talked about earlier so it's always a tough choice and decision K's doing a great job I don't know what the magic number is well it seems to me that 18% is a one half of a pay increase um at my family's company we did recognize that there was issues uh with with what we were paying people um inflation housing fuel manufacturers that we looked at and for the good ones I think the largest salary increase we gave an employe was a 10% raise in one year uh I I don't think I've ever given anyone an 18% raise in one La um so I calculated at 10% uh the salary increase to uh to become 26 5 uh that's what I calculated on that I'm uh I'm open to other suggestions it's not this is just we're debating on if I can mention one thing B air they took the I think it was 2020 they took the city clerk and advanced her into the city administrative act or whatever um gave her a I she was underpaid she was a city cler um so that's the lowest pable in there 126,000 everything else is well well above that um like I said we budgeted 180,000 I think Kyle worth 180,000 we I should say should say we got propose that worth it but whatever you want to if you have a number Mr Mayor more agreable well that was the number that that I was suggesting was 126.5 I that so that's 10% 10% that's 10% and it puts it in line f um a much smaller neighbor but oh no I'm sorry B gloves not B shorts right line with boves yes which is a community that has retail honors um just something that we don't hear have here I think um a 10% raise um is competitive and certainly justifi you agree Mr Banker yes all right Mr MOA on the contract the addendum it should State $26,500 and Mr Mayor members of the council uh um there is a second placeholder establishing when um that amount should take effect whether it is retroactive to a certain date or beginning on a certain date um you can see that in parentheses immediately proceeding the 2024 at the end of some paragraph a how do you wish to um handle that I would imagine the fact immediately so all right I can handle that to confirm can you just restate one more time for the record the salary amount $16,500 understood Council all right uh so going have to take a roll call on this one I'm just going to keep it going on this uh this is to create a second agendum increasing the city manager yield yearly salary to $126,500 you please call council member Banker if I may I'm sorry to interrupt just before we begin I want to be very clear procedurally this won't come back to you you've already seen the documents so we will if this is approved we will memorialize it execute it without further needes council member Banker yes council member Robert hi council member sha Elliot yes mayor gavis hi congratulations Mr Reaper Mr Mo please proceed to the second again thank you thank you very welcome lunch is on tomorrow item number 17 authorization of a sole source purchase of a wro waste stop 24 in valve for Street drainage improvements Project B 23-01 Mr thank you mayor this is a soul Source purchase it is a Lao uh check valve uh this is when we first started looking into check valves there are a lot of different models this is a newer more Innovative model than some of the ones that were done in the past you remember the dock flap or sorry the the duck mouth ones or the flap uh mechanisms that often would uh get jammed up and not closed back all the way so um these aren't perfect but they uh seem to perform a lot better than some the earlier designs and uh we've been using them throughout the city the uh currently have 14 install that we maintaining monthly um but this this particular one would go to the Swale out fall uh a Bayside Park and the streets that it affects is uh Cedar and Spruce which runs through the retention Pond up to the inlet to the S both of the streets so um again this is just a a soul Source a soul Source purchase um that uh per our purchasing procedures I need approval from councel it's part of the St thank you Mr re citizens for comments no comments all right C comments are closed going to need a motion to authorize this purchase motion by Frank Baker by Mr Banker do you have the I really think this should get included I 12 but it's a separate item just works both work thank you Mr Baker any other comments questions I think on this one we can uh we can just do a voice a Voice vote uh this is authorized city manager to purchase from a soulle source for a 24in valve for Street and drainage improvements Project B 23-01 all in favor I you oppos all right Mr reer you are authorized to proceed thank you number 18 authorization to purchase an xmart laser Z 48 in mower this is placed on the agenda by city manager R you mayor this is uh another uh purchase that is off of a state contract um the uh lawnmower is part of our capital equ equ uh replacement plan um we each year in the budget save uh $5,000 over time we build it up and uh right now we're du to replace our 48 in Toro it's a 2012 Z master um so this is an accountable mower um uh Community Services administrator Aaron glance he reached out to a lot of the Public Works departments uh throughout the county and ask uh just personal their personal opinion on what um newer model mowers have been working well with minimal repairs and the xmart laser Z came back U with great great reviews so um again this is a state Cloud contract that provides uh was public ad provides a 20% discount on the MSRP and um you we're looking to purchases from Chucho Cho La equipment who we've done business with in the past thank you Mr czen comments all right we're back to the council I need a motion to authorize this purchase motion made by council member Elliot do I have a second second second Mr Roberts Elliot you have the Flor this seems to be normal uh equipment purchases um things wear out we had a 20 plus year old home let's replace it other comments I just had one question about the uh the soul Source uh or not Soul Source but the uh because it's a state contract is it automatically the lowest price I know it says 20% off MSRP but nor only MSR is doesn't mean anything so my question is is should we have at least checked around to make sure that was the best price I believe that every uh authorized dealer of the x mark uses theate State contract and they all agree to MSRP it's a set price State what it is um it it it gets adjusted yearly you depending on inflation um do not think that if we went to each other authorized deal in state that we will get a different price if they've agreed on to to a market price and provideed off that state contract Mr Roberts yeah typically if you look at the state contracts I haven't seen this one specifically typically the language is in there that prevents the bid winner from selling it to anyone for a price lower than the price they gave to state so you feel comfortable normally that that's that's a great price all right any other questions or comments no all right this is to authorize the city manager to purchase an xmart laser c48 in mower all in favor I any oppos Mr you are authorized to proceed than you number 19 unfinished business unfinished bu time just as a point of comment just a quick Google search the more lit 12,999 so that could be 20% off that any other unfinished business right now we are on to item 20 which is city council comments this month we begin with council member Elliot oh wow I think we've accomplished a great deal tonight and uh prior week and I thank everybody for their cooperation and I certainly I know he's left with the night but I get right sincere congratulations to um officer uh sha Roberts um is it Robert Robert sh excuse me um and I and I must say that I have encountered him just in my daily walks throughout the community and I think he represents exactly what good public servants do he makes an effort to connect with people he's kind um he knows the area and he certainly uh gave his all on that day made from all right uh Mr Banker um I'm sure uh the traffic will start increasing the next couple weeks with the spring training com out and everything like that we'll probably have a lot of problem citizens not being able to get out in the street but I think it's something you just have to not much we can do happy birthday Babe Ruth 129 Mr Roberts yeah very happy that we were able to move the um Street and drainage project along the way so hopefully we'll get them started as quickly as they possibly can we all are familiar obviously with the hurricane season on June 1 that doesn't mean sometimes we actually have main hurricanes prior to that so it can happen um we hope we don't have any until August but that may or may not be the case so happy that that's moving along and it'll be enjoyable to see the improvements made and I know our citizens will enjoy that thank you thank you Mr Roberts as always I'd like to thank everyone who is here tonight and everyone who watched it home I'd also like to take this moment to thank this counsel for hanging in there not let the state run you off they tried it didn't work um I appreciate your your patience appreciate uh your your ability to remain calm even whenever we don't agree and uh I appreciate everyone having an open mind of being able to work together uh I still think this is one of the best councils in all in ell County I'm proud of everyone so with that do I have a motion to adjourn motion motion made by Frank maker do
