    "transcript": "good evening everyone welcome to the monday april 5th 2021 regular council meeting of the city of delaware beach please rise here council member frank baker council councilmember glenn gunn council member leslie ontario here councilmember rita spoke here vice mayor dave davis here mayor joseph manzo yeah city manager henrys okay first item of business um is the approval of the agenda do i have a motion second lesbian theory any discussion now on council i can't see the zoom so i uh is patti you monitoring that yes okay um um i think glenn if i say this tomorrow just uh let me know i believe joey shirley placed an application this afternoon for the citizen advisory board and i was just informed tonight that john hansig also placed an application did you receive that patty yes you say yes so we have two applications we were going to consider three people there's five slots um we now have two more people so the motion would have to be made by someone to amend the agenda to add those two uh applications so that we can consider all five so if council someone on council likes that idea maybe the motion will load on amending it and then we can take the whole agenda now you're just uh there's a sixth application but it's been held till the board of adjustment meets there's six total applications until because they here's the thing i mean if you vote tonight we put five people on and that person would be an alternate um is there a reason i don't know the person i don't know the reason so why not john hayes uh because they're having a hearing next month and uh he felt because of his experience he should go through that and then volunteering we would have to hold up the board placement yeah i mean that's a little bit of an issue only because what you and i were discussing today regarding the audit companies yeah so i'm just i want to go with whatever council thinks but i just think we should be pulling up five tonight [Music] and recipes too i have mr handstick that he just handed in and i have mr hayes in my office and how about baby charlie's i mean do we have the resume to council um maybe we put all of them off until next time when we have all the applications and resumes you can do that lynn and i were talking we might have to do that anyway due to some of the [Music] yes councilmember gunn did you have a comment no i i i i don't know also yeah we could get that microphone on that um all right so we'll we don't have to amend this we're not we're we're going to we have everyone's honor here we're going to table that vote that we get to okay that's what we're planning on doing this way everybody has fair consideration so then we can improve the agenda as is we have a motion through discussion any other comments on council citizens back to council last word going to uh david ice okay the next piece is the citizens comments we're going because of the virus here we're going to ask that you come up here speak right into this microphone because the people cannot hear you if you don't keep your mouth like about an inch away these mics are not that sensitive please give us your name your address you have three minutes to speak to the council please address the council and please follow the rules of procedure that we have for addressing council which basically means to speak nicely speculatively speak with everything else anyone would like to speak i'm not seeing any heads okay assistant comments are closed number three is the presentation of the pinellas county sheriff's office sheriff mitchell here for the month of february for the city you see our property in person prime enforcer and juan marston there was no no one was arrested in the city of bel air beach there was a total 595 trends traffic stops and house checks there was no crashes in the entire city and a total of 98 citations and warnings issued anything else you need to tell us about any questions [Music] you see we were doing stepped up controls for him [Music] some vacationers sure i have a report for you from the field something i witnessed um not in miller beach actually not here um um after two weeks ago there was a fundraiser who was killed and uh i said they weren't going to forget and i meant that i cleared my schedule and went to it and uh not here to brag that i got an award but i didn't give an award and it has this picture on it and that's not what i'm here to tell you about let me tell you that the community came out and they raised seven thousand over seven thousand dollars for his family and his mom was there and there's other fundraisers planned right now so it's just it's really encouraging to find that there's a lot of other people that feel like i did like [Music] [Music] so it was it was a big honor and i was very impressed with the community [Music] any citizen comments thank you very much good morning all right we'll do more so then she comes later we'll come together back for another one last month mark had his last council meeting and he gave him a plaque of death and we have one more award and one more you don't have a key to the city you don't have the president's award or anything like that the highest level of honor that we have in our city is the certificate of accommodation and i mentioned when we didn't know the results of the election he said that we want no one is more deserving than the council members who serve the amount of dedication that they give if i can get utilities i give you two because you did this twice uh two times two terms also served on our charter review committee uh and served on council he's instrumental in helping do the undergrounding and i call it your 40-point list of things that had to be done and he put together the citizen 40-point list of stuff that had been done i think we've done near about every one of them done between the first council and the second council so this is well earned congratulations uh so we have similar rewards for jovi that as she gets here we'll do that later on you're moving on tonight though we have board reports and mike kelly who's here from the board of adjustment i'll call him first thank you mr mayor council don't mind i'll pull that down and i hope audience could hear me i couldn't hear the officer in the back so this is that i appreciate it i'm here to report the board of justin actually did something this quarter says the board of adjustment meets on demand and hasn't met since march of 2019 for one our last years i accepted a suggestion from city manager lynn reeves that we get together as a board and have our own training session so march 11 the board here in council chambers did me for a little over an hour with a very very informative and very very relaxed meeting to go over the procedures explain why the board of justice exists explains the powers the protocol most of all to help them understand the application process anybody that's been to a board of adjustment meeting knows dave you've been through it as an applicant it's tough enough as an applicant to make sure you go through everything correctly but the criteria questions that the average advocate goes through are difficult number one to understand difficult to fill in and if you don't get all permanent votes on those criteria the board or special magistrate will deny your application it's only fair that every citizen get a due process protocol from the board of adjustment and that's why we have a training session here in a period of four months when dave first applied for year variance back in 2018 we did four hearings in a span of three months now we've had two years and absolutely no variances that's a good thing for the city it's a bad thing for the board but this training session has enabled us to bring new members up to understand what's going on i will finish by saying there are to my knowledge matty we have no alternates on court just right now is that correct and just like you said mr hayes is seriously considering or has applied for a position on the citizens advisory board inform the after the training session he thought you leave it are more than just if he is chosen to sit on the citizens advisory committee so i encourage anybody interested please put your names in as alternates and potential voting members and part of adjustment so got send any questions glad to answer first i want to thank you for putting it together um you reminded me i thought it was last year time flies and you're having fun but it was two years ago the last time you had and i did come to one about two of your hearings um if anyone's ever seen it i mean i kelly is probably the best person in the city when it comes to knowing how these procedures go to watch him run a meeting and actually give the information is incredible so that's a great opportunity that anybody had to study if you will underneath that setting so i the only i wish i had known about it earlier and maybe we could have even arranged to take something like that to show it to other people because something like that would have been very helpful you know so thank you very much for the compliment for newcomers especially it can be very very intimidating as a board member and intimidated by the advocate and the audience so i really hope that we continue that lynn thank you for suggesting that we have the journey session because to my knowledge we do have another variance coming up soon yes great thank you well hang on to someone's picture for the other comments and council but just everybody knows as mike said this is a place on judicial board they don't report to the council they're on their own and like you said if you get it wrong then the city can find itself at the wrong side of the lawsuit and all kinds of other problems they don't get it wrong so it's uh that's that's a lot of credit it's a great job i'll continue to do so thank you for any other comments citizens any comments all right thank you very much thank you parking reporter do you have someone here hey everyone good evening um i'm tamara prevenda i'm parker wreck board chair um so we meet monthly and i know i was hurting the month before last and we talked about a couple of events that we were discussing for this calendar year so after some feedback from residents park direct board voted to move jazzy apart which was originally scheduled for may to a little bit later in the year we feel that there were still some concerns and we thought it would be better to wait until everyone that wants to be vaccinated could be vaccinated and also to make sure that the program numbers were kind of where we need them to be for everyone to feel safe and want if they wanted to attend the event so our goal is to keep the budget for the event at approximately one third of our annual budget so around two thousand dollars but we'll discuss that more and look for feedback as the event gets closer but we're looking for maybe beginning of october or something like that um our current activity calendar is on a city website and the events are going well the blood drive was a success as it was built to capacity and i want to thank everyone that participated my cell is listed in several places on the city website so if you have any suggestions or requests for classes or events i believe in your phone calls and then as of today there are um because we've had requests so we kind of sourced them out but there are beller beach um men's and women's t-shirts tank tops um bella beach stickers and then koozies like for for water bottles i don't know if you can see it very well but everything is here there are different sizes different colors so lynn's going to post the pricing and if anybody has interest i just had some people asking we were able to get some good pricing we were going to do it at the jazz fest but because we moved it to the fall we thought it would be a good idea to get into the city hall civil war will happen on the desk if anybody's interested and then lastly we had two members on our board design for personal reasons so i'd like to thank rick and deaf for volunteering their time and talent but if anyone is interested in becoming a member it will be posted on the city website so does anybody have any questions or comments not different um years you know i have one and i bought it down in cnp so i could go to where i bought it they have two left i bought one for me and i bought one for my neighbor and like i didn't know there was more injury so i'll definitely go and see if they first weren't making them here so no problem that was entirely paid for 100 percent with contributions from outside sponsors the city after all was said and done the city made seventeen hundred dollars didn't cross the city of nickel and they used that seventeen hundred dollars to fund the other events and i think we wound up leaving about eleven hundred dollars in the bank because they you know pulled it and then i know there is a budget for this but is there plans to try and reach out and do similar sponsorships maybe particularly things like jazz festival and stuff like that that's not a so problem spent a dollar budget i have no problem trying to source it out i've actually had women come to me looking to sponsor us so yeah no problem council comments citizens any questions great just keep us surprised that's how things are going and you're welcome back here every month if you'd like would like to just hear that minimum thank you my name is zone board see some people jc greetings mayor council and welcome to the new members of city council i got a call here a few while a while back from lynn reeves and every time i get a call from glenn i think uh-oh well they asked if our committee would assume the code revision and investigation i pulled the committee who consisted of at that time angela barry and brendan puana sierra wanda who has been reporting to uh to counsel for us because of my absence and rudy davis and we said yes we would help out the city mortally knows that we didn't realize what size that code look was i'm sure he's very familiar with it but lynn asked us to do it and we met five times and i can say that all members were present at every meeting and we spent almost two hours per meeting and submitted final report to the city on some of the observations and recommendations from our committee and i know that uh everyone on the committee gets it out of the way award i believe mr mayor this committee was tough it was a tough excitement it really was and i thank them for helping and our service to the city we like to do it and we were glad to do it and if everybody spent as much time as our committee on the city situations i think we'd be in pretty good shape i have to thank lynn reeves and patty and laura for backing this up every meeting they were there and even a person named marvin used to come in and put needles in me at every meeting but we survived and mr mayor i'm sure you've got the final breadth and your committee did and we were proud to serve the city thank you to me on behalf of the town thank you your committee for hard work and effort in the middle of the pandemic nonetheless okay that's exceptional work i did have a chance to read through it i guess everyone else says tonight we're not going to debate at all um i had some observations some questions things i saw there's a lot of work that was put into that um and so i think what we're going to probably do is set this up with the city manager this morning we'll probably set it up for a future work session where we can discuss it further and review it and i also want to let you know because um he did another thing that was a tremendous amount of work a year ago right before coding hit you gave us a 90 plus page book about different options for this city all planning options and things some was stuff that we're probably never going to do but some stuff in there there was looking at then the buyers hit and then everything you know kind of went complete but um we're going to be reviewing that i want you to know that but i spoke with the city manager today we're going to be putting that on the work session and my new council members are going to hate me the old ones already do but that's okay it's a lot of work to read through all of this stuff you put it together we're going to review it and we're going to give you some opinions and you know and see what we're going to act and what we can do because it does do a lot marketing so i don't have any questions for you tonight per se i think we may have questions down the road on some of the things but um go open it up to the floor to anybody on the council and then to the citizens but i want to thank you and the committee for that report and for that prior report and we'll let you know that we will be getting on that pretty quickly within the next month thank you thank anyone else hang on jc is there any citizen comments yes patty [Music] i think this is the first [Music] foreign thanks very much thank you for

agenda consent agenda is approved his totality it's item six and seven so item six is approval of the march first 2021 city council meeting minutes and item seven is approval for 15 2021 special city council organization meeting minutes uh there's no discussion on this so we approve it in in mass we have a motion brian geiger gets a motion leslie second no i don't know [Music] [Music] normally you have to remove it from the consent agenda is it something simple that we can or something yes on the march first meeting item number seven it says the motion was made to table agenda item number six

advisory committee motion so guess council comments done there's mr goldman here golden's in the back would you like to speak tonight um all day we're taking one five right has seven zeros table last we have consideration 110 consideration have appointment of robert reisberg to the citizens advisory committee and council comments mr reisberg here mr husband's in the back to it was a good suggestion uh you can also make the most of it if you like motion there you go second second to robin and all in favor pass the seven to zero it's table sorry folks we will get this as soon as we can on the next agenda okay item eleven this is the request uh city management request authorization to utilize excess bellevue island and state's underground project funds for loan reduction and to refund and prepay the residence the description is to utilize the excess project funds to prepay loans in the amount of three hundred thirty thousand seven hundred seventeen dollars and fifty cents and refund seventy eight thousand four hundred seventy nine dollars and sixty one cents to residents who pre-paid in the pool we have motion here's what makes a motion second second um yes mayor console this is uh the undergrounding project and uh this morning i got an additional fifteen thousand dollar check to pre-pay another home so uh the motion for the 330 uh if we can amend that to say 345 866.69 a resident came in this morning because this is the month they did prepay uh when we just put in one second that's not in the motion itself so we don't have to amend it that's just in the description so you put that out there i will re-read it when we do the description when i call the question okay okay so uh the 78 000 is explained here there were 25 prepaids and that'll be split up depending on if they had overhead services so and i gave you the spreadsheet to kind of go over that a little bit with you as far as we will be paying on the loans that a b and c that money will be spread out equally and then they will do an updated amortization schedule and that's when we'll determine what the assessments will be reduced by to the people that are paying by assessment so all i'm asking tonight is to prepay the loan in the amount of 345 866.69 and start the refund process for 78 nine dollars and sixty one cents uh myself the accountant reviewed it and then i had a public advisory group who helped us with the loan a couple years ago we view it and that's all the data that was provided so we're comfortable with those numbers and we send a letter to the residents let them know that hey we saved you money and we're gonna give it back to you if you pre-paid and your assessment will be adjusted you've said this before an excellent job with making this happen and the cost savings i only have one question in reading the paperwork and stuff that's with it because once you send these checks out there's no getting them back okay are we we have assurance we're positive we're totally comfortable that this money is ready to be refunded no one's going to claw anything back no one's looking for any you know reserves or what have because we pay every year for the attorney to do a resolution and things like that and we do the assessment we'll make sure there's money set aside for that in the assessment but i know i'm comfortable with these numbers i went to a source that actually did the loan we even talked to brian miller olive the attorneys that did the loan because i wanted to make sure all my numbers were good numbers and my scribble numbers as i call them were within a couple blocks of their numbers so i think we were pretty confident all right i know it's like the pilot on the plane telling me okay anybody have any questions on council yes right is there interesting there's a little bit of interest that came from the sba but we've been putting it into that account as a total you know the 400 uh the 409 000 there's been a little interest and we've been putting it into that account so that they are going to get a little bit of interest back yes any questions back to counsel please hope his last word no i'm good got it okay so we're before the board is to request an authorization to utilize excess value island estates underground project funds for loan reduction into refund prepay residents that's the motion now the description has slightly changed it's utilized excess project funds to pre-pay loans in the amount of 345 six 866 and he said sixty nine cents yesterday that's 69 i can't believe nine in the four and refund seventy eight thousand four hundred seventy nine dollars and sixty one cents for residents who pre-paid in poll yes vote gets the city managers to do this um if i could call this individually this i can go my call is improved right okay all in favor all right you want to post that's the 7-0 city manager you're so authorized please move forward item 12 is to request authorization to waive additional bid requirements for community center uh closed circuit tv system and access control system this was tabled from last month we were requesting to waive additional bidding to award the 15 672.80 contract to integrated security consultants with the equivalent cameras requested by city council motion i'm sorry my little friend banker may be honest yeah mayor council this is we went back because of the hype vision cameras uh the not ndaa report and don't ask me what the thing is i'll have to ask any of that i've uh went back to the low bidder and asked him to give us a couple prices they still still would be the low bidder uh and so instead of re-bidding this again i'm just asking you to waive the additional bidding and the amount of six 15 two eighty we had two options that they sent us uh i did ask vice mayor has to look at him because he's in this field and he did and you recommended the problem just for the people who are here for the first time council member of that council member who asked now vice mayor um had questions addition so we tabled this last month um dave i'm going to refer to you and see if you're satisfied with this because i think you're all waiting on your stance between them before you move forward yes i am we went back to the bidder who made two few suggestions companies and uh their little homework one of the companies was relatively new uh in the market and whenever i tracked back where they came from they were chinese made the first one that i referred to i actually reached out to them and requested even though they bragged about not being on that list they did not provide me any proof city manager they gave us a lot of crosstalk on this because they was interested in all this so any other questions city uh anyone from the city any questions from the citizens back to council with frank banker having classwork okay okay so i'm gonna call the question number 12 to request authorization to weigh additional bid requirements from the community center closed circuit tv and access control system description is in your city manager's requesting way of additional bidding to award 15 672.80 contract integrated security consultants with equivalent cameras requested by the city council yes vote blessing to receive all in favor i heard of anyone closed has to set up the zero city matter you may move i'm forward is consideration of resolution 2021-4 a resolution of the city council of the city of valor beach florida establishing an audit committee providing for membership of the audit committee providing perception of care providing for duties and responsibilities thereof providing for meetings and providing for an effective date the description is this is consideration to establish community or review of city annual financials internal controls and compliance of policies and procedures see manager reeves you know i had a discussion on this this morning and i think there's some questions i think there's couple issues legal and now we don't have people from you're thinking about utilizing folks from the um citizens assistant citizens advisors of the committee is it established at this point so i think your consensus was to table this but i'll leave the council to do it at this point that's what you're looking for at this point yes mayor okay the the requirement just so the console understands there's a new audit to select a new auditor one governing board member has to be on the committee that's the requirement and the rest of the committee can be people that are having knowledge of finance and things like that but that's who will select our ex auditor our audit contract is is pretty much done now that we've had our audit for last year so we are going to be sending out the rfp here in the next couple weeks to to put that proposal out there and then the audit committee would have to review that but as i said the resolution kind of mirrors another city the mayor and i talked about this this morning uh the solution may be to select one council member and just use the citizens advisory committee as the rest of the members they'll have to meet and review the proposals once the rfps come in thus they'll rank them in order and then they'll bring that to the city council that's a requirement now by the foreign statute so that's what we're thinking about and then there were some issues you know because part of this is falling from putting all the council on and that was something i said well put all the counsel on the decision-making so there's some legal issues i think it's best that within a work session i read the question i'm going to ask for someone to make a motion but if no one makes motion it dies for tonight so i'm not telling you what to do but does anyone want to make a motion 2021 of the career resolution of the city council of the city of delaware florida providing the city clerk with authority to transmit adopted charter amendments to beauty code by the florida department of state and establishing an effective date this gives the city clerk the authority to transmit charter amendments adopted by the electors of the city from incorporation into the city charter and code of ordinances this is from the march election okay the other ones are out there right now um so we actually have two sets so first we'll have a motion unless we can tell us making motion second second is that right leslie i think this is just something we need to do obviously [Music] we have to speak right yeah i think this is you know just a very simple thing we have to convey them to the state and as well as communicate so they are available online so that this is a the voters have spoken that the charter amendments have passed this makes it official by putting it in the duty code and the state actually patty can i ask you i mean i think we're still waiting on ones november how long does this process take these folks no we have november so as soon as this is approved i can send it to the state how long does that well i really can't say i mean the last time you did it was ten years ago so i don't know how long it would take now it took me like four months to approve this community it took a while yeah okay anyway this has to be done any other questions on council citizens any comments let's say you have the last word a question okay so call the question on 1914 consideration of resolution 202103 a resolution of the city council in the city of valley beach florida providing the city clerk with authority to transmit adopted charter amendments to newlywed and the florida department of state and establish an effective day this gives the authority of a city clerk to transmit charter amendments adopted by the weapons of the city or incorporation into the city of charter until the board means this i'm tagging that this is from the march election a yes vote allows her to proceed all in favor and one of those council member banker aye [Music] unanimously and you may proceed thank you consideration of selecting council members as a voting delegate and an alternate voting delegate number one and alter alter and voting delegate number two for the barrier islands governmental uh council that's the big c we have to nominate and elect the voting delegates and members um so we have a motion second i put my name in for this i've represented us for the last two years traditionally the mayor is the representative um other people will i know uh mark dean used to go all the time and um leslie mccarran scene there wander sheree who's there from time to time so anyone's welcome to go big c just asked that the neighbors represent so i'm more than willing to continue to do that um i get my second shot tomorrow i'll be going back in person again um they have given that option i've stayed away from it until now but um be more than happy to represent the city we really need two other people though for alternates and i actually did put my name in for a nomination i just thought i looked at the list i did see a vice mayor i saw a council member and i thought i need to get to know the neighbors i see that you're on all right so let's just do primary then [Music] yes [Music] controversial public relations issues and legal actions so monica [Music] for those reasons looks like all the towns thank you i appreciate that frank your observation is correct and by the way frank has had a couple of our meetings um it's pretty amazing to start collecting a few meetings already i saw in some of those big cities um this the power of the big c is the mayor standing behind it if everyone saw our press conference about home rule last year it was the mayors who stood up and it was all mayors who stood up so it's not that other people aren't welcome they absolutely are welcome to be there but i'll tell you what bill clinton told me when i was first elected he said we want the mayors now bill clinton is a very influential member of the bc so um but i will abide by whatever this city says i'm more than willing to uh you know i'll continue to participate in the big c but i think they want the power of the mayors and uh and that's my my personal feelings are have nothing to do with that and myself professionally on this side we work with anybody on the big c for the goal of pretty much preserving the whole rule that we all really covet here we don't like tallahassee sometimes telling us that we're going to have businesses or um rented businesses and next door so that's what the big c plants were and the power of that is having the mayors to speak i know it sounds funny because we're all equal on this council there's seven people we all have an equal vote and there really is no different than anyone else but perception outside is mayor is the all-important person that's what was told to us at the at the emo training that's what was told here and um so that's that's the political end of it so i'll keep my name in it and we'll see how the vote goes what else anyone in the city and i will bring it back for a vote we're going to vote on the primary first so i might as well do a little call and um although it's either myself or for big guys councilman baker council member council members representative secondary representative we had leslie detero [Music] it says delegate number one and delegate number two is their preference [Music] delegate number two so the first person in the list is going to be the one that they go to if they can't make it then they're gonna go to number one and they're gonna go to number two so who wants to be one who wants to be two i'd like to be one so ladies first okay all right so um we'll do uh alternate number one we have leslie doterra all we don't

thank you very much um unfinished business do you have anything i'll give you some stuff in the update pick it up in your company city attorney um very quick report and that is i wanted to say uh congratulations mr banker and mr tara for winning their seats and i also wanted to say to marv and to joni i really enjoyed working with both of you and you were both extremely professional and simply pleasure to work with us and congratulations thank you for the city attorney citizens okay thank you fred this is your time lynn creates city manager okay mayor console uh if you look under tab 20 there's several things there you know we initiated a few months ago we talked to the county about the intersection we've talked to them about speed this is their draft intersection report they are going back one of the suggestions in here was to remove the palm trees at 12th street uh they are also going back to look at is it beneficial to move the island or is it a bad thing to move just put it into a normal crosswalk like we have at 6th street so there's some information for your reading free time you know also i put in there the traffic sign study that we've got up on boulevard they gave me the report for approximately three weeks of it being in there for the month of february and if you look at the chart for the most part the speed limits that we're seeing were actually under our speed current speed but we're continuing to monitor that code enforcement report is in for there to also read supplemental patrols i'll tell you after the fact they haven't got the information back from them but we have on the 19th and 20th and second third of april the county did pay us back uh fifty thousand dollars for the beach access walkovers so we got that reimbursed uh so it only cost us half a hundred so that's a positive thing but the county is willing to do that i mentioned earlier the rfp is going out later this month and will resolve this audit committee selection community the mayor and i both received a letter the fema map that are new are coming out and they're effective august 24 2021. we have not gotten the official map but we will be getting that shortly next week on the 14th we have our crs verification visit and that's our flood insurance rating it's every five years and kyle and myself i'm giving cops some training in it and we've put together a pretty sizable packet email to it it's going to be something a little different because usually they come here and then we can take them around this year it's going to be virtually so this should be an experience uh we also our elevation certificate certification for this year is is finished so those are things that are part of the flood insurance requirements um one question that has come up we're getting ready to pave harrison and the bellevue estates islands that will start somewhere around the 15th of april uh and if you recollect i don't know a year and a half ago there was a discussion about that island at the end of harrison [Music] rather we take it out or make it smaller there is a meter in there for reclaimed water for that little island and i know one of our residents has questioned us making the island smaller i don't know if that's a benefit or not i just wanted to get feedback from you or take the whole island out and pave it over now i did talk to a couple residents that mentioned that maybe the island needs to stay there because it'll stop people from going into their driveway it makes them circle so uh just want to get some feedback from the console what your thoughts are on that and uh and have you pulled the residence comparison i mean there are the intentions it's one thing for me to say but i don't well i've only talked to a couple of them because it it just recently came up because we're paving it we put a letter out that we're gonna paint the street um the the ones that are really concerns or the people at the end and we can do a quick poll and find out what they say if they say leave it as it is then we'll leave it as it is if that's okay or take it out entirely or whatever and i know mr moss is here he's one of the residents that thinks it needs to be smaller i'm kind of in the middle i can pay but even as it well that means you don't have to tear out the whole island to make it smaller you you just can't cut off part of the curb and put it put it back around if you like maybe one day this week so but i can get kyle to do that with you so i'll i'll tell you in the morning so let's see what the rest of it mr moss did you have anything you wanted to say about since you're the one that brought it up most recently all right let's just hang on a second counsel uh no i don't mind he's here i'd like to hear from him um it's lynn's time right now we have a president i would like to speak on this very topic does anybody have a problem with bringing them up at this point dogs boss [Music] [Music] and there [Music] [Music] eliminated [Music] just let your neighbors as you see them know that we'll be [Music] seventh and eighth street project is wrapping up uh we'll be doing a walkthrough of this week but next you know and they've got sod to put down things with it the painting is done the curves are done the check valve's been put in the new pipe's been cleaned so that is moving forward they're still uh their silt barrier is still out in the water until they get that sodded and stuff after that's done then we'll reopen it one thing that you do need to know we're going to have the dot that's there needs to be removed and we'll have to budget something in the next fiscal year and put it back it's currently uh after going through the project and looking at it we had an engineer look at it it means it's in bad shape underneath so we'll you know remove it but the boat ramp will still be there and then we'll put something to budget for the next fiscal year so the pilots that's that was the topic that looks fine underneath the woods pretty pretty rough so i received the uh cost estimate from duke for underground health boulevard last on april fool's day and i thought it was it was just because it was 5.5 million dollars and uh i've sent him an email back and i have a little more discussion with him about doing some things like we did with bellevue estates on we kind of hired our own person to put so we need some negotiations so we'll resolve that um only last thing uh is work session do you want to do one in april uh things we talked about were the review of the code enforcement uh looking you know on the planning stuff and what i'll do is paddington to the new council members i'm sure they haven't seen that you might have to rescind us all okay we'll just do that daddy redo the thing we want to um set up a date i mean i there's a lot to go through too much else on this because we can spend two sessions just going through the planning board's first report by the wrong code so um you want to split it up i mean it's it's waited this long wait a month but i don't need to get into the budget season real soon yeah and the code enforcement things really what the council needs to do is tell us what you give us your feedback on the report the things you want to change we can start on that you can you know get the city attorney to start writing the ordinances to update those things some of those things in there in the recommendations those are very simple to fix and if the concept lessons we'll be able to move them forward but it's not going to be a process that you can do like that uh you know we may go through half the report and say okay these things are fine let fred go ahead and start on you and then we'll go back it's kind of like the charter we did that last year so we could start with that send the other report out and then schedule something this year for the budget as i mentioned we gave you the calendar i'm looking at starting the budget for obsessions in june to try and give us a little bit of head start with the concept so you aren't packed in where you got tourism budget meetings and as i remember the planning board suggested binder they didn't recommend most of them they just gave them price outside the box so they came up with some stuff that i think some of it it's really thinking outside the box but we're probably not going to do it so we might be able to go through it fairly quickly i think when we get something like the marina that's going to be a discussion you know so we might want to set up a night just for that my suggestion would be maybe start with that code one this month keep the new uh um and leslie a chance to go through that 90 page book because i've already read it then um you know maybe hit that next one that's just my suggestion i'll take it in any order it doesn't matter and so whatever well some of the some of the code things you know in the play the code review report some of those things are going to be constant's going to say yeah let's go ahead and change those wording or this word or maybe one word so those are simple things that could probably move rather quickly and we could start with the city in turn rewriting you know the ordinance to replace them so i would agree with you that the good thing may be [Music] well usually we do it on the third monday which is the 19th uh i don't know what everyone's schedule is i'm not available until the 22nd so i'll be 19th 21st 22nd i could come telephonically [Music] the next monday is the 26th sixth unless something else comes up confine it to the sign ordinance and the code and then next month we're going to hit that uh big planning book and then we'll plan that on the third one so if uh you can plan whatever that third monday is around 17th or 18th you have any months okay that's all i have and uh the uh patty did a lot of work with searching i just want to say the that came back from from uh munico we're getting ready to send that that portion from the november election to the state uh and i think you know it took them a little while to decipher it and whatever they do to a massager but having reviewed it and everything looks good so we'll be forwarding that for the state to serve and the november were starting the process and i'm afraid if you have nothing else to do i don't want to decide the fact that the next election is the final installments of the quote uh of the charter review recommendation so we've got plenty of time it's not till next march but i'm just i'll say it now because you know when you get the budget you'll start forgetting about these things so there is i think four or maybe four amendments as i remember so there's a body still they're not as important in the level of importance of how we're getting to the lesser ones yes any questions i am still struggling with our multimedia system and i believe everyone on the council is it's better but it's still it's not good enough is there a plan i think we're going to have to bring someone in similar to what bellaire did and let them come and hire help us but we've got to start on it and i think going forward it's just a process see where some immediate improvements could be made at very little money and i want to talk to you about them just because uh it's a struggle it's a struggle for all understanding i'm not sure how uh council member gunn is doing on his side uh councilmember uh god can you hear us it's a struggle music we need to make more improvements that's the struggle yeah i i can't i can't i can't remember where glendon just said what i think uh i would like to do is work with lynn and establish a preliminary budget for a quick fix right and then a long-term budget for the final phase because this is ridiculous it's not your fault but we definitely think we can do it i mean there's guitar players who play the local bar that have a better pa system okay you can hear them sometimes they're too loud glenn gunn is talking on the zoom he's 10 feet away from me frank can't hear her he's keeping away from me i can't hear john hanson he's shaking his head from the audience i can't judge shirley's shaking his head in the back of the audience i mean we're not even holding a good public meeting with this everybody has to be able to hear what's going on right it may be upgrading the speaker system from other things which lifespare now every special microphone microphone well one microphone that seemed that it did pick it up a little better so that that's part of the process to buy those get rid of these but we want to find the type that you can push a button turn it on because the one we bought as a test doesn't have a button to it but it did it picked up we used it on vice versa it did seem to work well so hopefully that'll help part of the [Music] have you looked into that light on the end of donato ranger 22nd turning it up because when you go down 22nd to take a left on donato it is so dark and you have to be aware of it if you just take it like you normally would you could easily hit somebody so can we look it's the donato it's really dark but scary and then second um when we were on that zoom call with the sheriff will terry i asked him about looking at percentages of use with bel air short did he ever get back to you on that i've asked him about that a couple times and i haven't got any response about it other than they they were going to work on it well it's beyond that so what what just so the council understands what could happen he could come back and say well we'll just take that deduction out and you pay for your own that's what we have which is about i think was 35 000 if i remember right is that the sheriff's choice or is that something that counts our council i'm asking for a point of information because i have no idea i'm not proposing i'm just saying is that something we could decide to do if we want or is that something the sheriff has to do to make separate contracts or they do their own stuff we do our own stuff and well i i think the feedback from the council would be very important to give to him and i just don't know who makes that decision well he at the time i guess you know i'm just speculating at the time uh the sheriff well i know it for a fact at the time the sheriff became our service provider uh our police department did that service for bella shore so at the time uh when the sheriff took over our contract 2007 i think it was he gave us whatever the number was at that time he gave us a credit or doing that services one of our deputies so uh just just asking for thought you're curious yeah i've asked captain miner a couple times about that and she basically told me he knows they're supposed to be working on it the only concern i really have is are we willing to take if they come back and say well you know on the other side you want to take the additional expense and say don't do anything over there you know what i'm saying you understand what i'm saying okay we're getting the credit for that police service that they're doing to bellar short in our contract if we don't allow our deputy to do that then we would pay that thirty five thousand dollar credit but isn't miller sure paying directly but the sheriff gives us a credit upon our contract of 35 000. off the bottom line yeah so our contract if they decided not to do that then our contract this year as an example would be if it's uh at five it'll be like 5 35 or something but i i can send you that direction i don't understand that i don't understand why [Music] it should be the same in theory right i mean no no they're giving us a credit because they're using our officer to provide that service to the belair shore so bellar shore is paying the sheriff and we're getting the 35 000 credit basically with that contract our time of service where we were receiving service from the sheriff's department would go yes instead of sharing with bel air shore right he would be responsible for working out their own contract right and they would be completely separate right and basically what i was told is they just go to the next city and probably give them the credit somehow so is it how much impact do we have because it's actually working as a sublease right shift so how much will [Music] it depends on the day and time you really got to look at it some weeks and months it doesn't really affect us in any way shape or form now if there's a call to bell or short it takes an inordinate amount of time but you got to understand the sheriff sends backups okay to these situations whether it's in our city or that city so uh it's kind of a what i would call an abortion away but if you took to the amount of the contract i think we looked at it was like 45 minutes per shift okay that they should devote well do they devote more than 45 minutes per shift maybe saturday and sunday they might but monday tuesday wednesday thursday they probably don't you know so that's kind of how you got looking at it well that's kind of what i was asking for is that due to recent issues if more time is being allotted than normal and now the time limit is going up and therefore we're kind of losing out because we're because when they're busy over there dealing with shade they're neglecting speeders over here so that's what i'm curious about if that number amount of time has gone up due to recent issues and if so that's just information we need that's what i was asking the sheriff right so keep that in mind i haven't stopped any other questions going i wanted traffic sir um um [Music] because [Music] i think the real problem is not it's not the roads it's not it's not the sheriff's department the city of the clearwater village and we're basically held hostage by the city of clearwater you have you have cars back non-public coming in they're not coming here they're passing i mean that's what i'm saying but it impacts anyone from wall street and it's actually never started coming into making perhaps [Music] we didn't have that suggestion i think you threw every other suggestion adam um and you know we didn't come away with too much that they were actually able to be for us they were supposed to be monitoring this light here at the intersection i was sitting in a 40 minute jam so i saw what that was working the other way and it was backed up almost to uh to the hardware store so far it was it was one of the worst i've ever seen um i don't know that might work i mean i have met with this guy tom washburn a few times that's what got us that other thing one of the observations is and i've actually put myself into the gym a few times just to see what was holding it up one of the things we've done was that a lot of people were slowing down and real big mansions that the baseball players mentioned stuff like that and that's why we put that sign there that hopefully they would actually maintain it but winter showed us the results and they're going slower at the side because i think their sightseeing because a lot of times it freezes up in the deputies when i spoke they were saying it was freeing up after 17-18 if you put those in which is a good idea the question is how much of an effect does it have on people coming over the bridge then so the planners have to tell us that you know and it does give us a break i feel for the people but we don't we're kind of out of solutions because you know we talked about doing something with the bridge it can't be done because it's built with federal money so you can't do anything to in any way tax people told people anything like that so that's not happening you sure as hell can't buy property and make the roads bigger that's not happening so i think it's just your idea is good if it doesn't back it up even further but then you talk with tom washburn and put these ideas out there that light by the way i mean i i sat in the same traffic jam for eight minutes 20 minutes yeah i did the last two weekends for two or three times so it's been uh i understand the pain this way i uh maybe i was lucky but you know i i waited at uh let's see it would be 19th street probably five or six minutes one day because i had the deputies doing uh checking to see if people were sidetracking you know going from like morgan or hibiscus shooting down i haven't got that report yet but they did do some of that movement but i waited three or four minutes you know to get out to make a left turn if you made a right turn i did that too made a right turn went down you got down faster and you made a left turn and went into uh morgan park and came back out then you could make a right turn and go back the other way that's a heck of a way to get around the city but look at other issues i went to the marina here down there it does it does break up let's add to that just so that if we manage to get out let's say we want to go to publix we may not be able to come home as soon as we get in our heart we take us 45 minutes that's right it's relentless and as far as people entering their their neighborhood if we picked on one street and said this is the one that you activate to get out well now you just you burdened john hanson because i think you volunteered for it i think he did too [Music] you tell them basically you would be funneling all of the north side traffic down one street which is going to create another problem i've also noticed that if there is a gap if there's a gap at all if they see you easing up to get ready to leave they punch every time it's it's a nightmare and turned out to hear sometimes i don't know what what the fix is but right now the fix is don't leave after 10 a.m on a saturday if you do don't plan on coming back until five o'clock weekend publix opens at 7 am i've been there just for that reason to avoid traffic all the way back there's no easy solution folks and um i mean you know i'll say i tried i was personally attacked because i made suggestions with the city manager and i mean it was nasty as if i was going to get bags of money delivered to my house from the toll bridge [Music] you know if you like the traffic you can keep your traffic if you want it fixed okay then support the people that are trying to fix it they'll attack them because i don't know that there's an easy solution frank has made a good suggestion i've never heard this before it should be looked into but please don't crucify him if it turns out that it's not good he's trying we'll have okay discussion with tom see what their thoughts are is it it's a county road that's that's part of the whole process [Music] [Music] um getting a lot of feedback noise coming from over there is it are you going to zoom with it i've got to turn down because i'm hearing everything they say twice well that's part [Music] counsel comments before i go to the citizens do you notice your hand up first then john will do you next okay a couple things i was just warning first of all we don't do that obviously at the end of 7th street but they're doing that silver project and i noticed the equipment even bigger the city used to have some ripple like hedges there to kind of give it a kind of a barrier so you couldn't really see it from the road i mean the houses i noticed this yesterday the houses around that are going to have to see that the one on the right i don't know most people you pull into their driveway and you see this big equipment right there um is there anything the city can do as far as shrinking i mean we're very thankful to the county for fixing the plugging issue um the second thing is is is this city willing to roll the dice now i do know they back each other up through cities but if you are sharing a sheriff and two incidents come up at the same time the other city sheriff is tied up are you're making them make that decision as to who they have to go with i mean you're making the officer make that decision this this city should be looking at its citizen safety first so i i believe that this council needs to take a serious look at as spending that 35 thousand dollars in absorbing and making sure that this city is safe first making our citizens thank you thank you if there was a dual call what do you think back up on something like that yeah i mean isn't that a procedure they bring in different times there's people from bellar gloves over here there's people from indian rocks no they they bring back up yeah can we ask one of the gentlemen in the back yeah i'm sure could you uh sergeant when you come back um speak on this in terms of if you get a dual call you know let's say you're on and even i mean for that matter you know you're in bellarmore or bellar beach and then make it paul and bella shore how do you handle sure the comment from the citizen was um where council member aki had brought up this goes back a year ago when we had the sheriff's contract there was an allocation i think it's around thirty thirty five thousand dollars for the patrols in baylor shore she had raised some questions at the time she's raising them again asking if he got an analysis from the sheriff so the first question is where do we stand with that analysis secondly the next the citizen question is if if we were to say you know is there a situation where let's say the sheriff could be a claw in bel air shore and then would have to not do a call in miller beach or vice versa call the mail or be killing one person does that be better sure you know what i just said is i think you get on the walkie-talkie and get some more people in but i'm not quite sure what the procedure is yeah i'm still not quite sure of the question i'm i can't comment on the allocation right that is not my position to comment obviously for events and sheriff but in regards to the safety of the citizens i didn't hear that question presented um i don't see that as a concern because yes ellard shore and delaware beach does share one demon however we have bellar bluffs we have me we have my corporal we have in the iraq speech we have the unincorporated deputy so i can assure you if there's ever something that is serious of nature i'm gonna allocate deputies to come over here and assist and as a as long as i've been here in the city that's never been an issue so i hope that answers the question if it doesn't hear the answer it does for me i'm not sure about the rest of the accounts i mean we're both fortunate in both cities i have listened sometimes happens if there is something at the same time anybody else share a thought here thank you sergeant thank you okay all right john hansen this is golden marines now this is the lynn reeves meeting [Music] john hanson 22nd street um in the beginning of uh wins lynn's briefing spoke about the island here at 12th street and the palm trees that were doing surveys maybe the county should consider taking that whole island crosswalk completely out in my mind it makes no sense that you have that crosswalk within two blocks of the crosswalk right here at the intersection of golf that's contributing to back up on the right terms not going to solve the problem on weekends i guarantee you and i think i heard a comment about a traffic control device on the weekends but i can tell you too from personal experience one made the mistake of going blows on a saturday that was going to be christmas clearwater road from there over in an hour all i could see was traffic all the way down bay went over here to 8th street from down indian bronx another mistake backed up there and then the intersection was a dope rope i can't use the navy terminology um because people were sitting in the middle of the intersection trying to make left-hand turns and through traffic wouldn't get through took over an hour to get home we have come to the conclusion my wife and i we get our stuff done before 10 o'clock on saturday and it will stay home for us today on the weekend and even trying to cross the street for 22nd to go use the um access by the motel to be challenging but then i forget at the next parking lot you've got a crosswalk near there and then the next one is way up the street before you get to work apart so sometimes we get lucky people stop and let us cross but i don't know what we can do either so just made a comment but take take to the county and ask them what about taking out that whole gangnam crosswalk here at the parking lot well they're they're looking at uh their recommendation in this intersection study is even looking at the two left turn lanes to give people at least off built over it on the causeway but they're looking at they did recommend to take the trees out because of visibility they are looking at taking the islands out but leaving the crosswalk which um i guess in my mind it would could create a problem for the people on 12th and 13th street because there's no island there because what could happen is the uh where the island's at that does stop people from lining up all the way down uh gulf boulevard expecting a left turn but you know the consultants will look at that and get back to us but they did right and they did recommend at least leaving the crosswalk because there's a lot of activity on 12th street that goes across to the beach access well one more observation too you know recently somebody was between 12th and 13th to 14th to cross gulf boulevard with their dogs i guess to go to the beach they used to cross walk just crossed right there at whatever this high street was so you know some of his personal responsibility that's that's true people crossing where there's no crosswalk all the time doesn't matter where you're at you can be a pillar of love indian rocks you know all of us have driven that way think about all the people we see going across this street intersection there's no point so thanks thank you okay any other citizens yes [Music] uh i don't know what the answer is [Music] right i mean as you're speaking i'm i'm getting signs from the people sitting in the back they can't hear like kelly's family ago [Music] like i said they have better systems at the local bar for the guy who plays guitar so yeah we gotta do better really we're a premium city right so [Music] okay do you have anything else no you sure all right all right city clerk you only have about a 45-minute presentation all right we moved to city council uh for the uh for the new members the way i do this is on an even month and i try to do it alphabetically and um vice versa myself in the last comments but i go automatically so it's an even month i start running my way down next time i'll start doing this so this way you're not always in the same spot so is it even a month then robin hockey you're up first first off i'd like to say congratulations to frankie leslie and glenn for winning happy to serve with you guys looking forward to it other than that i think i've already made my comments sorry that's it thank you thank you yes uh just two things um [Music] on march 27 yes and you can see she's in one of these tents which is no higher than probably two and a half comes out okay it's behind it's actually lower than the first portion of the sea wall she says you're going to need to remove that she's really polite but that's a shade structure the childhood is three years old six months old i understand this litigation that um this could go on in my opinion for years i i would love to see the council get together to try to work something out get these things uh sooner than later i'm sure there's no residence you don't want to make a dime on this thing you just want to go to the beach if you leave if you read the two bellaire shore color beach access band points i don't think we've done our job uh in the beginning to keep you know non-residents out i think there's a lot of ideas i can come up with i think bel air shows has got some legitimate complaints about non-residents i've seen and i don't i'm not sure they're uber drivers but no they're not my kids because i've seen people tip and drive when they get out so i and they get out and they go on the beach and they you know what i'm trying to say is they don't read the signs you just go on the beach on growls or whatever the deputies are overwhelmed it's not their problem they patrol what they need once a weekend they set up their umbrellas or whatever whatever trash the beach leave and it impacts the responsible citizens of this town okay because i've got neighbors that don't want to go to the beach but it impacts us when you come here on saturday you'll see course park here you're going to wall street you're going you see a mayor going down the street just one thing uh i got a request from a citizen of uh 102 with history about her miami curve is actually sinking a little bit it's it's causing a uh is that sheila yes yeah okay all right when gun first off i'd like to welcome our new council members i look forward to working with you at least for the next year also to jody shirley and mark it's been an honor and a pleasure to work with you and i know you're not going anywhere i see names coming up for volunteering and things like that please stick around you've made a serious impact on the city and it's greatly appreciated other than that i apologize for being out at the last meeting i was forced into vacation and it rained the entire time that's the payback i guess but i'm looking forward to uh reviewing uh the code uh all the suggestions and uh i think that there's probably a couple of things that were missed or uh or just recently came up i've discussed some of that with lynn and i'll be bringing that at the next meeting other than that i appreciate everyone coming and thank you thank you i'll let goldie welcome to train banker and uh welcome back to leslie mataro and again our uh and you know of course clem gunn we won again um and thanks to judy shirley and tomorrow being for excellent careers um frank i appreciate what you said here um you know because of my special position i can't believe it too too much i just want to let you know in fact um that might help uh before all of this stuff went when they when they passed the ornaments across the street in back in my june of last year i had reached out personally to the mayor just as friends who were friends um and i asked him come on this is a mess he understood that i would understood it he asked me for a month july 21st and this council agreed that lynn reeves was going to represent the city to go across and uh asked him july 21st to see what would be done and then three of us glen gunn joey shirley and myself went as private citizens and very nicely joey shirley i remember uh gave all the options that we had these you know basically someone who came from shock someone came from a work session about gate controls and you know things that would give you stepped up police controls they rejected that when god had some suggestions i had some suggestions explaining to them about how the the legalities of the eastman threats just saying you know i bought ears like going to that beach they didn't do anything and been reads multiple times said we can work this thing out come on let's book this thing out and they rejected him so that's when the letter started and then um two months went by the deadlines long extending pass back then for them to do something and they didn't do anything and then i i had no choice but to like take the legal action because my property's been affected and so is yours and everybody else's so i'm taking i can only take the fight right now for myself but everybody knows that i'm thinking about it [Music] this is heartbreaking to see a young child in a tent and then to be told that and i'll tell you something i'm gonna say this publicly we don't please this is litigation file so it's a record it's out there people have it you got a similar picture and i didn't take this picture but um it is um allegedly one of the council members sitting under a cabana drinking beer out of a grass bottle from two weeks ago on the beach there so while the little baby can't shave themselves they are it's just that so um to the extent that people want to do something that they always can try and build something out that option is always there but um it's getting worse and not better and this is i have videos of people like people sending videos of people being one person almost got the ticket um and it was an eight-year-old girl watching our parents getting dusted on the beach because he had an umbrella so that's all i'll say about it because that's those are facts i'll need to give you any other information but thank you please watch out this is not right um i only have one thing and it's uh something i just want to sing to under about to know and i have served for a year now on the mayor's as representative to the emergency services of pinellas and um that's police fire the ambulance and at the last meeting i was elected to the executive board of that so i'm going to be serving on the executive board for the emergency services committee so that's a big honor for me and i'm really glad to assume that and should anybody have any issues with any of our emergency services police fire ambulance please let me know because i have direct input now to that well i always have direct input now i just have more input so i'm looking forward to that new role so i'll be doing that for the next year other than that that's all we have right now um we have a work session coming up on the 26th that's at 6 00 p.m and we'll go back to our regular schedule and that's our part we're doing here on april 14th at 3 pm so if you're available for that other than that i will entertain a motion for adjournment i'm thankful exactly everyone have a good night thank you for [Music] coming"
