    "transcript": "good evening everyone welcome to the monday april 5th 2021 regular council meeting of the city of ballarat beach please rise for the pledge of allegiance i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america and he will come forward one nation under god indivisible with liberty council member frank banker council member glenn gunn council member leslie otero council member rita spoke here vice mayor dave gattis here mayor joseph manzo yeah city manager lynn reeves and city attorney fred riley here and london is joining us on the telephone correct patty uh zoom unzoom okay very well i just want the record to reflect that okay first item of business um is the approval of the agenda do i have a motion move by dave gaddis a second lesson in tara any discussion not on council i can't see the zoom so is patty are you monitoring that yes okay glenn gunn have no comments um i just wanted to make sure that we're all agenda with respect to the advisory board can you hear that i heard that i think i know i think we heard that there was a application um glenn gunn is i think glenn if i say this wrong just uh let me know i believe jody shirley placed an application this afternoon for the uh citizen advisory board and i was just informed tonight that john hansig also placed an application did you receive that patty yes sir he's saying yes so we have two applications we're going to consider three people there's five slots we now have two more people so the motion would have to be made by someone to amend the agenda to add those two applications so that we could consider all five tonight so if council someone on council likes that idea make the motion we'll vote on amending it and then we can take the whole agenda mayor just uh so you know there's a sixth application but it's been held until the board of adjustment meets there are six total applications okay he applied the design until because they have a hearing so okay well here's the thing i mean if we vote tonight we put five people on then that person would be an alternate um is there a reason i don't know the person i don't know the reason so why not john hayes uh because they're having a hearing next month and he felt because of his experience he should go through that and then volunteer we would have to hold up the board placement yeah i mean that's a little bit of an issue only because what you and i were discussing today recording the audit committee so yeah so i'm just i'll go with whatever council thinks but i just think we should maybe vote on five tonight i get a nod from dave gaddis leslie we don't have the applications and the resumes for the london team do we i don't think patty got now i'm i'm sorry i can't hear you you didn't have the applications and resumes for the other two i have mr hands that he just handed in and i have mr hayes in my office and how about even though she's a known entity do we have her resume and application um i emailed that out to council okay to me maybe we put all of them off until next time when we have all the applications and resumes we could do that lynn and i were talking we might have to do that anyway due to some of the to some of the technicalities it's not going to mess you up with the audit committee is it okay no yeah maybe we'll table that but um why don't we just leave it on the agenda then and okay when we get to it then you can go down to six thanks mayor yes um councilmember gunn did you have a comment no and i i i'll i'll accept that i'm going to say perhaps vote on the four positions for which we have four applications forward and preserve the fifth open until everybody gets to review the ones from mr hayes it's hard to hear him but i think he said he was okay with it yeah okay yes and i i'm having a hard time hearing him also yeah he could get that microphone up close on that um all right so we'll we don't have to amend this we're not we're we're going to i mean we have everyone's word of honor here we're going to table that vote when we get to it okay that's what we're planning on doing okay this way everybody has fair consideration so then we can improve the agenda as is you have a motion you went through discussion any other comments on council citizens back to council last word going to uh dave gaddis uh none okay i'm sorry we can do a voice vote to approve the agenda all in favor okay the next uh piece is the citizens comments we're going because of the virus here we're going to ask that you come up here speak right into this microphone because the people cannot hear you if you don't keep your mouth like about an inch away these nights are not that sensitive please give us your name your address you have three minutes to speak to the council please address the council and please follow the rules of procedure that we have for addressing counsel which basically means speak nicely speak the way we speak with everyone else anyone like speak i'm not seeing any hands okay citizen comments are closed number three is the presentation of the pinellas county sheriff's office sure we have someone here good evening corporal curling from the fellas county sheriff's office for the month of february for the city you see our property in person crime reports there is one larceny there was no no one was arrested in the city of bel air beach there was a total of 595 events in the city which resulted in 656 units responding of the top three they were directed trolls traffic stops and house checks there was no crashes in the entire city for the month of february and a total of 98 citations and warnings issued that's it okay anything else you need to tell us anyone on council have any questions or comments i had one have you noticed any impact having the speed science on gulf boulevard yes that has a big impact especially for uh spring break i think two weeks ago traffic was pretty backed up and you could tell either people were obliging by the speed limit sign or it was just too congested at the time but it's definitely made a major impact thank you i see we were doing stepped up patrols again and uh i one of them happened to be right in the block down by you know one from me and uh looked like it was plenty of customers so how was your experience with that there's a lot of people uh visiting the area obviously parking with them in a designated parking area somewhere somewhere obviously uh parking tickets were issued to some vacationers so hopefully they can learn from the next time they come and visit the city anybody on council sheriff i have a report for you from the field something i witnessed not in ballard beach actually out here um quaker quakerloop last two weeks ago there was a fundraiser for the deputy who was killed and i said we weren't going to forget him and i meant that it cleared my schedule i went to it and uh not here to brag that i got an award but i did get an award and it has this picture on it and that's not what i'm here to tell you about i'm here to tell you that the community came out and they raised seven thousand over seven thousand dollars for his family and his mom was there and there's other fundraisers planned right now so it's just it was really encouraging to find that there's a lot of other people that feel like i did and i'm sure like we do here in this community and i'd like to just pass that on that um you know there was good support for him there was 250 cars and they couldn't even fit him in the lock anymore people would have other collector cars so um so it was it was a big honor to participate in it and i just wanted i was very impressed with the community and how everybody came together so and as any citizen comments tiffany thank you very much you have jody and mark here good morning okay mayor jody's on her way back from orlando and talked to her right now all right we'll do more so then if she comes later we'll take anybody and take that out of order back to another award um last month marv had his last council meeting and we gave him a plaque a desk plaque and we have one more award and one more uh commendation it's in ellerbe we don't have a key to the city we don't have the president's award or anything like that but the highest level of honor that we have in our city is the certificate of accommodation and i mentioned when we didn't know the results of the election we said that we thought no one is more deserving than the council members who serve with the amount of dedication that they do if i can give you two of these i'd give you two of them because you did this twice two times two terms mark also served on our charter review committee uh and served on council was instrumental in helping with the undergrounding and i call it your 40-point list of things that had to be done and he put together with the citizen 40-point list of stuff that had to be done and i think we darn near got every one of them done between the first council and the second council so this is well earned congratulations and it was an honor to serve okay so we have similar awards for jody's and as she gets here we'll do that later on we're going to move on to 95 though we have board reports i know my kelly was here from the board of adjustment i'll call him first mike give me mr mayor council if you don't mind i'll pull that down and i hope audiences can hear me i couldn't hear the officer in the back so if this is better i'd appreciate it i'm here to report the board of justin actually did something this quarter since the board of adjustment meets on demand and hasn't met since march of 2019 for one of our last hearings um i accepted a suggestion from city manager lynn reeves that we get together as a board and have our own training session so on march 11 the board here at council chambers did meet for a little over an hour with a very very informative and very very relaxed meeting to go over the procedures to explain why the board of adjustment even exists explain the powers the protocol and most of all to help them understand the application process anybody that's been to a board of adjustment meeting knows dave you've been through it as an applicant it's tough enough as an applicant to make sure you go through everything correctly but the criteria questions that the average applicant goes through are difficult number one to understand difficult to fill in and if you don't get all permanent votes on the criteria the board or a special magistrate will deny your application it's only fair that every citizen get a due process protocol from the board of adjustment and that's why we had our training session here in a period of four months when dave first applied for a year variance back in 2018 we did four hearings in a span of three months now we've had two years and absolutely no variances that's a good thing for the city it's a bad thing for the board but this training session has enabled us to bring new members up to understand what's going on i will finish by saying there are to my knowledge patty we have no alternates on the board of justice right now is that correct correct and just like you said lynn mr hayes is seriously considering or has applied for a position on the citizens advisory board informed me after the training session he thought he'd be leaving our board of adjustment if he is chosen to sit on your citizens advisory committee so i encourage anybody interested to please put your names in as alternates and potential voting members of the board of adjustment that's all i've got any questions i'd be glad to talk to glad to answer tonight first i want to thank you for putting it together um you and i spoke i mean i did patty the credit should you put in a great manual thank you very much thank you lynn did it whoever did it very well done for um you reminded me i thought it was last year time flies when you're having fun but it was two years ago the last time you had it i did come to one about and kind of came to two of your hearings um if anyone's ever seen it i mean mike kelly is probably the best person in the city when it comes to knowing how these procedures go to watch him run a meeting and actually give the information is incredible so that's a great opportunity that anybody had to study if you will under you in that setting so i the only i wish i'd known about it earlier and maybe we could have even arranged to take something like that to show it to other people because something like that would have been very helpful i'm sure you know to a newcomer so thank you very much for the compliment for newcomers especially it can be very very intimidating as a board member you can be intimidated by the applicant and the audience so i i really hope that we continue that lynn thank you for suggesting that we have the training session because to my knowledge we do have another variance coming up soon yes great thank you oh hang on to someone's make sure to nail their comments with council but just so everybody knows as mike said this is a quasi-judicial board they don't report to the council they're on their own and like you said if you get it wrong then the city can find itself at the wrong side of the lawsuit and all kinds of other problems they don't get it wrong so it's uh that's that's a lot of credit to you before it's a great job we'll continue to do so thank you council do you have any other comments citizens any comments i thank you very much thank you david parker right there do we have someone here hi everyone good evening i'm tammy lavenda i'm park and rec board chair um so we meet monthly and i know i was here i think the month before last and we talked about a couple of events that we were discussing for this calendar year so after some feedback from residents the park and record voted to move jazz in the park which was originally scheduled from may to a little bit later in the year we feel that there were still some concerns and we thought it would be better to wait until everyone that wants to be vaccinated could be vaccinated and also to make sure that the coded numbers were kind of where we need them to be for everyone to feel safe and want if they wanted to attend the event so our goal is to keep the budget for the event at approximately one third of our annual budget so around two thousand dollars but we'll discuss that more and look for feedback um as the event gets closer but we're looking for maybe the beginning of october or something like that um our current activity calendar is on the city website and the events are going well um the blood drive was a success as it was booked to capacity and i want to thank everyone that participated my cell is listed in several places on the city website so if you have any suggestions or requests for classes or events i welcome your phone calls and then as of today there are um because we've had requests so we kind of sourced them out but there are beller beach um men's and women's t-shirts tank tops um bella beach stickers and then koozies like for for water bottles i don't know if you can see it very well but everything is um here there are different sizes different colors so lynn's gonna post the pricing and if anybody has interest i've just had some people ask and we were able to get some good pricing we were going to do it at the jazz fest but because we moved it to the fall we thought it would be a good idea to get them into city hall so laura will have them like behind the desk if anybody's interested and then lastly we had two members on our board resign for personal reasons so i'd like to thank griff and deb for volunteering their time and talent um but if anyone is interested in becoming a member it'll be posted on the city website and we welcome your application so does anybody have any questions or comments no yeah um years ago i guess maybe three or four in east africa each license plate the diamond plate in front of the cars have you guys looked into that because i've got questions from other payers and saying that we can't get them you know i have one and i bought it down in santee so i could go to where i bought it they had two left i bought one for me and i bought one for my neighbor and like i didn't know there was more interest so i'll definitely go and see if they can order some more and we can get them here okay so no problem okay i have a question for you last when we did the festival last time that was entirely paid for 100 percent with contributions from um outside sponsors you may the city after all was said and done the city made seventeen hundred dollars didn't cost the city a nickel and they used that seventeen hundred dollars to fund the other events and i think he wound up believing about eleven hundred dollars in the bank because they you know pulled it hit and the events had to stop and everything i know there is a budget for this but is there plans to try and reach out and do similar sponsorships maybe particularly things like jazz festival and stuff like that sure that's my problem no one has mentioned it until today and so we haven't spent a dollar in the budget i have no problem trying to source it out i've actually had a couple of people come to me looking to sponsor it so yeah no problem any other council comments citizens any questions great just people surprised that's how things are going and you know you're welcome back here every month if you'd like but we'd like to just hear at a minimum of quarterly reports so if you could just you know keep us advised that things are gone thank you thanks hiding in zoning board see some people kc greetings mayor council and welcome to the new members of city council i got a call here a few while a while back from lynn reeves and every time i get a call from lynn i think uh oh well he asked if our committee would assume the code revision and investigation i pulled the committee who consisted of at that time angela berry and brenda puana sierra wanda who has been reporting to uh to counsel for us because of my absence and rudy davis and we said yes we would help out the city lord we knows that we didn't realize what size that coat book was we could never find the attorney he disappeared i'm sure he's very familiar with it but then asked us to do it and we met five times and i can say that all members were present at every meeting and we spent almost two hours per meeting and submitted the final report to the city uh on some of the observations and recommendations from our committee and i know that uh everyone on a committee gets an atta boy award uh believe me mr mayor this committee was tough it was a tough sign it really was and i thank them for helping and our service to the city we'd like to do it and we were glad to do it and if everybody spent as much time as our committee on the city situations i think we'd be in pretty good shape i have to thank lynn reeves and patty and laura for backing us up every meeting they were there and even a person named marvin used to come in and put needles in me at every meeting uh but we survived and mr mayor i'm sure you got the final draft and your committee did and we were proud to serve the city thank you let me on behalf of the town thank you and your committee for all the hard work and effort in the middle of the pandemic nonetheless okay that's exceptional work i did have a chance to read through it i i guess everyone else has tonight we're not going to debate it all um i had some observations some questions things i saw there was a lot of work that was put into that um and so i think what we're going to probably do is set this up i spoke with the city manager this morning we'll probably set it up for a future work session where we can discuss it further and review it and i also want to let you know because um you did another thing that was a tremendous amount of work a year ago right before code had hit you gave us a 90 plus page book about different options for this city all planning options and things some of the stuff that we're probably never going to do but some stuff in there there is looking at then the virus hit and then everything you know kind of went to fluid but um we're going to be reviewing that i want you to know that okay i spoke with the city manager today we're going to be putting that on the work session and my new council members are gonna hate me uh the old ones already do but that's okay it's a lot of work to read through all of this stuff um you put it together we're gonna review it and we're gonna give you some opinions and you know and see what we can analyze and what we can do because you guys put a lot of hard work in it so i don't have any questions for you tonight per se i think we may have questions down the road on some of the things but um i will open it up to the floor to anybody on the council and then to the citizens but i want to thank you and the committee for that report and for that prior report and i want to let you know that we will be getting on that pretty quickly like within the next month thank you thank you thank you i had my shots i gotta get my last one anyone else hang on jc is there any citizen comments yes patty um one council member glenn okay go ahead he's on soon i just want i think this is the first body of work that i've seen where we tied our future directions and actions to our vision and goals in the strategic plan so it's a really a landmark breakthrough for the work that's gotten done and it certainly has the fingerprints of various people like juan square one of the plant owners of the strategic plan it's really good who kind of gets all that stuff but the kudos to all of you you did a great job on that thanks very much thank you so for those of you who couldn't hear glenn gunn said kudos couple times excellent job and that's pretty much that so um again tracy thank you for the hard work we clicked our awards at the door you can get your awards at the door and the cadillac is waiting outside for you just kidding all right that takes care of the board reports for this month next we go to the hard work [Applause] all right so now we go to the consent agenda the consent agenda is approved in totality it's item six

discussion on this so we approve it in in mass we have a motion frank banker gets the motion leslie second no i have a shall i say a correction to the minutes okay um hang on let me let me get with

you go second second to ramen and all in favor pass the seven to zero it's table sorry folks we will get this as soon as we can on the next agenda okay item 11. we have to get something i can get something done on over here this is the request city managers may request authorization to utilize excess bellevue island estates underground project funds for loan reduction and to refund and prepay the residence the description is to utilize the excess project funds to prepay loans in the amount of three hundred thirty thousand seven hundred seventeen dollars and fifty cents and refund seventy eight thousand four hundred seventy nine dollars and sixty one cents to residents who pre-paid in full i have a motion city manager yes mayor and console this is uh the undergrounding project and this morning i got an additional fifteen thousand dollar check to pre-pay another home so uh the motion for the 330 uh if we can amend that to say 345 866.69 a resident came in this morning because this is a month they can prepay uh then they just cut in one second that's not in the motion itself so we don't have to amend it that's just in the description so you put that out there i will re-read it when we do the description when i call the question but we don't need an amendment okay okay so uh the 78 000 is explained here there were 25 prepays and that'll be split up depending on if they had overhead services so and i gave you the spreadsheet [Music] to kind of go over that a little bit with you as far as we will be paying on the loans the a b and c that money will be spread out equally and then they will do an updated amortization schedule and that's when we'll determine what the assessments will be reduced by to the people that are paying by assessment so all i'm asking tonight is to prepay the loan in the amount of 345 866.69 and start the refund process for 78 479.61 myself the accountant reviewed it and then i had a public advisory group who helped us with the loan a couple years ago review it and that's all the data that was provided to you so we're comfortable with those numbers and we'll send a letter to the residents and let them know that hey we saved you money and we're going to give it back to you if you pre-paid and your assessment will be adjusted accordingly in next year's taxes we've said this before excellent job with making this happen and the cost savings i only have one question in reading the in the paperwork and stuff that's with it because you know once you send these checks out there's no getting them back okay are we i know we have assurance we're positive we're totally comfortable that this money is ready to be refunded no one's going to claw anything back no one's looking for any kick you know your results or what have you right there there's nothing no no what we we if you look in the uh we've got a little five thousand dollars because we pay every year for the attorney to do a resolution and things like that and when we do the uh assessment we'll make sure there's money set aside for that in the assessment number but i know i'm comfortable with these numbers i went to a source that actually did the loan we even talked to brian miller owlette the attorneys that did the loan because i wanted to make sure all my numbers were good numbers and my scribbled numbers as i call them were within a couple bucks of their numbers so i think we were that's like the pilot on the plane telling you he's pretty confident he could land it you know so yeah you're confident you're good right yeah okay anybody have any questions on council yes right um 178 000 was there interest approved on that money uh no no there's a little bit of interest that came from the sba but we've been putting it into that account as a total you know the 400 and was it 409 000. the 409 000 there's been a little interest and we've been putting it into that account so that they are going to get a little bit of interest back seriously yes anyone else on council any zoo anything on the zoom patty good okay i'll open up to the citizens citizens any questions back to council for your smoke has last word no i'm good call it a question you got it okay so before the board is to request an authorization to utilize excess bellevue island estates underground project funds for loan reduction and to refund prepay residents that's the motion now the description has slightly changed it's utilized excess project funds to prepay loans in the amount of 345 866 dollars and i think he said 69 cents yesterday that's 69 i can't read my nine and a four and refund seventy eight thousand four hundred seventy nine dollars and sixty one cents to residents who pre-paid in full a yes vote gets the city manager to do this um do i have to pull this individually because i can go i can call this a group right okay all in favor aye aye aye anyone opposed pass the seven to zero city manager you're so authorized please move forward item twelve is to request authorization to waive additional bid requirements for community center closed circuit tv system and access control system this was tabled from last month we were requesting to waive additional bidding to award the 15 672.80 contract to integrated security consultants with the equivalent cameras requested by city council motion dave uh i'm sorry we're doing frank banker and big data frankly before [Music] we went back because of the uh hikvision cameras uh the uh not ndaa report and don't ask me what it the thing is i'll have to ask dave that but i've uh went back to the low bidder and asked him to give us a couple prices they still still would be the low bidder and so instead of rebidding this again i'm just asking you to wait the additional bidding in the amount of 15 670 280 we had two options that they sent us i did ask vice mayor gaddis to look at him because he's in this field and he did and you recommended the one we selected so i'm just asking for constant approval just for the people who are here for the first time council member that i'm council member guys now vice mayor um had questions and issues so we tabled this last month um dave i'm going to defer to you and see if you're satisfied with this i think we were all waiting on your um of approval before we move forward with it yes i am we went back to the bidder who made two suggestions uh two different companies and i've been a little homework one of the companies was relatively new in the market and whenever i tracked back where they came from they were chinese made and i really couldn't find a reputation on the other one uh i believe was korean right thanks for sure uh and uh they were not on the nbaa ban list the first one that i referred to i actually reached out to them and requested even though they bragged about not being on that list they could not provide me any proof that they would comply so that made me feel better about my decision i want taiwan so you're comfortable at this point council do we have any other questions for city manager or dave gaddis i'll allow crosstalk on this because dave was instrumental on this so any other questions city uh anyone from the city any questions from the citizens back to council with frank banker having the last word question okay so i'm gonna call the question item 12 to request authorization to waive additional bid requirements for the community center full circuit tv and access control system the description is your city manager is requesting to waive additional bidding to award fifteen thousand six hundred seventy two dollars an 80 cent contract to integrated security consultants with the equivalent cameras requested by the city council yes vote blossom to proceed all in favor aye anyone

the description is this is consideration to establish a committee or review of city annual financials internal controls and compliance of policies and procedures city manager reeves you and i had a discussion on this this morning and i think there's some questions i think there's a couple issues legal and now we don't have the people from you're thinking about utilizing folks from the um citizens committee assistant citizens advisory committee which isn't established at this point so i think your consensus was to table this but i'll leave the council to do it at this point but that's what we're looking for at this point yes mayor okay uh the the requirement just so the council understands there's a new audit to select a new auditor one governing board member has to be on the committee that's the requirement and the rest of the committee can be people that are have knowledge of finance and things like that but that's who will select our next auditor our audit contract is is pretty much done now that we've had our audit for last year so we are going to be sending out the rfp here in the next couple weeks to to put that proposal out there and then the audit committee would have to review that but as i said the resolution kind of mirrors another city the mayor and i talked about this this morning the solution may be to select one council member and just use the citizens advisory committee as the rest of the members they'll have to meet and review the proposals once the rfps come in they'll they'll rank them in order and then they'll bring that to the city council and that's a requirement now by the florida statute so that's what we're thinking about and there were some issues you know because part of this was calling for putting all the council on and that was something i said both we put all the council on we have the decision making so there's some legal issues i think it's best dealt with that work session i read the question i'm gonna ask for someone to make a motion but if you no one makes the motion it dies for tonight so i'm not telling you what to do but does anyone want to make a motion once plus no one okay it'll be uh it'll come back in another day okay thank you okay item 14 consideration of resolution 202103 a resolution of the city council of the city of delaware beach florida providing the city clerk with authority to transmit adopted charter amendments to munico and the florida department of state in establishing an effective date this gives the city clerk the authority to transmit charter amendments adopted by the electors of the city for incorporation into the city chartering code ordinances this is from the march election okay the other ones are out there right now um so we have to have two sets so first do i have a motion leslie terrell's making the motion second second second that was that radar yes um i think this is just something we need to do obviously you know and i see no no issue with it at all [Music] um yeah i think this is you know just a very very simple thing we have to convey them to the state and as well as communicate so they are available online absolutely correct that this is a the voters have spoken the charter amendments have passed this makes it official by putting it in the municipal and the state actually approving it patty can i ask you i mean i think we're still waiting on the ones from november how long does this process take these folks no we have november so as soon as this is approved i can send it to the state how long does that take well um i really can't say i mean the last time we did it was 10 years ago so i don't know how long it would take now but it took him like four months to approve this from youth right it took a while yeah all right so okay anyway this has to be done any other questions on council citizens any comments let's say you have the last word question okay so calling the question on 1914 consideration of resolution 20 2103 a resolution of the city council in the city of bellar beach florida providing the city clerk with authority to transmit adopted charter amendments to munico and the florida department of state and establish an effective date this gives the authority of the city clerk to transmit charter amendments adopted by the electors of the city for incorporation into the city charter until the ordinances i'm adding that this is from the march election a yes vote allows her to proceed all in favor and what opposed mayor could i do a roll call on this one yeah okay thank you yes councilmember gunn hi councilmember aki i council member banker aye councilmember noterow councilmember swope vice mayor goddess aye mayor manzo aye still seven to zero pass unanimously and you may proceed thank you thank you 15 consideration of selecting council members as a voting delegate and an alternate voting delegate number one and then ultra alternate voting delegate number two for the barrier islands governmental uh council that's the big c they have to nominate and elect the voting delegates and the members so we have a motion [Music] second second second second newsletter dave i will uh yield back to the mayor okay i have put my name in for this i've represented us for the last two years traditionally the mayor is the representative um other people go i know uh mark dean used to go all the time and leslie the terror i've seen there wanda schweer was there from time to time so anyone's welcome to go the big c just asked that the mayors represent so i i'm more than willing to continue to do that i get my second shot tomorrow i'll be going back in person again um they have given that option i've stayed away from it until now but um i will be going back in person so um i'll be more than happy to represent the city like we would really need two other people though for alternate so you know so a volunteer leslie okay and frank and i actually did put my name in for a nomination uh i just thought whenever i looked at the list i did see a vice mayor i saw a council member and i thought it'd be good to get to know the neighbors i see that you're on uh you're representing us on other like to put my name in committees four figures yes is it primary yes all right so let's just do primary then mayor yes councilmember gunn had a comments yeah i just want to say that i think it's very important the collegial working relationship with our uh our neighboring cities and i think the person who represents can't be encountered by controversial public relations issues or legal actions so my tendency to lean towards the first words of fresh outlook and support dave dennis i know it's time to counter to your tradition but i think we really need to make some considerations here on those for those reasons thank you anyone else on council um it's right i reviewed in some of the east council or in some of these positions and it uh it looks like all the towns do have the members that you made so i'm gonna thank you i appreciate that frank your observation is correct and by the way frank was at a couple of our meetings um which is pretty amazing since we just got elected and come to a few meetings already i saw him in some close legal cities this the power of the big c is the mayor standing behind it if everyone saw our press conference about home rule last year it was the mayors who stood up and it was all mayors who stood up so it's not that other people aren't welcome they absolutely are welcome to be there but i'll tell you what bill clinton told me when i was first elected he said we want the mayors now bill clinton's a very influential member of the big city so um but i will abide by whatever this city says i'm more than willing to uh you know i'll continue to participate in the big c but i think they want the power of the mayors and uh and that's my my personal dealings are have nothing to do with the way i handle myself professionally on this i really work with anybody on the big c with a goal of pretty much preserving the whole rule that that we all really covet here we don't like tallahassee sometimes you know telling us that we're going to have businesses or um rental businesses and next order so that's what the big c fights for and the power of that is having mayors to speak i know it sounds funny because we're all equal on this council there's seven people we all have an equal vote the mayor really is no different than anyone else but the perception outside is the mayor is the all-important person that's what was told to us at the at the emo training that's what was told here and um so that's that's the political end of it so i'll keep my name in it and we'll see how the vote goes anyone else anyone in the city [Music] and i will bring it back for a vote we're going to vote on the primary first um so i might as well do a roll call and um we'll vote it's either myself or for dave council member aki manzo pardon i'm voting for mayor manzo thank you councilmember banker mayor banjo councilmember gunn council member janice please council member notaro yes councilmember swope vice mayor gay guys vice mayor gaddis gaddis mayor manzo manzo so it's 4-3 dave gaddis will be our primary representative secondary representative we have leslie matero and frank did you say that right okay anyone else want to go for it says delegate number one and delegate number two is there a preference you know well we have to vote i'll leave it to you too you know what what's your question we have delegate number one and then alternate delegate number two so the first person in the list is going to be the one that they go to if you know dave can't make it then they're gonna go to number one and then they're gonna go to number two so who wants to be one who wants to be two i'd like to be one leslie ladies first okay right so um we'll do uh alternate number one we have leslie naterra all we don't have to do it by person all in favor aye aye one of those seven to zero you're the alternate frank banker is alternate number two all in favor [Music] frank is alternate number two all right uh number 16 consideration of selecting a council member as voting delegate to the florida league of cities you nominate and elect a voting delegate this you um last year they didn't have a convention so if you go to the convention or the last people get it online you cast the votes it's pretty much a ministerial thing the votes are going to pass but somebody has to count on somebody has to cast them on behalf of each city so um first let's get this on the uh agenda we have a um a motion and second second one discussion i put my name in for this um i expect to go to the convention if they hold it in person so last

concerned with the uh kind of their agenda so there's a month and monthly afternoon meeting with them and uh i don't attend every one of those i try to attend as many as i possibly can so um i'd like to be considered on that anyone else i would like to nominate the mayor okay thank you thank franklin anyone else okay then my full question i you know i didn't ask for citizen comments there any

glenn and nick bavaros who um who saw they want to make change here and they were also part of that group that knocked out that 40 items jody was instrumental in getting us the storm water the whole idea of this whole storm order assessment to deal with a problem that we've been talking about for many many years a lot of times she also served our charter review committee um i think we're on committees before he ever got on council and now she's looking to do some work today so um first i want to give her the certificate of commendation again as i said before this is the highest honor

so congratulations thank you fred anybody have anything before the city is hurting citizens okay thank you fred this is your time lyndon reeves city manager okay mayor and console uh if you look under tab 20 there's several things there [Music] you know we initiated a few months ago we talked to the county about the intersection we talked to them about speed this is their draft intersection report they are going back one of the suggestions in here was to remove the palm trees at 12th street they are also going back to look at is it beneficial to move the island or is it a bad thing to move the island just put it into a normal crosswalk like we have at 6th street so there's some information for your reading free time you know also i put in there uh the traffic sign study that we've got up on boulevard they gave me the report for approximately three weeks of it being in there for the month of february and if you look at the chart for the most part the speed limits that we're seeing were actually under our speed current speed but we're continuing to monitor that code enforcement report is in there for you to also read [Music] supplemental patrols i'll tell you after the fact i haven't got the information back from them but we had on the 19th and 20th and the second third of april the county did pay us back uh 50 000 for the beach access walkovers so we got that reimbursed so it only costs us half a hundred so that's a positive thing that the county is willing to do that i mentioned earlier the rfp is going out later this month and we'll resolve this audit committee selection committee the mayor and i both received a letter the fema map that are new are coming out and they're effective august 24th 2021. we have not gotten the official map but we will be getting that shortly next week on the 14th we have our crs verification visit and that's our flood insurance rating it's every five years and kyle and myself i'm giving kyle some training in it and we put together a pretty sizable packet email to it it's going to be something a little different because usually they come here and then we can take them around this year it's going to be virtually so this should be an experience we also our elevation certificate certification for this year is is finished so those are things that are part of the flood insurance requirements uh one question that has come up we're getting ready to pave harrison and the uh bellevue estates islands it'll start somewhere around the 15th of april uh and if you recollect i don't know a year and a half ago there was a discussion about that island at the end of harrison rather we take it out or make it smaller there is a meter in there for reclaiming water for that little island and i know one of our residents has questioned us making the island smaller i don't know if that's a benefit or not i just wanted to get feedback from you or take the whole island out and pave it over now i did talk to a couple residents that mentioned that maybe the island needs to stay there because it'll stop people from going into their driveway it makes them circle so uh just want to get some feedback from the council what your thoughts are on that and uh i mean have you pulled the residence of harrison i mean they're now it's one thing for me to say but i don't live there what are they doing well i've only talked to a couple of them because it it just recently came up because we're paving it we put a letter out that we're going to paint the street the the ones that are really concerns are the people at the end and we can do a quick poll and find out what they say and if they say leave it as it is then we'll leave it as it is if that's okay with the concept or take it out entirely or whatever and i know mr moss is here and he's one of the residents that thinks it needs to be smaller i'm kind of in the middle i can pave it or leave it as it is you can do either three right so i mean let's if we can maybe you know council agrees if we can get a survey let explain to him what it means smaller i mean you know i don't know if you're talking 10 feet 5 foot 2 foot no that means you're going to have to tear out the whole island to make it smaller you you just can't cut off part of the curve and put it put it back around lynn if you'd like maybe one day this week i can just pick you up and we ride out and knock on some doors if you've got time we'll we'll uh we'll get that done and and i'm gonna be out of the office the rest of the week for family issue so uh but i can get kyle to do that with you perfect so i'll tell him in the morning so let's see what the residents think about that yeah mr moss did you have anything you wanted to say about since you're the one that brought it up most recently i'll just hang on one second council what's up does anybody have a problem with bringing him up at this point no mr moss right here uno match 216 harrison avenue as linda indicated this problem came up a couple of years ago when truckster and tramus were backing into my drive because he couldn't turn around so at that time i proposed having that out of the mood and we did a survey i did a survey and the council didn't accept that survey they wanted the city survey mailed out uh the survey i did which land showed that 70 percent of the people whether that island removed but when the letters were sent out by the city less than half of them were returned and there were also a couple items that should not happen in the two homes there were three homes that were west of the birds were not affected by the island because their trucks can turn around on the street so and and at that point the city decided to plant some fruits there so the person wouldn't drive into that island and the reason the eyes on the island was larger was there were two palm trees on that island and at that time the fire department got involved and requested that those countries be removed because they could not service that area with their big trucks and that's where we're at right now now it's possible to reduce that island so the choices go out easier it'll eliminate the problem i have they won't have to back into my driveway but it won't eliminate the difficulty of the trucks coming around that cul-de-sac because that's called this hack is the smallest one in the city and it has an island and as i said i could go either way but my preference on the long run i can be easier for the city to remove that island so it wouldn't be a problem thank you great thank you and if you'll just let your neighbors as you see them know that we'll be coming out and surveying them thank you thank you back to you 7th and 8th street project is wrapping up uh we'll be doing a walk through not this week but next uh you know and they've got decide to put down and things but the painting is done the curbs are done uh the check valve's been put in the new pipe's been put in so uh that is moving forward you plan to open the park up soon because we still have a sign that says it's closed and there was still a containment boom there well they're still uh their silt barriers still out in the water until they get that sod in and stuff after that's done then we'll reopen it one thing that you do need to know we're gonna have the dock that's there needs to be removed and we'll have to budget something in the next fiscal year put it back because currently after going through the project and looking at it we had an engineer look at it and it's it's in bad shape underneath so we'll you know remove it but the boat ramp will still be there and then we'll put something in the budget for the next fiscal year to rebuild it so the pilings that's bad because the top yeah underneath the woods pretty pretty rough so i received the cost estimate from duke for undergraduate boulevard last on april fool's day and i thought it was an april fool's joke because it was 5.5 million dollars and uh i've sent him an email back and i'm gonna have a little more discussion with them about doing some things like we did with bellevue estates island we kind of hired our own person to put conduit in and things of that nature and save the residents a lot of money so we'll we'll go further with that the kitty's only about four million that we're getting from the county so we need some negotiations so we'll resolve that only last thing uh is support session do you want to do one in april uh things we talked about were the review and the code enforcement uh looking you know at the planning stuff and what i'll do is i'll ask patty to to the new council members i'm sure they haven't seen that book we'll need to send that to uh frank and leslie i'm sure everyone else has it you've got it all filed right where you know where it's at right everybody's laughing about you you might have to rescind the top okay we'll just do that patty but redo the there's a lot to go through i wouldn't put too much else on this because we could spend two sessions just going through the planning board's first report let alone code so um you want to split it up i mean it's it's waited this long if you wait a month but i don't we're going to get into the budget season real soon yeah and the the code enforcement things really what the console needs to do is tell us what you give us your feedback on the report the things you want to change we can start on that we can you know get the city attorney to start writing the ordinances to update those things some of those things in there in the recommendations those are very simple to fix and if the console blesses them we'll be able to move them forward but it's not going to be a process that you can do like that you know we may go through half the report and say okay these things are fine let fred go ahead and start on and then we'll go back it's kind of like the charter remains how we did that last year so uh we could start with that send the other report out and then schedule something uh this year for the budget as i mentioned and gave me the calendar i'm looking at starting the budget fork sessions in june to try to give us a little bit of head start with the console so you aren't packed in or you got two or three budget meetings within a couple week period and as i remember the planning board suggested binder they didn't recommend most of them they just gave we asked them to think outside the box so they came up with some stuff that i think some of it it's really thinking outside the box but we're probably not going to do it so we might be able to go through it fairly quickly i think when we get something like the marina that's going to be a discussion you know so we might want to set up a night just for that my suggestion would be maybe start with that code one this month give the new uh frank um and leslie a chance to go through that 90 page book because i've already read it and um you know right maybe hit that next month that that's just my suggestion i'll take it in any order it doesn't matter so whatever well some of the some of the code things you know in the planning the code review report some of those things are going to be the console's going to say yeah well let's go ahead and change those the wording or this word or it may be one word uh so those are simple things that can probably move rather quickly and we can start with the city attorney rewriting you know the ordinance to replace them so i would agree with you that the code thing may be painless and we'll include sign movements in there fred reilly sent us each a copy of the sign organ suggestion there's quite a bit of discussion on that well maybe not but there's there's quite a bit of law on that before we can come up with this right right um you want to pick a date well usually we do it on the third monday which is the 19th i don't know what everyone's schedule is i'm not available until the 2nd so i'll be 19 21st 22 i could become telephonically but i have comments for sure on that stuff so i'd like to be here pleasure of the council the next monday is the 26th from the 6th 26th 26th at 6 pm okay so that'll be very funny so confine it pretty much unless something else comes up confine it to the sign ordinance and the code and then next month we're going to hit that uh planning book and then we'll plan that on the third monday yes i think so if you can plan whatever that third one to use in may i'm not sure on the top of my head right like the 17th or 18th so you've got a couple months off with no work session so yeah we have to get back too okay that's all i have and [Music] the uh patty did a lot of work researching i just want to say that the uni code that came back from from uh munico we're getting ready to send that that portion from the november election to the state uh and i think you know it took them a little while to decipher it and whatever they do to their messiah but uh patty reviewed it and everything looks good so we'll be forwarding that for the state to certify probably november and then marches we're starting the process now fred because you have nothing else to do i don't want to lose sight of that that the next election is the final installments of the code of the charter review recommendation so we've got plenty of time it's not till next march but i'm just i'll say it now because you know when we get to budget we start forgetting about these things so there is i think four or maybe four amendments as i remember so there's a bunch still that are coming but not as important we took them in the level of importance so now we're getting to the lesser ones yes any questions for lynn go ahead i am still struggling with our multimedia system and i believe everyone on the council is it's better but it's still it's not good enough is there a plan i think we're going to have to bring someone in similar to what bel air did and let them come and try to help us but we've got to start on it and i think going forward it's it's just a process of moving i see where some immediate improvements could be made very little money and i want to talk to you about them just because it's a struggle it's a struggle for all of us and i i'm not sure how council member gunn is doing on his side can he uh council member uh gun can you hear us it's a struggle it's a struggle i endorse exactly what you're saying we've got to make some more improvements on this thing it's just [Music] since we need to make more improvements that's a struggle yeah i can't hear him i can't i can't hear a word glenn gunn just said what i think uh i i would like to do is work with lynn and establish a preliminary budget for a quick fix right and then a long-term budget for the final fix because this is ridiculous it's not your fault but we definitely need we can do better yeah i mean there's guitar players who play the local bar that have a better pa system and i'm not kidding okay you can hear them sometimes they're too loud and glenn gunn is walking on the zoom he's 10 feet away from me frank can't hear him he's two feet away from me i can't hear him john hansen is shaking his head from the audience i can't joe shirley is shaking his head her head in the back of the audience i mean we're not even holding a good public meeting with this everybody has to be able to hear what's going on it's critical right it may be upgrading the speaker system or other things which vice mayor it seemed that it did pick it up a little better so that that's part of the process to buy those get rid of these and buy them our type but we want to find the type that you can push a button to turn it on because the the one we bought as a test doesn't have a button to it but it did pick up we used it on vice mayor over here it did seem to work well so hopefully that will help part of the system any other questions for when yes i have two questions well then i've asked you to um have you looked into that light on the end of donato right there 22nd turning it up because when you go down 22nd to take a left on donato it is so dark and you have to be aware of it if you just take it like you normally would you could easily hit somebody so can we look it's the donato in 20 seconds the light right there at the intersection yeah we did turn it up a little bit but i'm still open come hang out at night and don't walk your dog because you guys both get hit because it's it's really dark it's scary and then second um when we were on that zoo call with the sheriff will terry i asked him about looking at percentages of use with bellaire short did he ever get back to you on that i've asked him about that a couple times and i haven't got any response about it other than they they were going to work on it well it's beyond that so what what just so the council understands what could happen he could come back and say well we'll just take that deduction out and you pay for your own that's what could happen which is about i think it was 35 000 if i remember right now is that the sheriff's choice or is that something that counts our council could i'm asking for a point of information because i have no idea i'm not proposing it i'm just saying is that something we could decide to do if we want or is that something the sheriff has to do to make separate contracts or they do their own stuff we do our own stuff and well i i think the feedback from the console would be very important to give to him and i just don't know who makes that decision well he at the time i guess you know i'm just speculating at the time of the sheriff well i know it for a fact at the time the sheriff became our service provider our police department did that service for bellar shore so at the time uh when the sheriff took over our contract 2007 i think it was he gave us whatever the number was at that time he gave us a credit for doing that services one of our deputies so uh just just asking food for fun curious yeah i've asked captain miner a couple times about that he's basically told me he knows they're supposed to be working on it the only concern i really have is are we willing to take if they come back and say well if you you know on the other side do you want to take the additional expense and say don't do anything over there you know what i'm saying do you understand what i'm saying okay we're getting the credit for that police service that they're doing to bella short in our contract if we don't allow our deputy to do that then we would pay that thirty five thousand dollar credit the city and isn't baller sure paying that thirty five thousand they're paying it but it's a credit to our company and then we no no they pay the sheriff directly but the sheriff gives us a credit on our contract 35 000 off the bottom line yeah so our contract if they decided not to do that then we our contract this year as an example would be if it's uh right at five it would be like 5 35 or something but i can send you that information i don't understand that i don't understand why you know they should be the same in theory right i mean no no they're giving us a credit because they're using our officer to provide that service to bellaire shore so bellar shore is paying the sheriff and we're getting a 35 000 prairie basically with that contract our our time of service where we're receiving service from the sheriff's department would go up yes instead of sharing with bel air shore right would be responsible of uh working out their own contract right and it would be completely separate from artists is that right right and and basically what i was told is they'd just go to the next city and probably give them the credit somehow so is it a win or not it's kind of 50 50 50. well how much impact do we have because it's actually working as a sub lease right sure so how much are we losing by so increasing this year it depends on the day and time i you really gotta look at it some some weeks and months it doesn't really affect us in any way shape or form now if there's a call to bell or shore and it takes an inordinate amount of time but you got to understand the sheriff sends backups okay to these situations whether it's in our city or that city so uh it's kind of a what i would call an abortion away but if you took to the amount of the contract i think we we looked at it was like 45 minutes per shift okay that they should devote well do they devote more than 45 minutes per shift maybe saturday and sunday they might but monday tuesday wednesday thursday they probably don't you know so that's kind of how you gotta look at it well that's kind of what i was asking for as if due to recent issues if more time is being allotted than normal and now the time limit is going up and therefore we're kind of losing out because we're because when they're busy over there dealing with shade they're neglecting speeders over here so that's what i'm curious about if that number amount of time has gone up due to recent issues and if so that's just information we need that's what i was asking the sheriff right so keep loving them i will i haven't stopped okay any other questions for women uh on the traffic survey um i know they're looking at reducing the speed or questioning the speed of gov god bless anyone events north of 12th street during spring break and anything like that i don't know how you get out of your residence i mean it's a total mess going up golf ball or in the clear water and coming back i can tell you how you get out sideways well i i don't know why we can't put in excuse my crunches they're called like dark lights every now and then they stop the traffic because if you live there i don't know how to get out i don't know how you make a left on that right well that's so so now we're captive in our city i think a couple birthdays they'll have to be uh activated at all times just over heavy weekends it might i think the real problem is not um it's not the roads it's not it's not the sheriff's department it's the city of clearwater beach we're basically held hostage by the city of clearwater you have you have cars back all the way up beyond publics coming in they're not going here they're passing through i mean that's what i'm saying but it impacts anyone from 12th street and it's actually now they're starting to come into random rocks and it's impactful i really think we should look into it frank just so you know um and i i i knew this you know i mean we've seen it lynn and i have met twice with the planning people from pinellas we didn't have that suggested i think we threw every other suggestion at them um and you know we didn't come away with too much that they were actually able to do for us they're supposed to be monitoring this light here at the intersection i was sitting in a 40-minute jam so i saw how well that was working the other week you know it was backed up almost to uh to the hardware store it was that so far it was it was one of the worst i've ever seen um i don't know that might work i mean lynn and i have met with this guy tom washburn a few times that's what got us that other thing one of the observations is and i've actually put myself into the jam a few times just to see what was holding it up one of the things we found was that a lot of people were slowing down at the real big mansions the baseball players mansion and stuff like that and that's why we put that sign there that hopefully they actually maintain it but linder showed us the results and they're going slower at the side because i think they're sightseeing because a lot of times it frees up and the deputies when i had spoken with them they were saying it was freeing up after 17 to 18 street if we put those in which is a good idea the question is how much of a effect does it have on people coming over the bridge then so the planners have to tell us that you know i mean it does give us the break i i feel for the people but we were kind of out of solutions because you know we had talked about doing something with the bridge it can't be done because it was built with federal money so you can't do anything to in any way tax people told people anything like that so that's not happening we sure as hell can't buy property and make the roads bigger that's not happening so i think this is your idea is good if it doesn't back it up even further but maybe talk with tom washburn and get these ideas out though but that light by the way i mean i i sat in the same traffic jam probably you did it's 40 minutes yeah i did it the last two weekends for two or three times so it's been uh i understand the pain this way i i uh maybe i was lucky but you know i i waited let's see it'll be 19th street probably five or six minutes one day because i had uh the deputies doing uh checking to see if people were sidetracking you know going from like morgan or hibiscus shooting down i haven't got that report yet but they did do some of that over the weekend but i waited three or four minutes you know to to get out to make a left turn if you made a right turn i did that too made a right turn went down you got down faster and you made a left turn and went into morgan park and came back out then you could make a right turn go back the other way that's a heck of a way to get around the city but you know when you're looking at other issues i went to the marina you're down there it does it does break up let me add to that just so that you can feel our pain if we manage to get out and let's say we want to go to publix we may not be able to come home as soon as we get in our heart may take us 45 minutes to get started it's relentless and as far as people exiting their their neighborhood if we picked on one street and said this is the one that you activate to get out well now you just you burdened john hansen street because i think he volunteered for it but i think he did too you tell them basically you would be funneling all of the north side traffic down one street which is going to create another problem i've also noticed that if there is a gap there's a gap at all and they see you easing up to get ready to leave they punch it every time it's it's it's a nightmare and uh turn out here sometimes that's that way i i don't know what what the fix is but right now the fix is don't leave after 10 a.m on a saturday if you do don't plan on coming back until five o'clock you're prisoner for the weekend yes publix opens at 7 a.m i've been there just for that reason to avoid traffic on the way back no there's no easy solution folks and um i mean you know i'll say i tried i was personally attacked because i made suggestions with the city manager and i mean it was nasty as if i was going to get bags of money delivered to my house from a toll bridge um we were trying folks and then you turned me off i gotta tell you okay some of the stuff that was said so um to paraphrase barack obama you know if you like your traffic you can keep your traffic if you want it fixed okay then support the people that are trying to fix it don't attack them because i don't know that there's an easy solution frank has made a good suggestion i've never heard this before it should be looked into but please don't crucify him if it turns out that it's not good he's trying okay no no we'll have another discussion with tom and see what their thoughts are it it's a county road that's that's part of the whole process yeah well yeah we can't do anything without the county both roads are counted and so far okay anyone else for a living there is a there's a citizen that has a question for you if john and june vancouver okay i'm sorry wait go ahead let's do council first um lynn i've been getting a lot of feedback noise coming from over there is it are you on zoom with it i've gotta turn down something okay because i'm hearing everything they say twice oh i just saw that's part of the process okay i'm just gonna let you know because i didn't know if it was [Music] any other council comments before i go to the citizens junior so your hand up first then john will do you next okay jim van scoy 7th street miller beach a couple things i was just wanting first of all we don't live at obviously at the end of 7th street but they're doing that sewer project and i noticed the equipment is even bigger the city used to have some beautiful like hedges there to kind of give it a kind of a barrier so you couldn't really see it from the road i mean the houses i noticed this yesterday the houses around that are going to have to see that one the one on the right i don't know those people but you pull into their driveway and you see this big equipment right there um is there anything the city can do as far as trying to beautify it a little bit i mean we're very thankful to the county for fixing the flooding issue lord for a bit um the second thing is is is this city willing to roll the dice can you talk to the mic is this city willing to roll the dice for 45 minutes a day first of all for sharing their sheriff with anybody now i do know they back each other up through cities but if you are sharing a sheriff and two incidents come up at the same time the other city sheriff is tied up are you you're making them make that decision as to who they have to go with i mean you're making the officer make that decision this this city should be looking at its citizen safety first so i i believe that this council needs to take a serious look at as spending that 35 thousand dollars in this orbit and making sure that this city is safe first making our citizens number one thank [Music] times there's people from bellar gloves over here there's people from indian rocks no they they bring back up you know about if we ask one of the gentlemen in the back i'm sure would you uh sergeant would you come out i wanted to speak on this in terms of if you get a dual call you know let's say you're on and even i mean for that matter you know you're in bellaire shore or bella beach and then they get a call in bellar shore how do you handle that what's the procedure john we got you right after the sheriff okay mayor i'm sorry i came in late uh starting switch with sheriff's office i came in late um so i could only hear bits and pieces back there so if you could repeat the question sure the the comment from the citizen was um where council member aki had brought up i guess this goes back a year ago when we had the sheriff's contract there's an allocation i think it's around thirty thirty five thousand dollars for the patrols in belarus shore and she had raised some questions at the time she's raising them again asking linda he got an analysis from the sheriff so the first question is where do we stand with that analysis secondly the next the citizen question is if if we were to say you know is there a situation where let's say the sheriff could be uh calling bel air shore and then would have to not do a call in bellar beach or vice versa a call on bail or beach you only have one person does that leave dollar shorter uncovered or you know what i just said is i think you get on the walkie-talkie and get some more people in but i'm not quite sure what the procedure is i'm still not quite sure of the question i'm i can't comment on the allocation right that is not my position to comment on obviously i'll defer that to the sheriff but in regards to the safety of the citizens i did hear that question presented um i don't see that as a concern because yes beller short and bellar beach does share one deputy however we have bellaire bluffs we have me we have my corporal we have in the iraq speech we have the unincorporated deputy so i can assure you if there's ever something that is serious of nature i'm gonna allocate deputies to come over here and assist and as of as long as i've been here in the city that's never been an issue so i hope that answers the question if it doesn't i'm here to answer more it does for me i'm not sure about arrested accounts i mean we're both fortunate in both cities i have listened sometimes to our shore meetings and they have equally good crime statistics like us so it's you know when we have one arrest we have no arrests in the city this time so i mean we're you know we're usually pretty good when it comes to that type of thing but i think that answered the question as to what happens if there is something at the same time anybody else sheriff up here thank you sergeant i think that takes care of it okay all right john hansek this is for lynn reeves now this is the lynn reese meeting 22nd street um in the beginning of lynn's um briefing he spoke about the island here at 12th street and the palm trees they've been doing surveys maybe the county should consider taking that whole island crosswalk completely out in my mind it makes no sense that you have that crosswalk within two blocks of the crosswalk right here at the intersection of gulf and bay that's contributing to back up on the right turns not going to solve a problem on weekends i guarantee you and i think i heard a comment about a traffic control device on the weekends but i can tell you too from personal experience one made the mistake of going to lowe's on a saturday timothy christmas clearwater lagrail road from there over an hour all i could see was traffic all the way down bay went over here to 8th street come down indian rocks another mistake backed up there and then the intersection was a goat rope i can't use the navy terminology because people were sitting in the middle of the intersection trying to make left-hand turns and through traffic couldn't get through took over an hour to get home we have come to a conclusion my wife and i we get our stuff done before 10 o'clock on saturday and then we stay home the rest of the dadgum weekend and even trying to cross the street from 22nd to go use the um access by the motel can be challenging but then i forget at the next parking lot you got crosswalk near there and then the next one is way up the street before you get to morgan park so sometimes we get lucky people stop and let us cross but i don't know what we can do either so just making a comment but take it take to the county and ask them what about taking out that whole gag gun crosswalk here at the parking lot well they're they're looking at uh their recommendation in this intersection study is even looking at the two left turn lanes to get people at least go over on the causeway but they're looking at they did recommend to take the trees out because of visibility they are looking at taking the islands out but leaving the crosswalk which uh i guess in my mind it would could create a problem for the people on 12th and 13th street because there's no island there because what could happen is the uh uh where the island's at that does stop people from lining up all the way down uh built bull markets making a left turn but you know the consultants will look at that and get back to us but they did right they did recommend at least leaving the crosswalk because there's a lot of activity on 12th street that goes across to the beach access well one more observation too you know recently um somebody was between 12th and 13th or 14th going across gulf boulevard with their dogs i guess to go to the beach it used to crosswalk just crossed right there at whatever the size street was so you know some of this personal responsibility that's that's true people crossing where there's no crosswalk all the time doesn't matter where you're at you can be of bellar bluffs you know all of us have driven that way think about all the people you see going across at a street intersection thank you okay thank you mr hansig any other citizens yes but the island that john mentioned taking out when that was first put in it actually helped the people going north because they could pull out of their streets and make a left turn if that island is taken out all it's going to do is back up everybody in the middle lane so how is anybody going to get out on the weekends to make the turn going south i don't know what the answer is i brought it up at a council meeting a while back but a bridging another one where are you going to do it or how you're going to do it i don't know another subject is to go back a little bit with the sound in this auditorium i worked in industry for 38 years and i worked with a lot of ac systems this one is designed horribly right now i can hear you and i can hear myself sitting back there you can't do a thing so i think we ought to do an experiment lin maybe and just shut that off and see if everybody in here can hear because the amount of noise in my hearing aids it just drives you nuts thank you thank you mark i mean as you're speaking i'm i'm getting signs from the people sitting in the back they can't hear my kelly's family just early like i say they have better systems at the local bar for the guy who plays guitar so yeah we got to do better really we're premier city right so come on okay do you have anything else no are you sure all right city clerk you only have about a 45 minute presentation nothing thank you all right we moved to city council um for the new members the way i do this is on an even month i do it alphabetically and vice mayor myself get the last comments but i go alphabetically so it's an even month i start with robinaki and i work my way down next month i'll start with smoking work my way back up so this way you're not always in the same spot so it is an even month and robin hockey you're up first first off i'd like to say congratulations to frank and leslie and glenn for winning i'm happy to serve with you guys looking forward to it other than that i think i've already made my comments towards him sorry thank you that's it thank you frank yes uh just two things um i know there's litigation between bellaire shores and private citizens um thank you right there with the beach beach access the umbrella shade structure uh on march 27th a sheriff deputy came out i'm sitting on the beach with my granddaughter okay um anyway deputy came up and you can see she's in one of these tents which is no higher probably two and a half feet high okay it's behind it's actually lower than the first portion of the seawall she says you're gonna need to remove that she's really polite she said but that's a shade structure the child in it is three years old you can't see the baby you're six months old [Music] i understand this litigation that this could go on in my opinion for years i i would love to see council get together with belair shores and former committee to try to work something out get this thing resolved sooner than later i'm sure there's no residents that want to make a dime on this thing they just want to go to the beach if you leave if you read the two belair shore beller beach access grant points i don't think we've done our job in the past to keep you know non-residents out i think there's a lot of ideas that can come up with i think belarus shores has got some legitimate complaints about non-residents i seem and i'm not sure they're uber drivers i know they're not my kids because i've seen people tip the driver when they get out my kids never kill you when i drop them but i mean and they get out and they go on the beach and they they don't what i'm trying to say is they don't read the signs they just go on the beach umbrellas or whatever the deputies are overwhelmed it's not their problem they patrol it maybe once a weekend they set up their their umbrellas or whatever their coolers or whatever trash the beach leave and it impacts the responsible citizens of this town okay because i've got neighbors that don't want to go to the beach because they can't take me and braille they got no no no no whatever and they know the wall but it impacts us but you you come here on saturday you'll see cars parked here they're going at 12th street they're going to 6th street you see them there going down the street and just one other thing um i got a request from a citizen of uh 102 fifth street about her miami curb is actually like sinking a little bit it's it's causing a uh is that sheila yes yeah i know okay all right thank you thank you thank you frank one gun nothing nothing okay let's leave it down nothing pretty slow nothing thank you guys first off i'd like to welcome our new council members i look forward to working with you at least for the next year also uh to jody shirley and marvin it's been an honor and a pleasure to work with you and i know you're not going anywhere i see names coming up for volunteering and things like that please stick around you've made a serious impact on the city and it's greatly appreciated other than that i apologize for being out at the last meeting i was forced into vacation and it rained the entire time so that's the payback i guess but uh um i'm looking forward to uh reviewing uh the code all the suggestions and uh i think that there's probably a couple things that were missed or uh or just recently came up i've discussed some of that with lynn and i'll be bringing that up at the next meeting other than that i appreciate everyone coming and thank you thank you i'll let go of the welcome to train banker and uh welcome back to leslie mataro and again our uh and of course glenn gunn we won again um and thanks to joni shirley and tomorrow being for excellent careers on the council um frank i appreciate what you've said here um you know because of my special position i can't really get into too much i just will let you know a fact um that might help uh before all of this stuff like when they when they passed the ordinance across the street in back in june of last year i had reached out personally to the mayor just his friends when we were friends and i asked him come on this is a mess he understood that robert schmidt understood it he asked me for a month to july 21st and this council agreed that lynn reeves was going to represent the city to go across and ask in july 21st uh to see what could be done and then three of us glenn gunn jody shirley and myself went as private citizens and very nicely jody shirley i remember gave all the options that we had these you know basically some of them came from rickshaw someone came from a work session about gate controls and you know things that we could do stepped up police patrols they rejected that glenn gunn had some suggestions i had some suggestions explaining to them about how the legalities of the easement no threats to saying you know i bought here so i could go to that beach they didn't do anything and memories multiple times said we can work this thing out come on let's work this thing out and they rejected him so that's when the letter started and then um two months went by the deadlines long extended pass but then for them to do something and they didn't do anything and then i i had no choice but to take the legal action because my property is being affected and so is yours and everyone else's so i'm taking i can only take the fight right now for myself but everybody knows that i'm thinking about them and i mean that that's the way it is my comments mr mayor is not against anyone in a lawsuit or whatever it's just i think this is just beyond ridiculous anymore this is heartbreaking to see a young child in a tent and then to be told back and i'll tell you something i'm going to say this publicly we don't please this is a litigation file so i don't think it's a record it's out there people have it we got a similar picture and i didn't take this picture but it is allegedly one of the council members sitting under a cabana drinking a beer out of a glass bottle from two weeks ago on the beach there so while the little baby can't shave themselves they are yes it's not our council member no no i'm sorry it's belly sure yeah it's a belly council member yes i'm sorry no it is not one of our council members and um that picture is going to be going around uh and it's just it's it's sad it's just sad so um to the extent that people want to do something that they always try and work something out that option is always there but um it's getting worse and not better and and this is i have videos of people people sent me videos of people being um one person almost got the ticket um and it was an eight-year-old girl watching her parents getting busted on the beach because you had an umbrella so i that's all i'll say about it because that's those are facts i won't give you any other information but thank you and please keep the people watch out this is not right um i only have one thing and it's uh something i just wanted a city to under uh to know um i have served for a year now on the mayor's council as representative to the emergency services of pinellas and um that's the police the fire the ambulance and at the last meeting i was elected to the executive board of that so i'm going to be serving on the executive board for the pinellas emergency services committee so that's a big honor for me and i'm really glad to assume that and should anybody have any issues with any of our emergency services police fire ambulance please let me know um because i have direct input now to that well i always had direct input now i just have more input so i'm looking forward to that new role so i'll be doing that for the next year other than that that's all we have right now um we have a work session coming up on the 26th that's at 6 00 p.m and we'll go back on our regular schedule and i think i saw a park board meeting here on april 14th at 3 p.m so if you're available for that other than that i will entertain a motion for adjournment frank banker second leslie to terrell all in favor aye aye as opposed everyone have a good night thank you for coming"
