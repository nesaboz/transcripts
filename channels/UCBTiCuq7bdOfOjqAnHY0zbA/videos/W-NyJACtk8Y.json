    "transcript": "all right I'm ready good to go okay welcome everybody to the City Council Beller Beach budget workshop July 13 2026 p.m. we have call to order and all rise for the Pledge of Allegiance pledge allegiance to the flag for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all Adam clerk we please call the roll councilmember Archy done muted patty yeah but I I didn't mean it hold on I got her she's here we could see councilmember bean yeah councilmember gathers councilmember Gatos yeah councilmember surely I don't think she's here councilmember Swope here ice mayor Gunn not here yet mayor Manzo yeah city manager Reeve here alright thank you everyone howdy you're the official host of this right so you're they're able to control everyone's muting unmuting this works best if you are not speaking if you just mute yourselves but patty cannot guess mute it the only reason being is that this thing has a speaker view and if there's any noise like a dog barking next door it's gonna put that and it's gonna put you on screen when you probably don't want to be so if you do that that'll work out real well so we have one item on our agenda and one item only it's the discussion and review of the fiscal year 2020 and 2021 budget put on by Lynn Reeves who presented and made budget and at that I'm going to turn it over to Lynn reefs Lynn mayor and console what we're gonna go over tonight is the fiscal 20 2021 budget the first screen that I'm showing you which I we updated again today and Patty sent that out to you it's listing all the expenses by account number going down the screen from the most expensive as an example other contracted services that includes law enforcement some contracts we have in Public Works the code enforcement contract that we currently have and our contracted consultant for IT and in the non departmental it is just various contracted items that are checked out but that's just to give you a summary from the highest to the lowest for the budget so if you've got questions on that we'll we can talk about them later so I just wanted to show that to you to show you the expenses from the highest to lowest so we'll start with the budget and if you'll turn to page seven which I'm going to show on the screen if you have your paper budget this is a proposed budget calendar for this year our this is our budget workshop today we have another one scheduled if we need it on Monday the 20th and then on also on the 20th we set our tentative millage rate that we're going to submit to the property appraiser and that has to be to them by the fourth of August so the trim notices can be mailed out you know timely then in September we'll have our first public meeting on the 9th of September to adopt the budget and then our second one will be on the 21st of September to adopt the final budget budget and millage rate turning to page eight this is a summary of of all the the budget for the city currently we're using the 2.0 three nine four millage rate which is our current millage rate with the ad valorem tax collection of 1 million one hundred and sixty four thousand three hundred and five dollars we'll go through all this in a little more detail on the next couple pages but other taxes and fees intergovernmental things we've also included in here the assessments and when you talk about the assessments you see the hundred and thirty two thousand that is the assessment for Bellevue estates Island undergrounding project and then the storm water assessment out to the right which is a separate enterprise fund which is new this year going going down to the expenditure category and stop me if you have any questions and we'll get into the more detail the personnel budget for this year is five hundred and twenty nine thousand the total operating budget is one million four hundred and forty two thousand one hundred and eighteen and capital projects eight hundred ninety two thousand along with the debt service being three twenty and that is the debt service on this building plus the debt service on the Bellevue estates Island so yes why would the debt service for Bellevue state island be included in that when we're paying that separately well it's a lump it lumps in this is a summary of all the funds so you're seeing the debt service on the building plus that that's the two debt services that we have even though you're paying it and if you look up further you've got an assessment of 132,000 that's actually paying that so it's a government accounting is a little unique you gotta put an expense in even if you're getting money from somewhere else to show it okay explains it thank you so if you move to page 10 and it's on the screen these are the numbers for the proposed millage rate that we've set up our valuing up this year twenty-eight million are to five hundred and ninety four million six hundred ninety four dollars it's about a four point nine five increase in our taxable value on the next page there was an air or typo but we got that fixed if you look at the last sentence on the pages you have it probably showed ninety five thousand in this fifty nine number the fifty nine is correct it's not ninety five we picked up a wrong number and what we've added to this chart is to kind of show you what the trend of the taxable value has been doing along with our tax rates of what the current or 2019-20 tax rates are by agency so we get about thirteen percent in a round number of the taxable money that comes in for the ad valorem our share is about thirteen percent overall this sheet is showing you what the property appraiser sent to us on July 1st it's showing basically where the taxable values were adjusted the preliminary it went down about five tenths of a percent there five hundredths of a percent from what the original one was which was five and this this comes from the property appraiser they send a preliminary one out in on June 1st and then they send this one out on July 1st next page this just gives you some graphs showing you what percentages of taxes in the Java or general revenue and the operating and you should have all that in front of you or you can look at it on the screen so we will go to page 15 and the the millage rate proposed shows an income of fifty nine thousand higher than the current year some of the things that we've reduced and part of that is we don't really know as an example I'm gonna go down to the state shared revenue they haven't Trude that up for the year so we don't really know you know I put in about a ten percent drop on it for next year but we won't really know that real number till sometime in August when they drew up everything and I've shown some other drops in things like that use utility service taxes the franchise fees things things of that nature that we normally have income and because of the pandemic we're we're not seeing we don't really have a reasonable assurance that it's going to stay at a level that it was in the past and with with the current situation it could last longer than even we anticipate now the trash I expect them to raise you know we'll be paying a little more for our trash but I don't think we're gonna have to raise the trash rates because when we did it last year we figured in this increase for this year that waste management will probably be submitting to us shortly any questions on the revenues on this page okay page 16 I left the you know of course the interest earnings we reduce that considerably because the interest rates have went south for the most part we're still heavily invested in the Small Business Administration which those rates fluctuate but the rates we could get from CDs are a lot less so we've just kept the money in in the SBA and it's very easy to access and it's a very flexible fund the community center rentals we've lost a lot of rental for this year we were we were going forward making progress of course when the pandemic hit everyone you know cancelled or some canceled some moved out to the future but I guess I'm in the thought process that maybe by Christmas this will be gone so maybe we'll get a Christmas present and going forward we can pick up that rental revenue in the future the other miscellaneous things are things like lien searches site plan fees that we collect the site plan fees for the most part or fit are things that our consultant engineer does and he in turn builds us so it's a pass-through expense some of the things that I do personally like the N PDS stuff the city gets that it's just part of doing business so we'll go down to right now we're projecting an interfund transfer of two hundred and sixty six thousand forty dollars from the and the majority that's going to end up in the stormwater fund for the year for capital projects that's a significant drop the stormwater fund did help us going forward and of course rental registration will help us going forward we hope or I'm confident of that so that's the current reserve fund balance that we would need to take from reserves okay then we go down to the expenditures for each department city clerk expenditures are up a little bit partially because of the elections that we're having we've got to pay for them so elections for the actually we're ending up with to next next year so that that in itself is going to create a little more expense the rest the rest of the areas we're going to have a three percent increase in finance that that's set up in their contract for the the accountant that's doing our work my departments very negligible I'm actually that's probably the raised percentage which I've recommended three percent for everyone so you're going to go down down the list non-departmental went up a little bit but others went down a little bit because I'm moving the telephone into non-departmental so it's all captured in one department instead of trying to charge the clerk's Department three dollars a month for phone or fifth $18 we're going to move it to non-departmental so that's one of the new things code enforcement if we continue with the sheriff's contract that's going to go up about 2.6 percent and at this point I I will tell you I have some concerns and I think we could save that money and just partially go back to an in-house system he's currently working about twelve hours a week and you've seen kind of what code enforcement through the reports so that's something that we probably need to discuss from as a consul in total sanitation I talked about public works that 58,000 actually is getting transferred to the stormwater fee because that will be a department on its own so it won't be part of the the overall so there are some things that are dropping in that nature now are there any questions on the department budgets you've got a little different layout this year and and I'll just go to the first one this is the City Clerk's it kind of shows it in in by by operating account number and I gave you a copy that gave it in more detail I'll kind of show it here I gave you a copy of this that gives you by line item what's in that line item for each department the budget this year is a little more streamlined and I attribute that to the discussions I had with the accounting people and trying to make it a more easy to read and understand budget so this is an example of the clerk it's not example its actual budget so are there any questions on the clerk's budget or do you just want me to keep going hearing nothing keep it going keep it going okay let me get to my next page okay well we're gonna skip a bunch of pages and unless you want to get to specific by departmental and if you have questions and you think about them even after this work session please email me and I'll try to answer and then I'll send the answer out to all the council members in one email so we're gonna go to page 29 whoops one pass this is the general fund projects for next year and most of these are savings things like the painting for City Hall carpet replacement for City Hall the thing that's a little bit different in here is where it says beach access improvements there's 70,000 dollars earmarked in there and that's for the beach walking accesses and 50 of that is coming back to us in a grant from the county so we have to show the total amount and that'll give us about a hundred thousand dollars to redo all those beach accesses and the county is going to contribute 50 to it so it's almost a 50/50 match at this point in the computer hardware and software I've budgeted in there for iPads for the City Council I think as we go forward especially in things like we're doing now and for the future that that would be beneficial for the City Council to have a No and and we could put the you know the meeting notices the agenda everything on there so that's in there when you get down to the Z more those are savings things and the 880 V this would be the year that it'll get replaced we've got twelve thousand dollars set aside already so there will be another four thousand put in it and that will by that at the very the rest of these are savings for replacement of the tractor the Community Improvement truck and the large utility truck a new thing that's in here first year is the budget for the security camera and we the staff has worked with the couple vendors and councilmember Gatos in looking at putting security cameras around the building in Jarrell e and exterior and we're pretty comfortable that this is pretty close to what the amount of the cost will be excuse me ma'am Linda yeah will you be able to take a look at the park with those cameras from City Hall or will we have to add something you know such as a parking lot the cameras right now are mainly focused on the corners of this building so I don't think they will reach out to the park itself and at this point we focused on the building the parking lot the fronts the back and interior Lee if you don't mind I'll touch on that right quick if a camera was to be able to clearly see the park or at least a good majority of it to be able to pick out details your looking upwards of three four grand for a camera with that type of resolution it's just not practical Marvin nari I was wondering because the use there's a lot of dog there's people walking dogs in that park and a lot of people don't pay to park there I was hoping that possibly we could do something to capture you know the park and the the marking areas maybe in the future yeah and I don't think the having a camera there someone not paying to park would do us any good because this citation would have to be issued to the vehicle it's not like you can issue them a citation and then leave and because you saw them on a camera something that's true but kind of give us an idea of you know how much coverage we need in that park maybe certain times police getting that Park at the time when we have people walking dogs in her when they're not supposed to that's all okay I will make a note of that thank you okay the next page we're going to go to and basically behind all these pages are as an example the computer hardware you know to fund purchase of commuter computer equipment blah blah blah that's really what's behind it's just that the capital project fun items in lined up so now we'll go to page 45 this is the capital fund analysis or no actually 42 this this again shows you the capital projects revenue intergovernmental assessments interest which is very dropping and then our expenditures in the capital fund part of it is debt service of course but it's almost broken even even in the in this next year going to page 45 this is things we we do like Bayside Park beautification which we don't have any money funded in this year the tennis courts this is the second installment of that so we can move forward with renovating those we're saving some more money for the boat ramp the Morgan Park improvements this is to save for milling of the parking lot because it's got a lot of cracks in it and we're saving till we obtain enough money going forward to do the project street resurfacing we've set that at 60 this year we had 120 so we could do the paving to help with the paving in the BEI undergrounding area which was held off the other highlighted things the seawall we saved money for that the bridges repairs we've got a healthy savings in those two line items so this year I didn't put any money in the capital budget for the repairs on 22nd and Harrison both of them have a little over $60,000 in funding already in their savings accounts as an example yeah 22nd Street has 62,000 and Harrison has has 30 and we just did Harrison a couple years ago so I don't foresee a major major repair cost and over probably 10 or $15,000 that's what it's been the last few years so this year you did not elect to put any additional money in the repair budget Lin yes on that bridge I know to plan ahead on a replacement at a 22nd Street Bridge that was done a few years ago am I not correct yeah we've started that right now through 2020 which is this year we'll have a hundred and seventy three thousand set aside for that and we've been saving 30 a year and until that needs replacement and FDOT did an inspection last last year so there will be a new inspection in twenty but the last two inspections have been good with some minor repairs mainly some cracking repairs and you know where the yarn becomes exposed because of this salt water that's flowing in under there what I'm thinking is we've never done a total recent cost of repairing that entire bridge happening no not recently not recently just wonder if it's worth it so we know what the cost is going forward to readjust the savings on that yeah I'll make a note and see if we can get some numbers for that us for bridge going okay going down of course I talked about the sea walls I also that's just a savings account are two major sea walls we've we've already repaired and and that's the one on the Harrison bridge and the one on Belle Isle so this money is going to be utilized eventually for the sea walls that are in our part areas as they become deficient the street lighting program the money set aside their part of it is for the bridge lighting for the causeway because we were saving money to if we have to replace it the county for the most part is done maintenance for us on it and I know since I've been here we've never gotten a bill for that like if they replace the light bulb or went out there so that relationship with the street lighting department of the county that takes care of that for us has been good and they seem to replace everything as we need it but for the future we may need to replace those lights if what happened in 2017 to the lights on the other side of the bridge when they were all laying in the middle of the bridge from bel-air Bluffs so that's what that funding is and going forward we want to look at our street lighting plan and eventually change out some of the wooden poles and pick the worst ones to start replacing them with concrete so yes I'd like to just go back when when june van Hoek and myself went through all the parks we did notice there was a deficiency with a lot of ground missing behind our sea walls at 16th Street somebody's calling ok I will make a note of that and we'll double-check that again Kyle might have done something to it already Larry behind the seawall yeah I lost the ages you have up on the screen I don't why 46 and then ha you've got you don't see it no I just zoom not there that's all I say well there on the screen still does everyone else see it Blaine has them yes okay okay okay moving through this then behind those items are the individual sheets that show as an example the roof replacement for the community center what we're saving and what we estimated will cost us in the long term then we move to and if you've reviewed those and have any questions I'll be glad to answer any then we move to the marina fund which is page 66 and this basically we we've estimated we actually increased the parking fee budget because well we'll see how long it at last but the parking fees in the marina have risen more than double in the last two months which I think it's because people were locked up and couldn't go to the beach but slipper rentals will be maintained pretty much status quo there's a little difference in those based on if it's a resident or non-resident so there is we've changed out some slips this year so some of that will go and eventually the access will be transferred and if you look at the bottom there where it says other financing uses that $40,000 typically it's been between 40 and 45 each year we transfer to the general fund at the end of the fiscal year so it's a it's a revenue source repairs and maintenance things of that nature are pretty much standard we put in a little bit of increase for utility cost going up but it's it's minor the next page actually shows gives you a list of the the fees we're collecting from the owners and whether it's a property owner or a resident non-resident and the fees we're collecting from them okay our new fund which is brand new this year and you just passed the ordinance last week and we'll be moving on with that process one thing that I mentioned at the meeting last week we're gonna have to fund it appears from the county's subcontractor a payment of about twenty three thousand dollars I have asked them if we can negotiate but haven't got any warm fuzzies from them so we're probably going to have to approve that so we can make sure that the fee gets started October 1 as we plant so that'll probably be on your next council meetings budget going forward if you move to page 73 this is stormwater fund we're estimating the assessment at one hundred seventy five thousand when I talked to you about transferring out of the general fund and the 266 that's going we're going to transfer three hundred and seventy five thousand but that's a the 266 is net of all the expenses and the revenue that we're projecting coming in so that numbers about 110,000 higher but that money is coming from the general fund also and that's to fund the stormwater projects the maintenance we do the NPDES storm and drain maintenance contractual services with Pinellas County and street-sweeping which are all part of stormwater the capital projects next year total we put $50,000 in for Valley kerb replacements and 423,000 is rejected number for the 12th and 13th Street project that's currently in the fund and as we gave you if you look at the the next thing it's just showing you it's not in detail with the projects but on the CIP priority it shows you each year that the what project we're projecting and I do need those spreadsheets back that I emailed you so if you haven't sent them back please do so we can get those averages for you this is just showing this the stormwater fund and the valley curbs and then the stormwater project some lin question on the valley curbs this is what we're talking about waiting until this is in place to to address of alley curbs and good guy yes we're a little bit short of funding in the current let me look if it tells me that here because we've already got the quote no it doesn't I don't have that number in front of me but with this will still have probably another 25 that we can utilize for a their areas of the city the paving we're gonna have some excess so we can pave and some other areas of the city that we aren't doing stormwater projects on or that's the plan right now and going forward and how we're going to try to base that pavings on the pavement condition index that we did this study and we've come up with a ranking one through let me tell you we're not going to do things as an example we're not going to do things to places that we're going to be doing stormwater projects but we've got a ranking like the area at Belle Isle between the two hibiscuses it needs repaired that's a high priority Harrison is a high priority those are the the immediate high priorities but we have stormwater projects for some of the other areas like Cedar Drive and 18th Spruce Drive we don't want to do those and until we do the stormwater projects in those areas so that that index that program we bought turned out pretty good it gave us a lot of good information and I think it assisted us in looking at in the future budget we're gonna actually do what we did with the stormwater projects where you actually see where that project is like on the the CIP sheets that I sent out to you which I'll just flash up I sent this out to you you actually we can tell you okay in 2022 what project were we're planning to do and it's broke out in this year through twenty four twenty five and then the the last few projects are in the future but we're trying to we're gonna do that in a future budget with the paving and to be able to share that with you so we'll just say mayor man so street in which is not going to happen mayor Manzo but in twenty twenty eight is going to get their Street paved but his history does really low on the totem pole actually seventh Street is like six from the bottom for the pavement condition but there again there's going to be some work done on seventh and eighth as soon as we put the bid out to bid and the engineer gets all the permits okay I also gave you sent this out this is a summary of the major portion of the contracts and I've got a little ranking there and and I think that the council needs to look at a few of them and decide how they want to you know the the contract the one that I have have some different thoughts about is the the code enforcement I think we should bring that back in-house and move forward the sheriff's office they went up about 2.6 percent also and Fred I've sent to him the contract City Attorney's expenses have went up quite significantly this budget year and I think that was an increase because of public records requests increased expenditures and and I think the console needs to review this to look at some type of cost containment because if we go forward as we're going long-term it's going to really impact the budget in total engineering services you'll see some that I put not applicable and the reason I say that like Clearwater gas is a franchise fee they pay a 6% of their revenue it expires in 2032 forward Pinellas that's a planning thing and we only pay if we use those use them and we will next year be using them for the planning document that is doing 21 when you look at CP WG benoni dual they haven't done any projects for us this year mainly because the numbers that they gave us to do the stormwater project were higher than the numbers that engineering Sciences group gave us Cardinal does the end PDS report and I've shared the numbers that we've spent through the through the year through the end of May and they also did that grant research report Duke Energy's another franchise fee saltmarsh the auditor sometime after the first year we need to do an RFP and look at sending that out for an auditor to bid on that as you know they they were our normal auditing firm bought out and now certain salt marsh Cleveland and gun have taken over that contract through this fiscal year Susan Moore you just approved her contract for two more years John wolf we haven't had any Board of Adjustment hearings that we needed a magistrate for when we've had them the few that we've had the members that are on the Board of Adjustment have been able to have a quorum and attend the meeting so that's that's a positive and Victor marketing is the videotaping and I think for the most part Victor does a real good job sometimes he's a little backed up with the videos but overall I think he does a good job so that's a list of the contracts and then where are we a new document which we're still working on this is something that we can put out to the residents it just kind of gives a breakout call it a budget in brief and what we're doing it basically shows the revenues where they come from and then down below the expenses personnel capital improvement projects operating and the debt service and then if you go to the second page it again shows you something that we had on the previous slide I'm adding that to it because I think people the the residents need to understand a lot of people think that they're paying a hundred percent of the taxes to us and that's not the case actually last year or this current year I think it worked out at like twelve point seven percent and I'm sure this number founded where she they've set up the graph for 13% so does anyone have any questions of me nice job what's that you're not unmuted mayor oh all right I think you got it Thank You Patti Ben um good presentation uh the criteria that you had I don't know what you're looking for on this chart that has the red thing on it it says sort it I mean I see ones twos threes are we looking to prioritize them in numerical order are they one two three rankings I'm not quite sure what you're looking for from us okay if you go up into the little I'm gonna try to show you on my screen cuz I don't have this up that little green area in that those are the strategic plan goals and actually four and three are flipped but we want you to rank them with that and then the to be able to say that the secondary goal because as an example I'm just going to use something down the list there'll be a little simpler we'll look at the streetlights well the primary goal would be a number two you know it's tax money and number three would be the aesthetics as an example last year so you give us your you're ranking based on those items and put it so it's a ranking of 1 to 4 and then we will take the average of all council members and give you the average in a another spreadsheet and we are working on some modifications to that so you know at this point if I get the preliminary and then there may be a second one that I asked you for more information following you it's just the area in red you want ranked or everything on this page everything on the page what what is your priority from 1 to 4 and then it's just an average so as an example I'm just gonna pick one out that I have council member ranked it as a the carpet was a 3 as an example so if you just mark it 1 2 4 and send it back to me then we'll capture this and you will see on there the rankings average there to the left of that column it shows what the average was not the storm water so much because we've set up that projection for the storm water I think everyone here would say storm water is number 1 going forward so it's just for you to give us a little feedback on what you feel is is a priority you might even be able to streamline it a little bit because I the storm water has pretty much already been filtered out so I mean if you were to just pick it up below the gray in the orange we thirty line items there you know III think the stormwater stuff has pretty much bubbled to the top of the priority list so the the question is of all the remaining projects and cap improvements left where do those fit into the strategic plan priorities and then so if everybody can kind of look at those ones below the gray and orange and kind of a factor in what strategic goals are supported by those things primarily and then secondarily we can kind of compute a priority there and then we can subjectively go through it and say well does this will give it a sanity check well does this make sense you know this this capital improvement is at the very top of our priority list by the strategic goal that it supports but does it make sense I mean based on the economy based on resident feedback based on everything else does it does it pass the litmus test for is that actually what we want to pursue next yeah it's mainly to to to get feedback from each council member because every council member has a probably a different theory on what is is a priority in the city as an example one kind of I know several of you think the security cameras are a priority so you're probably going to rank them higher than someone that doesn't think they're a priority and I will tell you just as a outlier we for some of our expenses we submitted a grant to the law enforcement agency and I know we're not a law enforcement agency but my understanding is for the pandemic and just we don't know if we've got it yet or not but they allocated 25 thousand dollars to the city of bel-air Beach so we think and we made sure we spent 4900 and I think it was $99 or something but that's for supplies like the PP&E stuff and in talking to the people at this law enforcement what they told me was there's the potential that you know we've got a high potential of getting it so and then now that also the county has come out with some money so we'll see if we can get anything it's not going to help our revenues but it might help some expenses going forward any questions well I you know we the staff did a great job this year we tried to reconfigure the budget so it's not this big thick book so what what once we get through all of it this will be our budget the backup stuff is just peripheral backup stuff that we wanted to provide to the console and if you know if the public wants to know anything about it will be glad to meet with them and hopefully we'll have a time when we can have a public forum that we can kind of talk a little more about the budget in the future so people understand it a little better do we have anybody from the public there yes man there's two phone calls I can see the phone calls I can't see the raised hands like I did earlier in the day when we were testing it but I can unmute them and ask him that they want to speak if council wanted to let me just ask counsel first it's it's we've traditionally always welcomed input from the public but it's not required we're not making decisions does anyone have an issue if we open up for public questions no not hearing any patty if you could open and and we'll try and limit it to three minutes at those questions okay I'm just going to do one at a time okay yes of course and this person is named Jane so Jane quiet people Jane yes did you have a comment or a question no we're not okay thank you let me mute that okay now let me go the other one is just a phone number so I'll have to ask I can unmute it hold on it's not a meeting hold on one second it's not coming off of mute so I believe that they have control over it with a on their keypad oh yeah I saw so - yeah that I can ask unmute but they have to actually I knew that right councilman they're Gatos yes okay yeah they're not a muting this is just our first discussion on it so if anybody has a question that did not get hurt tonight and they want to be heard on it they could write or just call and tomorrow to City Hall speak to Lynne or to Patty get that question and we'll make sure it gets picked up on our next meeting so that's not a problem then there being no other public questions or comments we'll close that and come back if there's any other council comments or questions Dave question for you I still have room on the screen nothing else okay I I don't and I don't think any anyone else ran into that as far as what the problem is now you're talking about yourself or the overall screen all right I have the course pictures of every on the right and then in the center of the screen is zoom nothing nothing that Lynne has presented since I told you about it and I tried to click on a few things to reinitiate her instructions from zoom nothing happened it sounds to me like you've got malfunction of some sort I'm not real sure because I've never seen that before what did you ever get a picture at all yes I did when we first started okay think what recommendation would be to disconnect right click and then log right back here what I will do Dave is I'll take a picture of this so you can see it the next time I see you and maybe we can figure it out okay yeah just send it to us more okay from this end just so everybody knows from this end I think Patti I don't think you muted me the second time I muted myself to try and keep you know so there's no background noise and then it wouldn't let me unmute myself so I'm not so sure that it's not like once you mute yourself it may not let you back in but other than that it ran fine let me add to that right quick I wanted to address that issue I know this is our maiden voyage John soon basically there are a lot of switches in the in the setup you're basically once you you turn up in a certain way one way or the other they become the default for all meetings unless you want exchange of a by meeting the not allowing people to unmute is because we have one number that we've given out to everyone one conference basically one type of login and in the you know a little bit better structured version of this that we're going to have to practice with it and a Patti I'll come down and work with you to get it set up it's basically will be one type of log in and then we'll post a public login we all have the public type of login right now if you notice it didn't ask for a name or much of anything really whenever we get to that point everyone on call in will that doesn't have the special access will automatically be muted once they unmute Paddington control it but as soon as it's muted again they can't they can't barge in whereas we will be able to turn it off and on as we as we walk to this this is our maiden voyage with zoom so overall it worked well I think the only other thing I mean I'm doing this on a laptop when I had your stuff in front of me I could see it but if you were looking if the public was looking in I think it might have been hard to see some of those numbers I don't know if you could enlarge that screen a bit other than that it looked it looks fine so yeah there is yeah there is a way I could I think I couldn't make it a full screen which brings the numbers and stuff closer to you the page we're currently looking at on your screen I know that it's printing to read like a book right if you could change the page size whenever you turn it into a something else for this like just say all the pages make them landscape that gives you more text in a wider a wider right or group and that way you can enlarge it cuz basically we've got two thirds of this frame that are useless right right hey Dave another another comment here I think a phone call came in and that's what scrambled a screen for me I think that's what happened my other my line because I'm connected phones are connected that's possible and again I also have the app on the computer and I didn't I tried to go through the app to set up the meeting and I wouldn't I couldn't connect so I had to go back to email and click on that link so I don't know if there's a conflict between the app and the link I'm not really sure Martha again probably just to see if you could get it back I mean it's not going to hurt anything for you a disk an active bump ride back in because if it actually connects pretty quickly will if you want to try that we'll talk about you Lyla while you're doing that all right now to go off of this saying I'm on I'm connected to Firefox just go to that and disconnect and go back to the email and reconnect yes all right I'll try it while we're waiting for more of anybody else have any questions on the zoom or anything else that you need from Lynne on the budget just to clarify to everyone next Monday we'll have another budget work session with any of your comments and I'll have the budget document in front of me also we need to set the tentative millage rate which I mentioned earlier so there will be a special meeting after the work session to set the tentative millage rate and at this point I'm recommending that we set it at 2.0 2.0 3 9 4 which is the current millage now we can't once we set that we can't go higher but you can go lower but this initial tentative millage rate is what we need to submit to the property tax raiser so they can send out the term notices any questions great job great job the format is great and kudos to the staff and Dave for the meeting format boy it's really working out really well good job wall it's back to you mayor just waiting on Marv Marv will you let me know and I'll call for the adjournment here well I tell you I went out but I never really went all the way out I still had I had a blank screen the Apple screen and everybody stayed up on the right-hand side when out try to bring it back in and I still can't reconnect why don't we do this if we can keep maybe you on the line and if Lynn and Patty and maybe Dave whoever's the experts want to stay around that would be great and then we can release everybody else unless anybody else has anything else cuz this is a limited beating so really we're not supposed to have anything else I'm good with that okay do we have motion for adjournment Shalu all in favor I see everybody Monday night marce [Music] okay the deputy will see you tomorrow mayor 1 1:30 yes be there okay thank you thanks Lynn I don't"
