    "transcript": "good evening everyone it is uh now 6 p.m on November the 14th and this is the city council work session coming to order uh let's do the Pledge of Allegiance congratulations for all Kyle will you be taking the role yes um council member Frank Banker can you hear us [Music] yeah he's muted not Shannon well my apologies Mr Mayor can you hear me now sure can you look better council member Frank bankert's here via Zoom council member of Leslie nataro here council member Lloyd Roberts here council member Mike zabel Eric vice mayor Jody Shirley here mayor Dave Gattis here interim city manager Kyle riefler here City attorney Randy Moore president thank you very much Mr riefler uh we'll just go ahead and get started with item number one which is discussion of proposed ordinance regarding comprehensive sign regulations this was placed on the agenda by interim city manager riefler uh take it away sir okay so this is our uh ordinance the City Attorney Morris has drafted up it he went through it and he can explain more than I can where he added uh highlighted sections of the areas of of possible areas you might want to change as far as uh the layout of the ordinance we wanted to spend on that shows myself I'm interested forgive me for a moment I just want to make sure I'm looking at most recent as it's been a moment since uh transmitted this oh sorry the sign code oh yes uh so with the sign code draws this is there's a lot here um I I it's not lost on me that it's lengthy it's much lengthier than anything I've sent you in the past or likely will send you um this conforms to what we've done in a lot of other communities as proposing this um in the in the draft that I transmitted to Mr riesler and I believe as it was communicated to you there are several portions that are highlighted in yellow these are the like it's your policy call we just here's a number any number if 24 inches isn't the number you want make it 26 make it 38 I don't care but it's really like this is where the policy Maker's role is at it's at its heaviest what we have here in the sign code and and I've circulated some of the case law in the past I know to Mr tarot directly I can't remember if I sent it to each of you but as I was interviewed and in the time since I've been interviewed we brought up what about our sign code what about our sign code this has sort of been a a point of concern for us in our community for some time in 2015 the Supreme Court um I believe is during the 2015 term might have been 2014. um past uh or issued a decision in a case called read B Gilbert out of Arizona and with Reed V Gilbert the the holding of that piece was such that it was we cannot regulate signs or sign regulations must be content neutral and so the traditional model of well if it's a retail if it's a real estate sign we can do this if it's a political sign we can do this especially as it relates to Temporary signs it has to be content neutral so we don't look to what it says if it says vote for Randy or join the Coleman for the Cure walk or the chili cook-off or um come stay here uh we we can't really regulate that we can regulate size you know Dimensions placement Etc time place manner restrictions as you might refer to them in free speech regulation but temporary signage has to be regulated uniformly and so the with a lot of communities that have looked at these um sign code amendments um and this would this would ultimately also go through your pnz and back to you again in the form of an ordinance uh where the sticking points have been in some communities have been on for example the number of signs allowed in a yard it might sound crazy to you to say we should allow six signs in a yard but remember when it comes election season if somebody wants to support four of you a ballot measure and the president you're there's six right there um and so but that number is that number whether they're political signs or something or just go with God and be kind today and put that in your friend whatever somebody wants to put um it's content neutral temporary signage and there's this you know restrictions on size and placement the other thing that's very different about this ordinance just from the jump the first several pages are whereas Clauses exodial Clauses findings I know as politicians you don't love and I'm not using that term to rightly but as the legislators you don't always love my I find legislators don't always love all these findings being in there this is to substantiate an ever-evolving area of the law and yes we considered it and if challenged yes we considered it yes this is how we reconcile that this is how we arrived here um there's been some more recent case law in the last two terms not necessarily specific to read b b Gilbert on temporary signs but more to Municipal regulation um in Florida we have a scheme where we're already regulate um off-site advertising for example I'm going to have a sign here for the bait and tackle shop way over there and so but as drafted this already addresses that I I can while I have sort of a broad-based summary because of its length the idea was first to give this to you folks to hey we have work product we are moving forward is there anything that is very specific to your community that this isn't addressing or you say hey there's a lot here I'm not sure IT addresses this but as we move forward I want to make sure A B and C are handled um but again we're not I'm not looking one with this being a workshop I'm not looking for and we will pass this tomorrow um but are we moving in the right direction and if not why not what can we do to address resolve continue to move forward um so with that it it's I know there may be some inclination as you look at this to say we have two zoning districts this can't be that hard um it's residential and another form of residential but what we also try to do is say what are the issues in other communities and make sure this is really closer to an insurance policy of Regulation that we're not wondering how do we regulate it when something shows up we already know how off science sides are addressed how illuminated signs are addressed how you know snipe signs or whatever every kind of Lollipop sign whatever the things we've seen in other communities and no I'm not making these words up they're in there um but knowing how we're going to address them rather than well we don't have any of those so that's not a problem here well yeah and so that's why it's drafted as robust as it is with the informed by the Lessons Learned in other communities where we have proposed and and Advance these drafts the first thing that that I would like to say about this is this will probably be the most expensive ordinance that we've ever done right um because we're paying for your time God only knows what it's going to cost to advertise this this is multiple pages of a newspaper um and then of course we don't have to publish the whole ordinance we publish just the title but I do agree with you it's a long title it's a lot and then also the uh municode I don't know what it costs per page to add this but it's going to be very very expensive but it is something that we need I think the last time we we even attempted this it was nowhere near 45 pages and we were still overwhelmed with the volumes of information that we had in front of us um Jody well I agree it's something we need to get back in place it is a lot of material to go through um no doubt yeah and you know I've been thumbing through it since received it and uh I'm not sure that I'm completely following it maybe we just need a quick lesson on what what are the Highlight light sort of thing because all the whereas Clauses you know don't uh that's law and it's not something that I'm versed in and I don't you know it's a tough It's it's tough for Layman to read right but um you know maybe it would be helpful I know you highlighted just some sizes of lettering um temporary Banner information things like that uh Florida statute but what would you say we should focus on when we're reviewing this own it no um I I really think that the attention should the point of attention should be what numbers are you as it relates to Temporary signs what numbers are you okay with in on properties um their Dimensions uh looking to to the extent you have you don't really have commercial districts but to the extent you have things that like well that's always been a picture of the community is there are you worried about and again less relevant here but in other communities hey we've always had the Eat At Joe's sign and it looks like this and how's the E to Joe sign that it fit into this um those sorts of the things that are specific to your community is really uh where I think the attention should go I I hear you on the length of it and while I I wouldn't say that none of it could be paired down this is a very rare instance most of the time as you're making policy I'm not coming to you and saying you need to pass this ordinance right here's an ordinance you should consider I'm doing this in response to we are doing this in response to Supreme Court jurisprudence which is somewhat Ever Changing I went to a conference Justice Just this summer it's like here's the sort of new shades we think based on recent Supreme Court case law and so what we're trying to signal is well likely if we're going to see a challenge to something this is the kind of thing we're likely to see it to and I want to make sure that I'm giving you all the fodder to save we're going to go through the through the effort of of adopting this just debating it discussing it that I make it defensible right um and I don't and I'm not asking that you internalize and and understand every single whereas Clause um what I think the step I think that tonight should be the first in a series of discussions about this um this should be broaching that discussion and saying well here's the other part of this is in addition to it being top down in terms of here's the Supreme Court such City attorney give us something to work with Beyond saying Randy we need something to work with I haven't had we haven't had a workshop on signs before right in my tenure in my tenure I know that there's been discussions in the past so I'm sort of going in Tableau Blank Slate here's something if this isn't what you had in mind by all means please tell me obviously I I work at your pleasure if this is too much fine we'll figure out how we pair it back if it's not addressing the particular ills that we're concerned about in this community then let's make sure it does but given that this was sort of a we need something to work with here's everything it's here's the whole Buffet right and and the list for example of prohibited signs is lengthy right it captures almost every iteration of something that isn't what you would ordinarily see if you don't want to list that robust fine understand that okay that'll that'll shorten it substantially but then we are leaving maybe leaving some question marks on what can and can people do and how what what license will people take um and I'm not saying that's where you were focused but to me I don't know that it I given its length and given that we haven't had a discussion prior to its presentation to you about what we did and didn't want I it is not my advice to you tonight that and give me this and we'll come up on first reading this is let's start the discussion with something to work with um I don't think we need to Workshop this for the nine you know 90 minutes of tonight I don't know that that's going to be productive given where our level of understanding is if you want more um synthesis that's understandable and reasonable and I can give that it was it was hard for me to say here's exactly what we're focused on Beyond hearing a little bit of you know we had this one thing three years ago and we had this other thing and trying to get that into and now I know I've met my clients needs well here's here's my dilemma is why it definitely needs to be moved forward is we've had um although we say we have no uh we only have Residential Properties we have the Bel Air Beach hotel which is got a quite large whole sign that was lost during the storm you know is that permitted in our current code of course we don't even have a sign because so what happens you know how do we how do we permit that when they go to replace it and they're going to right um you know is that even something that we want to see in our city is it going to be this big illuminated you know hole sign which they can hang a box and go back to what they had and it could be illuminated and well and I can tell you as it relates to a particular property or property owner anybody who's applying right now is applying under your current code we can't say that we're something we might maybe do in the next five or six months binding and I know you guys appreciate that I want to say that just for clarity in the record if something were to pass tomorrow that's not a failure of this body in the here now because we didn't do something tonight um your code is your code as it sits tonight and this isn't something that we even have we're close enough to say like okay everybody was reasonably on notice of precisely what was being adopted um I will tell you that in as much as while you're generally residential one of the reasons more time was put into this draft and and a colleague of mine who's also a City attorney in other Beach communities principally drafted this Rob essenfelder in my office with my in insights and um collaboration I will tell you that um one of the things is like I see that they're two districts but they do have pseudo-commercial uses and I need to be sensitive to that and the draft and make it more robust than just homes right so we did have an eye towards that in our draft specifically discussed it um the time share Hotel element of what you kind of sort of have um and so that's another concern of ours is saying well well we don't necessarily we may not necessarily anticipate the use proliferating people didn't anticipate vacation rentals operating as they do today and so we want and I'm not saying this is specific to that I just give that as an example that it's on the brain for other reasons um you know just you know with that but you know one of the questions I have for you folks um in terms of this open dialogue is were there concerns not that whether they were addressed or not were there concerns that you have that you want to say like as we move through this I want to make sure we are dealing with X Y or Z or or resolving ABC in our community because that's also helpful for me to know what your concerns and your constituencies or concerns are about signs let me go to uh Mr bankert he's had his hand raised for a while now actually it's a computer Dave so uh I didn't have it up but uh anyway um I believe Justice Thomas wrote majority opinion in um Reed Gilbert uh and he clearly says that Tommy go a long way towards the entirely forbidding the posting of signs so long as it does so and then even-handed content neutral manner so I cannot see how I couldn't I think you you pointed out Mr Mayor the last proposal Mr Riley gave us is like 27 pages I think this is like 35 or 30 some pages uh I couldn't stomach that one I'm not degrading you Mr Moore at all or whatever I mean you're giving us you know a sign audience but wouldn't it be better if we said on the east side of Golf Boulevard we take justice Thomas's language no signs west side of goth Boulevard for the commercial businesses the condos we have some type of strategy of science and be done with this nonsense or just put the old sign ordinance back which is a couple pages long I mean this is this is just beyond ridiculous it's going to cost us a fortune like you said Mr Mayor and publicizing it this is just this is just bad I think any attorney that looks at this will be salivating because anytime something's written long there's ways to bring into court and scrutinize the whole ordinance thank you thank you I think the the reason why we're we're going through this exercise is because our existing ordinance was written wrong was written poorly um Mr Sable you you had a comment yeah I want to bring this up um you would think with our type of City it'd be no problem but we got two sitting council members that are being sued we have public citizens that are being sued for something that is frankly in the exercise of their position this is a litigious Society and frankly I would put our attorney up against any other attorney that lives here in this city you need to be very very specific do not be you know Dollar Wise pound foolish we must get this done correctly I really do appreciate what's been done here uh my way forward I propose is I like this as a start you definitely I mean this has got to look at every contingency which he has done yeah attorneys salivating fine knock yourself out but we've done our diligence to protect the city because this would rip the city apart next is the potential pathway yeah this is a lot to swallow in the first reading and he said we're starting the process great idea if we can just get a general idea of going forward educate but turn it over to you know the various committee that can actually get into the weeds and they have the time and the inclination or whether they can review this more thoroughly we have not only this but we have buoys we have finances budgets we do have a lot on our plate and to keep it manageable recommend that they do a throw review and then we all meet again with attorney Moore to really you know fine-tune the areas that we can fourth time thank you thank you very much Leslie do you have any comments um I I'm amazed I've heard legal briefs that don't have as much citation as this thing does um question Scenic America Inc I'm on page nine whereas the city recognizes that Scenic America Inc recommends improvements in the scenic character of a community what is that I hear the question it is a I will tell you that it is a non-governmental organization right that that has opinions on these things that you like saying perhaps AAA or something of the sort what we're trying to do is say that they we have looked uh when in justifying Municipal enactments and in articulating a rational basis the city need not engage its own studies and and efforts to adopt measures it can say look other entities have looked at this issue and this is what they have opined and we find those findings relevant for our purposes I I I'm not a candidly I'm not in a position to tell you this is how they're Incorporated in their history and in their structure and their um relationship but they it is a certainly an entity with interest in the Aesthetics of uh municipalities and and our you know communities and booktube for that purpose yeah you know it's just an amazing um an amazing ordinance um last time we did something on City Signs we brought in sample signs here's one that's X by X feet I'm assuming they're somewhere in the you know in the closet here somewhere so that we could take a look at you know how big should we allow these signs to be do you know what I'm talking about or where they may be hiding or I don't know if I can locate the old ones but it wouldn't be hard to remake samples definitely visuals for you guys to look at and again as this is drafted it has placeholders for Dimensions this was Dimensions to me to me this is sort of like the equivalent of if you're building new construction um you folks are going to need to make decisions about the finishes yeah you know how what's this going to look like but we need the structure first um and so this is absent any input on structure here's the most robust version we can do once I have your input I of course will adapt it to what this community wants I I want to be very clear that the seven or six of you are the policy makers not the City attorney I would not have it that you adopt something simply because the City attorney said we needed to and so this is what we did I want that doesn't mean you need to intellectualize every single facet but I this is ultimately going to be your work product and if you don't like the work product I appreciate that feedback let me know um I again we were starting sort of from zero to make sure we have something to work with and it's easier to subtract from uh with with Precision than to add to um in the with ambiguous desire and so that's in my estimation where we are on this I I want to be very clear I take nof events to constructive criticism aimed at a better product so so what you've given us one second uh Mr Roberts what you've given us is you've given us a a generic document that whatever numbers we plug in anywhere we see a yellow highlight uh it's a one size fit all it's just what do we want and we plug those numbers in it's generic but it's generic grounded in your community it was drafted with attention to what your zoning districts are what the history of your you know the warehouse go to the year you were adopted not just like where is an X you did why um it is already drafted to fit this community but yes it is here's by and large how we've done this in other communities and it's not a one-size-fits all because ultimately you make it fit yourself there's other communities that we've done a draft another Community I work in that has a draft that they're workshopping right now and at the end of it there's a whole chart on signs signs sizes and and Zoning districts that's because their current code has that and they want that chart yours doesn't have that we're not going to create a chart that's because just because there's had it doesn't mean yours needs to um and so we we did try to make it a line while it may not mirror what you currently have in as much as one of you has suggested you know why don't we just eliminate sides on one side I want to be very clear if you're doing that you're saying there's no signs of if one of you runs for office tomorrow and you live on the east side or whatever that side that is there's no political sign there is no real estate sign there is no signs allowed in the community if that's the prohibition um this this as as Justice Thomas's opinion was written it severely curtailed that now the court has since retreated a little bit from that very restrictive read of read read B Gilbert um to say well you got to have the ability to regulate somehow we're not going to get into you know if Eda Joe's off-site is is the same thing but um ultimately we can I I will defer to what policy directions you want to move and provide you the analysis on what is or is not permissible in that regard oh wait yeah so Randy earlier you mentioned that um there was some other towns or cities along possibly Gulf Boulevard excuse me that are similar with this type of a document is that accurate um I I am the City attorney in the city of Indian Rocks Beach I've provided their manager and management team a draft similar to this I just had a meeting with them 10 days ago to talk about or something like that to talk about line edits and drafts and we're putting it before their pnz we I know we put we've provided similar drafts in the city of Tarpon Springs and the City of Dunedin I don't know if those got enacted I just asked my colleague where those stand uh so I don't know which ones have gone to adoption versus which are in process but I will tell you that when read came out in 2015 there were probably two firms five lawyers who were being contracted with throughout the state to draft because nobody really was willing to wait wade into those Waters confidently and a lot of people were looking to a couple attorneys one of them unfortunately had health issues and rather than keep telling our our clients well this is the person you need to you need to you need to use them we got the competency and looked at what their drafts are and tried to conform to where the direction of the law is going um yours your ordinance was re all those Warehouse classes were Revisited to make sure the case law is current as of the draft you were provided um this is not just like well we drafted and we're sure it's fine we're looking at it I don't love giving you guys I I don't believe in using five words when you can use two this isn't representative of that and I recognize that um I'm we are in a in what I would call a fluid legal jurisprudential area and I want to make sure that if you're going to go through the effort of adopting it that it's defensible researched and articulated that this was we did have a basis for going in the direction we did yes we saw those case law decisions and yes this is still where we want to go and ultimately see but again I just want to I have to emphasize you folks are the policy makers you don't like it tell us yeah I'm actually a big believer and um in more detail because I would like to have a document to where we would minimize any opportunity if possible to where somebody says well you know you really don't say in here what I'm dealing with yeah so anything that we can put in there on a much smaller scale when I was dealing with rules for a softball league when I was in loots you know that was my goal so nobody could say well this is unique you don't really address it in the rules I want to avoid that every way possible and we've endeavored to do that I will tell you that invariably somebody will find that thing that you never anticipated right um this is not without its flaws it was still written by people so it has laws I'm sure and I again in as much as those flaws are things that you folks can't count men's please let us know okay just one quick question uh just because I was having trouble visualizing it on page 13. just at the bottom which is the calculation of a double faced sign so a double face sign my first time I read that I thought front and back but I don't think that's what it's saying a double phase sign shall be the area be calculated in the area of one face only double face signs shall be constructed at the perimeter of both faces coincide and are parallel and are not more than 24 inches apart it's interested to be like a box our our signs are like double-sided right now you've got two two sheets of Plexiglas one side here one side here and in between is just a giant box full of lights right and so you're 24 inches now but what if if you wanted to make this really huge one that was six foot in depth but the face are within the regulation correct so they're saying two feet apart the 24 inches is the maximum yeah the two sheets has nothing to do with top and bottom 24 inches just like this okay guys that's what numbers able was it okay awesome yes I don't think there's a tremendous I mean if we want to say that we're fairly comfortable with this for lack of a better term like a boilerplate here um but we want to go through and address those highlighted areas where there's dimensions and days and times and things like that I don't think it's a huge amount of work to go through there and identify those that have already been identified but for us to kind of say well we think 24 inches is is too far apart we want it to be 12 inches right and we go with that precisely and I'm just using that one as a limited example and the size of yard signs and the each Community is different and okay as a firm believer in home we'll want to make sure you're capturing what it what makes sense in your community I'm I'm curious um the dimensions that are plugged in uh were old Dimensions reused as much as possible that's my recollection of that I I um in as much as a code presently regulated it was here's what it presently says that's how we typically try to do it um because I'm I'm operating on on Dual tracks of sign codes at the moment in my head I'm almost here in another Community I'm sorry we're calling what's which one was Which Way but yes ordinarily when we do it where there was an existing number we tried to keep it so you didn't charge us 100 for the effort for two cities right no sir we okay we shared the cost on this one I'll refer to that as bulk pricing that's right that's what we got and I just want to say we probably should make sure you read everything thoroughly because there is a prohibited sign that is talking about vehicle signs and all I can think of is a construction vehicle and it says uh the vehicle visible from the street or right away within 100 feet of the vehicle uh where the vehicle is parked for more than two consecutive hours in a 24-hour period so I'm just thinking any construction worker side of the Vans painted they're going to be there all day working it's going to be parked more than 24 hours if I'm reading this correctly I'm just kind of scanning through circling some things yeah just some things like that that would probably you know just make sure that we're not being unreasonable either sure well obviously this is a lot of information that we have to sort through and uh we need to make our own recommendations and come back for another meeting on this um this is a great start uh ultimately I wouldn't mind it going to the citizens advisory advisory committee once we like we'll do it backwards this time we'll make recommendations and pass it off and let the citizens advisory committee look it over and make recommendations and in my recollection based on its placement in your code I believe it would also go before you're planning and zoning board as well um if if you wish to send it to CAC that's I think your guys rules on that are are discretionary but just to be advised that another another board will look at it the more the more eyes it goes in front of the uh the better I will feel any other comments about this sign ordinance thank you Mr Banker no I I've said my piece I think we should go with what Mr Thomas wrote all right thank you very much uh with that being said we will move on to item number two which is discussion of draft employment agreement for the services of Kyle raffler as city manager and this was placed on the agenda foreign happy to be the person who's placed it there and as much as I said uh you know so uh let me just pull up my email on that one moment please um so about a little less than two weeks ago um I sent to you folks on November 2nd I sent to you folks in email detailing uh the the here's the draft that I provided Kyle here's the draft that Kyle provided with his insights Kyle and I had the clear line of communication emphasizing that I am here as counsel for the city and its commission our Council and he was free to get whatever other advice and insights he wished he he took the time carefully reviewed it provided another draft in addition providing those true Dash those two drafts my email can included a bulleted summary of notable terms contract terms salary Health Medical Dental life insurance annual vacation leave Etc this draft was not on my end not done from scratch as of course we had negotiated extensively with another candidate and ultimately did not reach mutually agreeable terms that that fact notwithstanding some of the more substantive changes as it relates to Kyle from the draft that you'd last seen was the um uh the the leave component um this this body had deliberated about leave for the prior candidate and concluded that they wish that you did not want to have a distinction between annual leave sick leave Etc just here's your leave use it as you wish Kyle having been an employee of the city for several years now has a crude leave and as a general ethos and Kyle you can correct me if I'm speaking out of turn gear as a general ethos in his notes to me said I generally wish to be treated more like another employee um than not I still have his contract but if this is how we administer benefits to employees by by and large he preferred that model than creating some kind of special regime just for his purposes and so uh with that in mind um that's that's where you'll see some of the more notable differences annual vacation leave sick leave um the the salary number I did not have a specific negotiating range I was mindful of what ranges you talked about out in some of the marketing before I mean some of the numbers that have been bandied about and also mindful of where Mr riefler is presently on his compensation I threw out a number with not not with specific guidance of 95 000. Mr riesler countered um with with it being graduated five percent at different times uh Mr riefler as he and I discussed that explained well you know he'd much rather have a number and also just track the three percent subject to your approval that you generally have been giving or whatever your cost of loving cost of loving cost of living adjustments you make year over year for your employees that it would be equally extended to the manager in that in that case in mind there would be years where he didn't got in and get an increase um otherwise I'm happy to answer any questions but I think it's been laid out in a way that's concise enough to be digested uh since uh Mike Sable made the motion to move forward on this uh I would like for him to make the first comment yeah um I like to go back to salary obviously this has the initial at 115. what is the current salary right now with that additional kicker that we had voted in um currently his current I didn't know the Baseline yeah my recollection was the Baseline is presently around 92 to 93 is that correct that's correct with his with his previous title plus the one thousand dollar whatever it was edition if any if made annual his his it would be 92 to 93 and let me I did ask these questions to the um Finance director um Heather guadagnoli so let me just call up that email if you don't mind so I can speak to some of that I asked her to identify the total value of Kyle's annual salary before receiving additional compensation is interim manager it was 65 251.42 I asked you to identify the total of Kyle's annual salary after receiving additional compensation and it was 91 251.42 cents uh which is roughly a 26 000 annual increase I asked to identify the dollar of value of Kyle's present total annual compensation salary and benefits and adding in pension contributions health insurance Etc his total compensation presently was at a hundred and fifteen thousand six hundred eighteen dollars and sixty two cents with dental and vision car allowance pension health insurance um and the life insurance policy that the city has I asked to confirm whether Kyle presently receives his health insurance through the city or receives the flat rate 600 a month payment and she said the 600 a month payment with a total of seventy two hundred dollars um confirm whether Kyle is presently subject to the paid and sick leave Provisions in the personal manual yes standard accruals as a present employee and confirm the nature and Quantum of the city's retirement plan contributions for Kyle presently it is a 10 pension contribution through the Florida municipal pension not yet fully vested based on General employees terms although city manager immediately becomes vested in general employees after five years Kyle would be fully vested on June 4th 2023 which is to say he is approaching his fifth year in June 2023 and that was the the numbers I was given I can repeat any of those if that informs you but those questions were certainly considered in the draft figures because the um I was looking at this obviously when we discussed salaries Etc these were for people with you know 20 some cases 30 years more experienced vastly more degree um right now what I'm looking at and this is not by anybody as just as my shot at it if we're taking say 93 000 right now as is current I'd be willing to say we had three percent of that and uh offer ninety six thousand dollars like I can't see going to 115. uh immediately because once you get to 115 and then you're talking annual increments in a space about 10 years it could potentially be unaffordable um so you got to work a little bit both ways make sure that they have a pathway for longevity but at the same time we are appreciative of what he's done so he's keeping that uh that additive that we put in and then putting three percent on that for ninety six thousand dollar uh salary initial that's all I have though appreciate that thank you Mr bankert I see your hand is raised Mr reefer interviewed for the job and before we did any interviewing I think Mr zabel and I seconded and I um was a hundred and twenty three thousand dollars we were looking for a base salary in our current budget we budgeted around 185 thousand dollars to give Mr reefer a three percent increase when Social Security participants are getting the 8.7 percent increase I think it's disrespectful for the job that he's been doing I think we should increase it to a minimum of 120 000 of salary I think he deserves it um it's well under the budget it's well under what we were seeking to pay and um what have we done for him for the last what five six months nothing okay uh I I propose four times to move the city manager Mr zabel proposes it once and it gets a unanimous vote but this should have been done months ago hopefully it's done before Christmas Kyle that's all remember Baker could you repeat the figure I didn't catch it that you were proposing at least 115 to 120. thank you which would be 65 000 under our budget Leslie um one question on the first page and the second whereas um laws in a public meeting on October 22nd 2010 is that a correct date am I missing something there um that sounds sounds like a typo um they got the numbers October 10th 2022. yeah that was interposed thank you for that I was looking at my calendar to see when we had our last meeting um so I I would be totally in favor of otherwise going forward way too much time right otherwise the attorney spent way too much time and we worked with the other City so you're in favor of the 115 yes Mr Roberts yeah first off I think the 115 is is a great number and here's why early on we looked at um some other competing towns and cities within Florida Coastal type towns and cities and um I know Glenn and I were working on some different numbers regarding what people were being hired for and I recall it was this 115 number was right in there I think it went to a maximum of 118 and down to like 95 something like that but many of those people that were hired um no I can't say many some of those people that were hired may not have had any experience in a coastal type Town there's a lot of things they may have been missing Kyle obviously has been here for a while there's some things he's does extremely well because of that I think also Dave you had said that down the street a town relatively recently hired somebody for the city manager or the town manager and she was previously like the CFO or something like that she held a position it was more of the accounting type person had done a great job for that town I actually called them and she was promoted and everybody was in favor of it the city council or the city commission whatever they were called so she went directly from the previous position to her new position and it was in the 130 range that this particular person got now she had been with the city for quite a while um but personally I feel the 115 if I had to pick the number before I actually saw this based on the numbers that I've seen out there and what we looked at before I think that's a solid number song for the 115. thank you vice mayor Shirley well I just want to start by saying 115 accounts to 139 roughly when you add in all the benefits so just like when we're looking at it like make sure we're we're looking at the total number um you know I'm not opposed to the 115 number but if if that it you know we're looking at you know we're all focused on a number and not so much the rest of the terms the contract and we're looking at a two-year contract so I'd say if if we did enter at that 115 number that that's the number for years one and two I think there's going to be some learning curve sometime he's I still stand firm that uh you know there should be some education requirements I'm not talking about furthering degrees I could care less about a degree I'm talking about furthering you know his public management uh experience and trying to get him in a program whether it's with FSU Florida State you know um I don't know they have some public Management Programs the fccma has a monthly training um and you know I initially uh suggested that we connect him with the senior advisor who would um Mentor him and help him sharpen his management skills and I think that you know that he has a bit of a learning curve Kyle I'm sorry I don't mean to talk about you like you're not in the room this is very awkward but um we just we need to strengthen his skills and invest in them and so I'm okay with the 115 but I think that's the wage for years one and two um well he works on uh continuing education that we agree to pay for I think in here it said we would contribute twenty five hundred dollars towards some um associations but I think that needs to be modified to also include paying for education I think it does because right after talks about the 2500 it says City further agrees to consider budgeting and paying for managers reasonable travel for professional development Etc so there's a 2500 for the associations yeah for membership dues and then beyond that we can go beyond that to go to city manager 101 or whatever yeah and I'm not familiar with those you know other than the ones I know that they have at the college level but I I think that you know we'll need some direction and that's where I think it provides for that in there and I I agree that and and there were some mentoring resources available uh who were the senior advisor program and and the senior advisor program in it um in addition points to iccma and fccma uh which is one of those memberships um specifically that those are those are the associations for the city managers in Florida I'm much like as a municipal attorney I have the Florida Municipal attorneys Association fmaa where I can pursue those sorts of things we can definitely make sure he's plugged into those resources and those and those people locally the senior advisors program is not just for example for recruitment but also there is a sounding board and resource so the uh that should be a requirement I would think yeah and also yeah I like her proposal about yeah if we're gonna do a 115 for each of those uh the first year and the second year and then obviously the education I think that I would agree with that uh going back to Mr Banker's comment um I I know it's it doesn't seem like much but a 26 000 instant increase is uh is pretty darn cool uh I think that um we could have gone a different route we had several candidates we could have hired we we held in there and uh um I I don't think we've treated you wrongly I I hope you don't feel that way um but uh you're still here and we're working with you and we're trying to make this work so uh uh don't please don't let those comments weigh on your heart okay we're doing we're doing what we think is the right thing and we're doing our due diligence um personally I'm uh not opposed to the 115. I I think it's probably a little on the high side I'd like to see the training also but I think that this council is willing to work with you while you obtain that training and uh and the mentoring and uh and seek out any resources that will help you to do the best job you can so uh I I'm fine with that salary other comments from the council I have no further contract and no further comments on any of the limitations or numbers in the rest of the contract I'm willing to go forward based on that talk about 115 Mr Banker I think we all should get smart here and jump on the 115 and give them a pay raise like every other employee will get especially with his economy um because he has now been the city manager interim whatever you want to call it passing out two storms you pay them too low someone's going to pick him off from us and we're going to lose so we can be cheap about it and losing or we can compensate what he deserves thank you thank you were there uh other areas of this uh as as we continue and members Abel I might ask you to clarify with all due respect um inasmuch as there was I have a draft cause of draft here's the differences and we say like otherwise I'm good with it I'm willing to understand that is otherwise I'm good with all of Kyle's proposed revisions to the agreement because that would be the later in time draft so in as much as my my things as for example you know uh just to look at something separation severance I have it says this his are the same but there's a few added there's a little bit of added language if you say I'm good with it the added language stays in the draft that's what it was approaching okay just want to make sure there's no misunderstood I mean obviously right but as you go through if there's things that you're saying this is what I want I'm good with what's in there I want to know which there we're talking about Mr Roberts page 4014 uh probably um 7 8 of the way down the page where it's highlighted in blue for the 600 a month I just want to clarify with that Kyle where it says this in incentive payment options shall not apply until after the manager has provided written verification that he has covered by other health insurance now not you specifically but you know that was me in my case and perhaps my spouse has Insurance opportunities available I get added to that policy are we requesting that he actually show that he's paying an equivalent of that much money for his add-on insurance but what are we trying to address there just the fact that he has additional insurance is he um does he have to show that he's paying money for the other insurance which is why we're giving you 600 I just wanted to clarify that the way people might be asking so like when I signed up for it I had to prove that I was covered under my wife's insurance right um I think in providing the documentation it showed the additional payment for that um but the program was designed as an incentive to uh to I guess get an employee to be covered some other by some other means um because I think it's a calculation of the 600 a month was sort of uh a half the amount it might cost to insure that employee okay that's fair that makes sense other questions I think I have a question on um Page Six automobiles the very last sentence there where it says manager however Greece used city-owned vehicle a sedan and good and safe operating condition for long trips in or out of the state of Florida and then there's a random letter H next to it so I think that that probably was intended to be deleted because we don't have a city vehicle I mean the work truck but I don't think that that's something he would drive depends on the means I'm I'm just making sure I'm looking at the language apologies section sub G yeah it kind of looks like the um you know G and H and I something God something was confused there yeah yeah I got mixed fine candle that might have been between the revised drafts I'm not seeing that in mind but it might have been the Vestige of how the the draft two came through um certainly we can I can I will make sure any final draft is is clean I'm looking at it now I think it has to do with how track changes came through yeah I think you're right a sedan and good and safe operating that's a that was Lopes from Kyle's draft I would certainly clean up that element and make sure that if it does capture something um it would probably stop at the repair and fuel costs and eliminate the sentence that begins manager however agrees to and everything after that would be out as it presently reads we're using a personal vehicle do we have any is there any uh mention of required insurance uh it's in there but I don't believe there's a specific insurance requirement in the in the draft just says it has to be insured I think it doesn't have a dollar value and what is our maximum and payout uh for an accident something happens and we're soon uh I'm not saying you're going to do that but I think that that our statutory limitation in tort is two hundred thousand dollars per individual three hundred thousand dollars per incident and and I think that that would should be the requirement for any employee that's using their own vehicle within the city or for City business the miter says it doesn't have to be in the employment contract it's covered elsewhere but well and and what we have here is manager shall be responsible for the payment of insurance fuel maintenance not not mandating the coverage of as a release of the automobile also if he's operating in His official capacity at the time that would likely be within the scope of the city's existing policy through its carrier if he's on official City business and gets in an accident merging onto God forbid onto the onto the road right here and hit somebody because he was going out to respond to a call he's in his official duties in His official scope now if he's on his way home and pulls out different results um but as it relates to driving around town or in on the city's business that's typically within your carrier policy I'm not saying I've read the writers and declarations for your city's policy as an ordinary course in Municipal Insurance the employee employees official acts are covered but if you wish to make it clear that he will have insurance on his vehicle we can certainly mandate that that's not I just don't want our insurance company thinking that we're only driving city-owned vehicles on official City business because that right could create a problem yeah other questions Mr Banker do you have a question no all right is everyone on the same page do we uh do we agree with Mr riefler's version of this contract so will we get one more finished copy to review just you know without any of the side notes and the colors and stuff on there was this is it this is the baby right here as colorful a person as I am yes I will ultimately have a clean document for you and it would be my my intention based on the very little dialogue that has happened here is to put this in a clean copy send it to to to to you and say this is what would be in the next regular meetings agenda items for final approval unless there's some you know and please you are all free to contact me directly if there's a hey Randy I didn't realize between then and now there's this ultimately we'll have to have buy-in and I'll say like oh somebody come with scrivener's errors are not a big concern right now right if we find a misplaced you know an O where there should be an e that stuff happens we can fix it that stuff happens and can be fixed if there's something substantive like we should have addressed this then I'll have a draft and say subject to the added note Mr Roberts had but generally speaking my my intention at this stage is to come with you for a clean um draft at whatever meeting you decide whether you wish to make it a special meeting or a another meeting or your next regularly scheduled meeting in December in two weeks or whatever would it be possible to have that before it comes out on the agenda uh where we just oh yeah I would not spring it on you I I would probably I would hope to have it to you I mean this is simple enough that I think I could have it to you this week okay great maybe my hope and just say you know there's there's that amount of time and and that's also provided and I'm not trying to box you in anything Mr riesler but provided Mr riesler doesn't have added inputs having heard your conversation that as we saw that happen in the past where we thought we were there and then there's oh wait there's one question nothing's done until it's signed um and so I I want to make sure that variable is still recognized okay I'll fight with that approach I have I have a question is there something else I should have it says see Kyle riefler's CV appended here too and I don't see anything I did not provide you his resume his resume was part of the various application materials and and I didn't wish to this one seems like I had enough paper yeah it's in there and I do that in parts of that if there was from an employment law standpoint if we later on find like well it was represented it was these were his qualifications they were not right um or also or if he says you guys had a missing machine on what my background was I never represented that well this is what the contract recognized who we were hiring then another question just general question for the council or is everyone comfortable with a two-year contract when before we were looking for five years this wouldn't be committing us to a full two years is that correct I think her question is in the inverse but correct you're never committed to any amount of time because he's an Atwell employee and he and I are only as good as our next meeting while you have a I think three-year commitment with our firm maybe two years um any next meeting could be my last meeting so yes in that sense it's not a commitment that way it wouldn't be a breach you just have noticed provisions and I'm subject to what your Charter has augmented rights he has in how a dismissal would go I think remember Shirley's question was more to with the last candidate and of course everything is different the last candidate was external it was we don't want you to come here and then leave a year later and so we were very we were tracking towards a longer commitment I think her her question is less less about the commitment and more about the brevity right I mean I'm not a perceived property yeah I for me I you know love to see us go enter into an agreement that like we're kind of in it a little if we're gonna if we're gonna invest some money should we say let's enter a three-year contract if we're investing in some education dollars and those sorts of things so just things to put on the table be if we're trying to get this thing to a final contract agreement I'd like to make sure that we cover all those spaces Mr Roberts I'll be honest when I first saw two years my first feeling was I thought that was short so so I concur I think um especially like you just brought up I mean we want we want Kyle to succeed and I know he will and so we're going to be pumping resources money to help them out in every way we can so we'd hate for him at the end of two years say hey that's pretty cool I'm very marketable now thank you adios so not that you would do that but yeah three years I think would be much better I can go along with four years yeah Mr Banker I think we should do at least three years possibly five nicely I'm happy with two I have no problem with three you know because it's just we can terminate with yeah we can get out of it either side can get out of it at any time so it's sort of a technicality shall I say did he may not be here fine the city may not be here you don't know what's going on with hurricanes but the end of three years or two years and we negotiate right right so I'm fine with three years everybody good with that it's Kyle yes Council agrees that one I would want to take back with my legal and have discussion about said it well I can't give an answer right now I want to take it back and see how it's written out in the contract and I think we're good with either one two or three right so you were good with two for sure right sure yeah and if you're gonna check to see if you're good with three okay yes I I looked at all the previous city manager contracts and I thought you know I mean given um Dr Griffin was a different situation but he uh five years is a very long term and I saw that the the previous city managers were all on a annual basis for Renewal and I thought two years is was good for a renegotiation but um again I'd have to consider it well and let me ask you this which may inform your your decision making um presently the instruction is two years 115 000 salary 115 salary for both years we add a year what then um then at that point we would you be open to considering in year three salary shall increase commensurate with increases to other employees or at X percentage um as I redrafted that that does change a material term that you folks have sort of come to a general agreement about and so we can do subject to his agreement we can do three years and if he doesn't agree we can talk about that um but we can do three years but I want to make sure that I'm capturing your terms up until now salary was stagnant in the turnt contract term now would you want it to be stagnant all three or variable variable after year two I think and three years basically an election it's like yeah I'm looking at the page 14 page 4 of 14 it says manager shall be entitled to an increase in base salary on each anniversary date of employment that's in his draft yeah okay you folks just said orally here was I wanted two years I'm willing to go to his number but I don't want to have an automatic increase I want it to be 115 for year one and year two in a two-year agreement so yes that's what that draft says but based on your notes that's sort of changing the landscape but if Kyle is go okay after he talks with who he needs to talk to then the third year after the second year before the theater year begins we would be amenable to an increase right so he said yeah is that the consensus of the body yes yes absolutely okay not me all right with this economy you're going to freeze a guy's wages for two years that's insulting it's freeze for two years if I may we've doubled his salary frankly he started at 63 000 no more than four months ago now we're talking 115 that's almost doubling the salary nobody here and I see some serious salaries in my business will even come close to that type of a jump within four months he is now our city manager okay he's taking on the responsibilities okay of the city manager that's not doubling his salary that's compensating for what he's doing all right he was double his salary because he was a an apprentice more like okay an assistant he has shown that he can do the job compensate him accordingly any other comments from the counselor all right I think the consensus uh for the most part is uh two years and then uh at the beginning or the end of year two uh would be eligible for a pay increase I think within that two years that would be plenty time to uh to get the training required training and uh and hit some of the Milestones that we're looking for again even uh after the first year there's no raise in the compensation would you still be uh providing me with a annual review I'd like to feed the course yes do you have any other comments Mr riefler not at this time no okay any other comments on this before we move on to the next item just a thank you to the City attorney for you know working us through this process thank you pleasure all right we are now on to uh item three discussion of council members Abel's proposed list now I'm seeing this is broken up and some there uh this is not uh we're not going to discuss everybody that were the most items buys pizza tonight but uh that could be possible the way I'm feeling today is like um no it basically is I was trying to see an idea is we need to communicate better with the citizens too often nobody actually knows what phone calls are made to the mayor or to a councilman or something that was said at a at a chili cook-off whatever there's no list that when a citizen has a thought or an idea that we should have somewhere where yeah there it is we've heard it we all know it's there and there's some work being done on it or there may just say that look we've all talked about it considered it but we can't pursue it at this time it provides us also with a an area or a workout we're going we have a city council in four more years and they come back hey I got this great idea so no take a look at the work list we've considered this back then maybe situation has a change we want to re-look at it I don't want to scare you away I mean these are just some of the things that have been receiving through emails and phone calls I just wanted to show you a format for it because what I'd like to do is for city council issues if you look at page six and seven I just broke down the Strategic goals so we could put those with issues that come forward on the agenda same here with if you see items you know grab any one of those items try to put okay it it hits goal number Four B you know playground decision or walking easement breakout again just trying to allow it so we are looking at the Strategic plan we're listening to Citizens citizens know that we've considered their inputs so much that there's a working list and as things do progress I mean they're showing a area where we have done the following that was one of the comments they asked well how do we know that items that we come up with are being addressed um in fact later on the program we're talking about answers to questions um you can nobody in this world can actually answer every single question that could come up you know the answers in military yes sir no sir um and no excuse sir and the final one I don't know but I'll find out and this is the I don't know but I'll find out and the citizens can go there you know online and say okay hey they heard me here's what they're doing and sometimes it kind of helps us as a memory jogger so that's what I wanted to to show you and give you a kind of a fleshed out idea so you have an idea how kind of it looks like kept electronically so if I came three days three years from now and said well what did we do on storm water I can search this document or wherever it's posted and it will give me all those right the record the recommendation would be I'm not trying database or anything but simple word is enough and can be maintained on the city web page basically at the front block you just go okay I want to see the citizens concern page here it is Click read down the road here's what you know maybe some cases look somebody's already asked the question and here's the status I just didn't know about it right the answer is right there yeah Council as you folks consider this issue another resource now this is more of a capital Ally thing but some communities have their minutes and agendas um indexed in a way that they're searchable and so if you search the word X that will show you whether it's an agenda item from 2012 you know it's a year starting whatever's in the database right but that's another way to rather than creating a new record say our existing records capture you know that's a whole nother thing on the seller and all these other and that's just one player in the marketplace but they sort of players that have those platforms that's something else um as you wish to consider resources another way that communities handle hey has the word rental been used the word stop sign been used and you just search it and then it goes yeah I mean that's why I try to approach it this way where they can actually see the objective linked to a strategic plan outline and it's really based off a question hey uh recommend emails names of all council members would be placed on agendas for all to see without going to the website okay you know we the counselor likes that you know later on I mean we can work through these things but they can see here's what's been done um search engines are difficult because not everybody knows or has a good vocabulary of words that can be used in a search engine some people understand line but some other people have five different words that mean that and can get a better search result so when I see this what I what I'm hearing you say is uh like for instance the uh emails you had a resident say hey I can't find the emails for counselors so they're struggling with even that simple task on our website yeah so then will they be able to search this that's why it should be a search you just go to that page and just scroll down through it and read it I mean you can search it I mean you can do web searches it just go to the top click web search and it'll search the text for you in some cases Google will actually start pulling up these results but it's just easier in a Word document just go down through the word document and anybody can say suggested I mean all of you are out and about talking to people and just added on hey bomb hey uh mayor you know hear this and then we can go through it occasionally you know every three months hey heard this let's work this issue doesn't our uh WordPress site have a search function in it now it does and it's pretty generally you know you gotta hit the top toolbar and it basically will find any uh you know use of that word in any of the pages and it'll bring those pages up in order um I don't know if it always works because I go to it often yes and I can't ever find anything I have to go through all the tabs on the web on the web page yeah and the tabs can be very hard to navigate yes if you just don't know the tabs you have to know where you're going but yeah yeah it seems to me that a search a search box on the the website should it no matter what the word is if you type it in there it should find every instance of that word on the entire website in my experience it has um but I would have to if you want to give me some examples that maybe I could try to but in context I was looking for the Strategic plan or I was looking for something but it was something so just commonplace that I searched it I couldn't find it I ended up calling Lynn and I think it was missing on the website but still you know there's and then there's and there was something else I was searching one day and I could not find it so it's happened twice to me so yeah and I brought this up also coming from the first meeting we ever had the mirror asked you know give me a list and everybody's kind of thinking from oh God you know just provide the list a search engine really doesn't provide the functionality that this would because again you're you're putting on a cleaning language hey uh recommend all agenda items be strange you know with a strategic plan ID okay what did you guys do we did the following right item closed because as long as whatever is posted uh on this site this search engine it's public meeting data and nothing else absolutely uh then I I think that's fine but we still have to have the the searching or the some sort of a database to present the information with I mean they could build one but I know where you're going with that one it's like yeah that would be nice would would it make sense for actual searches when we finally do have a part-time clerical person that that maybe we have them keep a monthly list that's then distributed at either work session or council meeting and then becomes part of the minute so that we can shoot them the email hey objective is that an objective for me each one of us can give feedback as you get comfortable yeah also or are these obviously they have your name on them but you haven't changed but these aren't 100 accurate objectives because the majority hasn't agreed to move forward on them that's right right so there has to be so we probably just need to go through the list do a quick yeah we agree with this no we don't agree and they may not be in the right format I mean you got to give somebody a solution for the kind of get their hands around it go on okay now okay I see what let's change this yeah well we started going through this a while back and I don't have a problem doing a few of these with every work session just to see if this is something we want to move forward with um I have no problem we're we're cruising right along I have no problem starting with the first few goals oh okay if you would like to uh open discussion before we do that I'm gonna call on Mr Banker yeah um I've been on our Muni code many times uh our website and our search tab I think is pretty good I mean I just went on it now while I'm listening and I pulled up some of the things that were mentioned at the uh during this discussion and every one of them resonated right away with a pop-up and a four a follow-up uh page um I I guess I guess I am I guess what I don't understand is the uh the emails that from citizens to council members are they going to be exposed is that what you're looking to do all Council will get anyone that wants to see anybody's emails will be able to see them that's already the case under chapter 119 if they're requested just because if they're requested that's true yeah I'm talking about now they're going to be publicized I don't think that's that's the uh the goal here I I don't think that's that's it at all I think it's it's basically um Mr zabel is trying to establish goals uh something long-term that uh of things that we would like to accomplish and then we just uh we we uh post our progress for each one of the action items just see where we are have we gotten started and when's the estimated they uh yeah What's it gonna cost um because right now that's there's very little of that available we have the construction projects that are being shown but there there may be The Apartment project or something like that uh Dave yes question this is sort of a question for um our attorney do we have an issue with um the Sunshine Law if as council members we respond to something else that somebody else put on another council member put on there not in a public meeting the plan was that would be presented in a public meeting that's what that's what we that's what I was saying as it gets delivered to us as part of our agenda items yeah but I think it's already happened a little bit like it's historical data but when Mike has put out something and said here's something that came up and this is the way I feel about it I think that could have caused an issue I wasn't actually going to necessarily bring that up but I think I don't know how Mike's sometimes like 17 times has challenged me on something so I'm giving one back here so that uh yeah so when he comes out in an email that goes to everybody and says um this is some information I got some citizens asked me about this I think this might be a great idea and I'm for this so now just like this young lady is bringing up here I don't know if that's you know he's telling us how he feels how he would vote for a particular thing so I'm going to um unpack that because there's about four or five questions in the various comments that have been made first point if the city has an official Running document of its task items and Endeavors and historically um cataloging it um there's not to me a sunshine law issue there provided there is a a captive um set of who the authors are and those are not council members me meaning if that document exists on the website the clerk changes it not any one of you can organically go in there and say oh I want to do this now I don't know what I think we should do that that's what your meeting agendas are for um so I think that sort of model where there's just an archival document is not archival is it's capturing past conduct to address the point of what about us taking positions on issues that may reach other council members there is nothing in the sunshine law that prevents you per se from running out onto the beach right now and saying I am totally against condos over for stories tall any more than there is about you saying it on your Facebook page or otherwise in a general hey whoever wants to hear me can hear me situation the challenge with Communications as between each of you whether it is I know you're on my newsletter distribution or I just send a targeted email reply all to something Randy sent to the council is the potential for the violation it's more of a Prudence than a restriction you I you will not you would be hard-pressed to find something that says it is per se a violation for me to speak in your direction the problem is that you as a person and and possibly more even so as a politician are going to be inclined to respond um and that's where the meeting of the minds occurs whether that's a what I would joke as a Monday night Merlot Manifesto or a Friday night hey aren't we all so great somebody responding no we're not all so great you're actually kind of trash and now we start having this meeting of the minds and that's really where where the problem happens and so you've in in um public meetings jurisprudence you see this idea of the first bite of the Apple um where well if I sent it first I'm good but the moment you reply you create a violation well you're kind of setting each other up for failure that way um especially where you're taking stances because inevitably somebody's going to no matter how many times I admonish all of you that reply all is not your friend and always be mindful well that's in the past yes but it has the potential to come back before you um so the simply the fact that something happened in the past is an idea well I'm just talking about what we did yeah but we're talking about what we did to determine whether we need to do something different in the future um and so that's where that kind of becomes a problem so the short answer is a one-way communication is not advisable because it is the foundation for a violation sure but it is not necessarily by it by and unto itself a violation barring certain circumstances if members able send something to member Notaro one way but it says Brock Lloyd told me to tell you well now we've got a whole other issue um so you know the it depends factor of being a lawyer will always say like I needed more facts but on its on its face an archival document not a problem newsletter Facebook blast I spoke to the paper and said we need more bike Lanes in our community that's not a sunshine live violation because the times published your position but once you start going back and forth it is okay and that's where the first one that speaks silences everyone silences everyone and you'll see this we've advised we've advised this in others if you've been to these training companies like well what about when we all get invited to the Baptist Church on a Sunday to talk about the the our changing community usually your advised one sit in different places and then the moment one of you says you're right this community needs this everybody else cannot touch that issue um okay thanks so the obviously is this goal number one is to figure out some way to post our progress on current projects current and future projects but it's not a sounding post for any individual correct council member in fact if possible it'd be great if somebody in the city maintained it we just sent them an email and go I'd like to add on and see the the problem that I have with this is that these are not our projects they're they're the city's projects which ultimately lands in the city managers lap and he's responsible for it uh so really it's uh it seems that it would be more of a an administrative function to host progress on all all projects that are going on and I think for the most part you are doing that I'm trying to and I can elaborate on that list I think my uh city manager report has grown over the last couple meetings but if you know more more direction from Council on projects that were taking up then I'll just keep following up on you know perhaps uh if your city manager report you had an update during the meeting but you had a living document that you maintain on the website that may be easier and then because nothing's ever dropping off you can Market complete and it becomes historical data and moves down the list but that way people can look and see if we've already if we've already accomplished something that they're wanting they always ask what's next actually if we can't I mean I'd like to go through the list but you know we got a lot of stuff here and I just defer to the other items on the work session tonight we can go through this list at a later work session well it's only again is everyone else uh good with that yes yeah yes okay all right uh so let's uh move on to item number four placed on the agenda by council member Bankers discussion of council member Banker's proposed resolution for Council to respond to comments from citizens of Bellaire Beach on non-agenda items Mr Banker take it away well I don't know if I have to now that I just heard that we're so concerned about citizens uh or citizens concerns and um the resolution speaks for itself a citizen gets up addresses Counsel on a non-agenda item and we tell them thank you and they have to sit down and hopefully a council member an hour later two hours later four hours later Dorner city council comments will comment all this resolution does is provide if this council is serious about communicating with its citizens they'll do it on the spot and instantaneously and not make the citizens wait or call or email later thank you Mr Banker I'd like to make the first comment on this I I jotted some notes down this afternoon about this so I'll just I'll read them to you and uh and everyone can make up their own minds instead of some comments are designed to give citizens the opportunity to speak freely on any topic they desire however agenda items are there to steer the meeting if any council member would like to respond to non-agenda items they are free to do so during Council comments or by email phone calls or in person after the meeting citizen comments were placed at the beginning of the meeting for the convenience of the citizens but their comments do not supersede a planned agenda this community just witnessed three years of poorly ran meetings in the last election I promised that I would fix our meetings so far I've kept that promise and I have no intention of changing it back that's my comments anyone else sure oh sorry go ahead I agree with you you know if someone if they have something that they want the council to discuss at the beginning when it says are we going to approve the agenda and they could say I'd like to add something to the agenda and then we put it on the agenda if it's not on the agenda council members don't have time to prepare for it to you know shall I say do their homework um I I would not be in favor of um you know opening up a citizen's comment to free open discussion of the council thank you Mr Sable uh yeah I'm in agreement with you because you can take a three-minute comment and if you had a council member respond to that they can basically filibuster the entire evening uh back and forth and it's not only a venue for for comment but for abuse and I feel very strongly we should not be abusing the citizens of this city period they have a comment time and frankly if you think you've got all the answers immediately you're a lot smarter than I am and I got the degrees and the experience to prove it I won't answer a question straight up you look get the correct answer for the people once Always Forever and that's not just you you don't play stump the council here this procedure that we have worked out works very well we are not abrogating our first amendment freedoms because we can email call I do it all the time time I had a few emails before I came here tonight so we need to follow a structure and that's the agenda is approved I appreciate all the statements made so far in full agreement with you thank you Mr Roberts nothing to add except that I did receive a couple of phone calls that's not a lot maybe three of people that had read the agenda ahead of time and they had expressed that they were very much against that thank you vice mayor Shirley I had the same I had a couple of people residents reach out to me and and say they were against us uh considering this resolution and you know it could for all the reasons you mentioned this could be it could just be a slippery slope and we lose control of the meeting once again so I'm not in favor of this resolution thank you um Mr Banker I see your hand is raised uh it's never an embarrassment to tell the citizens we don't have an answer for you tonight but we'll get back to you okay as soon as we haven't qualified answer what we do now is we just thank them for showing up and that's it if these um people that are calling council members saying that they're against respond being responded to uh by their counsel that's very very confusing to me that people would give up their rights to have addressed the council and then have the council return their comments all right I'm gonna I'm gonna respond where's America go I'm going to respond to you on that and give you an example of uh why the way that we're doing it actually does work a gentleman showed up and he complained about not having enough park benches at the beach accesses um I gave him a call the next day we had a conversation about it Mr riefler got involved with it this was all from a one-way comment that he made he's gonna get his benches in the accesses we're working on it right now and it's all because a citizen came made a comment no he didn't like not getting an answer immediately but he was very happy whenever he found out that we were going to do something about it so um on top of that the meeting ran efficiently we wrapped it up at a decent amount of time not 11 o'clock at night and uh and and we're getting we're getting things done and Mary may I add that um because we don't respond immediately that doesn't mean that we don't respond they're getting responses it just it may not happen right at that meeting and maybe after the meeting it might be the next day but the citizens are getting responses any other comments from the council sir your hands right um what you just cited about the work the park benches is a perfect example what I'm saying a reply to him saying we will look into this and get back to you justify this resolution but if you review the tape it was your time is up um and that was it now I commend you for going the next step forward and addressing this but what I'm saying is a simple courtesy of telling the citizens I will look into this or this can't be done or I'm not sure about this but we'll look into it for you that's what this resolution is about and it's really hard to believe citizens don't want that Mr Roberts um not that you need any defense Mr Mayor but I know I have heard on more than a couple occasions where you in fact have provided that information to somebody at the podium and well you didn't just say thank you very much the times I think you said thank you very much where it was more of a case where somebody stood up and made some statements about something but where people were asking a question I'm confident that you always handled that very professionally explain to them thank you very much for the information and the question we will take that into consideration and somebody will be working on this and getting back to you so I've heard that many times thank you any other comments on this topic sure if I can add to that uh yes uh thank you very much I mean we've all appreciated basically the change in leadership that's uh happened with the election in fact you know people overwhelmingly voted for this way of uh acting on medians but uh also to add that during the last meeting we had somebody specifically asking where do you stand on the contract I thought you voted for it and our attorney was able to basically do a brief at the end explaining where we were in the situation but the key was you got to stick to the agenda otherwise like I said if I got five people out there if I bring five of my buddies I can physically filibuster this entire meeting if it was one of those give and take sessions and you can't do that you have to attend to the matters of the citizenry and again thank you very much I really appreciate it it's a better breath of fresh air we all appreciate it and so did citizens thank you all right uh that being said let's move on to uh let's see here item number five discussion of Code Enforcement survey results and a plan for action this was placed on the agenda by interim city manager reefler thank you mayor um I want to go over to some of the results that came back from our survey uh that we sent out to the residents it was during the month of October and uh we went over this as a group in the code enforcement team that we put together and um kind of came up with a direction to move forward and I'd like to go over some of the results and then give us or give you uh an idea of what we were thinking and what direction we're going um start out with uh the first question uh pretty straightforward but it was you know something to point out that we we did get 47 of people who responded actually put their name um as opposed to being anonymous um the next question kind of covered where in the City by Street um you know the people were where they lived and where they were answering these questions and when we looked at the distribution over the whole city you know it was pretty spread out so we thought like that represented a pretty good uh selection of the city then uh when we got to uh the third question uh we we broke it down and we had the uh 23 of of the possible code violations that we thought um we wanted to get an opinion on and we asked uh the participant you know overall where they were they not concerned slightly concerned moderately concerned or very concerned and um these are the results as such um we'll come back to this you know different uh layout that I went over um then we we asked the question in a different way we asked um you know of of these uh possible code violations if you had to pick two what you're most concerned and what would those be just to see if we capture some different data from that question uh then we had another one that addressed um how often in your area of Bellaire Beach are you seeing these violations so they wanted to know the frequency that they're observing these violations that we're bringing up and um more so just to get an idea of of what what is being noticed not so much uh what their concern level is but are they seeing it you know are they not seeing it so then we mixed it up and we did uh we showed some images and the images didn't print out on these results but they were some different um shots of people's yards and um you know one had a minimum amount a minimal amount of clutter maybe just a couple toys or or some some tools left out and then some were um a lot more like trash and uh you know just items left in the yard we were trying to gauge what the perception of um what people consider to be an outdoor storage nuisance and uh these results actually showed that almost every image um some a good amount considered an actual uh storage units and so that it kind of told us that it uh the Aesthetics of what the property looks like is important to our residents and they and they they do have uh kind of I guess a smaller tolerance for for what's left out uh the next question was the uh can I get the feel of the the current code enforcement measures um be it are they appropriate in your mind are they excessive or are they too lenient and then the last question was the whole um do you think code enforcement should be uh reactive or proactive so the proactive would be focusing on you know going out patrolling uh educating educating as much as possible to to get Alliance throughout the throughout the city or the reactive would be more on the uh you know you know this complaints coming in or that this you know this has been noticed now let's go react to it so coming back to question three when our our group looked over all these results and and we kind of discussed what what jumped out at us um question three jumped out at us and we thought that we wanted to focus on what residents identified as being most concerning to them and uh I broke this result uh table out by by taking out you know the not concerns slightly concerned and just putting the very concerned and then what we did is uh we put them in a rank order and uh I highlighted the top ten just to kind of show what what we got back as being most concerning to the residents and then we did the same thing with the uh the consistency or the level or the frequency of the violations that are being noticed because we wanted to know what you know what what are they seeing and you know what is jumping out at them that they're seeing in their neighborhood um so we just have an idea what what the which code violations are the highest volume of what they're observing so I did the exact same thing I I got it down to the most consistently column and then highlighted the highest ranking violations so using that data we decided that we wanted to create a quadrant system to best illustrate the results um where we have quad one in the upper left which is is the most or the very concerning or very concerned by the residents and the and the constantly occurring um and then over at quad two top right it's very concerning but they're not seeing it as often and then in Quad three the bottom left it's the not so concerned slightly more moderate but constantly occurring and then Quattro four is the you know slightly concerned and uh not seeing it that often and we thought that was a good way to lay out um to to just to depict you know um and and draw our assumptions so when in Quad one which is going to be the resonance think it's um very important that these violations don't occur and they're cut they're constantly seeing them for as far as code enforcement moving forward we feel this is where our Focus needs to be um because it's important to them and they're seeing it so we need to make an effort to to limit this from occurring but to to try and gain Satisfaction by Code Compliance in the city um so the assumption is we want to make this our focal point and I made a note on there because we did get a lot of comments and this is uh this could be based on the survey design um about the street parking but we came to the conclusion that most of the street parking that residents are seeing is is going to be the contractors um during the the business day um so we want to focus on the off hours so that we're stopping the illegal parking on the street and not so much the legal parking that we have every day on on the streets um moving forward when uh when we resurvey the residents to see to be able to measure um if we're meeting our goals I I was going to clarify more so so that the question was probably answered more accurately so quadrant two was the very concern but sometimes are never occurring um one thing you would you saw on the uh on the graphs was the that's where the short-term rental was much higher than any of the other violations and that falls under that that quadrant so it's it may we may have it down where it's not being seen as happening as much but when it does happen people care a lot about it um so our assumption and and our and our Focus moving forward is is whenever we see these we know that they're they're important to the to the resident so whenever it's seen it needs to be stopped and then our quadrant three and that I considered um to contain a lot of the Aesthetics in the community and we found that the the it may not be quite as concerning as some of the other violations um like say the rodents or the short-term rentals but it is something that people are seeing it's constantly occurring and in this case we think that it's it's code violations that we need to do we need to address because they're codes they're there for a reason um and we need to do it more in a methodical manner of you know once a week driving around and um documentation and focusing on you know writing down where all these violations are occurring and over time making sure that they're less consistent and then the last quadrant is the slightly moderately concerned it's um never sometimes occurs and you know these things and the residents are highly concerned about them and they're not seeing it that often so there's still code violations they still need to be addressed but we've we want to address these as they come in as opposed to focusing our efforts um specifically towards these codes thank you very much Council yep um what I noticed here what stood out was first of all I'm a data geek I love this and I'm assuming councilman Roberts had part to play in the design of this nothing to do with it Kyle did the whole thing both of you guys I love this so take one of those 17 down this is a good guy uh but I noticed it pops right out quad 4 the least the worst we really don't look at it is a licensed handyman and that's been the whole uh priority for the existing code enforcement so what you guys demonstrated with data is like we're going up the wrong tree that code enforcement should be focusing on the quad one so I have a by the way again I love this this is this is good stuff yeah it's a great report the code of us enforcement officer was was happy to get this I think don't you say this helps me a lot now I now I know what I need to do so it's nice as opposed to you know I think he had a lot of thoughts in his head when he's driving the city right yeah he was trying to see you know 30 things at one time some of which perhaps we found out that the citizens aren't that concerned about it they know what's happening their wish it didn't happen but it's not you know it's not the top five things that they're concerned about so so it was great you know Kyle put out the uh questionnaire and I think a lot of people responded and um that was excellent we do this annually so so I have a couple questions regarding this though what do I found interesting is the rodent issue and I think the city probably needs to take some action there I'm setting bait boxes I actually have a guy coming tomorrow to set three more bait boxes I already have four in my yard I was standing out front with a dog yesterday and at night one ran I was just telling my neighbor how I set bait boxes and here comes this rat right right behind me she goes there goes one right there because of my dog and it said it can't win in the bush you know and I figured with the dog out there it wouldn't come out but it didn't bother the rat at all and then it came back and sat under the truck and just looked at us so that's it's an issue it's a it's a real issue and I don't know no one in my next door area has fruit trees or anything that's attracting them so I'm not sure why we're having an issue but clearly it's an issue and I think you know dealing with the private property that's going to be a piece on the the education and pointing out things that you know what rodents would hard like what they're going to Harbor into and then hopefully bringing attention to the residents that if they're seeing um areas for them to live or a lot of rodents that they can no just so you know they were under the hood of my car and shoot up some wires so I had I have my two years yeah I had sensor issues and you know it's not even cold what's gonna happen when it's cold out you know it's going to be a real issue so a thousand bucks yeah I I didn't spend nearly that but only because the dealership wouldn't get me in right so I went to a mechanic I think this uh squirrels are Infamous for the car engine areas as well you know eating up and I guess the squirrel is a rodent but I think the biggest um I have a neighbor next to me has beautiful fruit trees and of course he hates the fruit rats so he periodically puts out traps for them because he doesn't want to just poison them and have them die in his attic or something like that but he told me one uh one week he got 16. and I've seen him go across our fence at first I thought they were squirrels and I was like oh that's not a score then after the storm they came through the other day I was cleaning my pool and I was scooped down there just to get leaves and stuff and got a little rant so he didn't make it he got in the pool and drowned but I don't know so you're saying city-wide there's not anything that we can that the city can do because it's private property is that is that your assumption outside of the education piece um I mean we could make recommendations based on what professionals say and and possibly um companies that could be used but yeah um if if they do see something um that they're identifying as a home to rodents if they're making us aware and it is a violation um it considered a nuisance that we want to act on it well maybe even in our parks and whatnot we could control the city owned property right sure yes and we and we do have uh you know rodents control in this whole property right here and I can I can get some insight into our Parks if there if there is a like I know there is that Park on there's a park on hibiscus and there's a couple banana trees on it so that's you know a good opportunity to have Rats on that property so out although we should probably look at Citywide oh I'm thinking some of this goes back to just uh your your standard landscape you know what how much clutter do you have around your house it's sort of like the coyote problem also if they have a place to hide right they're they're gonna do it uh but uh so I'm I'm curious how did uh deputy clapka how did what did he think about this list he likes the um that's backed up by data he likes that um we're identifying what our focuses are going to be and uh he it gives them a chance that if there is a question on why he's drawing attention to this violation he likes the fact that he can point to that we we've reached out and heard back does he feel like his directives are more clear now than they were before he does and um again with this we wanted to get a consensus from you over the direction that we're going in um as as a body and then uh we want to share the results in our Direction with the residents and then from there um start taking action and then our and our goal is to follow up survey in a year to so that we can measure where we're at Lynn Gunn would be very happy to hear that yes he likes the metrics and and we did learn a lot from the first survey we're not expert survey writers um but we obviously learned things that we can design it better in the future to capture what we're looking for good and will this be on the City website posted on the website okay perfect are there any action items from here on this I mean okay well it looks like the action items are the bullet points underneath each one of the quads under the assumptions of them this is a focal point stop when observed uh it sounds like Quad 4 is uh rely on neighbors to uh to report issues more than anything um I'm I'm guessing that uh if the deputy sees an obvious uh violation uh someone's out there with a bunch of saws and a crew he's probably going to check on him just to make sure that they're they're I'm here they're uh they're permitted but uh I think that this is this is going to give him more to do than less right and and of course like if you know somebody has a permit for something um replacing a window and then he's seeing loads of papers being taken into the backyard that's something we want to know about because we don't want someone turning the whole backyard into an impervious service so you know there's importance behind every code but this is more of a a way to draw to draw up our objectives and our focus of where we're putting our time and energy I understand Council and I'm confident that Kyle will do a great job he's like he said he's going to follow up with a letter that's going to go to everybody that he sent the questionnaire to because I think it's important that you know we've all been subjected to that where you fill out some type of a questionnaire and you never hear anything about it and that's that just messes you up for the future it's like well the next time I get one of these I'm just I'm not I'm tossing it so he'll do a great job with that let everybody know thank you for doing it and here's what we determined from your input and here's what we're going to do about that and so that'll be great um I mean I don't I don't have any question that we need to review that before Kyle sends that out so he's just going to send that out to the people in an email and a little side note uh our code enforcement officer his Sergeant was there his Sergeant right yeah so Sergeant Jason stibbert yeah so he said he was going to become the most hated man in his community now because he liked this so much he's going to go back to his next HOA meeting and challenge the entire President and Vice President of the HOA people and say you're going to do one of these so that we can let you know what we think is important in our community so immediately felt like he's going to be cool not liked anymore I think it'll be uh very beneficial to everyone uh whenever some of these problems are resolved and we're not having to make constant phone calls to complain yeah yeah absolutely I promised Laura that once this thing got implemented her phone would never ring again I like it that's a good one that's your foreign thank you this is a very good report any other comments before we move on oh all right so now we are up to number six discussion of 805 Harbor Drive tree inspection and current tree codes placed on the agenda by council member bankard Frank take it away I believe it's actually 804 Arbor Drive um I brought this up at the last council meeting um I would like to see this Council direct the city manager to enforce section 2234 duty of property owners when it speaks in section B about trees and hedges encroaching or otherwise affecting any neighboring properties which this tree that we've I've hammered continuously to counsel for the last probably five to six months is doing so with it residents actually presenting uh costs and damage that the street occurred on his property or from from the street occurred on his property 22.31 in definitions clearly says danger falling agent and changing properties on the right of way of any tree that interferes with utility services there's Utility Services on here we've had now two reports from an artist that this tree is going to fail what I don't know what the holdup is is what I'm saying actually I disagree the latest arborist report said it is no danger feeling uh can you point out where you see it's uh on that second number I believe at the end of that I don't have that I'm I'm traveling this week and I don't have that with me but I sent one from uh Al Mayberry who does clear waters Ian went out and inspected the tree I believe that last report actually does say that that it's going to fail yeah if I could uh the actual quote is here and this is uh not cherry picking uh people but quote is the likelihood of failure for the limbs is improbable in normal weather conditions for the inspection period time removal one year the overall risk rate you put this tree is moderate on a scale of low moderate high and extreme consequences of failure are severe and the likelihood of failure and impact is somewhat likely in weather conditions that are typical in the area and again it does an apply in severe weather but the key again it said they said it's moderate and likely failure problems is improbable we also have to remember that this is not that person's property yeah ir2 looked at it um previews given that second report from somebody that we contracted is so different from the one that was contracted from one of the neighbors we really need to at least bring in the owner of the property Mike I've asked I asked our Council to direct our City attorney to write a strong letter about that uh that failed and I was told we couldn't do anything like that and then the next month um was brought up at a council meeting that we should be doing something about this or do an inspection on all the trees but you just you just read the letter about consequence of fail um severe failure or something in that letter which I don't have the actual report yes Services now the actual report that you have in front of you okay was done by a visual in the easement Mr Mayberry did it right on site knocked on the uh had a free sounding device um went out there and uh addressed the trees uh and trunk and he says it's only a matter of time of failure so you have one that did that more or less sustained Mr Mayberry's findings that did it 10 feet from the site and then you have another one from an well-defined arborist who says this tree will fail now our code clearly says danger of falling on adjacent property or trees that become hazardous to neighboring properties you were there when that citizen brought up the damage that was pulled from that tree all right what more do you need Mr riefler would you like to comment on this uh yes uh going back um I do recall the first report um that that report was um I guess solicited by a resident in the area and they they did go on some private property and um the reason for doing the uh second report was that I was looking for an objective report um from from a tree contractor that I selected and and to to to get a take of something that we could use to prove if there was a violation or not and um I wanted uh when I got the report back you know to the best of his ability which was a level one um you know assessment um based on what the property he could go to that's the extent of what we could do and that's the extent of what we could do to any tree that's on private property in the city um and I got this report back and um based on this report um and I kind of I I took some the terms that were used in the report from the ISA manual and and how they put together these uh these assessments and um you know under the treaty effects it it says the likelihood of fail failure is um improbable and that's with the crowns and branches so there's no problem there um when we get to the trunk which um which is the main concern um it reached a two out of four which is it's possible um and you know when we're talking about failure you got the improbable you got possible you got probable and you got imminent and um when we're talking about failure and then we're looking back at our code and it defines a hazard it has it as tree it's you know it says shall mean any tree that is injured a terminally disease or dead so we know it's injured uh we can't prove it's terminally disease based on our report but then it says and in danger of falling on adjacent property um you know when you when you go back to the report and he's and he says that uh you know the consequence of failure is severe and um that the likelihood of impact on the target area is high you know those those are um you know ex they're four out of fours but that is talking about um pretty much any tree in the city would be ranked for that just based on the location of the city how densely populated we are so I just wanted to put that in perspective um it does have it is capable of falling on adjacent property here right away but that doesn't mean that it's in danger because we're talking about failure so in summary what I'm trying to say is by looking at his report looking at the terminology the way he wrote it up I'm not seeing that that closer to the imminent danger that I would like if I was going to enforce our code for a violation thank you very much Mr Moore do you have any comments on this I'll tell you what I'm gonna I'm gonna hold your thoughts for one second let's take about three minutes because I see people fidgeting around I have a question though yeah I do need to take a break but then I want to perform random speaks up I want to okay ask the question when you sat down here is there is there anything fun we sat down there was there information you can hear about that there's nothing about the tree was that in the original packet no that was from previous yeah okay I don't have any information about them I forgot to bring my stuff oh okay I can't okay foreign all right we're back uh now Mr Mora you were about referring to Jody Shirley as what I was council member or vice mayor Shirley had a comment first yeah I just have a question is the tree standing today yes okay so we've been through two major storms that report says that it may have consequences in a major storm I don't remember the exact verb as you just used but the tree's Still Standing so chances are the tree is not a problem it doesn't you know it doesn't have a health issue if it because there were trees in my neighborhood that fell over um palm trees maybe a little different recent storm yes yeah yeah yeah yeah and lots of palm fronds all over the place um so I think the palm trees are a greater risk of causing damage than this tree one and two I have a problem with us considering going on private property and removing a tree without owner authorization so I'm just had to say those two things before we heard from Randy that's it thank you thank you vice mayor Shirley Mr Mora um so I think there's a fundamental misunderstanding as to what is and is not occurring maybe perhaps I can resolve it your city manager is tasked with enforcing your code um your city manager read to you the definition of a hazardous tree and said it shall mean any tree that is injured terminally diseased or dead and in danger of falling on adjacent property or the right-of-way and as said that his interpretation says that in danger is not necessarily the same mean as capable because capable would mean any tree could just based on your property line most trees are capable of Falling Towards one property line or another your issue is not one of your code and as much as when we tabled this discussion or said let's move it to a workshop it was well let's talk about what our code needs if your code was to do anything I I don't I think that it's would be if you wish to change the definition of hazardous tree to have certain objective criteria grounded in the terminology arborist use that might get us to less of a debate on one one or more people feeling it is a hazardous tree one or more people feeling it isn't and ultimately what you have here is your managers looked at your code and says I see this I hear people's concerns I'm not saying there's no concern I just he doesn't believe that it is a violation of your code as your code is written and he is unwilling to prosecute it at this time based on his discretion alone if you wish for it to be um adjudicated uh you could either change your code to and say well it does not just to meet this one tree but in a way that will capture future instances if while I advise against it if you wish to tell them we would like to see this matter as a body we'd like to see this prosecuted and let the magistrate decide if it is or isn't I advise against giving him that kind of Direction because well then we start to get into what your role is and the enforcement side and that's again I have my advice you guys do what you wish um the the there was another question in there um so to be clear manager ruizler's not saying I your code doesn't make sense to me saying I don't think it oh um I don't think it's a violation and as much as we're talking about going on private property that's not that that at least from where I'm sitting that would not be the process at first now you're giving them notice they have an opportunity to challenge it you would go to the magistrate find that it is in fact the Hazardous tree if it was prosecuted it would not be he deems it in a violation and on Monday and on Tuesday we're out there with trucks it is their property they are entitled to do process rights um and and and their property rights being mailed and if they wish to proceed and defend that's something else the other thing that's sort of being lost in this conversation and I'm not I've not researched it because it's not my client now my role is the private property owners potentially having their own causes of action and their own private recourse outside of the city's code enforcement um regime if they so wish to pursue that and and I don't that would be for them to determine um I I don't know but right now mostly what we have is a private property dispute absent your enforcement official binding a violation worth prosecuting and I went with uh I went with Kyle uh we spoke to the surrounding homeowners we did not approach the tree we stood on public property the street and we observed yes it's ugly at the base um the top was green the tree was standing firm uh it looked like there were some roots that were exposed but I I think Kyle and I both determined that we did not have the mechanism in place to actually inspect the tree to determine if there was anything beyond it's just an ugly tree that's big and scary um and and that's that's kind of where we were left um the in an ordinary code enforcement typically you don't have absent consent or some other exigency you don't have the ability to enter on private property and code enforcement you can get inspection warrants and that those have been needed even in hoarder house situations and the like where you go to the court and say nobody seems to have been here for 20 years those rats is all this but we want to go in we know that it's we can tell from the street it's not being kept but we want to go substantiate our violation you get an inspection warrant from the court um so I don't want to suggest you that there's no way I don't know that the court would would give it stat on this but we if that's the desire of the administration um that's something we can pursue another uh item that we discussed was the possibility of the city approaching the homeowner and saying hey uh we we would like to take it down but then we were afraid it would be setting a precedence to everyone who had a crappy tree in their yard and why aren't you cutting my tree down and so you want to treat everybody fairly and and equally and with we just never could come up with a good solution uh for for this tree that may or may not be problematic um as uh vice mayor Shirley stated it's now survived two major storms and did not come down yes it's ugly and just like any other tree it's going to shed in high winds and I think that that's what's happening it's up high it starts shedding whenever the wind blows and it lands on bird cages and causes problems um I I don't I don't have a solution for it um and I I don't think I don't think anyone here does um Mr Banker uh is is asking that we in fact his hand is raised Mr Banker uh yeah I have to disagree with it you Mr Mayor and the vice mayor that we didn't just survive two major storms uh we were we were blessed that those two make that one major storm bypassed us where we only had Winds of maybe 40 or 50 miles an hour the last storm um by the time it hit us I think the top wins were under 50. um and if you I I was able to pull up the letter because I did email it to one of the residents when I got it I want to read this um the overall risk rating for this tree is moderate on a scale of low moderate high and extreme the consequences of failure are severe and the likelihood of failure and impact is somewhat likely in weather conditions that are typical in the area the risk reading does not apply in severe weather such as hurricanes we haven't had a hurricane Force win in this area okay so we we thank God we have it all right but again going back to the code of ordinances we have I believe every right under 2231 and 2234 to notify that owner that there's a possible violation that this tree needs to be addressed and I think if the owner got that letter they would do something a council and Frank wasn't it at the last meeting was it was it the uh fire chief that was talking about they removed the tree and you're asking them how did they do that I guess what was his answer I don't remember they said it was leaning towards the uh roadway okay now this one's leaning towards the easement which our code completely says easement um look I I look I think a strong letter from our City attorney is you know is is a remedy that would probably resolve this and I don't think our City attorney should be writing a letter I mean this isn't coded I'll tell you it's not without precedent to write a hey would you be a good neighbor letter and say your tree has been the topic of conversation it's a fact that this tree has been the topic of conversation at more than one public meeting it's fact the members of the community have expressed some consternation about it we can write and say you know while our codes have this and we reserve the right to enforce our code which we do if I mean if if Kyle's conclusions change based on new information if a new manager comes in and reaches a different conclusion it's not Beyond um stating that those those things are true it's not a notice of violation it's not a we're taking you to the magistrate it's a hey this is taking some of our time and and um taking some of our time and resources care to do it um it's my understanding this is owned by an LLC that doesn't change anything it just changes you know it makes sense if if correspondence was Senate would go to a registered agent or you know and whether that registered agent is passing it along to a homeowner I don't know I know I asked this question before has anyone reached out to the homeowner or the property owner it's vacant property correct it might be saying that unimproved property you know with the train um so that that property owner has been approached by a lot of well I should say several of the Neighbors about the tree um over time some feelings have changed just based on recommendations and things so there's history and um before a city manager Reeves left they they did send a notice of violation for an Australian Pine and then when it got brought to my attention I discovered it was not an Australian Pine and that's kind of where that got left off so that was for an invasive species not a hazardous tree right so this is not an invasive invasive species it is not okay no there there is an example of a community that has determined their Norfolk Island pine is a nuisance species that's something you could consider but you do have a lot of other Norfolk Island ponds okay in the city I would like to ask uh you Mr rafler to try again to contact the owner of the property and explain just like Mr Moore said that okay it's becoming a Perpetual topic and um see if you can work something out with him um I I don't know what that would be uh because no matter what we would be we would be picking up the tab on this and that's not the goal the goal is not for us to pay for the tree removal um I it's not a decision I can make and uh something that I guess the council would have to agree upon or you would have to take it upon yourself to do it and even then I don't know if that would fly well with this Council so there has to be a solution some way or another that we can is there a do you have a name a phone number address of corresponded with this resident yeah yes one of the top issues on the code enforcement thing was hazardous trees and I understand there are several other trees throughout the city that are you know potentially hazardous and I think this could be something that we could get our code enforcement guys to go out and shall I say survey and figure out you know which trees have problems which ones don't and then if we treat all of the tree owners the same it puts us in a much stronger position than just focusing on this one tree unfortunately this this one tree has been in focus for such a long time that well that doesn't mean that doesn't mean we can't you know incorporate the other trees on that point if you look at these Norfolk Island Pines um this is the tree we're talking about a lot of them they do lean but they self-correct um I don't know if councilman remember Baker can you see um but I I went around and um there's some different examples throughout the city and uh they like this one is an extreme you've probably seen it um that one's not self-correcting it's got a pretty significant lean to it that's a good treat well that's not a tree that's in question but it exists oh but I mean that's considered a good tree I would say so I mean I can have an assessment done on it but I what I'm trying to say is um if we want to be fair we want to be more aggressive about it I think we need to have a method of doing so um but I think based on our current definition and what a professional Isa person can give us um I I can't draw that conclusion to say it's a hazardous tree it pains me to not be able to address the uh The Residency issues that surround this tree but um I I just don't think that we have one at this time yes Mr Robert I wonder so just off the top of your head how many homeowners in that area have expressed unhappiness about that tree how many different homes two three three or four oh really okay so that's good that's good news I think just taking a guess I mean we could get some bids or they could get some bids from a tree company and perhaps um the homeowners there could say look we'll each Kick in a hundred dollars to take this tree down do you think there's any love for that tree by the property owner I know I don't think that's it at all I think that that there's actually um what's the best way to say it the neighbors don't like each other so yeah this is the surrounding neighbors it's the surrounding neighbors against the tree owner and um I think that several residents have Frank uh correct me if I'm wrong but haven't they offered to pay to remove the tree okay and and he wouldn't allow it um I'm not sure if they offer to pay the whole not uh but I know there was an offer there and he got indignant it's just it it's like like I said it's an LLC the mother hasn't been addressed son who manages the LLC I think has been addressed he's been this sticking point of this whole thing but I command you Mr Mayor from now taking this to another possible level maybe getting Mr Moore to do a good neighbor letter or whatever you want to call it yeah I would say just let's start with with a contact and if it's uh helpful if you want me to reach out also I'll be more than happy to do that just as a friendly courtesy call I'll start by reaching out um and I can find out feel them out on what different options he would consider good good does that uh satisfy you uh with this uh conversation Mr Banker I thank you Mr Mayor Ford all right so let's move on to number seven uh also placed on the agenda by council member bankard a discussion of buoys install to maintain at Bel Air Shore Beach accesses Mr Banker you're up uh thank you um this is this is just basically a continuance of last year's Council uh approval it was past six one um and just all this does is complement what was going with what is just passed on the council's agenda last month providing buoys from 19th Street to Harrison my request is and I address Council land I addressed Belair Shores last year the mayor was very it seemed very acceptable to it but um he was hesitant on possible cost even though Council last year said that we would pay for three to five buoys um he was concerned about where the abilities would go because he said it would be better if he knew where they were going their former or their attorney didn't know there was an interlocal agreement it's still in place that would protect Bellair Shores and Bellaire Beach I understand an awareness would have to be changed but when I'm asking this Council to do is if Bel Air Shores agrees to changing their ordinance that we placed the buoys that are noted in my request tonight third sixth I believe in 9th 12th and 15th Street now just to clarify uh who would be responsible for ongoing maintenance in in the interlocal agreement that was created in two I think this December of 2000 Bel Air Beach was [Music] the administrator of the entire buoys from placement to maintenance to renewing the permits and that was from First Street down to Harrison that actually covered 33 buoys I actually sent three documents but Patty never got them I don't know if she forward them to you guys tonight or before she left we have them and in the in the internet local agreement and and Bowie permanent01210 it clearly states that Bellard Beach does the maintenance on them and always has so if the uh if the town of Bel Air sure was to agree with this does the council agree with uh with purchasing and maintaining buoys on Belair Shore I guess that's the question I I think the question is maybe we're premature at this point we have not received the formal approval of our buoy situation from FWC uh that's one uh number two we directed that our beaches will be provided the buoys they have not uh I would say they'd be on their own for costs on this one because they have to under home rule they have to decide what they want done with their beaches absolutely and that's what I was stating was if they agreed with it is that the wishes of this Council if they agreed to let us pick up the tab on placing buoys up and down their Beach um is this is Council uh are are you interested in that at all I don't want to pick up costs for Bel Air Shores on this one the agreement says that we are paying um the maintenance equally because of all maintenance whether provided by the city or by separate contract shall be born equally by the city in town so the interlocal agreement says maintenance is equal is paid by both entities okay well that that may very well change uh the possibility of that even happening I think what what may have frightened him off the last time this was discussed was the fact that they would be basing permanent maintenance fees on uh buoys that they may not have necessarily wanted in the first place yeah Mr Robert so you're saying there was a time where they didn't want buoys I think that they did not want them replaced okay all right well my first thought was if we did this personally I would try to use this and I know there's things that are being discussed regarding the infamous umbrella world if we could use this as a as a bargaining chip that's how I would approached them and I think it might because I've heard through the grapevine often that you know they're reluctant now to do anything about releasing or changing the umbrella ordinance because that would admit they were wrong and that could impact the lawsuits however if they were to say something like well we did change the umbrella rules and the reason we did that because we entered into an interlocal agreement with a Bel Air Beach and they assisted us in providing buoys and that's really the reason we decided to change it so let me give you some information on that as far as connecting the buoys to The Umbrellas I don't think that's necessary okay reason why is because they've already had their first reading of bringing umbrellas back to the accesses so on December the 6th they're supposed to have the second reading of that and then it becomes law and now you can once again have umbrellas in the at those access in the access areas so I I would that's a big help I don't think that that's that's necessary but uh your thoughts on buoys is is US providing buoys and possibly splitting maintenance uh yeah I don't think so if we just put a buoy like at each other three X's at each of the accesses rather than all the way up and down the beach that's around six how many accesses are there parking access this is three nineteen twelve six I think that whatever it uh 19. Mr Baker did you actually have a map in your documentation showing where the buoys were supposed to be placed uh in in the permit number one there's a map but um for clarification um there is already a buoyage 17 to 18th Street at Bel Air is yours we would be putting one anyway at 19th Street at the beach access so the councilwoman's question about putting one at 6th Street and 9th Street which would be the uh or 12th Street I'm sorry which would be the only other two access points you would the problem here is we're protecting the citizens from 19th Street North but the citizens from First Street to 19th Street um and and if you if you research the Bel Air Shores minutes there have been citizens that have gotten up and asked about buoy replacement using pennies for Pinellas to do it and they said the money's already been spent for underground lighting um I've talked to a couple residents that are live in Bel Air Shores that are very annoyed of the jet skis coming in real close to the Shoreline they're saying that they should have we should have the buoys back and we should pay for them not not Bellar beach with Ballard Shores but I'm thinking be a good neighbor get everything back on track five buoys isn't going to cost us a lot of money and it would protect the citizens from first to 19th Street which I'm the only council member that lives in that area anymore what is the cost approximately calm for a buoy a little over 200 200 bucks yeah okay is that installed no yeah a couple hundred more depends how many you do it one time it's cheaper if you doing a lot changes so how many additional buoys would we add to our Beach Boys I went out today in uh GIS located what's it left on our side of the beach and it's like five and a half because there's one that's like full water or something's halfway floating um at this point I believe they're over three years old I recommend that we replace them all because if they haven't ever gone the rest got to be close um and that way we're not worried about trying to re-sticker an old buoy um so right now I'd say to to to come into compliance with our new ordinance um which I'm working with the FWC to make sure they're on board with everything I'm doing um the language and all that the buoys we need at least 16 for what we committed to 16 for us yes okay and then how many for billiard Beach if we went along with that uh we keep the same distance if we're going to go all the way down to 28th um Avenue or whatever um I'd say about 16 I mean with the relative distance I'd have to Google Earth it to know for sure I want to say you know roughly the same amount when the original permit was done it was in the 30s maybe 28 I'd have to check the way the ordinance goes we can't just put them at the parking lots we're at the accesses the beach where they have to get their own permit to get their ordinance yeah because their ordinance isn't changed like ours is with what we're I know that it at one time there was a joint some something to do with permitting was was done jointly or something in the past and now we're having to do it on their on our own which means they're going to have to do it on their own also correct and having reviewed their in preparation for this meeting having reviewed minutes and some of which are even been provided here as of roughly a year ago they had no intention of of re-establishing buoys and that that was my of course that can change um board to board but they're not in any present discussions to re-establish buoys pursue permitting and understanding that this entire conversation is predicated on their pursuit of them um or or potential pursuit of them there's not a present pursuit of buoys by Bella Shores such that this is necessarily timely in that way that we hey we need to let them know as they're debating it maybe it'll push them over they're not debating in the present yeah and that's that's kind of what I I got out of uh a couple of conversations uh one of them uh at the end of the meeting whenever uh Frank made his presentation just listening to the the commission I think that they may have been on board until they were considering maintenance fees and uh and uh upkeep and then uh it seemed as if it just slipped their minds and they were no longer interested so uh and we have the same issue with the condominium owners they look out back they don't want to see the the buoys so it makes perfect sense why they would not want the buoys but uh I I don't have a problem reaching out to a couple of the Commissioners and see what they have to say about it if if they're interested I uh I I don't mind doing that uh Frank and um and then at the next meeting I'll I'll let you know what they say I I don't know what else to do right now I'm I much appreciate it Mr Mayor so step one would be for them to apply for a permit well I think I think to begin with is just to determine if they're even interested because they're I have a feeling they're not uh but let's see and uh and we'll just uh go that route I I do understand uh the need uh why why you want them on the South Side it makes perfect sense and uh uh it's just a matter of getting both sides to agree to make it happen thank you much all right now we're on to idle mate which is General business uh do we have any general business anything yes sure uh we all received an email today I mean this is going back to are we responsive Dan right we are um you only had sent an email to Kyle to forward to everybody and I just wanted to say Kyle can you please answer her about uh what did the city do I guess as regarding the easement 18th 19th Street about who turned that over you know just give her an answer copy us if possible I mean you saw the email from when Lynn was here and he looked into it I don't think he ever got the answer of why that easement stopped um right at that property at 18th um I don't know if I can find that answer I can try I can tell you Lynn told me because it was a Hot Topic at one point and he did some research and could not find uh any proof any surveys that indicated that the easement went Beyond 18. and so I don't I don't know if I fully believe that I don't know if it just got lost I think there's probably a way to track it with just getting an engineer involved to look at the history of um the Lots there you know before that house was built I I was involved with their because the surveys are very old and they were hand drawn um and I we I do remember them reaching out to the original surveyor and and trying to pursue it from some of those documents um outside of going through the records room and just coming through everything yeah it was an old-time resident that was on Council that said there was definitely some concern about whether or not that easement was there before or not and had Lynn digging through all right so they believed that it was there at some point he believes it was that Lynn said it wasn't so I don't know and I think that was one of those things that that person went away and no longer was pursued I asked the question and I was told that no that there was no documentation of us ever having that easement going through to 19. and we still have the reach back with the former city manager what's that we still have that reach back portion of the contract agreement yeah anyone can pick up their phone and call Lana Reeves okay it seems like the county would have I think we got really aggressive we could look back at some archives and go to the county and pull you know old plots and that type of thing and we tried that I I'll reach out the lens it was just something there but it's worth a shot I was thinking you know possibly going through the old records right yeah um it's you know uh I've not lived here for a long time but it seems like it opens up and then it closes up and it opens up and it closes up and it depends upon what the uh the current landscape is or possibly who the latest owner is but it seems like it changes you know from time to time you'll see a picket fence and then you won't see one oh no no I missed so it's uh it's their flat out yard I cut through it sometimes you have to go in one gate not the other gate it's a gated Lynn was successful getting everybody's permanent like fence structures outside of it except for there's one left and I thought Lynn said that they were all gone but there's definitely one um between I think 16th and 17th for the fence is in the easement and I wanted to make you aware of that and I don't know if it's something we want to still pursue um is it 16th and 17th or is it the one that's right up near there Yoli sent us the only said it was like it's the connector to the north side of town right so that's where we don't know if it even exists that's what that's the piece we don't know if there actually was an easement but there is where we know there's an easement there is a fence that's encroaching it oh there is there still is and that's what I'm that's what I want to make sure that what happened between 18th and 19th doesn't happen anywhere else that that easement is always open because we we can't have these people that's one house that's there right White House that they can access both from okay and my understanding is I get halfway through and the other Gates locked and I have to look what happened um my understanding is that easement is is an in perpetuity it never it depends on the instrument that it's based on um prescriptive easements meaning easements achieved by adverse possession which we're not talking about here would be sort of different but if we have an easement it would depend on what how it was dedicated what if it's a if it's a written easement what the easement documents say um not all easements are in perpetuity no um I I don't know if this was done basically we may also be able to do a title search yeah but I have a feeling that if it's not coming up more readily and digital reviews of records that a title search probably won't find what was you know handwritten on graph paper 60 years ago um but ultimately I I defer to you folks but as a general matter no not all easements are in perpetuating uh well we're discussing easements uh how is the survey going how many have you had doing very well we're getting close to 200 so we're almost twice as much as wow all right so for the walking easement this is the Locking engagement now there's a shorter survey but they did go boots on the ground and went every door so I think that did make a difference and are you keeping tabs to date or are you waiting till you get I purposely have not looked at any of the results I was just gonna wait for the thing to close um people who have kind of asked me but I can't keep daily tabs on what the results coming in I'd rather just be able to summarize all the day and it's the uh the cut they um receiving them uh the close of the month so November 30th the sixth expiration and uh so when will we have the results I could share that with you immediately if you're interested right it won't be my you know it's the three questions but I can you know I'll put it in an Excel formats or like I did with this one and just send it out to you are they going to be in quadrants [Laughter] hello I took that survey to you know I had to hand them off on Harrison and one of the neighbors goes walking path in my day that was called The Sidewalk is that what you're talking about not white all right well uh any other General business Mr Banker your hand was raised yeah um top on these easements is there I haven't seen a blueprint on I just saw it was 10 foot wide is there going to be drainage in there because right now I'm just talking from Ninth Street South when you get a high tide that easement floods in a lot of areas especially if the check valve isn't working um so did we because now we're going to be black topping 10 feet of uh ground which water absorption will be deterred from that 10 feet so how how are we going to drain it is what I'm asking I'm gonna I'm gonna step in on this one I don't think that that that's the result of the survey we're relying on the survey to find out what everyone wants us to do with these easements and it may very well be that we don't do anything with them or we throw shells down or something you know I uh I my guess would be no blacktop but I don't know I don't know we'll we'll find out in a couple of days and then we can have that conversation thank you again I'm sorry what was that thank you thank you thank you again I'm sorry oh oh no problem no problem any other uh General business everyone want to go home can I just mention really quick you guys did not see the um the September financial report uh Heather wanted to hold and deliver it within next months with the October report just because it's the end of the fiscal year and she wanted the numbers to come out a little more accurate um to wrap it up so I just want to make you aware we didn't forget thanks for the heads up on that I'll entertain a motion to adjourn motion second second all in favor aye good night good job"
