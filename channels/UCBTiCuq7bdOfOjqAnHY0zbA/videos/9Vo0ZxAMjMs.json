    "transcript": "good evening everyone welcome to the september 8th 2021 regular council meeting with the city of belgrave before we do the pledge of allegiance um i have some horrible news that i have to um on august 25th my dear friend john hollis passed away he's 39 years old it's his wife and his son buck and my heart goes out to you guys josh was a very dedicated uh citizen of our city he served on our board of adjustment and he's about the best friend you could ever have there is a service on saturday the 11th uh at 2pm this saturday at the country christian church that's at 1850 north of mullin road in clearwater the city is invited it's a celebration of his life it's going to be tough without him we're going to try and make it here [Music] please join me in a moment of silence for josh please stand united states councilmember frank banker president council member glenn gunn council member leslie otero council councilmember rita swope yeah vice mayor dave gaddis mayor joseph manzo city manager lynn reeves and city attorney fred riley here thank you so the first item of business is the approval of the agenda do i have a motion [Music] uh lesbian apparel second second one yeah one question mr karen sure i'd like to amend the agenda for tonight regarding an issue which happened last thursday september 2nd my amendment for discussion involves the beach and parking access along with safety and possible detriment to our lot of 12th street i asked last thursday for this to be put on the agenda for tonight in this reference my request was not timely because the agenda items need to be placed by wednesday while i'm not disputing this requirement even though this council meeting was set six days later the incident or amendment by request directly impacts our residents and other residence heavens which have addressed as the past council needs therefore mr chairman my request is now timely since the adoption of the agenda has not taken place and my request for the amendment falls um before i ask for a second on that first let me ask for a second on that do we have a second on that second second city attorney and i'm going to be asking for a change on this agenda also typically you have to pre-advertise the uh any agenda items to be official this does i do not believe this includes an expenditure of money um but it is something that was brought up i believe by mr vanguard earlier um there is no rule that you know that's that's our rule the house rule here that a thursday afternoon thing has to be done um it has been as early as wednesday it can be later there's no real rule from florida as to when something can change on the agenda so i'll certainly entertain this but first i have to seek your approval as to whether this would be an appropriate amendment i know certain ones wouldn't be but this one's different [Music] the question is whether you should allow an amendment to aggressive issue at this point if it passes yes this amendment that mr that council member has proposed i'm having all sorts of trouble hearing you because you're a mask sorry what i understand the situation is i the agenda was finalized and then was sent out is that correct i can't hear you it was sent out the next morning i think what patty's sent to councilmember especially if it's not requiring expenditure of funds you're not entering into a contract you're going to discuss something that is a very relevant thing that i think if the council wants to allow it to be discussed and you ought to let it be discussed with that i'll open up the council discussion this is important any discussion this is only on the amendment on going backwards i would like to hear the amendment one more time my amendment goes to beach parking beach access and possible detriment to the lot of 12th street and the safety accessing the beach on an issue that occurred on september 2nd would this be something that we're voting on no okay eventually will it come up to a vote you think i want this event right now i don't believe it will come up to a financial mode or a fundamental it's just i don't believe so okay i got a question to you you stated this is the 12th street beach access correct correct okay so that's bella shore property and i'm not sure that that would be considered bella regis city business to discuss so i'm not sure why we would even be involved in that discussion i uh expect to differ whether that's bella or schue's property according to the three deeds that are recorded in this office and this county canals which clearly says i believe i can read i can read the lot in question and i want to quote from the conveyance of february 12 1948 states that said quarries to the first part and from consideration of the sum of one dollar to them in the hand paid by seth secretary aware of is hereby acknowledge that granted morgan sold conveyed and confirmed an easy presence pre due grant or self and ban confirm unto said party of the second part against delaware beach and its success is forever the following parcel of land and situated in the counties of penelo state i'll help you out a little bit i know a little bit about this um civic dollar elite as every citizen east of the center line involved boulder as a perpetual easement that runs with their land to utilize those lots will be conveying purposes i'm not positive that i know what we're speaking about but i have a pretty good idea what it is and uh that absolutely impacts me ability consistency so it is serious no disrespect i'm not sure you actually know what this is about but um again it's a safety issue it's our residents our residents weren't packing directly i was impacted and i just would like to explain the council did you say a september 2nd incident correct okay so there's we don't i mean i know nothing about the september second amendment it sounds like maybe it's something more appropriate for council comments at the end than putting it on as an agenda item well i believe it should be an agenda item because if it would have fell if the incident would have happened september first i would have been on the injector but because it fell on september 2nd it was a day later then the agenda was written i would have been it would have been timely submitted but because we had that rule the wednesday before am i the only one who counseled no idea what the september second incident was so i feel you know it's hard it's hard to discuss something on the agenda i can briefly discuss it right now if i'm allowed [Music] um to the council you're going to have to trust councilmember vanguard that he says this is important and something we need to know about if you don't think that that's the case then vote it down it's the banker i'm telling you right now councilmember there's going to be a world session right after the next budget i have a number of issues that i'm going to deal with i'll be speaking about tonight okay i'm done with this and i have a number of issues that i'm going to be speaking about tonight and they're going to handle the work session so that is the secondary option if for some reason you don't get this opportunity but if it's an emergent matter either with the city attorney i want to hear it the only the only reason i would like to put it on the agenda item is because the people who are in this room are here now when council speaks about their personal agenda or whatever most these people probably home and in bed okay where i like to be sometimes but um because of the fact i see some people that this impacted directly so i think it plus what i want to bring up is people already decided to council address the council about this i say let's let's agree to put it on the agenda because in the future one of us may bring up another issue that we feel is important and just to extend the courtesy to frank like we would like it to be extended to us in the future so on the sense of good faith and trust and and i would do this for each and one of you if you felt strongly about something i support him council comments my recommendation would be to move it or to add an agenda item 22a that does move to the end but if it makes it an official agenda item ten minutes later five minutes later he's going to be able to speak anyway let's go ahead and give him the benefit of the dial and uh and put it on as an agenda it's the 22 a.m and comments on that just on that none um act here oh that's the material you had the last word if you like before we called it for a vote just for frank's amendment you moved the motion so just go through call the role please okay so this let me call this question so this is to amend the agenda as item 22a for the proposal of frank bankguard regarding the 12th street access and some observations and information that he has that he wants to give to council he'll show up on a regular agenda item 22a yes vote gets it on the agenda novo keeps it off council member aki hi council member banker yes council member gunn council member doterra aye council member schwab aye vice mayor gattis aye mayor manchin all right so seven to zero frank you'll leave that up 22a okay thank you thank you okay so um with back to the regular agenda leslie you didn't even have a chance to speak you did bearing that motion regular agenda any comments because i do i do want to make a proposed change to the agenda to approve the agenda which now includes a 22a okay so items number 12 through 16 are authorizations for the city manager to act on various contracts if you total up these contracts they total almost through about three quarters of our annual operating budget and they're going to be passed on a consent agenda without discussion without discussion by the city without discussion by the council that is not what the state of florida envisions this is supposed to be a deliberative body so i'm going to make a motion that items 12 through 7 i'm making this motion and i'll tell you why i'm going to pass the gavel if i get a second on it um i'm making this motion because i don't want this council to get themselves in trouble we cannot blow this stuff by without discussion there's three quarters of a million dollars of expenditure going down here and we are not passing that without discussion i don't care if there's no discussion ultimately on it we want to have that discussion out here and if we don't do that then woe to us because i do believe that we're violating several things including the sunshine law the public meetings law and allowing the citizens to have the opportunity to speak this should never be in the consent agenda so items 12 through 16 is my motion do i have a second and i will pass together second second thank you dave gannister to chair this part just for my motion i'm first because i was the one who proposed it so it's this simple okay as i just said we basically have items 12 through 16 on here item 13 is 52 000 contract item 14 is a 58 350 contract um and their local agreement is number 15 there's no dollars attached to that item 16 is a 304 000 contract and i skipped item 12 which is a 522 000 contract that's almost nine hundred thousand dollars on a 1.2 million dollar budget what are we thinking that we're going to pass this without allowing you the citizens to be able to speak there's approval of police in here there's approval of new garbage fees in here and you deserve to be heard on it and so is this council i have questions on several of these some of them i have absolutely no questions on this is not consent agenda consent agenda ministerial items it's national breast cancer awareness month don't laugh you don't understand it it's from ministerial items that's what the state statute says and fred riley has that statute i serve on four boards and not one of them tries to ram through stuff under the consent agenda including the minutes i have a problem with that these minutes in my opinion happen to be excellent there's not a problem with them but sometimes that's not the case we need to have the ability to deliberate this stuff and not ram it down your throat 900 000 worth of expenditure so please let's do the right thing and get this right the first time because if we don't then it's void eno which means it's completely void contracts that's all i have to say about david back to you would any other council members like to make a comment yes i would um i'd like to ask the city attorney how does this violate any sunshine law or any other laws i'd like to ask the city manager have we not spoken about every one of these items in different work sessions and at other council meetings where everybody was allowed to say and speak about it at that time yes uh with the exception of a local agreement anything else it's been it's the standard contracts for each year that we do any other council members yeah let me help you with that law i didn't have the opportunity to speak okay mr riley did make a recommendation that basically would give the public the opportunity to speak on all consent agendas and that would that would resolve the issues that they could pick any one of them to discuss um just throwing it out unfortunately that doesn't resolve the issue of the council which is also part of the public speaking so let's cut right to the chase folks you're going to find out some information about your police contract that maybe somebody doesn't want you to know i got that information but i can't give it to you right now because there's not going to be a discussion but we're going to ram through ran through without your discussion 522 dollar expenditure the biggest single contract we have all year that doesn't merit discussion let me tell you what the city manager thought marinette discussion a 280 bill from juventus for records requests that married in an hour and a half discussion a 320 bill from me that merited an hour and a half discussion but a six hundred thousand dollar five hundred thousand three hundred thousand dollars nah let's just rubber stamp it we could be out of here by seven o'clock it's not what our function is as a council as for consistency let's go back to last year 2020 every one of these items was in the regular agenda consistency i've been preaching it since i swore in as mayor so tell me what changed from last year of this year because the law certainly didn't change florida doesn't envision you passing three quarters of your budget without the citizens and council talking about it and no we didn't talk about this contract for the police it just came out i just found something out about this police contract and i want everybody in this town to know about it can you advise us what's the best course of action say that again i'm sorry can you advise us what's the best course of action whether or not these items should be put into the regular for discussion like what's the proper thing to do yeah i made a mistake today and the mistake i made is i wrote an email and in the email i should have said and in hindsight i would have would have done this but didn't want to write another email but i said members of the public i should have said and city council members the easy solution to this predicament is to have anybody that is in this room that wants to comment on the items comment on the items and that way there's no issue whatsoever about whether there's compliance with the statute so that's that's my recommendation i had to do it over again this morning when i wrote the email i would have said members of the general public and the city council i thought that was implicit in what i said but i i i guess it was not so sorry for all the confusion the object of doing this is to have transparency in government and to have people have the opportunity to be heard which means an opportunity to give input and whether you as the council want to take that into account in any way shape or form is up to you as the council yes uh with that said by our city attorney rather than us ourselves into a legal bind it doesn't look like there's a you know roman empire out there audience so let's just move this to people's feet anyone in the audience like to speak on these topics just on these topics just on the agenda well i have some questions yes you're you're in the middle of addressing the amendment so i would suggest you complete that task and then go to the next step correct the amended amended agenda we have to pass it command so amendment we'll keep it simple have we passed the amendment so you mentioned an interlocal agreement is one of the items on this agenda and then point that out to me okay yeah how do i find out exactly what that entails what are the details of that there should be in the back um on the presentation there's copies of the agenda there yeah the other one is the police contract that you mentioned is there another way of finding out what's in that contract it should also yes it is in there if you look at the uh the consent agenda item numbers there further back in the agenda you'll see that there is an item number there there we have them tapped for me to comment later after i've read them because i haven't seen them before the agenda has been published for about six days now it's it's been available online i because i did look for the agenda for the budget this morning yes mayor if i may um mr darrell you will have if this passes and these are moved to the regular agenda i will call each one of these for comment and public comment so you have that opportunity but we're going to move in there pretty quickly because it's going to come right after the minutes do we have any other citizens that like to comment on the manzo agenda agenda amanda agenda yes sir mr anthony john hansig 22nd street the only comment i want to make about the mayor's motion amendment whatever is i would encourage you to seriously consider voting in favor of it we're all everybody in this room basically we're all taxpayers okay and i was a little surprised to hear for example that there's an issue in the sheriff's proposed budget i didn't have time to look through that you know i'm supposed to be retired and have all kinds of time i'm working more than that without getting paid check but besides that it's important that we all have the same information okay so i would just ask everybody on the council even the benefit of the doubt there must be something there that's important enough that he brought it up just like mr banker did earlier and you gave him the benefit of the doubt it's all about us together as taxpayers thank you very much anyone else like to comment back to council mr gunn just out of curiosity the agenda items that are being questioned in the budget have there been any revisions i know we had two budget revisions but the concerns about the share but have there been changes to that budget in those two divisions so i mean all these items just have to discuss that we've had what two or three workshops to discuss the budget and none of these issues were brought up at that time no the sheriff as an example gave us his budgeted number uh i submitted they submitted the contract which is it's pretty standard contract that's the memphis city attorney you looked at it said it was fine and i put it on the agenda so i just want to i just want to clarify that there haven't been any changes or any conspiracy theories here trying to slip on through at the last minute there's been adequate time in the budget sessions and reviews to discuss all these issues that are being brought up there's nothing secret and while i appreciate the ability of residents to make comments the process is working you've asked to remove things from the consent agenda i support that but i want to clarify that there hasn't been any sneaky or conspiratorial things taking place in the budget at the last last minute so while we can draw this out it's routine business for uh council to discuss lengthy intricate business details and finances at work sessions and approve it and get a consensus at those work sessions and then you come forward and in the interest of timeliness if you improved on the consent agenda so i mean it's nothing new it's done by large municipalities all the time but i fully support the process it's working here you've asked to remove items from the consent agenda and pull it into regular agenda i have the same feeling basically if we don't move this we're going to get into quagmire where we just will never be able to move on with this agenda so i'm uh i'm for the man so um thank you all for your support i will have last word here uh not saying there's a conspiracy period because there is new information that came to my attention after our last budget meeting so i want to share that with the city and we can do with it what we wish um and i have some questions on some of this other stuff because it's the first time i'm seeing some of these contracts just to understand the budget process okay and i described this to someone today you all make a budget at home you budget for a vacation this year that doesn't mean you're going to france okay you might go and you might not you might have to stay home and paint the house there might be bad weather and you can't go you might have something come up that you can't do it's in the budget the budget doesn't mean everything is rubber stamped go ahead and spend it means we've set money aside for it and we're going to be talking about the approval of the budget later on tonight so this has nothing to do with the budget i don't want to interfere with these two things these are separate items we spent more time talking about it right now i could have probably ran through about every one of these and had them prove right now because i don't think there's going to be lengthy discussion on most of this but there may be some stuff that when people hear it gives them pause and if it does then we'll come back and prove these things later that's all i want the opportunity to have full disclosure with everyone we don't hide them all here yes i wouldn't play it i i agree with the transparency and full disclosure and i will go back to my comments at the previous work session we spent more time discussing a 30-page sign over this and then we spent 30 minutes talking about a budget when we couldn't spend the time talking about budgeting so that's my point here is all of a sudden this is a dire consequence of getting focused in on and distracted by a possible supreme court case involvement of sign where we could have been discussing we've been here at one o'clock in the morning i will stay as long as everyone needs to stay i've got no place to go i've seen every golden pile so i don't need to be home at nine o'clock to watch the reruns you'll stay here as long as it takes so don't ever say that we ever tried to rush anything through because you have the floor anyone has the floor we you've made 45 minute presentations sometimes on traffic and stuff we listen maybe we got it in the first 10 minutes but you know what we listen you have the floor you put a lot of work into it you want to hear what you have to say also this one does not feel that's the floor here thank you for that but sometimes it takes 45 minutes to get the point across to some people my point is is we did not take the time at the budget time to discuss about this that we we spent so much time talking about signing words everybody was weary and that's it that's that's called a declare of their community thank you any other council members okay i'm going to call a questionable question all right this is to amend the agenda to move which items 12 through 16. close to 316 into the regular agenda uh do i have a motion follow the question council member aki council member banker yes councilmember gunn aye council member notaro aye council member sue aye vice mayor gathers mayor manzo hi i will pass the gavel back to you sir i'll announce it for you passes seven to zero so the manzo amendment what man's all amendment amendment is uh item 12 through 16 will move straight in order onto the regular now with that you're still on approval of agenda does anybody have any other comments on the agenda citizens leslie matera last word and i'll call the question as um twice okay um i'll do a voice vote on this all in favor all right anyone opposed 7-0 the amended amended agenda is passed and then we move to citizen comments this is item two so this is citizen comments and just uh for anyone who might be new any items that are not on the agenda you can comment on this is the time if there's something that's on the agenda we will get back to you later on and you'll have the opportunity to comment again on it so this is anything that is on your mind that we did not list on this agenda with that said um please come up here to the front podium give us your name and uh and give us the information you always been in motion over here so you'll love me first good evening uh building room 113 12th street and i believe i have darlene's three gray and very good minutes in thank you on june 7th of this year this board this council passed uh after much heated uh let me just ask you to speak right into that in the discussion uh you passed a worthless resolution stating that bellar beach is not part of a lawsuit that was on by mr manzo and the interiors i am one of the interveners was published in the newspaper and that big hoo-ha was made about that to make sure the world knew that bellair beach was not part of this lawsuit yet a month later as a result of the freedom of information act i have it would before me some invoices from the attorney city attorney of baylor sure which i will give to miss clerk uh for your review and afterwards and these invoices there are three entries that kind of um troubled me uh although i think one may have been answered in our earlier discussion not answered um hinted at um but these three entries really concern me the first entry is july 2nd it's a preparation of correspondence to bellaire beach regarding settlement negotiation and inter-local agreement now we mentioned interlocal agreement a little while ago and i'm going through the big thick packet to see if i can find out what exactly it means i have yet to see what it really means so i'm curious as to what is the change in the interlocal agreement but this particular entry i'd like to see what that letter was she prepared a correspondence to this city regarding not only the interlocutor but also the law the settlement of the proposal settlement all right negotiation now this settlement negotiation only applies to the lawsuit does not apply to the city does not apply to anything else it's the lawsuit which the city has no business or interest in and whoever that party was negotiating with her which i think is the city manager based on the other two entries i want to know why because that person is not authorized to discuss lawsuit negotiation of that lawsuit any kind of settlement negotiation with the city of belarus shore on july 14 there was a telephone conference with regina karnash and our city manager regarding settlement proposal what settlement proposal would that be during that time period is when the parties of the lawsuit has submitted a proposal to the city of bellaire of the town of bellershore for consideration of the lawsuit so why is the city manager discussing settlement proposals of a lawsuit of which he's not part of and the city is not part of with the attorney of the town of eliasure which by the way is not the attorney on the lawsuit all right there is another attorney she has no business discussing that either and then on july 22nd there's a third entry telephone call to bellar beach city manager now july 22nd is very important because that's either the day or the day after the town of bel air shore decided to reject our proposal maybe the thumbs up was given i don't know but i want to know what that discussion was now my concern is why is the city manager involved in this and either i'd like to have a really good reason or i'd like to have some reprimands because the you guys passed this resolution saying you're not part of this lawsuit and that means you stay out of the lawsuit you stay out of commenting of in negotiating or giving information about the lawsuit to the other party i'd like to see that letter mr reeves the one that she's prepared for you also um mr dara on this whole time for a second point of order information are you making the public records requests for that item yes sir thank you time back in okay um to me this is a waste of our city manager's time and money on items that are not in his job description which at the very minimum should require reimbursement to the city um as a private citizen i'm sure he's free to talk to anyone just like all of you are free to talk to anyone about the lawsuit but when you're talking on behalf of the city after you pass that wonderful resolution there's a violation here somewhere and i like to have someone look into it and i do want to point out that it is the city manager's physician sometimes to be contacted first for example this might be closely related to mr banker anyone asking for permission to park in our access lots be it uh film commission construction workers they'll come and they'll call the city manager first and i believe his response would be no you're not allowed or if he wants to make an exception for a particular issue or person or company then there should be a process by which that should be done an application a sign of waiver of liability for damages and accidents that can be caused plus a hefty fee for parking in our lots but no the city manager has been known to to respond i don't know call bella shore pass the book to bellaire shore and let them do what they are not allowed to do because their ordinance specifically says they are not allowed to give permits and yet they consistently do and why because we have abdicated our responsibility to control the parking so i will give these invoices to ms patty for you to see i will ask for the freedom of information uh requests on that letter and if anyone can tell me what this interlocal agreement discussion is about what does it mean because i haven't gone through the entire agenda yet so i would appreciate it thank you thank you mr daryl are you going it's not lost on me what you just said and there's plenty more beyond that so if you can stay and all of you can stay and open your eyes to some stuff that maybe you don't want to see a long time coming well if we don't want to see it that's not an incentive aesthetic what's that oh you want to see it trust me you want to see it yes um the resident brought up some issues i didn't want to i didn't want to you know kill her thought process but uh i don't know it's not i mean here's what we did mr banker last time we said um we had a discussion with tipbuck so our rule says this when a citizen comes forward we thank them we can refer it to the city manager or something we're going to have that option um or we can deal with it later on during our period of time or we don't have to deal with it at all um last time we suspended the rules so that we could have discussions with the individuals so that they don't have to wait till the end of the night that's what we did last council session so um you know if i'll entertain a motion if somebody wants to do that and we can discuss it mr cass made a very good point at the last meeting when he did that to get these get the citizens and get the council members interjection back and forth while they're still here she said she may not be here so i made an emotion i'm sorry my comment was to hear not to respond i never said that it was a back and forth it was more of a the citizens deserve the right to speak and to be heard they shouldn't have to wait till the very end of the meeting to be heard uh it doesn't necessarily mean that i agree with i want a back-and-forth conversation every time someone speaks that's you know you uh did you open it up for a discussion last time we did open it up for discussion one second i'll stick to the end okay that's fine but there's a motion on the floor i need okay this isn't going to second obviously is there anyone who wants to second mr banker's motion open this up to have a discussion now second we have a second now we have a discussion mr banker well i don't know if you want to get into this line item because hang on this is just to sell your idea of let's open this up so you can talk about opening it up yep she brought up some issues that are in 22b that are i think critical to this and i think it should be discussed by everybody's here and i would like to say what i have to say right now i don't want people to trickle out of here when the reporters tape recorder runs out i want the reporter to hear what i have to say tonight about what happened a year ago with this city and this city manager i want you all to hear this anyone else on council why not yes i just have a question from the city attorney and the city manager i have no knowledge of these the first item that mr darrow brings up about the issue but when she uses the term interlocal agreement it does raise a question in my mind because who are the only people who can negotiate or discuss an interlocal agreement i mean in my mind it takes place between the council or the city manager or the city attorney between the municipalities not interveners or parties to a litigation so when you use a term an interlocal agreement that raises money interest well yeah there is invested interest in the city manager discussing an interlocal agreement with another municipality so i mean to me that's no surprise again i have no doubt please allow me to finish sir please allow me to finish please the again the interlocal agreement mr gut it's just a point of order this is about whether this is going to be put on as an agenda item to be a back and forth not a discussion of what your feeling is legally about an interlocal agreement which i might add has nothing to do with the one that mr daryl is talking about so let's stick to apples to apples this is a question of mr banker council member bangkok has made a motion to open up a two-way discussion yes or no we want a two-way discussion there'll be ample time to talk about whether your city manager did a good job or did a poor job that will be heard tonight whether it's hurt at midnight or it's hard at seven o'clock it's gonna be heard so please you have the floor to talk about thinking about whether mr bangalore should or should not get his wish that's all i want to hear about right now you know he's just merely asking for a clarification of the issue for ms bergero before we proceed okay we'll move on anyone else on council citizens just on this motion back to council with frank vanguard having the last word i believe all the citizens are in front of us they bring up some issues i believe we should have him back okay so the motion on the floor at this point from frank banker is to open up a two-way dialogue between the citizens now we're not going to have the citizens come back up and back or not that's not the way it works ms rodero set her point this council will respond to it that's that and then the next person can come up and we will have back and forth with them through institution competency yes we'll make that happen a no vote will stick us to our regular stuff and we'll deal with it later on patty please call the role council member aki councilmember banker councilmember gunn council member otero council member sue aye vice mayor goddess aye mayor manzo aye has a seven to zero frank blackburn we will be having that two-way discussion now ms rodero you had a number of questions for this council allow me to knock one out real quickly because it's the easiest one we're using this interlocal agreement um there's several interlocal agreements i can assure you the inter-local agreement you're familiar with as part of the lawsuit which has to deal with the arrangement between belarus shore and bellar beach is not the inter-local agreement that's on the agenda for tonight okay that's actually their local agreement between us and the pinellas i think code board or pinellas building inspector to do building inspections and stuff for us so two different same term two different things and i'll bring it back to the council and if anyone else would like to respond um frank banker i know you had some items and um i'm gonna bring some stuff up later all right the resident brought up construction money lots uh parking mobilize and one of the things i wanted to bring up i got past the v was last thursday september 2nd i was going north on golfball about 9 00 a.m and noticed at our 12th street lot two tractor trailers and a 130 ton crane was parked in the lot all part using up more than one half of the lot on my way back the crane was being built right when i mean being built counter weights installed outrigger pads put on i'm a certified crane operator i hold licenses in other states so i'm not trying i'm impressed what i'm saying is i understand cranes pretty well all right anyway so on my way back the crane was being built which was now improved 80 percent of our lot all right for the insulation block removal maneuvering of trailers the access path to the beach was further blocked during the time which two residents and myself trying to use now i have a question right quick are we discussing 22b now we're discussing what she brought up about i'm wondering if she brought up an agenda item and that's right brought up well that's what i'm asking we're not supposed to be discussing agenda items during citizen comments okay so if you have other comments on her comments thank you he's correct we are getting into 22. so let's keep that for later because i'll have the opportunity to comment specifically on that one i know it's related um but this is specifically on the city manager's actions okay okay any other council members okay then i'm going to go um they're all quite familiar with the documents that you have i've been going through the discovery and i'm not going to be talking about my lawsuit but i'm going to be talking about behavior and what's been going on over here so on july 3rd lynn reeves wrote to regina kardash please call me at 727-229-8431 the city council has tasked me to contact bel air to try and resolve all issues before the lawsuit i spoke i had spoken to your mayor commissioner bloom just prior to the lawsuit looking forward to speaking with you then they go back and forth to kind of get a date and then you get what you got which was there was a conversation between them talking about the lawsuit and talking about settlements okay can i clarify the date that you said that happened yeah that date was uh july 3rd was when he wrote the initial letter 2021 july 3rd 2021 yes correct okay so and i'm sorry i will specify the year because we're going to go back in here and then yes regina kardashian's bills which i have okay um show that there's been ongoing discussion now why is that important folks i'll tell you why it's important i'm not going to tell you anything that's private i'm not going to tell you anything that i know that you don't want to tell you what was said at the bellar council meeting as part of our intellectual agreement signed by mike kelly when he was mayor and i don't know if mr reeves was on that board or not but the city council agrees to indemnify belarushore for all legal fees related to the beach access lots yeah so you're talking to the attorney that wants to build this city for better legal fees win or lose by the way folks win or lose not a smart move not a smart move but it gets so much better that's not all see we had all this talk that there was um there was a settlement in the offing remember that one yeah well i made a freedom of information act also known as the florida public records request i asked for everything that the city manager had relating to his seven you know what i got i'll show it to you one calendar entry that he called mayor schmidt yeah that's the settlement that explains why they never heard from bella shore because there was no settlement there's no paperwork there's no settlement there's no nothing but there's more folks this is like a batted from infomercial there's more a year ago this council i'm sorry the previous council when i was working with mayor schmidt before july 21st when they had first passed the ordinance i called him because no one here knew how to get him i got him in 20 minutes and i got a moratorium on the enforcement of the umbrella ordinance for one month until july 21st 2020. mayor schmidt said let me talk to my counsel he's not a strong mayor neither am i i said yeah i work for our councils the city council here on july 6th said mr prior council said we don't want the mayor representing the city we want the city manager representing the city i wasn't thrilled with that it's not an attorney doesn't know the issues but you know what sometimes you've got to do what the council says so that's what the council said so let me tell you how your city manager represented your city and the individuals in this city i am reading now remember the meeting was july 21st 2020. he was tasked with reaching out to them on july 6th on july 16th he made a phone call i've got a letter right here patty this is going to be put into the indented minutes i will give you a clean copy not highlighted tomorrow we'll give a copy to every single uh council member we're going to give a copy to every single citizen in this city i want you to hear what your city manager did barbara kaluchi city clerk of bel air shore wrote this to mayor robert schmidt july 16 11 53 am subject live july 21st meeting meeting request from lynn reeves hi in light of the current situation lynn reeves called this morning and wondered if it would be a good idea for our town attorney to clarify jurisdictional boundaries and municipalities being able to enforce ordinances to the water also clarification of not being able to lock the gates regina spoke to me about this already that would be regina kardash just wondering if this can be done at the meeting are you ready lynn believes that the facts will shut people up with what they are rabble rabble-rousing about he sold your city out no wonder why when we went there on july 21st they laughed at us the fix was in how dare you [Music] i have the right to ask that he be fired so the point of order is not well-founded i am asking this council to terminate you this is insubordination unprofessional you are sent over to defend the citizens of this city and you sold them out how dare you joe jill let's just bring it down okay unless they said opponent of order but we don't know i said what i had to say i'm allowed to raise my voice [Music] take a deep breath let's just calm down who wants to speak next and on top of that you got the nerve to go in the newspaper and criticize me you thought that passed me by because i was out of town you talk about unprofessional can i maybe suggest a five-minute recess to all collect our thoughts and calm down my vlogs are fine i'm finished speaking i had said what i said citizens you like that you still have the floor well we have back and forth with the only regard that's what i wanted to tell you only so the citizens still have it you always feel that time she sat down in the middle in the middle while we were debating i don't know how much time she has left patty you tell us how much time she has left i can talk to you in [Music] entries that i referred to was this year so not only was the city manager interfering a year ago and i attended that bella shore meeting as well and i saw the interactions between all the commissioners and the mayor and mr reeves so i know what happened at that time as well but the entries that i brought up today happened this year when we submitted the lawsuit a proposal to see if we can settle this and obviously that interlocal agreement as you clarify was not the same as the one i am familiar with but the entry also mentions settlement negotiation proposal and i want to know what settlement negotiation is city manager having with the town of bella shores that is at all related to this lawsuit that you're not a part of and that makes me angry and i agree that he should be terminated because if a member of this council whether you're elected or paid does not serve the citizens of this city then you don't deserve to be here and that means you're terminated in whatever way it happens resignation recall termination whatever i for one am very angry about this and i'm trying to really hold myself back there have been homes that i have learned that have not sold when they learned there was a lawsuit penalty that you couldn't open an umbrella on the beach that is the most absurd and ridiculous thing ever but nobody talks about the property values that are going down or will go down if this continues i for one make will make it my mission to tell everyone about rocky values and realtors have been notified i tried to go notify as many realtors because there have been deals that have fallen through end the story yo if you want to stay up in case anybody has any questions for you i'm going to have you go up and down counsel any response i would just like to respond since i've been retired i guess people might think i don't have anything to do but i've been going through all the minutes and listening to the audios of last year and that just for correction i think july 6 this council voted which i'm sorry they have an ethical resolution done by bellar shores meeting one that was done on july 20 i believe it was july 20th and you wanted to answer the council wanted an answer back by the 21st um if it's off today it's time to tell you okay and the city manager was directed to go to the belarus shores and work this out with the umbrellas i'm just talking about the umbrellas all right i got this minutes and dollar shorts mean it's not even goatee david shorts minutes july 21st it's noted in august meeting where you attended and other council members and candidates but you always need because nothing was resembled now frank if i might just it was july 21st at their meetings they may have put the wrong date on it but the meeting minutes are actually very very copious and very this council seemed to be very strong in support of the residents here about the intelligence all right and i don't know how it got waivered okay i don't i don't i wasn't on council at the time but i've been bringing up buoy issues okay which were removed by this city okay as unnecessary all right and just this past weekend you should have seen some of the in my opinion drunks running their boats 20 yards all right dangerous very dangerous now i talked to lynn i mean i actually made a resolution or proposed to write a resolution in june to have us pay for liabilities to put back and build our shows and fund all right i got called in met with city manager he says he believes he can work out two issues the umbrellas and the bullies give him some time mayor schmidt would be out of town that was a gym it was i think it was june 8th this year this year okay i gave him time i've been fighting with the fwc florida wildlife mission without these buildings because right in the buoy permit there's 14 items if any i got a little bit leery when i didn't hear anything back i contacted the city manager in july right apparently we never got a meeting with beller's mayor but he did talk to belarus shores council as of two weeks ago i believe if i'm wrong wouldn't tell me all right and she said bellar shores is not interested in putting the boobies back which compliments in my theory that let's make it as dangerous as hell out there for sun bathing but vice mayor rosemary on september 15th and this is noted in the minutes of dollar stores when discussing the money they were getting for the pinellas for our pennies for vanilla is about using that money for buoys this is the vice mayor saying hey we have a dangerous situation here let's put the buoys back mayor schmidt then says well that money's already been allocated for other things so i have a real hard question to believe a couple things here that i've heard i've heard from the last year that if we only would have not filed a lawsuit or you interveners or whatever this would have all been worked out excuse my french bingo all right bingo all right that's the word i need to use you all right because i would have been more candid than that okay because the fact of the matter is the abilities are a safety item it's like removing that light down here because all right they weren't going to pay for it commissioner bloom says oh it costs a lot of money it's not going to cost you dime we're going to pay for it now those lots which i read earlier are our lives bought and paid for i was also told oh you only paid a dollar and paid 10 bucks or whatever how much does manny have paid for like the dutch they gave me some tickets and uh whatever right that i think the manhattan right now you have to pay 580 billion dollars right those three lives are our lives this council needs to stand up and say a we're putting a buoy at six street we're putting a movie at 12th street there is a buoy already at 17th street and anybody that gets fined okay that has an umbrella on those lots we'll pick up the tag and we'll provide counseling okay because it's an unsafe item all right and waiting one more day okay because you don't know when skin cancer will attack me okay waiting one more day is not acceptable thank you councilmember and that is exactly the story we've been hearing for a year if you had waited not filed your lawsuit we would have settled there are plenty of signs on 5th street on the lawns stop the lawsuit let's talk about is too mild a word it is talking from both sides of your mouth you either are with the residents or you're not and if you're not then stay out of the way we'll take care of it but just stay out i don't care what i'm just trying to say is if you drop that lawsuit if you never filed that lawsuit i've dealt with government's last 20 years of my career and i'm talking about federal state missing this about governments are famous for just pushing the agenda item and making you weary and tired and forget about it i've seen people when i've been here oh over seven years i've seen people in this audience i've seen people in this audience enjoy that image for years and they stopped going i was also told i'm bringing up issues that really don't impact a lot of people okay i don't give a crap and that's another good word okay if you use the beach or not it's your right okay the last word on our town is belair beach all right i want my taxes adjusted because i was told well you're taxed because of the area all right this council needs to stand up and reclaim those lots okay issuing permits and we'll get into this later that one my last comment if you allow me is that the the the problems on those lots especially the 12th street lab only benefit to people commissioner bloom and the new homeowner on the other side those are the only two people who benefit from that 12th street law putting in any cranes or trucks commissioner bloom thinks is his personal parking lot for his cars and his trucks of his business those are the other ones the rest of the ballet town of bel air shore does not benefit from those la from using those lots i can't comment on that thank you yoli i want to play the bs bel air shore card okay we'll call it the bel airship or the bella or the barbara streisand car either way it's bs you're an attorney i'm an attorney listening to tara is an attorney and so is fred reilly an attorney you know damn well that the rule is that their settlement negotiations they're not admissible as evidence i'll tell you there was settlement negotiations ongoing i did what i had to do so did uh debbie ball and rick shock we gave the notice of lawsuit to that city i waited an extra month and a half before filing the lawsuit to see if anyone was going to do anything they didn't have that decency to pick up a phone and call me and acknowledge my letter that's a fact that's a fact and why would they my city manager was out selling me out given bad legal advice but he's not a lawyer telling them it's okay to enforce the law which they are not okay that's our city manager the great white hope that we set across the street to save our skin yeah great job buddy i'll give you a 50 point review this year you deserve to be fired and by the way what miss rodero said about this current information there was a resolution passed by david brought by david daddy's past fortitude of this council and it said in clear uncertain terms bellerop beach is not a part of party to manzo versus badler short now we didn't need two hours to figure that out it was in paragraph two of my lawsuit but i guess nobody made it to paragraph two but have you got the paragraph two it's in bellar short bella beach is not a party to this lawsuit and i don't represent ballard beach and i don't represent the citizens and i don't represent the council and i don't represent the city that's what it says go read and after that thing passed you used city phone city email city time and a city office to contact them to settle a lawsuit that was mine you don't work for me buddy you're not in my law firm who don't represent me and it's defamatory for you to speak on my behalf how dare you who the hell do you think you are point of order granted this is a hostile uh work environment yes it is yes i can say anything hospitality towards the city manager i wanted to stop this law let me give you a piece of law okay you are full of law yeah the law he just said it's a hostile work environment that's what whiny guy said in december two years ago very good reason very good yeah really absolutely guys for a minute [Music] school and i learned it in law school when you're sitting in this chamber and you're discussing legislative stuff what's known as legislative immunity i could say he's incompetent i could say he's corrupt and there's not a damn thing he can do about me because trust me if there was he would have been sued a long time ago for the he said about me all right so don't look that one up go ask your city attorney if i'm running can we all just calm down please yeah we'll calm down city attorney you want to say something well i want to say a lot of things the first one i will say is if you're going to entertain any sort of thing related to the city attorney the city clerk or the city manager my recommendation to you is to have it be an agenda item so that in a future meeting people can come and speak pro and con and you consider in lynn's case and in my case there's a contract so it would be prudent for the city council if they're ever going to consider that not to do it on the score of the moment but to have the contract in front of them so you could have some idea of what the ramifications would be if you ever make a change so that's the first thing second thing is i i've sat here for now two years and the hostility level is has increased throughout those two years and there is a certain decorum that has to be present in a courtroom or in a local government meeting in order for people to effectively do the job that they're supposed to do the the young lady came forward and shared information with you and it in essence was information that relates to the city and city business and to me i sit here uh and listened because a lot of that was news to me i don't i'm not aware of it and i sat here and listened to it i listened as a professional and listened impartially which is what somebody should do with being presented with that information if in lin's case i have to say on his behalf he has not said a word yet concerning the things that have been said and i don't know but my guess would be he didn't know this was coming up and it is in essence and a for one of a better phrase a situation where he's blindsided by something that he was not aware of would be presented this weekend me saying that doesn't say a word about the merit of what was presented i don't know whether that's all correct or not i'm not taking any of it as being correct although it may be a thousand percent correct but y'all can't get things done because you can't hold a meeting without there being a tremendous hostility and it is extremely difficult to get the work done that needs to be done for the city so robin asked several times for a pause i would encourage you to take a few minutes have a break and folk then come back and focus on doing the work of the city commission council and go through the agenda and address the agenda items that's my suggestion and i'm not supposed to be the referee as a city attorney i've told that to you many many times and i sit here thinking people are expecting me to jump in and come uh pull the combatants apart y'all y'all earlier had an issue where frank asked to put something forward and that was a reasonable request and as i think robin said you are going to in good faith uh have allow him to do that i mean in good faith let other people have a chance to talk and bring the the hostility level down because it doesn't make it easier to do these meetings it makes it substantially harder robin you want to make a motion i make the motion that we take a five or ten minute break ten minute break second seven discussion eddie all in favor all right close 10 minute break not the available yes ma'am from here please so we can't hear you i'm sorry you can barely hear it when the mic is working i just need your name and i'm darlene gray at 108 12th street um just to say i'm not a rabble browser point number didn't you give your minutes to uh yes okay oh okay one order is well founded then sorry yep sorry thank you say what no yeah if you give the minutes away then you can't thank you sorry about that all right any other citizen comments yes i first want to mention oh i'm sorry jules chandler hibiscus drive west thank you for that mentioning taking a break because that was very much needed and i was on city council and i've been here since kathy mortensen was on city council so i'm a long time resident of bella beach council members do not always agree with one another and that's fine because you are all individual people but i have never seen such disrespect for other council members unless it goes that person's way and then it's well clapping is not allowed but clapping is now allowed or attack attack attack it's not it's not kind it's not nice and it's not acceptable our attorney talked about decorum i mean this is bella bel air beach is it has become and is continuing to become for the last two years a laughingstock it's a laughingstock at the big c meetings we've listened to people's conversations there and it's council member glenn gunn wanted to talk and he wouldn't let him talk because it was something that you disagreed with you don't always agree with what when i was on council i i brought it heads with with mr gunn and i told him when he got on council i said you know i respect you you turned my thinking around i was willing to have my thinking turned around i'm not so conceited to think that i am always the right one i'm just saying think about what you say but you know it's like i would tell my children when they were younger it's not what you said it's how you said it i've never seen such disgusting behavior by adults this is my last meeting i know mayor you'll be very happy with that but you know i'm just i mean some of you left i know it's funny it's downright laughable it's disgusting thank you [Music] any other citizen governments mr 22nd street um it's been several months since council reviewed a contract for audio services upgrades for this room and council was somewhat unanimous in requesting that the city manager go back out and rebid everything to include a few other things that weren't in the original specs to be bid on and i wonder if the city manager in his comments at this meeting would please give us an update as to where that process stands right now as of this meeting because we seem to continue to have a problem being the fact that you got to be within one inch directly in front of the microphone you know like i said it's been several months and i've heard nothing so if we could just get an update at this meeting that's all you want um remember we have an open dialogue not just on the one issue so i just heard him say that he could address this so if you'd like i'll have him speak with you right now please all right okay um mr reeves and i have been working with uh with two companies one company is a wiring company and the other company is on board they are going to put in the multimedia equipment so so basically what's happened is the goal is to put patty's desk near that outlet there and then put the podium near that out there oh no it's the other way around okay the wiring is the issue with the way that the floor is okay encore has asked for a certain type of wiring it needs to be a certain distance has to be a certain depth in the floor and basically the wiring contractor has been tasked with finding something that will not tear up this room so we don't have to come in here with a jackhammer and basically kill the floor so it's not real easy to find what we're looking for but he is looking for it and i haven't heard from him lately have you it the the wiring has been put in the audio visual first of it was 15 000 we went back and got the second bid uh it's and it was discussed at the budget meeting last month there's 36 000 set up in the next year's budget uh for the upgrades and that the council discussed that last month and we'll be doing the preliminary approval tonight it's a it's a big deal to do basically to do what we're trying to accomplish which is to make sure that everyone here can hear what we're doing people at home can look or see or hear what we're doing and if citizens want to comment either here or from their house we would like to be able to hear them that way also so it's not a real simple task it's very easy whenever it's one computer and you're sitting at your at your desktop at home but whenever you're trying to entertain a large group like this it's it's expensive it requires a lot of microphones uh it's it's a it's a big deal in fact the gentleman back there running the camera can probably testify to that it's not that easy he wasn't paying attention but i think he would probably agree with me has when you said the wiring has been put in on the floor already okay and that was the that was the hole though that was the uh the hard part i think the rest of it was just securing the equipment that that was a cheap part but that was the harder part i believe just finding the did you cut it i mean uh no no there's conduits in the floor we just had to make some changes to the brighter box lids that you see there we had to make some changes to that and pull some wire into that room and wire up the ball and uh it's it's been done it was like 700 [Music] thank you all thank you mr hanzo anyone else advanced way uh 7th street on the beach i just want to say that if citizens want to talk out we talk about transparency we talk about sunshine laws and we post things in a timely manner so people have a chance to speak on issues but when the citizens are told or or even spoke to or down to and called rubble rousers how does that make people want to speak out how does that make people want to come to these meetings and when when did this council stop thinking about its citizens who voted them in and just remember if you want to be voted back in you need to start doing the work of the city and stop trying to appease other people thank you thank you [Music] any other citizen comments seeing no other hands on my close citizen comments with the presentation uh sheriff i said two sheriffs someone will make a presentation tonight yes sir okay please come up margin sorry hey commissioners thank you uh my name is randy sergeant randy hart um here with the beach i'm new to this city uh coming out here so the first time i've come through here um real quick your city is going to save us in pinellas county uh the last actually in the month of july you had five arrests two being uh simple batteries two being duis and one being water and prowling with a possession of control again if you want to save the city of pinellas county i really don't have much more to say but just keep up the good work with your citizens here if i had a couple things for you number one and i'm not sure if it was my copy and i'll check with the other council members it looks like everything got cut off on the report that we got did anybody else get a full report or we have cut off reports everybody's cut off okay so we need complete reports because mine ends at july 20 20 year to date i don't have a full um report so sheriff i'm sure you gave us one but i think in the duplication must have gotten truncated or something here i have a question for you and by the way excellent job again um with keeping the crime rate low and that also i always compliment the citizens too because they're your eyes and ears on their bumping in the ground and let you know when something's missed i get and it's available to everyone it's nothing special that i get but pinellas county will send you crime reports at any city that you want and i was looking at there's some crime reports for july 1st july 2nd july 20th two or domestic violence one is fraud and none of that appears on this report here does this report only show i'll say the heavier crimes and maybe knocks out some of the lesser ones is that how it works whatever is considered out of the unified crime reports okay that's what the fbi is concerned about that's the major one that you're gonna get uh delivered in that graph okay so i mean just so the citizens know it's still an excellent thing but you know in that month we had the way i was reported to me you have two domestic violences and one fraud so you know there is other stuff going on in the city just to be aware of and um you know but i don't think it changes anything here we still have a very good report so great job to you and everyone on the in the office in the department thank you any other council comments any citizen questions for the sheriff thank you sheriff thank you i'm for forward now at a public hearing ordinance 2105 and ordinance of

there you bring it to the back corner everybody smells it so bad ordinance but anyway it's on second reading so that's my opinion i'm with you frank anybody else uh citizens get your hands inputs john hanson 27th street in this ordinance it says in part lawn and or landscape maintenance and then it builds the property within the city's prohibited um 6 p.m at 7 00 am weekdays so do you want to just citing the where exactly you're out so we can find it here i'm on page two and section two at the very top of the uh proposed ordinance i guess what my main question is this i'm too cheap to hire a lawn service so you're telling me it just passes i can't cut my entry in my grass on sunday [Music] well the way this reads it prohibits between the hours of 6 pm and 7 a.m weekdays and sundays i get that and all day on sundays and the various holidays john i'll give you plenty of information here says such prohibition shall not prevent property owner members of the property owners immediate family or anyone residing on the property from working on his or her property for construction remodeling alterations repairs maintenance and loan and or landscaping maintenance so long as such property owner or other authorized person as the force said complies with all other provisions of this code such as excessive noise or other nuisances may be available so i think we're okay okay i just wanted to be sure is that every let's turn to the city attorney for clarification on that that's i should be making that determination is that what this order says this is a valid question i cut my law on sunday i don't feel like getting a ticket i think the uh over a period of time you all changed this and the clarification was added about the property owner's immediate family so you would be able to do one on some okay property owner and their immediate family can cut their lawn do maintenance thanks to the mail to do whatever they want to do it's the outside contractors that we're trying to stop oh i was clear about that okay i want to make sure but your cabin vote for this i mean because monday is a tragedy for us and you know that's the way i read it i know the city attorney seems to agree so i think we're all right thank you okay thank you do you have a code enforcement person working on something um we can't it's it's subject we're gonna actually talk about that uh i'm gonna i think we need to hold up how we're doing code enforcement here but one of the whole reasons why we went to city to the sheriff was so that we had coverage on weekends occasionally we don't want to advertise exactly when they're out there but yes the answer is yes that can be any other citizen comments i'll come back to council last words anyone okay then a whole question word news 2106

item 12. authorize the city manager authorize the city manager to execute the contract for law enforcement services with pinellas county sheriff for fiscal year 2021-22 this is to authorize the contractor pcso for law enforcement services it's a 522 072 contract first the motion uh motion by slope second second second by david gaddis yes mayor console this is uh the annual contract for the sheriff's services for next fiscal year we've discussed this at the budget work section and the cost and i'm recommending approval the contract was reviewed by the city attorney council i'll go this is what i want the citizens to hear our police services cost went up 3.6 this year nothing wrong with that that's actually a little bit below the cost of living but there has been a lot of discussion particularly with council member aki brought this up several times about the allocation to bellaire shore and guess what belair shore police cost went down this year and i don't know why i heard in that meeting there was no information given you know we've asked for computations on how this is uh how this is computed but i don't know why ours would go up and theirs would go down i'm not saying theirs is wrong i'm questioning is ours right so to the city manager yeah the sheriff the sheriff computes that based on the population that's that's what they shared with me and the computation course our population is i think it's 60 25 and so whatever the population of bellaire sure was that's how they became a number did we check it did we recompute this did we verify these numbers i've verified them with captain liner just to double check to make sure that that's how it was done and he told me yes i'd like to see the computation i'd like to have that given to the council well actually a few months ago you were given that a budget hearing but i'll get you another copy yeah because i wasn't aware theirs was going down that's what's news to me and that was at their meeting so my question is is our population we've got a lot more houses here our population's going to go up they've got about 58 houses we're going to keep going backwards against them every year but you know how the sheriff does it is on population is there any other options why don't they do it on calls or time spent i i thought there was an email from captain lawrence explaining that there's some magic formula calls number calls and contacts are in their badging performance yeah there was there was you asked for that information that captain milan got it and we had this discussion if we were going to do a separate contract and pay for a full-time deputy which we had this discussion right we decided against that and you decided against that and you know we don't personally compute what the sheriff does we're given what our contract numbers are and i provided he provides a worksheet which was given to you at one of the budget sessions it would be a lot helpful for approving a contract to have that even if you give it before the budget which is this thick you know that we have that information supporting that contract rather than having to go through you know three inches four inches of paper i do remember seeing this paper coming through but i don't remember the computation i don't remember seeing how it actually wound up so not a problem that was my question so okay any other council comments right what's the alternative if we don't go with the sheriff you have to start you need to start your own or you can uh see if someone else would uh would do it for us the last time we tried that was me a couple years ago i reached out to clearwater they weren't interested i think the only other closer ones that are nearby here would be president bel-air right i did that i think that you could use i don't think largo was close enough to make it work so um of course starting our own i think lynn had gotten a number and i independently computed it we were pretty darn close on the numbers and it was darn close to a million dollars to do our own overall yeah so it was almost between a rock and park kind of that's what you get when you display well when we disbanded the police department we were spending about between 650 and 700 000 and the first year the sheriff came here we were spending i want to say it was a little under 400 000. my point is that 3.6 isn't a heavy increase i don't i think there was one home torn down on balor shores there so their population when it went down i think he was a renter uh do you do you know the percentage went down over there no what i recollect and i'll i'll dig that out and send it to all of us but what i recollected was just a few numbers and our population went up citizens no citizen comments back to council any last words okay so item 12 authorize the city manager to execute the contract for law enforcement services with pinellas county sheriff for the fiscal year 2021 through 2022. this is authorized the contract to pcso for law enforcement services 522 072 for our share i'll do this as a voice vote i believe that's okay correct patty yes okay all in favor aye aye anyone post seven to zero contract is approved i am 13 authorize the city manager to execute the contract for code enforcement services with pinellas county sure for fiscal year 2021 2022 is the authorized contract to pcso for code enforcement services motion please submit your smoke second second second dave gaddis rita i'm going to turn it over to our city manager mayor council this is a request to execute the contract for fiscal year 20 21 to 22 at the rate of 49.80 per hour we have a budgeted amount of 52 000 where the sheriff's deputy will be here more uh more often and we will rotate to the question earlier uh some sundays [Music] any other comments questions citizens counsel last word yeah i think i think these guys work too cheap want to talk to your fop about it frank [Music] they'll raise the price okay any other comments all right i'm 13 authorize the city manager to execute the contract for code enforcement services with pinellas county sheriff for fiscal year 2021 through 2022 yes both passes this all in favor aye aye anyone opposed seven zero passes item 14 execute authorize the city manager execute an extension to the memorandum of understanding for accounting services explanation authorized an extension and a three percent increase of the mou with andro uh tess cpa for accounting services motion second second yeah this being smoke again i'll turn it over to the city manager yes uh this is a request to authorize the extension of the mou with the accounting services we currently use in their original agreement they have it stipulated three percent increase that's all they're asking for and uh i think this has been very effective over the last two years that we've used them and it has been an improvement in the accounting and budgeting plus it saved the city about over 70 thousand dollars total this is a good thing you're very satisfied and i know i think everyone else working here is satisfied with their services correct yes we have no reason to bid this out at this point in time correct okay do we feel that this is a competitive price yes i i do feel you know there's only a couple people that do this and we would have to go back we'd either have to go back to a person like we had or we'd have to try to find another company that might do it so i i think this is fair you don't think i mean and i don't want to make a move necessarily just because of cost savings when we're satisfied with somebody example when we talk about the garbage folks we pay them a little bit more than the others because they do excellent work i think i've always heard that these folks have done excellent work i have not heard anything to the contrary no no and we call them and need something on a day that they're not here they'll either come here or we'll do it remotely so i think it's a good situation council any other comments citizens back to council it's an authorization for the city manager to execute an extension to the memorandum of understanding for accounting services authorized an extension and a three percent increase of the mlu with android test cpa for accounting services for the coming year do voice vote all in favor aye anyone opposed seven zero passes that contract is approved item 15 authorize the city manager to execute an interlocal agreement with the building division of pinellas county building and development review services department authorized contract with county for permit services motion please tell me second yes uh this the new building official pronounced county has asked for the interlocal agreements to be updated the only change to our analytical agreement is that they will no longer participate in our variance request or typically they were part of a board of adjustment that would be something that we'll have to do in-house or we'll use our engineer to do uh but other than that it's the same analytical agreement that the last one was executed in 2015 and this is just a re-extended they do all our building services permits and things so that was the question i had for you because i noticed that there and i know in coming to the board of adjustment hearings they would always be here so who takes their place now we have to go out and pay for is that something that the person do the application would pay for that engineer to come here well we would probably use who we're using for site plan engineering to to give us a comment so there would be a cost there but on the other hand the uh we charge a fee for a bearings and i think i feel pretty comfortable that we can the amount of fee that we collect we can absorb that it's not going to be a very excessive expense to a property please monitor that if it becomes an issue come back and we'll adjust the fig yeah because we shouldn't lose on this and i did note that they you know because i remember the man used to be right here and you know he would he would give whatever advice was necessary now i guess there's nothing stopping since this is a quasi-judicial thing they could i guess if they really wanted to subpoena the person to come in but that's up to the applicant not up to us we don't need that person uh other than having the engineer could probably take their place is what they're saying right and and realistically uh in the past all all the county really did was verify what we had already verified uh you know as an example if it was a doc permit it was x amount of feet you know they would come in and our site plan engineer would deny it and if it was closer than it was supposed to be and then uh we would just ask the county for there and put on it to verify that we were following the ordinance correctly [Music] citizens any comments act counsel any last words item 15 authorized the city manager to execute an interlocal agreement with the building division of pinellas county building and development review services department he has both passes this all in favor aye [Music] 16 authorized city managed to execute contract addendum for residential single-family multi-family residential complex solid waste collection services contract addendum with waste management inc of florida motion place slope second second thank you let's leave it slow i'll go ahead and turn it over to the city city manager yes mayor council uh this is uh extension well the contract's there this is just an increase in charges to us we do not have to increase any fees for our residents we'll be able to absorb them into the current uh crash production fee that we already charged but they have an option in their contract that they can increase it four percent per year which uh there's some back up in here that shows you their calculations and also they have a if the tipping fees at pinellas county go up they can charge us a little so what they've estimated uh the cost to be if in the back if you look at cpi index increase that they're asking for is the four percent which is the maximum even though the cpi changed 5.79 when we did this contract a couple years ago we negotiated that limit so it couldn't go above it a couple years ago the inflation rate so they didn't get any increase last year they did and did you not absorb this last year when you were able to absorb the rate increase i believe right yes are you saying there's you're going to be able to do that again this year fairly fair okay did you check i know the cpi numbers are cpi numbers that's from the government but do we i know we have an option of checking these tipping fees and dumping statistics do you have anything on that yeah the county sends that out to all the cities when they increase the fees okay so that comes directly from the county right okay so we're not taking waste management's word on it we're getting that from the county okay that's my question so there's going to be their price is going up but the citizens should not see an increase increase excellent i could not vote for that any council comments citizens frank you still think it's too low i'm just kidding okay all right uh any other last comments i am 16 authorized city manager to execute contract addendum for residential single family multi-family residential complex solid waste collection services waste management inc of florida uh yes vote passes this all in favor all right anyone opposed 7-0 passes city manager you're authorized to receive okay back into the regular agenda now on to the taxes so we are item 17. that is this tax package here um consideration of adoption of proposed mad valor millage rate for fy 2021 2022 this is the first public hearing on setting proposed final millage rate for fy 2021 2022 city manager there used to be a dialogue that i had to read it which is the proposed military yes okay i'm reading that now no first we're getting a motion right yes okay motion please [Music] yeah i would like to say i'm going to go with the staff's recommendation and we've all talked about this in the budget meetings i'm going to go ahead and say that we should stick with the 2.0394 council looking for that page here all right i've never voted for a tax increase and i'm not going to start this year this is a 7.5 increase in budget our cpi we just heard was 5.79 so why can't our city live within the same budget that the rest of the world does and for those of you on social security with john 1 you did not get a 7.5 increase last year let me give you a little history of how this city spends your money okay in 2013 our net revenue was seven hundred thirty three thousand one hundred seventy eight dollars two thousand fourteen eight hundred twenty four thousand eight seventy eight ninety seven two thousand fifteen eight hundred seventy six thousand seven sixty two thousand sixteen thirty 933 197. listen folks it keeps going up and up and up and up until this year it's at 1 000 251 815 taxes have increased 70 percent spending has increased 70 percent since 2013 and none of your none of your wages increased like that none of your cost of living's increased like that anybody who gets any kind of kicker on to their social security or anything else didn't get that we play this game we play the shell game we keep your millage the same yes we do we have done that for 12 you know since 2013 and every year your property values has gone up now that's great i'm glad property values is going up but the property values are doing the dirty work this is a multiplication formula if you remember from third or fourth grade math okay a times b equals c well whether we keep whether you raise a or b you're still paying it in c and c is your taxes your taxes are going up it's the village that stays the same but your property values go up and the hall from this city like i say 2013 we ran the city with 733 000 now takes us a million to 51. and what's really disappointing is that our friends in washington are sending us like eight hundred thousand dollars this year to use for our infrastructure so i don't want to hear that this is like for the you know gonna be to cover all these capital projects and if you forgot there was a storm water feed tacked onto that garbage bill that you get every month okay that takes care of your storm order tax increase tax and spend tax and spend i'm not for it i'm not voting for it jody shirley used to be with me on this i hope there's others that will join me i'm not voting for this anyone else counsel i agree with you mr mayor uh the way florida works as you stay with the taxes order with the property versus you know your taxes i don't think there should be need for any increase and that's called the rollback right so we have the option of going to the rollback rate which says we live with what we brought in last year and we make some strategic cuts maybe we don't buy that fifty six thousand dollar sign for outside maybe we don't piss away some of this money like we like to do frank bankert said you shouldn't be in the business of doing festivals you know what when we were doing it for free i had no problem with it but i joined him we shouldn't be spending thousands of dollars for this not the entertainment business we're a city not big enough to do this kind of stuff but if we can get sponsors then let's do it so i'm not voting for this thank you mr banker anyone else like that i mean support of keeping the page rate the same i mean we just discussed the 3.6 increase in the sheriff office contract to to think that the housing market is going to continue to increase obviously it's not that's the reality of the situation we have seen detrimental budgets here with the housing market decrease so if you rolled this thing back now because you're afraid of a tax increase how are you going to explain it when you do have to really increase taxes to cover the city expenses we spent three work sessions trying to trim the budget and you were there in all those discussions so i mean we're all duplicit in maybe not controlling those expenses to meet your expectations but the reality of the situation is our expenses are not frozen in time they're continuing to go up and to think that we can just freeze our revenues or roll them back and cover all the expenses i think it's up to the residents to be stakeholders and making this city continue to move forward and prosper and do the things we want to do to make it a premier city i am not in favor of all my practice this military thank you if housing goes down like it did in 2008 then we can readdress it um i don't see a crash in the market coming within the year i believe our tax base is always a year behind anyway so here what's the average age of this town 58 57 55 okay a lot of retirees here fixed income um i just don't i just don't support any type of tax increase you know you want to start cutting money on optional stuff how many of you all have a gas generator in your house i put my hand down i don't have one my lights go out we go dark we get hot that's the way it goes what are you doing in here for a hundred plus thousand dollars there's a hundred grand there's your savings just hold back on spending that capital money there you go we don't even have to lay a person off we don't have to cut hours we don't have to take out the pencil and really sharpen it which we could do if we want to as a council okay we said we wouldn't increase the tax rate but today the rubber meets the road okay when we put the last budget hearing through we said you the way things work whatever you tell the county you're locked into that and that's what you get on your trip notice that's the highest we can go so we can't go higher than the military that we have here but we can go lower so i'm saying go lower listen um true we can't go lower at the final budget here again september 20th um we can't go if we go back to the rollback rate we can go below that we can do this we can always go back lower later and i don't think it makes sense to do the rollback break at this point we've never done it that way before i'd like to have the comments this is exactly the same argument we had last year what we're doing is we're playing it safe this is the proposed mill is ready and it's better to be somewhere where we have a little bit of a safety net rather than to roll it back to a to a value that if something happens we can't dig out of i just we have the same one every year we're not increasing your taxes your property value does go up we'll just wait and see what happens oh i beg to differ you are increasing taxes you're not increasing the millage rate but as i gave the example a times b equals c a being the village rate b b the value of your house your house values went up your taxes are going up unless you roll back the military that's the rollback rate we can come to the same number that we had last year but we don't want to uncle joe has given us 800 000 folks 800 000 to use for infrastructure and storm water hear anybody up here talking about like knocking off your stomata fee you can do that look i don't hear so i want to hear from the council i want to hear from the citizens your taxes are going up listen it's not going to break you okay it's another 10 15 bucks whatever it's going to be for the basic house and hire higher nicer houses are gonna pay a little bit more but it's coming up every year folks every darn year taxes i'm tired of it i'm not voting for it yes sir well just before just concerned we had no other council comments thank you mayor council run scan it down on drive i just want to remind you i was part of citizen finance committee and we spent a lot of time digging deep into the finances of the city i started with support holding the middle drink the same i think a lot of actions that the city's taken such as increasingly uh fees of the marina or the rental charges that have gone up it's just the natural thing that costs are going to go up so i'm protecting this uh nobody planned for your uncle joe gift and so let's use that as a gift and and soccer use it for the infrastructure if we save money we've got into reserves over the last few years so i'd recommend keeping it where it is let's remind everybody that county did roll back their rate so it's probably a net offset so it's a flight for the whole between the counties giving up what we're going to fly so that's my position thank you citizens any other comments yes sir thank you jeff keith harper i keep hearing about this value increase and i look at my new assessment and it comes up 100 grand less than last year does anybody else see anything like that a lot of it has to do with what your neighbors are doing that your property value is adjusted accordingly it's just you know it's an overall the overall value for our we get this from the tax collector and the tax properties appraiser beginning of the year we look at the whole city not each individual house so yours might have went down up down somebody else's went up perhaps there was a change or something incorrect it's based on your individual assessment but overall the city's went higher so yours will probably go your tax will probably go down that is the second part of the question is the taxes won't go down because it's a recapture on the homestead well so they don't go down regardless of the value going up our values keep rising whether we raise the millage or not so my taxes will go up the value went down okay that's one point you're correct there's a save our homes cap and you have it's limited to three three percent every year so we've been getting increases of four percent five percent six percent if you've been here for some time which i think you have you're proper you've you're under and so am i so i've been here for a while and so a lot of people have lived here and even if even if the property values went down like if the market crashed it still could be going up for a little while until you get equilibrium so right yes the line's going down now i'm going up that's that's just the point uh i saw my property go down 50 from the time i bought it and it came up well above that so okay thanks you're correct on that yes sir so kenneth's staying beyond 1212 street um i think mayor manson has the right idea here um the meal rate in among itself and the property value the ultimate tax in and of itself is not necessarily the point i think the point is we should live within our means why should we keep on looking at getting more money into the city um just to spend it i know there are projects that need to be done there are services that need to be provided um but at the same time the mindset should be to bring that in and why should it go up and up and up all the time um i come from sweden i've lived under very high taxes same things happen over there and you don't get money back you give to the government there's an inefficiency there so i want to keep my money and make choices on my own i understand that we live in a community we need to help each other there are certain services that we need to provide so i'd rather i'd rather talk about what can we cut that is inefficient than we're the traits and values thank you thank you any other citizen comments see no other hands on closeness and comments and bring it back to council for final comments all right how much money did we used to get in those beach lots for fines and revenues that we're not getting now it i couldn't give you a specific number because at the time that they were doing that uh a lot of those tickets were being sent to the sheriff's office we didn't take that in-house till i was here like a year and i said i'm not getting any money from parking tickets and i said i'll just collect in my ourselves and but you know it was i think we did a study but i don't recollect the number 900 or fifteen hundred bucks that we could have done counsel any other comments yes yes the portion of the taxes that you pay on property correctly but my understanding is only 12 of the property taxes that you pay on their home goes to the city of delaware beach everything else goes to the count okay so only 12 comes back to the city now we talk about the increases of our home values and that's that's taking place and that's a good thing but i think it's narrow minded to think that that's just because of whatever you're doing on your property is increasing those property guys i think you are a stakeholder in making this a prosperous desirable city to live in and that's what's driving the property manager so i think it's incumbent upon everybody they take be a stakeholder ahead and bear sharing and to think that we can just enjoy the increases in property values and not have to pay out or address the expenses again and go back to the duplicity of this council we've had three budget work sessions and we had our opportunity to trim those expenses and here we are and i get once again we're just talking about children i don't agree with that you know what's ironic we heard that the county is using the rollback right county figured out how to do it anybody think pinellas county is not a well-run county got all kinds of problems with it tell you what you know this county runs pretty darn good particularly when you compare it against the other counties they do a darn good job in fact every month at the mayor's council meeting there's a county commissioner and almost unanimously and this is hard to get all mayors to agree on anything there's compliments and it's not a political thing because sometimes it's democrats sometimes it's a republican it doesn't seem to matter everybody's pretty satisfied with the work that's happening with the county that goes to the board of ed too they've been doing a really good job the education department so um they figured out how to do it we can figure out how to do it we cut this thing on one night if we have to so i don't bite by that we can't go back and fix this we can fix it right now are there other municipalities rolling back there another break now i i don't believe so all right very few okay any of the council comments and let's call the question and uh we're going to do this by roll i want this recorded um so this is consideration of adoption of the pro proposed ad valorem millage rate for fy 2021 through 2022 now in you want me to read that little no no the the staff just where it says recommendation yeah that's what you agree i read in your staff record your recommendation oh yeah yeah yeah you're you're right the dark yeah okay so here's what i have to add the proposed millage rate of 2.0394 mils which is higher than the rolled back rate by 7.04 is to fund the expenses of the general fund for

makes that motion second second second free to swap leslie i will turn it over to city manager city managers yes uh mayor this is the budget that we discussed at three different uh budget work sessions and you had some revisions of the july 19th and august 16th and i'll just highlight those uh the increased contractual service with the sheriff for 53 000 we decreased staff and code enforcement by 39 620 we increased the audio visual upgrade six thousand dollars to make it a total of thirty six thousand in capital projects we increase the generator 40 000 increased property and liability insurance 4 100 in non-departmental decreased personnel services in non-departmental 22 392 deleting the part-time administrative system we increased the insurance in the marina fund of 600 and we changed the stormwater fund as follows the increased stormwater expense a hundred thousand dollars for that mandated state bill house bill 53 that we'll have to put out to bid the effect of all these changes for the budget your fy 2122 consisting of five million ninety three thousand three hundred thirty dollars two million eight hundred and nineteen thousand three hundred thirty dollars in the general fund [Music] hundred and 86 dollars in the marina fine five hundred ninety four dollars and five hundred ninety four thousand one hundred thirty dollars in the storm water fund and one million five hundred ninety three thousand 190 in the capital projects fund just to clarify that large number in the capital project there that is it's budgeted because it's the pinellas pending for malice money that's for the boulevard underground which is 900 000 from that so that numbers uh so staff respectfully request that the city council approve the 20 122 budget including the capital plan a copy that budget was provided you with the changes attached for your view the florida department of revenue requires specific language and procedures we're improving the budget so i can start there we're only going to read it once this time though because it looks like i only have to do it after the motion which makes no sense but we should do it before um okay so uh i think it's pretty clear in the budget we've gone over it multiple times that multiple i hearings and put a good description in here of what the changes are and i believe we should approve it as as presented counsel again i can't support this okay support this is to support the tax increase i'm not going to support the tax increase i'm not going to support this budget um now that it's so wrong but it could be tighter and so i'll be voting for this one any other council comments citizens you know citizen comments back to council last word leslie mataro if she wants one okay you got it item 18 is consideration of

providing for several ability providing for the repeal of all ordinances in conflict here with and providing for an effective day this is to allow discussion of pending litigation and prospective litigation we'll have a motion so the literature by david a second thank you secondly uh david um while on earth are we rehashing section 2-63 in january fred reilly went into great detail to explain how section 2-63 legally protects our city and how we already are able to address prospective and ending litigation the state of florida recognized this sunshine law was problematic for elected officials concerned with litigation to address the problem the florida legislature amended the sunshine law to allow government audience to meet in private to discuss pending litigation in january fred reilly detailed the shade meeting process and how it was used as fast painting litigation if you recall we recently had a shade meeting to discuss pending litigation section 2-63 was never mentioned and the meeting was held without ever being challenged in january mr riley also told us exactly why section 2-63 was put into place he made it very clear that discussing any litigation in public meetings is dangerous why would any council member want to put this city in danger from a constitutional perspective most would agree that as citizens sections 2-section 2-63 trials on our first amendment rights as council members however is free speech from the dais in the city's best interest when dealing with perspective or pending litigation i would say that it is not as elected officials we must hold ourselves to a higher standard florida's sunshine law expects it and our code ordinances expects it back in january our city attorney conveyed that same message of holding us to a higher standard he said that as council members we had an obligation to protect the interest of the city as you may know this debate over section 2-63 was recently sparked back to life when a council member attempted to create a resolution based around current pending litigation in the city's best interest section 2-63 prevented the resolution from ever making it to the council for debate it did its job so how do we handle prospective litigation the drafters of section 2-63 realize that discussions of prospective litigation in public meetings could also be perilous mr reilly told us how he handles prospective litigation simply by contacting each of us individually with the same details and recommended courses of action allowing discussions and prospective pending litigation in public meetings can have devastating effects on our city and council with little or no warning a council member may not realize that he or she has been baited to say the wrong thing until after the words have been spoken by then it's too late as mr riley has implied section 2-63 was designed to protect us from ourselves therefore this rule should remain as it is currently written it gives the city attorney and the chair full authority to rule out of order when necessary which prevents the possibility of admissions against interest as council members we are obligated to protect our city section 2-63 was added years ago for that very reason to protect our city today i'm asking each of you to do what is best for our city by voting no on this ordinance so when it's in the city's interest to stifle first amendment rights that's okay this city just doesn't learn does it didn't i read you twice federal constitutional law section 1983. didn't four of you get that mailed right to your house and a bunch of other people in the city see it just because it's convenient or the city doesn't like what might be said you don't lose your first amendment rights when you become an elected official period no exception now if you're so darn concerned about declarations against interest why don't you deal with the city employees i'm not going to talk about lawsuit i'm going to read books in the newspaper lynn reeves he stressed however that the city council members were within their right to essentially fire van scoy she took the position on the parks board and acted like she was a city employee then she tried to use her position to get people who worked in another city to be fired that's not what you do reeves said reefs the city manager never went to law school he doesn't speak for this city just made a damn declaration against interest that buried this city and you people who are in this lawsuit should be screaming right now because he did not help her case by saying that he's factually wrong and he's legally wrong that's all we'll talk about i brought emotion and i'll tell you what the motion was about the motion was to have the three people that were on this council playing gun david gaddis and riaz voluntarily resigned we can't force you to resign it was a motion to ask the people to resign and i was stopped from bringing it my first amendment rights were trampled 1983. sound familiar you're going to get a second suit out of your first lawsuit if you keep it up this was a compromise that's what this was and i said it last time and it's in the minutes that we just passed through this was a compromise for me to withdraw that motion to allow the city to allow the elected officials not to have to deal with an unconstitutional law they talk about this all we want you can't enforce this law but in the interest of having sanity and having meetings that run right we want to get this right now with regard to the shade deal that was an illegal meeting [Music] city attorney didn't say anything about it i didn't really realize it until later on this we shouldn't have had to shave you because the rule says you're not allowed to discuss litigation period shade meeting sure the state says you can do this into shape and by that i mean we all get together we dismiss everyone from here we bring a court reporter in there's a record taken of what we said but it doesn't become evidence until after the case is settled or tried it allows the council to settle cases it allows the council to determine strategy as a matter of fact with this declaration against interest i'm going to be asking for a shade meeting so that we can go over proper strategy for our employees i want the two attorneys to come here and explain why we shouldn't be making statements like this because it's detrimental to our city don't tell me i'm trying to help june this doesn't help june one day mayor can i say a few comments when i'm finished you can sure okay but right now i have the floor i'll recognize you as soon as i finish okay this was a compromise if you want to change your law that's unconstitutional change it if you want to vote it down that's fine you do what you do and i'll do what i do but i know my motion didn't get hurt it got shot down before it ever saw the light of dead and for the record city manager had no problem with that city attorney told me that i would possibly be facing charges well i can't as an attorney be facing charges so i can't do the civil disobedience thing i wish i could but i can't but there's other ways to take care of this you stop me from talking that you don't get to do not if it benefits the city not if it hurts the city you don't stop your city manager from talking [Music] i urge you to pass this and as i said i am a man of my word i will drop the motion i don't intend to bring that motion this was a compromise but i want this ball fixed you don't want to fix it no problem no problem frederick well there will be a problem but no problem no problem tonight just arrived okay well i'll make several comments one one is i sit here and listen and i purposely don't interrupt elected officials because it's my understanding that elected officials need to have as long as it's any sunshine meaning the opportunity to say things to each other and i don't prejudge what y'all are going to say to each other that's the reason why i don't interrupt people constantly and as i've told you many times that's not my role my role is not to sit here and be the referee for the seven of you that's up to y'all again at times i i don't know what to do with this group of people it is the attorney i'll say a few things one today the current law is in effect so i would suggest to the council you shouldn't discuss any pending litigation so that's a blanket statement if you choose to ignore it then that's up to you i strongly encourage you to not discuss pending litigation so that's one foundation point the other thing is i can give a uh long detailed explanation of the met or the the [Music] um resolution that i was asked to draft but i'm not going to do that i'm going i wrote a lengthy email if you want to know what that was all about you can read the email it's a public record the uh short version of the resolution is that it did ask for people to resign and i presented in the email which was a legal opinion why i recommended that the person that asked for that resolution reconsider it and i did that consistent with the florida bar rule that i'm supposed to to apply and i applied it i mentioned the rule numerous times it's in the email i don't know the number off the top of my head but it it is a very important rule and i followed it to the the t lynn did not step in and do anything other than talk to me about the resolution that i was asked to prepare i dutifully prepared it and then i presented it to the person that asked for it to be prepared and i presented the lynn and gave my recommendation on this is something that i recommend you reconsider subsequent to that there was a discussion about amending the city code and i prepared an amendment which you have before you and the amendment to the city code is to clarify something so there is no mistaking what uh whether you're complying with florida law or not and to me this was a good solution because it addressed a problem i at that time when i prepared this this ordinance i said there's a far easier way to solve this issue it's to make sure that the city code provision is absolutely consistent with florida law that's what i did so getting off the deep end in the constitutional issues i'm not going to say those are don't matter they certainly do matter but i'm saying i wrote this so that you had a simple straightforward way to address the problem and make sure you're acting consistent with florida law and that's what i did i did not go into extended analysis related to constitutional law issues because i felt this was a far more direct and simple way to address a problem so that's what i did in addition with respect to prospective litigation i i still have a serious concerns about that but i drafted language that i thought would give the city council some parameters so that if you ever had a situation that the city council needed to talk about a potential lawsuit you would have at least some basis to do that so that's that's where this lies um dutifully impressed with vice mayor gavis's research on all the things that i said it sounds like i did a pretty good job um but to me this is a reasonable thing to consider and i think it's a something that the city council should consider and i'll certainly stand for any questions that you may have questions for fred reilly and then we'll come back to your general discussion questions [Music] so mr riley you're comfortable with section two d and the whole entire word the new version yes yes read that slope so you're comfortable with the new version but yeah you are recommending we do not discuss opinion litigation of which i don't feel like we should either another concern i would have is what is one of the council members of family or significant other whomever is the line fire with the lawsuit and then we're going to sit up here and award them the money that that definitely might be a good conflict of interest and i also don't know off the top of my head nor would i because that you incurred to work on that resolution when you simply couldn't just ask because i would have told you no i will not voluntarily resign and you could have saved the city attorney's time energy and the taxpayers some money for the city but that would be a sunshine violation rita and you know nice try i did the same thing that i've done other times i asked lynn what is the procedure you followed in the past and him and i talked about the the resolution that one of the council members has to have or not resolution in this case ordinance no i'm sorry about the resolution and i did what i would after discussing it with lynn did what i was asked to do and then i went the extra step and also did what i'm obligated to do ethically which is address the ethical rule that i did address and that i will tell you took considerably longer because i you know meticulously went through the process of analyzing that and putting it on paper so that i was at the legal position i was taking was absolutely sound and it is absolutely sound i just have one more comment uh you made a statement here that would have been a sunshine law violation i don't see how it would have been if you probably would have stated you know in a city council meeting i wasn't intending for you to ask me and privately because i definitely would not have had that conversation but i just wanted to make sure that general public realized that i i've been in this room that you would publicly state it never clarification no problem and that's not the appropriate way of dealing with such a request we deal within the resolution and i have a right to bring a resolution we talked about a resolution that was brought earlier that could have been avoided by reading second paragraph of my lawsuit we spent an hour and a half doing it so i have every right to bring a motion and a resolution and this was for the city's protection folks this wasn't to punish anybody this is the city's protection i sit here and i hear comments made one camera two cameras three cameras recording everything that's being said where do you think those tapes are lined it up you've made declarations against interest you didn't even know it you don't even realize it sometimes when you say something not you i'm talking about the council in general it'll all come out i'm sure at the appropriate time and let's clarify something i'm not the attorney on this case so stop anyone intimating that because i don't appreciate it it's not my lawsuit i'm actually trying to help this city right now save it for making more battle and bad rules this was a compromise if the council wants to go for it that's fine if they want to reject it i'm fine with that too all right but then i i will have to address the fact that my motion was not heard and then we will get a ruling as to whether your existing law is good or not good i promise you that i [Music] now have looked through it i would be willing to vote for this uh provided that we only added the shade meeting portion of it uh i think that we have no business discussing uh pending or prospective litigation can i explain to you why that's in there i would like to keep it that way let me explain to you why it's in there okay you said that fred can talk with all of us there's actually an issue if he talks with all of us and comes up with a decision there's actually a bridging potential for that which is a sunshine violation the reason why that is in there with his warning and doesn't mean we have to do it we had this happen not too long ago this is concluded litigation so we'll talk about it we had a slip and fall at morgan street we got notice and as i recall it was a very comprehensive notice of lawsuit it was incredible i've never seen one so well put together it had code provisions it had state law provisions about drainage and showers and everything else we got it and instead of heading this off before it got to a lawsuit the whole reason the state gives you uh six months of time between notice of lawsuits or a tort claim and the actual bringing of the suit is so that you can do something about it we sit here and do nothing because we don't want to talk about it because it's going to go away well it doesn't go away it goes to court it goes to trial and when you go to trial the price of poker goes higher because the lawyer has to work more actually i believe that that case linked directly to our insurance company is that correct well what i was about to say is when a case uh notice of a case like the slip and paul case comes in the city has insurance for that and lynn notifies me of the the fact that we got a claim letter and then lynn ships the claim letter to the insurer and the insurer assigns claims counsel and claims counsel evaluates the claim at that point and that that's something is done and that's that's exactly the track it follows and the reason why is at that point i do nothing i other than if the claims council calls me i certainly take the phone call or if he calls lynn lynn takes the phone call and gives him additional information related to to them evaluating the claim and that that's the track that's followed right and the reason why we actually proved this whenever we did have a shave meeting we discussed it we made a decision and the insurance company did what does everyone remember they came back and said this is none of your business we're paying this and we control how much we're paying and no matter what we voted on if you recall almost everyone said we're not paying we're gonna fight to the end on this and what what happened the insurance company came back about three four days later and said you can't do that we're the ones that are paying the claim and will handle it so a majority of our lawsuits the the whatever comes in where does it go to does it go to our insurance most of the time we're not in the dark we always get we always we get all the details as soon as we're notified it all comes to us we just don't discuss it because at the end of the day the insurance company they have the they have the final say so you know and i followed up on that question because i was i said all right well why do we bother having a shade and the response from the florida legacy is it's not a necessity it's the unilateral decision on the insurance company so you can make whatever you put you want you know shaving but at the end of the day it boils down to what does an insurance company want to do and if you decide beforehand you want to take some action the insurance company made that golf completely and said it's yours now you want it so i mean we have the florida league of cities coverage on this thing okay can i just continue with my contract if this ordinance change is not in the best interest of the city nor in the best interest of the council as a whole and i don't support this thing either the current ordinance works you know it could probably be tweaked to come in alignment with the which foreign of the floor of statues we wanted to apply this was intended in litigation and to be able to have a shade meeting but ultimately it worked for us that time we had the median move to any major repercussions and as we found out at the end of the day it's a decision by the insurance company it's not it's not a council decision and if you decide to go a different way the insurance company backs off in the former league cities and says it's able to get on out and you incur all the costs these things are covered by the foreign legal cities insurance i mean we didn't pay any legal fees for that we didn't pay any penalties or settlements to discuss prospective litigation i don't perceive any upside to that it's a distraction when it reaches the pending stage and it's current litigation fine then let's go ahead and start thinking about complying with the florida statutes and have a shade need to discuss the issues and maybe make our recommendation to the insurance company holiday in the cities but other than that it's just a distraction and a waste of valuable time until it becomes a real issue where we are designated parties to this state is saying that declarations or missions against interest that's the very real thing and i reached out to the florida league of city's attorney whose represents municipalities in these litigations against the cities and lawsuits against the cities he's vetted by the florida legal cities he has their full trust and confidence in dealing with these things and he makes a living at dealing with the litigations and lawsuits against cities and his unqualified opinion was don't do this don't do this admission against interest you can have your city attorney give you warnings and concerns all day long but at the end of the day all it takes is a utterance or a slip of the tongue to hold something against you in court and his based on his experience and opinion working with lawsuits and with the formulations representing municipalities in this thing is a lot of council members and a lot of even municipal attorneys aren't familiar with some of the issues involved in admissions against interest at the end of the day the only people who decide what is an admission against interest is a judge and a jury so all the warnings in the world won't stop us look at the toddler and otherwise against our interests and while we may be supposed this first reputation of some of these foreign cities attorneys they make their living doing this and dealing with it every day given the current climate of litigation and stuff this is not in our best interest i i think i don't want to provide a microphone for more lectures or more espousing opinions on this thing and as you can see and everything else we deal with emotions flying here and that's where you have run into the danger of utterances or slips of the tongue that can be held against us so at the end of the day there's no upside to this thing pending litigation no problem if you want like the mayor suggests it does bernie in alignment with the uh designating the florida league of statute uh 286.011 but i'm dead set against discussing any perspective in it uh litigation it's a distraction there's no need to it and there's absolutely no value added or upside to them that's all i have thank you patty put the following in the record verbatim quote i'm going to read something in and then i'm going to now i'm done talking about this okay is my legal opinion [Music] that section 2-63 of our city code is unconstitutional and in violation of federal section 1983 which states every person who under color of any statute ordinance regulation custom or usage of any state or territory of or the district of columbia subjects or causes to be subjected any citizen of the united states or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to be to the deprivation of any rights privileges or immunities secured by the constitutional laws shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law suit inequity or other proper procedure for redress except that in any action wrote against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officers judicial capacity injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a declaratory degree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable end quote that ends my comment on that your law is unconstitutional i gave you an offer take it or leave it you have the law in front of you you have a city attorney who told you there's constitutional issues ask him his opinion i wanted to make a motion and i wasn't allowed to talk and then i'll be damned if it's for the city's convenience that you get to shop an elected official you think that's constitutional let's try it let's try who's up mr ryan i wanted to clarify that the comment that glenn made just just to be clear the shade meeting that is authorized by 286.0118 is only for pending litigation so you can't use that for perspective no i understand that's exactly what i just didn't just want to be you went back and forth between the two a couple times so i just want to make that that clear the second sentence about discussing prospective litigation um it the way it was written was the city council may and that is permissible that doesn't mean you have to do it it means you can refrain from it happen if we vote for this it'll happen i can assure you that's exactly why it's put in here so that it will happen okay well i i'm writing the proposed draft of the law in the best way i can to be responsive to what i was asked to do that's what i did i didn't say shout out to you i appreciate it let me finish my sentence my my advice to you is do not discuss pending litigation and refrain from doing it in a public forum and i'm not saying you can't do it i'm saying the more prudent action to take is not to do it and i'm not suggesting that anybody's constitutional rights be infringed [Music] there's times you you have every right to do something yet you refrain from doing it because there's a better way of doing it or there's something that you should consider other than the fact that you have a right to do it so you know again i did what i was asked to do i prepared a draft of this if you all want to change it then please tell me how you want to change it and if you don't want to change it then you can leave the provision the way it is as i stated earlier i will be more than happy to insert the statement about the shade predictions but as far as perspective litigation i would i would prefer to leave it alone who have every right to make the amendment that is not my deal with the that was a compromise and people don't want to compromise then test your law i will put it to the test guaranteed mayor i i wrote the ordinance i was asked to write i'm not criticizing you i'm not i'm not saying you're criticizing me i i did what i was asked to do and you know as well as everybody else in this room it has to be presented in a city commission meeting i understand so that is what it's doing and the city council members are debating that's what they should do they have different points of view we're having today i do have a question currently with prospective litigation it's not supposed to be discussed in a council meeting what happens if a council member brings up that prospective litigation just just like what's happening right now how does that apply with our currency well it's been brought up tonight and according to the city code provision as it exists today i did what exactly what i was supposed to do and pointed out that that shouldn't be discussed further but i'm the lawyer for this group of people and my i give you legal advice and if you choose not to follow it then you sub potentially suffer the consequence if you make a misstep and i'll be the first to sit here and tell you i don't have a lock on wisdom so occasionally i may be wrong but on this one i i've done exactly what the code has or says i should be doing correct and my question is okay if we all decide to follow the rules of 2-63 but one of us is the one threatening litigation but what happens is is that person in violation because they're the one threatening us with litigation because if that's [Music] i would like to raise an issue here and it's to the city attorney because my summation of this conversation is we are talking about prospective litigation right now and i would caution all of us not to make any other declarations or admission you're an attorney mr dunn thank you graduate from law school there is there's only one guided lawyer i think you need to caution us about if we're talking about prospective litigation is what's up here has the litigation been challenged has litigation been proposed you haven't noticed a lawsuit it's not perspective unless there's a notice of lawsuit that's what your code says that's what your charter says read it okay that's what the state law says don't tell me about prospective litigation [Music] this is getting personal yeah well it was personal when okay [Music] and i propose another five minute timeout i mean yeah i think we need a timeout do we need to go put a quarter but you guys are like kids i think we should just call for the question and move on with the agenda instead of continuing to have time out some people yeah well i think we'll go i think we'll let the mayor run the meeting and we're going to talk to the citizens next okay we need to take a moment everybody green there's only one person here that's losing his mind i know but we are called on you multiple times i'm going to be active you guys are being reactive i've heard from gaddis to defendants in the lawsuit all right i say we take a minute fred you gave your recommendations you gave your your thoughts which i solely appreciate and i'm ready to move on and vote so we can get this overlooked i'm ready to bring it to a vote after i hear from the citizen comments and any other questions of course that's the proper protocol this council just gave a confidence verified to mr ryan i think mr rowell has given us an ordinance that we should accept where does this are for today in the future i don't care about penny litigation all right this protects us today tomorrow if dependent litigation you want to reign raise grandfather clauses or whatever do that for right now i think we should close the yes i would like to take the proposed change to the city ordinance i would like to leave in the section about the compliance of the florida statute 286 and strike the last sentence about prospective litigation wait a second no second it dies back to the other council comments on the original motion any i would like to make a proposed amendment motion for an amendment all right so let me make sure i've got this screen uh third line which is pending litigation i would like her to say pending and prospective litigation except that the council may discuss pending litigation in accordance with section 286.011 florida statutes everything else needs to come off and then that way that completely prevents us from discussing pending and prospective litigation yet makes the clause about the florida statute for the shade provision that was what was just proposed no he actually left off the uh he left off the uh pending prospective litigation uh that's why i didn't say just cleaning up what you said see prospective litigation is not mentioned whatsoever it just says pending litigation about that right so i would like to say pending and perspective what's the motion do you want to eliminate the last sentence i'm trying to become trial we're not thinking out loud here dave do you have an amendment or you don't you're not [Music] or on the request of the city attorney shall rule out of order any discussion by the city council of matters that are the subject of any pending or prospective litigation except that the council may discuss pending litigation in accordance with section 286.0118 florida statutes and of uh sentence and you're striking the last sentence i assume the last sentence okay i a second to understand second now we can discuss it take gases first uh it makes perfect sense uh basically this uh clarifies uh the shade provision so that we legally have a way of doing it and as far as having any discussion of litigation in public meetings this would prevent us from doing that whether it's pending or perspective [Music] 2286.0117 only deals with penalties correct and that's because it's florida's statute it does not i guess that confuses me did that mean that your amendment is not needed because perspective doesn't mean the shade i'm sorry i don't understand that well basically if you take the i don't have the original uh section d or uh 263 d in front of me i wish i did but basically it says pending or perspective we can't discuss it what's missing from it is the how we can discuss pending litigation according to florida statutes so if you take this here it is right here currently it says the presiding officer or on the request of the city attorney shall rule out of order any discussion by the council of matters that are subject to any current or prospective litigation it actually should say pending um or prospective litigation what's missing is following that a comma except that the council may discuss pending litigation litigation according uh in accordance with section 286.0118 florida statutes if you take what we have now and then you add that beginning from the comma about the exception i'm all for it well dave your uh proposed amendment would of course strike the last sentence correct correct and let's see the way it's written right now it does not have perspective if you strike the last sentence completely it does not mention perspective whatsoever and i would prefer to leave perspective in there and then the exception is only allows for handing so you've got you can't discuss in on this diet you you cannot discuss pending or prospective litigation in a shape meeting because of florida's statute you can at least discuss pending uh in my opinion um this is this is my opinion the way i feel about it perspective is is a good way for us to debate it up here and and and be i mean look this thing's going on everything's being recorded anyone and trust me it will after um whenever certain people are no longer in office they're coming for us i can assure you and they're going to it's all going to be perspective until something is filed let me restate what i think your uh amendment is okay the presiding officer or on the request of the city attorney shall rule out of order any discussion by the city council on matters that are the subject of any prospective or pending litigation comma except that the council may discuss pending litigation in accordance with section 286.011 subsection 8 florida statutes period and the rest of the draft provision is stricken that's it that's exactly what i'm looking for um do you need us to go ahead and maybe just taper this so you can really look into it to make sure it doesn't break any other walls where no trucks can be driven through it i mean i'm just asking do you need more time to look it over with the change that vice mayor gavis asked for um because i don't want to just jump on it i did not dwell and did not dig extensively into the constitutional argument that mayor manzo has asserted and the reason i didn't do that is because i thought this was the way i wrote it a fair way of presenting it if you would like to table this to another meeting that's fine i will look further into that aspect of it to make sure that there's there's absolutely no issue so i'm i'm fine with doing that although i i [Music] i hate giving percentages but i'm pretty comfortable with the amendment that was proposed by dave but in an abundance of caution i i would be happy to spend a little more time on it looking at the constitutional aspect if that would be helpful and i would like to make a motion to table this so he has more time to review it i'll say that can i say oh wait you get to speak first sir you have motion to table now on top of the amendment motion of tables not debatable you need a decision majority decision how do you call it by councilmember gunn councilmember notaro aye councilmember swope hi councilmember aki no vice mayor goddess no mayor manzo no motion fails we continue the discussion on the amendment well i haven't really had much time to talk um well side comment i find it funny that that emotion was presented to cable to use more valuable resource time when that is always being debated about how much you spend on the attorney so that was interesting second of all i think we're pretty confident and let me rephrase that i am very confident in fred's abilities and if he is happy with the original london i am too if he's also happy with the dave's uh amendment and he thinks that that is adequate and hits all the points then i'm happy with that too because i just want to put trust in our lawyer that he's doing the best job not for any one person up here but for the city and i i believe in him so thank you fred for today's been kind of rough on you from some people so i appreciate you sticking with it and doing the right thing for the city so just to summarize the amendment basically closes the door on any public forum discussing pending litigation or prospective litigation but it allows us to comply with the florida statute and hold the shade meeting regarding pending litigation is that a natural summary yes sir and you're comfortable with that yes i am one of the things that that is extremely difficult to calibrate from a lawyer's standpoint is you make every effort you can to seal off any basis for a a complaint or any basis for a lawsuit i am not going to sit here tonight and tell you that you will never have a lawsuit based on this i can't do that but i have done my one of my favorite phrases i've done my 11 best to draft the provision that y'all are that i was asked to draft and i i put that on paper and that i'm not going to say it with a thousand percent certainty that you're never going to have a lawsuit over it it's you'll remember the sign ordinance and i hate bringing in something else because it always leads to a can of worms but the exasperating thing with the sign ordinances that is that people all over the country file federal lawsuits over the sign ordinance and you know there's inconsistent opinions on it and you know all i can do is present something that i think will put you in the best possible position in order to have a safe harbor and then i would also hope people of goodwill would act with goodwill i have something else to say um it has nothing really to do with my emotional table with as far as confidence i just wanted to make sure i was clear on that for everyone it was more about we're throwing something at him at you know 9 35 at night and i wanted to give him the opportunity to research it more so he would have you know more you know just say confidence in what he's saying or not confidence but you know more accuracy with doing some more research so it was just kind of a withdrawal self-imaging 9 30 you know so it wasn't anything to do with confidence in his just off the cuff being able to change something so i just wanted to make sure i extremely clear on that right well this is an ordinance change so it requires two readings so if you pass the amendment tonight that dave has proposed then this will be the first reading and then it will have to come back a second time before it goes into effect so i appreciate you uh being concerned about making sure we get at a thousand percent right if you pass the amendment that dave has presented tonight you can be assured that i will look into certain aspects of this between now and the next meeting and if i think there's a problem i guarantee you i will tell you what that is penny please place this in the record verbatim following the quote standard legal review for the infringement of first amendment rights is that must be a compelling state interest and the law must be narrowly tailored to do the least amount of harm i do not believe that this ordinance the way it's drafted now or even before fits that the current ordinance certainly does not fit that it is unconstitutional in my legal opinion and yes i'm a legal florida attorney i'm also a legal new jersey attorney i'm also a legal federal attorney in the new jersey district i can be admitted into florida in two weeks so please put it in verbatim this is unconstitutional end quote any other council comments and we've but now we're going to go to the citizens this is only on the amendment we still have the original but we're on the amendment only which is dave gaddis's amendment any other council comments citizen comments i i can't vote for the amendment because as you said the slope i mean you brought it back to the attorney and he says i can it might have a constitutional problem i want to put words in your mouth but give me a little bit more time and research i really believe it should be researched well the voting for an ordinance is a two-step process so i'm just saying let's get it right the first time you come back next month and say of course any other council comments to the citizens finally no citizen comments back to council i'll call the question for the amendment only i'm going to read only the piece that gets amended okay so this is ordinance 2108. everything stands dave please correct me if anything i say is not correct dave's amendment is as follows section 2 d the presiding officer or on the request of the city attorney shall rule out of order any discussion by the city council of matters that are subject of any pending or proposed perspectives litigation pending or prospective litigation except that the council may discuss pending litigation in accordance with section 286.011 uh parentheses eight florida statutes period then the rest of this continues section three four five six etcetera that was the change i believe you proposed you're nodding yes where i take that as a sign of correctness okay so patty we're calling that question this is for the amendment as i just read it please call by a individual for the amended ordinance council member banker no council member gunn aye councilmember notaro aye council member swope aye council member aki no vice mayor goddess i am mary eldar no so we have 4-3 and this passes as amended we'll be going for a second reading and advertisement see you at the next council okay item 21. consideration of resolution 2021-10 a resolution of the city council of the city of vallarta beach florida authorizing the city manager of the city of valor beach florida to execute and deliver the american rescue plan act coronavirus local fiscal recovery fund agreement providing for incorporation of recitals providing findings providing for authority to ratify execute and deliver the american rescue plan act coronavirus local fiscal recovery fund agreement providing for general authority providing for recording providing for copies and establishing an effective date this is approval of the resolution ratifying the execution and delivery of the agreement following the september 1st 2021 deadline first we have a motion leslie material second cavs this is the american rescue plan active there was a requirement to get it executed by september 1st and this is just a resolution to ratify that just to make a couple clarifications there was a date announced that said september 20 or i mean uh 2026 that is to get all your documents turned in everything has to be obligated in 2024 that's that's what the requirement of the document says also so uh that's the clarification it's 800 2 868 dollars that will be given to us in two payments as of last week they don't know when they're gonna give us the money yet so at this point we don't really have a certain date but everything's been executed and sent back to him they have to execute it then what they told me in an email within a few weeks so then we'll have to do a budget amendment at that time and decide what we would use it for so what we're asking for you is uh approval of this resolution if you have a copy of the agreement and uh so you've already signed this correct yes so why is our resolution saying to execute it shouldn't that be stricken in both locations you've already signed it and ratifying what you did you didn't do anything wrong you did everything right okay i have no problem with this i want to make sure the resolution reads properly because we're not executing it's already been executed are you asking the question why is it written yes it is yes i am because i didn't know it was signed okay well that's what it says here to our packet so yeah it has been signed so due to the september this is lynn reads to the mayor and city council august 23rd due to the september 1st 2021 deadline set by the bureau of recovery florida division of emergency management for florida municipalities to execute the agreement city manager reeves has executed the agreement so again not saying you did anything wrong you did it right we wanted to get this thing signed we're going to ratify it tonight i'm sure we'll go seven to zero i just want to make sure the resolution is legally proper here should we strike execute from both locations mr riley that may get legally correct as to what we're intending to do here tonight since it's been executed yes to be a thousand percent legally accurate you with the factual situation you can amend it by striking shall execute or whatever the language was somebody want to give me a amendment on this i would have amended to say ratifying the city manager's execution of the agreement i suggest we just say take out two execute and execute it's in there twice if we do that i think it's compliant unless mr raleigh tells us otherwise that's fine i just want it it's leslie's motion so she has to agree whatever we need to do to make it proper but make it safe you strike out execute where you're striking out the two execute and striking out execute wait a second sorry second but frank okay any discussion citizens on the amendment act of counsel let's learn to terrorize last word no okay so i'm going to read it as revised and then we'll uh we can do this as a voice resolution can we do another voice about patty or we have to do individual individual individual okay consideration of resolution 2021-10 a resolution of the city council the city of belarus beach florida authorizing the city manager of the city of bellar beach florida to deliver the american rescue plan act coronavirus local fiscal recovery fund agreement providing for incorporation of recitals providing for findings providing for providing i'm sorry providing

establishing an effective date and clerk i guess we'll ratify what the city manager has done councilmember gunn all right councilmember notaro hi councilmember swope i'm councilmember aki hi councilmember banker vice mayor gaddis hi mayor manzo hi pastor patti i don't 7-0 if the copy that i have up here will be um amended for tonight but if you need me to sign it i can certainly soon swing by and sign up it's a signature page i'm not sure okay we'll look at it later i probably did yeah i do so we'll just have to describe it unless you want to strike it i mean i have a couple minutes up to you your call okay later um all right item 22. authorization to execute a purchase order for the 22nd street bridge repairs this is authorized uh contract to pro shop concrete and bridge masters construction llc for five dollars based on 2021 f dot bridge inspection report those this is proposed by city manager reeves first promotion sunday you spoke second second okay rita [Music] this is uh to do repairs that were recommended by fdot 22nd street bridge comes under fdot inspection every other year they provide us a report which they did in january of this year per their recommendations we went out to several companies and we've provided you with that documentation behind it and there is money in the current this new year budget we have a savings account to do repairs on both our bridges in the city and so i'm recommending approval of eleven thousand thirty five dollars for pro shop concrete and bridge construction to do the recommended repairs and we've provided a copy of the report to you also on councilman commons stand our strategic plan thanks to the bridge mr reece i saw a variety of different prices and stuff here and some were comparable some for an example the gcc people don't set up for traffic control proshot does set up for traffic control i think the other guys bridge masters had mobilization traffic control are we comparing all these apples to apples because there was a big disparity in crisis over here and i just want to make sure you know it was clear that you know one of the bids was much better than others but i just want to make sure we're comparing animals to apples yeah we're comparing it based on what they submitted to us they were given the report and said told that they should give us a proposal based on the report requirements some of them is the one came back seventy six thousand dollars which is pretty ridiculous uh and then the other one let's see the other one had a mobilization fee of uh yeah ten thousand dollars up front for no work they're just mobilizing so uh that's one of the reasons why we're recommending pro shop concrete mr i'm confused i'm very good because proshot country is 76 0005 and gcc is 11 035 so you want i think gcc do you not i'm reading the sentence below but it is gcc okay so our explanatory is wrong our motion is correct so you want to you want gcc yes okay so we're going to cross that out i'm going to re-read that when we vote on it okay okay the pro shot concrete is out they were oh that's my seventeen okay that was all my question that i just read this lower sentence i saw it i'm worried i just want to make sure you're getting who you want here you want the 76 000 when that's fine we need to fix it and they've done the repairs for all right council any other comments citizens any comments back to council last week as well benny item 22 authorization to execute a purchase order for 22nd street bridge repairs this is to authorize a contract to bridge masters construction for eleven thousand thirty five dollars in general i'm sorry and it's still wrong okay my mistake i'm gonna reread that last one authorized contract to gcc general caulking and coding's company um for eleven thousand thirty five dollars based on 2021 f dot bridge inspection report correct mr reeves yes okay yes hope passes this we can do this as a voice vote yes all in favor all right anyone opposed seven to zero history is your authorized to move forward unfinished business i'm sorry 22a frank banker frank would you mind i don't write down exactly what you want this to be titled so would you please just introduce this was one sentence if you could 12th street lot access beach access parking violations according to our interlocutor okay do i have a motion to make motion second second second by uh i heard robin's will have robin uh go ahead you have the floor um yes i'm sorry this this job doesn't pay well anyway last thursday when i started saying before i was at where i apologize i was going north on gulfport around 9am and those in our 12th street lot two tractor trailers and 130 ton crane all parked using up more than half of our lot on my way back the crane was being built which i again saying that the counterweights the block and the accessories were being put on the access path to the beach was further blocked because you had to back the trailers in to get the counterweights etc i went home got my cell phone took some pictures of this and sent to our city manager clerk the reason who would issue a permit on a parking lot which was built for cars that generally weighed under three times now supporting a crane that weighs 100 tons okay 100 tons the two tractor trailers are coming in probably head counter weights total now they were legal okay everything was legal because they had furnace to move the crane okay they were probably around eighty thousand pounds all right the crane weighs approximately 55 times on bill right the reason the two tractor trails were there was to carry the counterweights as i explained permits are required by dot on equipment vehicles that are oversized and overweight before movement on the on roads further permits and costs may be required for bridges if planted permanent wrap these permits all have heavy costs associated with them each time these these pieces of equipment are removed reason being they tear up the roads and bridges hence compensation is collected before him permits are further along specific roads and routes is addressed on roads which do not have weight requirement restrictions we just passed on 22 in order or amendment to have a bridge rebuild right in there it says traffic restriction based on road rating analysts posting not required the structure is posted at both approaches single unit truck 11 tons combination 19 tons we had over 200 000 pounds on that bot in just one area all right that's why they have these restrictions getting back to the email i sent to our city manager he emailed me back and noted we only issued permits for our residents it would have no involvement or knowledge of other permits so the question is who would issue a permit to allow this type of weight on our lives other question would be was it a communication contract entered into assumed liability in the event of loss or engine now the pictures i passed out has a circle on the outbreak that was blocking the beach access okay so it was a tripping hash further if you look at the crane the outburners are not fully extended when the aberrators are fully extended when the turret or the upper structure it's called turns the counterweights will not go past generally and on that crane it is the upper structure so when the crane swung it was completely into the access path of that beach right now where i come from we would have called them an oil or an apprentice watching down here they don't all right i'm not going to get into right to work and everything else but what i'm saying is type of weight okay will destroy our partner all right we just settled and it was brought up tonight the lawsuit and more important for slip and fall slip and fall and now we put up these little signs saying that uh it could be slippery when wet and sand today these are our lights these are all odds to use now the crane in question okay there was another crane there beforehand but that was on the owner's property all right that was probably i believe the 20 time i didn't really take notice because it didn't concern me when hurricane hermine came at fourth street they needed a crane from someone to damage that crane came on the owner's property of the high means watermark all right set up on their property it was on the beach and performed the service they could have used a 20-ton hydraulic truck crane or an atv drain crane they put it on the beach the total width of that crane had been under 25 feet their control line is 20 i think four feet flat five feet right there i don't know how the exact but they elected to use our lie and i don't know why okay well it's probably because of the cost factor of getting a permit to shut to move the crane up and down the beach but i've listened like i said the council tapes in the past and this council was 100 for the defense of this citizen of the citizens of this town or city a year ago with the beach umbrellas and everything else and again i brought up the issue you know that you sat down i sat down with the city mayor and i was given some kind of insurance that cleaning up the beach umbrellas cleaning up the buoys and there was never an insurance here okay because clearly belair shores has taken an approach that they can get away with this they can get away with that and they're they're actually becoming a bully to us and i don't know why without taking it i really don't know why i don't know i i'm going to ask the council that we direct our city clerk to because the other one i can think of if we don't know musician in these permits is bellar shores well i would like a copy of all these permits but i'll tell you who's issuing the permits i'll tell you the people who've issued their permits city clerk barbara kaluchi has issued dozens of them uh his mayor schmidt has issued him deborah rosman issued one and i think that's everyone who's actually issued permits we're the owners of people issuing those permits that have better shore letterhead that says it's okay to park here those are the three people we have found interveners correct me if i missed anybody who's issuing those are the issues well the only thing i can find in the bell or short of minutes is back in may 21st noted in beller's meeting of tom brady's event is to use the park parking lots and it was asked if we could use those parking lots and the dollar shorts mayor noted issuing permits was okay by council is that their council is that our house i can't find it's not our accounts okay well who gives them the permission again their own ordinance doesn't give them permission well i i i know that and and this is just i can't wrap my head around this and until we take a stand we're going to keep getting the views and when i proposed earlier and i was out of water and i don't think i'm out of more now we need to say hey you're poor care you're getting your part and that was actually proposed last year wasted your time cause i've done it already i did it with debbie mall who called this city manager and he didn't even come out and come to the location on 12th street we had we had the police there we spent hours they told me to go f myself people out there who got it on video it's all part of the complaint mr brian heard it's all part of the complaint in terms of doing something there's only one person doing something and i'm joined by 42 other courageous people one just passed away we had 43. well we could make a stance by saying the beach umbrellas we're going to put them up at 6th street if anyone's fine we will cover the cost uh we can i believe we can install a buoy at six three i believe we can install the elite 12 stream which would cure the unsafe conditions there okay i think we have every right if you read the deeds it says submerged lands all right um and that's my motion to keep my forward my motion is to pick up any cost and to install those two buoys right now and if possible if we need to go to court this council this council approves because we have a lot of snowbirds and i'm not taking away from anybody's full-time residency because i'm one all right but the snowbirds will be coming down shortly they want to go to the beach older people need the umbrellas all right let's go to court and get a restraining order on that shade [Music] just trust me on that it can't be done there's a reason i found the verified complaint that was the precursor of that you can't do it okay trust me i can't do it what about the buoys um i'm not part of the buoys thing but i know you have done an incredible amount of work i mean i know i know some of the work you've done and it's incorrect and i'll tell you what mr van garden my hat's off to you okay because i didn't know you when he came on this council i didn't much doubt um your dedication to safety for our citizens is incredible you have put this city on notice and you put the other city on notice okay of what invention is going to be a tragedy okay it's just a matter of time okay it was so bad the other day we were home at our house and june said to me it sounds like that boat is like almost coming around and that was probably the one you were talking about that you know they were within several feet of the shoreline somebody's going to get killed it's just a matter of time now yeah i said it before i can't do civil disobedience okay um i'm licensed in multiple areas and i can't go and break the law intentionally there may be people who will do that okay um and then there's recourse if they get pinched by the you know by the police on that but in terms of setting up for safety if you want motion to whatever we have to do to get always in there you got my support 100 i appreciate what you've done here i went to that 12th street the other day there's cracks all over that that the cab over there this thing has done a number on there this is absolutely unacceptable this is dangerous oh and by the way we have an indemnification agreement as part of our interlocal agreement if anyone gets hurt on the beach access belair beach will pay for it so when we're derelicting our duties by not forcing people like this to get waivers by turning a blind eye and say it's not my job well it is your job because the inter-local agreement requires it and if somebody got hurt on this crane their attorney guarantee you will read the interlocal agreement and go oh it's bellar peach's problem imagine if you're a city and by the way i don't know what council signed this thing worst agreement in history we are completely liable for everything that happens on those those easements we have completely assumed all liability so if somebody gets hurt here if somebody illegally parks here and gets hurt their car gets damaged anything it says right in there that we indemnify them moving up the citizen comments we will i'll get to it as soon as we go through council again just just to clean this up i have my belly full with the fwc about this buoy permit that we requested have unnecessary buoys i believe was signed in may 2020. all right i went round and round with them i finally said you know what the hell with this i filed an appeal of the bully permit okay on my own so i'm going to be i guess you know as a bad child here okay by me and not by 43 interveners well i'm just saying okay this if i'm successful in getting that billy permanent repeal then the old apartment comes back and 17 buoys would be reinstalled okay now according to fwc it's unsketched or his statute language has been changed 12 years ago all up and down the coast you'll see the same language in the middle east all right but they're now telling us that we have to change our buoy language okay it's all nonsense it's all typical government crap they just don't want to get off their dead keisters but i really believe that we should throw those two buildings out there at 6th street which is ours and 12th street i say something yes um actually a couple things you said that uh you went ahead and filed your bill did you do that on behalf of the city of louisville was she personal right frank baggard i used my own email account i nailed it from my home address okay so that would be made a public record at this point since it was mentioned is that correct did you send that to the city so that okay the city should get a copy of my complaints we filed for the uh amended uh permanent deal okay and then um as far as the interlocal agreement and the reliability of that clause you were talking about i mentioned this before and several of the citizens had so much concern about that maybe we should give them the 60-day notice and bail out of that so that's an option too and um i am not i'm sorry council member banker but i have not supported the police that's my opinion there is their property it's on their tax rules not ours it's on their needs not ours so i'm sorry i'm not going to vote for that at all because you're a real big um proponent and supporter of not spending the citizens money but then you want to spend money to put something out there in a property we don't know [Music] of not spending the taxpayers money on frivolous space like the sign that's going to be installed outside we put 3 500 in that budget away from those okay a year we just spent what 35 000 on a sign all right i'm looking for two buoys that will probably be less than a thousand dollars all right which are a safety item all right now that sign all right what kind of safety is that providing the citizens of this town all right in fact you get a drunk trying to read it you might ride into it so i am a proponent of safety and i don't care what the cost is when it comes to safety you'll see that in the future but um i don't know why you would be against two buoys that would cure where you live and where other people live against the safety you know i think what you're saying is there are other issues here now what's the rest of the story with respect to this thing i mean there are things happening based on this appeal of stuff basically the legal standing of this thing as well as again he is raising a very poignant question is what's the legalities of this thing yeah we have easements in the parking lot but how does that extend into [Music] the team claims we have the submerged lands is it this easy or is there another is there a rest in the store and there was a one there well here's here's just to clarify the buoys okay uh we're working on fixing our booze so they come into compliance we send the i asked the city attorney to prepare an ordinance to change our ordinance because currently it doesn't meet the statute requirements which customer record is aware of those things have changed and we're going to have to change the wording on our movies we sent that to the florida fish and wildlife actually yesterday i got the friend sent me the ordinance we sent it up there he sent it to me to you last week you and i turned it around in about a day and a half right so we're in the process of getting our buoys in the gulf the city's foods in the gulf brought into compliance with current statutes the requirements so that is went forward they have to approve the change in the organization let's send it back to us then we'll bring it to the city council as far as balor shore and and i've discussed this with councilmember the the situation is in the position of the florida fish and wildlife or florida wildlife commission is you cannot go into another city and uh get a permit for buoys when this buoy permit was originally done 2000 as it won when it was originally done both cities went together got our short paid for the buoys in front of theirs city of valor beach paid for the buoys in front of our city last year we wanted to update our booths because we had a lot of them that were missing we wanted to put it back so bellar shore did not want to put it back and it isn't that somebody took them away what happens to who is unfortunately as they break away you may find them in saint petersburg or out in the ocean somewhere so if the situation is based on what florida library commission stated to me is we're going to fix ours so we're in compliance we've got the prices uh to have a vendor go out because we don't have the resources and then every three years we will have to have someone go out and do an inspection on because we don't have the capability to do that they have stated that we cannot put buoys in a city that is not ours basically but our shores of another jurisdiction so what i understand and i heard about it after the fact from fishing wildlife they asked me if i knew about it and frank had already done it sent the i guess the appeal and i haven't seen it well the permit of 2002 the permit of 2020 clearly states that any buoy is missing has to be replaced immediately all right i can't see how 17 day missing all in one day all right so i don't know if we were plucking out some of those buoys and putting them in our area or not i don't know but we've never been in compliance okay fwc has not held us in compliance now all of a sudden fwc because i brought this to the attention of them and it wouldn't back off threatened us okay saying we're just going to make you change the language or we'll remove your permit and take all your goodies all right meanwhile indian rocks clear water or stanky has the same verbiage on their voice all right so where's equal protection in the wall and why are we keep taking these threats from these agencies that do nothing okay they haven't they haven't enforced their own permit and we haven't really monitored our own target and i don't have any but now we're going to spend money and change the verbiage of our our buoys and allow the other towns to go away with nothing just because i brought this to their attention of a safety issue and this is this is nothing but a safety issue as you said mr mayor this is an accident waiting to happen all right and i'm not talking about you know as a rush word i'm talking about a possible death and bellar sure's previous commissioners even said that one of them said that says one life i don't care what the cause is commissioner roseman said not even a year ago let's put the money from the [Music] pennies for pinellas back to get the buoys right so i can't see how they're 100 against them we had movies they were on sixth street i used to swim there every single day and they i don't think anybody took them there they had a hurricane it was or me it was pretty rough even though it was a smaller hurricane and those things were gone and i and then it was weird because i think after maybe lynn reeves may remember i think after irma like one of them came back it was really weird you know but it was in the wrong spot so it looks like it must have broken loose and maybe it was submerged the other ones as you go further up towards 12 street i don't know what happened to those they all disappeared but you used to be able to go out in the water and i know because i used to swim beyond those buoys and come back okay i do long distance swimming and you would be able to go and you'd be able to see every single bully in line and now you can see it in indian rocks but you can't see it here well the 106th street okay got washed down irma to third street you're going to say well how do you know was that one well it had a leak in it and i patched it okay so i went out and passed again and and it was fine but it still took off so i knew it was sixty-four but in terms of not being replaced immediately i mean that was what three years four years ago hermine was what yeah some years ago six 2007 i was like four years or so ago but it was a while ago anyway they're derelict did not replace it yeah absolutely right after frank um i'm all about the buoys and the safety but i kind of want to talk about go back to some issues that you said about a different subject about the crane um if there's damage to the in that parking lot aren't we responsible for paying for it so and that may issue where you said the film crew with some council members thought it was fine because tommy boy was great thank you well i left off before tommy boy because he was a big star it's okay but i don't agree with that i contacted lynn reeves and sent him pictures and i actually just pulled up the picture it was the parking permit has the seal of bellaire shore and is signed by kaluchi now my understanding is they aren't allowed to give out permits so if they're not allowed to give out permits for tommy boy and his friends film boys to park there then they should have been cited or ticketed or something like for example can i on my computer side department and have all my friends park there and walk to my house for a party is that okay or if i get in trouble because if i can't do it tommy boyce should be able to do it don't waste your time called the pinellas sheriff asking for a ticket because i got that one on tape and it's part of my litigation what was that rita did you say something excuse me i'm sorry do you want to say something i'm right here keep saying tommy doing all that stuff i mean okay come on that was old discussions old counselors want to bring up fuel discussion do you like to always bring up like money and overspending and how much we pay on my journey all the time okay just thought so thank you let's go back to the uh the waste of time that would be to contact the sheriff i spent an hour i took it all the way up to the corporal level our wonderful friend captain miner did nothing absolutely nothing i showed them the ordinance of bel air shore i read them the ordinance that says they are not allowed to issue permits to anyone but bel air beach residents we confirmed that the construction companies were not from delaware beach because guess what folks we don't have businesses in our beautiful premier city and you know what they did nothing nothing but lindy they were not going to enforce the law they said it's quote it's their loss and they can do what they want i said but here's the law we don't care thanks sheriff so lynn did they contact you for permits to park there like the film crew yeah they somewhat not well i don't know who it was i think it was somebody from pinellas county they asked me if we had a parking place and i told them i would rent their parking spaces in our lot here uh and i told them you know we'd probably get some kind of discounted fee for you know how many ever days and uh they called me back and said they've never been there so as i told them like i couldn't give you parking did you tell them that they are not allowed to park there without a permit and you will not be giving them one is shore allowed to write permits for those three parking lots according to the ordinance not to their win their ordinance we only give permits to our residents we don't give them to anyone now so all our residents know you don't issue permits to anyone but our own residents no i know that that's us i'm asking them is barbara belucci's signature don't we do an information request on all permits issued for this year and take them to court for the loss of revenue or refine them why don't we start being a little aggressive it says just start taking yeah you don't want it does that sound like a movie but you never want to fight by keep taking a punch right well i sent this picture to lynn reeves too the parking sign that says restricted parking parking only for bellar beach vehicles with valid permits police patrol town of miller shore does not say and the women are sure based on who their friends are and you know construction yes have your answer [Music] section 30-57 parking permits this is from the unicode or shore no motor vehicle shall be parked on beach access lots 21 43 66 at 6th street 12th street and 18th street if you don't know unless such motor vehicle bears a parking permit a decal or sticker authorizing such parking such parking permits shall only be issued as may be provided by the board of town commissioners to the property owners in the city of belair beach east of gulf boulevard and shall be numbered i will buy you a soda or adult beverage if you show me a number on any barbara kaluchi permit okay um that's it the rest is reasonable rules and parking permits and stuff like that okay that's what the law is so the answer is no mayor mayor is that your end quote yes i'm sorry yes i'm sorry the quote ended i'm sorry daddy shouldn't have said anything that's my bad the uh it ends at and shall be numbered numbered is the end quote thank you and back to you uh i mean it's freaked i mean before you got on console i've been talking about this about how you know if the sheriff is going to be used more for you know enforcing the umbrella issue than they need to pay more that i'm tired without always having to deal with bella or shore and being like the the red step child where we get cracked on and you know just stuff like the pictures of the parking lot being half full with film crew for a resident a non-resident of bella or shore borrowing a house when i can't do the same thing if someone wants to film a document on me which would be very interesting um no but so my whole point is i'm a few friends i i'm not a fan of bullying and i'm tired of it so what i don't know what we can do i can't provide my son a partner right he doesn't live i can't get one from my mom so she can take my kids to the beach who do live here i'll give you a solution i have 43 interveners in this case become an intervener in the case or the city of valor beach can enter into the law city you don't have to take this you don't have to take it we need four votes on this council and then the city of bellar beach is involved in the lawsuit city has the right to sue as a property owner so you have an option we have an exercise kit only one person had the courage to bring the lawsuit in this city it's okay 43 people who joined more are welcome that's your option you can do it individually you can do it as a city you don't have to take it please don't come in my lawsuit and work against me you won't be in it very long well i don't think as a council member all right um i should be fighting for the residents all right i shouldn't have to enter being in a public or firewall we i took an oath to uphold this florida constitution defense united states our constitution clearly says i have a beach i have a right to use each okay if i don't do something then i'm in violation and everyone here is in violation so i'll make a motion that we do get involved in the lawsuit okay or we sh we sue them are not getting by the lawsuit that we sue them on behalf of the people of bel air beach for violating our constitutional rights okay and putting this in a hazardous situation is that a motion there's a motion we have a second then i don't have to recuse myself thank you i was going to have to hand this over and go through that whole form again but um because i wouldn't have to step aside on that one i can't preside over that part of it but you know what the options are folks okay so um when gone and then um we're still debating here on council and i see there's some hands that we're going to come to the citizens as soon as we finish our council [Music] with respect to a lawsuit the goal that's been tossed down by the mayor the city's council just said no we're not going to intervene so i would suggest that if you feel that strongly about instead of accusing us as a counsel for not standing up for this thing why don't you intervene and become part of the lawsuit i've asked that question myself several times they speak very strongly about it then that's the end of their involvement coming back to boys for just a second i asked the city manager what's the rest of the story my understanding is there's been some trickle-down effect from this involvement with the fwc on this basically they're not just targeting us anymore they're looking at looking at our neighboring municipalities for compliance and this thing made mushroom and balloon and affect everybody who all of a sudden they had no interest in this thing but all of a sudden the fwc is going to come down and be looking at their permits and replacements and there may be additional cause or problems for our neighborhood disciplines not all municipalities have boobies how many of our neighboring municipalities don't have boys i can tell you there's several that don't have buoys uh on the on the ocean side and there's almost none on the intercoastal we're one of the few and i can also tell you that the conversations i had with them about the intercoastal buoys they could come back and tell us to take them out because they're not in compliance but at this point the only one they're looking at is us because council member banker make calls to them and and now my understanding correct me if i'm wrong frank but i understand that the staff any conversation with them any further is with their attorney is that correct yeah she um she when she threatened me that she was gonna and i can't believe she's an attorney because she puts it in writing and she's gonna take all the buoys out because i brought this to the issue okay i said then let the blood be on your hands okay with the first injury all right and then she immediately called you okay so this is the ridiculous behavior from the fwc and like i said those buoys that the language you're talking about being changed mr guy i think the first time it was changed was in 2010. all right the permit has to be as mr recess renewed every three years so for over a decade they approved an unstature problem it just kept it proven just kept it proven and their answer is why did you approve it uh we don't have a staff checkmate so if you don't understand to check them out you should give up that right to monitor the permit that'll be an argument i'll make it from a okay now to address the movies again the trickle-down effect that you know glenn's alluding to that it may trickle into other municipalities good because then they'll be safer that's like saying oh this one highway has drag racers and so now one person complains about now the cops show up and now nobody can drive race good so bring down the trickle-down effect i like it it'll be safer for all the other beaches and swimmers and tourists and you know i applaud frank for being proactive and not reactionary so we're gonna wait for the first taurus the first kid to be killed by a drunk boat that gets too close i think the other expected consequences oh i'm sorry i was like not passive aggressive enough i was talking i'll talk louder if you can't hear me okay can you hear me am i close enough i just want to make sure so i i'm all for i've always been since day one i try to get traffic and safety in this thing about uh speeders on our street and i was shut down so i'm all for safety um so frank i completely support you with everything and you know the fact that they're threatening you is showing me that they are seeing their flaws and they can't uh open up to them so now it's easier to uh bully you into hushing that is next yeah i just caution you the unexpected consequence all the time to come out all the boys come out it's it's like putting your faith in a bicycle laying on the bridge they tell us we can't ride on the sidewalks because there's a bicycle leg next time you drive over that bridge look how many skid marks there are up on the divider on the side of the road protecting that sidewalk from traffic going right through the bicycle lane hitting the guardrail when next time you drive that bridge take a look at the ski marks on there and it'll blow you away what i'm saying is don't put your faith in a buoy or a painted line it takes a little personal responsibility and i i'm for you i want those boys in there i'm not fighting on this but i'm just saying you got to be careful what you what you ask for and how do you do it because you need the cooperation of those government agencies you make them mad or you antagonize them they're not your friend anymore they're working against you they're not working with you or for you i've started to get that impression that we're alienating people who we need to assist and help us this mr gunn for the record before i sat on council i contacted our city manager about this issue okay i've been a total sweetheart okay for months on this i can show you volumes of emails showing boats two feet away from children's heads okay i can show you folks coming in my neighbors almost hitting them i can show you videos i sent to the fwc all i ask them is to comply with number 14 of the amended permit saying if it's a safety violation the permit must be withdrawn okay they've more or less gave me the middle finger on the whole thing all right so what am i supposed to do roll over and play dead it's just like again we talked about our shores about getting the beach umbrellas back they gave you the middle finger all right they're not gonna do it until somebody takes them on mr dude they have the same issue they have the same movies okay and uh well the same garbage what are they doing i don't know i i'm i'm not a counselor for san diego they have the same i went up and down the coast taking pictures of buoys the coordinates and everything like that like i said since i retired so long as i keep out of my wife's hair i'm not sure if it's true or not but i heard that because of the ongoing conversation they may be pulling their buoys too i can't guarantee that but hey frank a couple things i think you may have excuse me you may have done some of these already some of this i might hear about but i certainly will um let me my contacts successful will help you you've contacted our uh our representative nick basicly you've contacted senator brandeis okay did we get anything from these people not from the senator but nick i've talked to a couple of times because i could have gotten you in touch with them i'm surprised you didn't get anything from senator brandeis i don't want to break sunshine rule here or anything like that but we can reach out to them or i can get i mean i can i can make a call saying that you're going to call them or something and that will help the other thing is you know i mean i'm not going to worry about what's going to happen with some other city and whether fwc is going to come down on us take this to the media that's what we did we brought the film crew right to the beach it didn't matter they didn't care but you know it doesn't look good it doesn't play well and i don't think anybody's going to look at that video and say oh yeah sure like those boats you know right up on a you know 10 year old kid's head we have media contacts too if you need it so um you know we can get you in touch i can get you on the radio i can get you uh you know and maybe that's what's needed is for you to start going out because you are doing one hell of a job and i totally admire what we're trying to do for this city and this city's safety i i i will help you however i possibly can in here and to the extent that it's legal outside of here well i don't like this mr gas i don't i don't use the sand king beach okay i would hate to see those removed um but that's up to the people of same cave they want to they want to allow i i i still i mean i don't i built in black's wall i looked in webster's ditch i don't understand what the premier city is saying i mean i mean i i understand the definition but i just don't see it here well we call it our 2007 so you don't hear anybody else call us all right can we get a good citizen system and wait and they want to talk on this jim uh first one uh this is a question and then you can just answer it after i leave because i know we can't go back and forth um any of the buoys that are there or where they are i should say we're there we still have maybe the amounts still there so all we're doing is basically putting the movie back and hooking it to amount and then maybe do maintenance down the road if you get what i'm trying to say on the existing second of all can't that kind of pressure on a parking lot cause a um a sinkhole a sinkhole now think about it false code okay now that those commissioners that we're having problems with or the one commission maybe and the the crane gives way because of the parking lot and now it falls over on his house where is the liability for this city vice versa the brand new house where's the liability for this city okay second of all osha has rules uh safety rules what what ocean things were presented to this city showing that they were in place to protect this city for that job site third of all i'm not seeing anything was cornered off keeping any kind of people from going in that area where that crane was working so there was no safety precautions in place even if they did use the lot okay not at all okay third of all if anybody who's been here long enough if you remember the boating accident that happened because of no wave zone in indian rocks beach and several people were killed because somebody did not respect the no make some they came across with the civil boat right across another boat that was crossing the water angling several people this was several years ago and just recently the debris that was in the water in the water where somebody got killed and thrown from a boat okay so safety is supposed to be our number one issue than our strategic plan in this city and and this city needs to start taking a look at the safety of our citizens and anyone else that comes into our city that we're going to be liable for thank you thank you frank you can you want to respond at the end or you want to speak you'll only see all these coming up next but i don't want to get into a council discussion but if you want to respond i don't know as she brought up i don't know if the angers are still in place there they may be the coordinates are pretty clean okay you can go down there and check but it might be a simple solution but real quick i don't need to caused you but there is still 1 billion balor assures okay it's around 17 i i never known you could be handcrafted are we changing that verbiage because fwc says you can't touch them it's not in our jurisdiction how do we go change that room so there's going to be one buoy saying no wait sound in the other one saying no this is beyond again my comment on the movies is that i think it's absurd to get upset about protesting the lack of movies because the consequence might be there to pull all the boys i don't see how anyone can pull all the movies and i think the media is our answer because once the stink gets raised about safety and the lack of safety and cigarette boats coming up and down that beach very very fast and close to the beach so excuse me i don't know much about the movie situation but thank you because i think that is um really really important but i am livid about the parking lot i don't think canceling our interlocal agreement is an answer to the bullying all right the answer to the bully is to stand up to the bully we are responsible for any and all damage and liability folks does that not bring it would strict fear my heart about you that at any time anything they do could cause us this city to pay aside from let's let's even leave life and injury on the side let's just make money money so definitely who gave them permission to um to park there why weren't all the safety measures that offer the convenience of a private homeowner that has two lots on the beach that can afford to put that crane in his property or around the back again 12th street at least it's for the benefit of two people two private homeowners commissioner bloom and the new home group and that should not be allowed we control those parking lots and whether we own it outright or it's deeded to uh bel air shore but it's feed it to bellaire shore for our benefit and it says it on the deeds for any beach residents so they don't have unfettered control on these um on these laws and what they're doing now is they issue the parking letter and they fold back the signature so that we can't see who signed the parking lot the letter giving permission but we see the letter but they fold their signature back so they are in total violation of their own ordinance we need to step up this council needs to step up and send them some kind of warning do something we can make them stop issuing permits and we certainly can i would tell them i would start telling anybody anybody i don't see why we can't call uh have a contract with a toy company because the police sadly do not respond with all respect to the sheriff's office they don't respond and when it comes to the umbrella i'm not even going to discuss it they they don't respond so definitely they're the bullies thank you thank you [Music] [Music] gave us we hire our own private talent i didn't i didn't even look at that but that's a great idea the other thing is i believe we ought to do an information requests on all permits that were issued by valor we were there several councils of them we talked about token companies because that would be the easiest first see her in the audience tonight jody shirley came across uh you come across a went across and made the comments who brought the comments of this council to their council this council had a meeting and most of those suggestions were made by one of our citizens rick shock okay about towing about stepped-up police enforcement there was a variety of stuff she made every one of those guess what goodbye thanks for coming have the lovely partying gift but remember i told you earlier that was the 21st of july 2020. the city manager was working with them on the 15th we had zero chance of getting those suggestions so maybe you want to try it again i'm not going across i can't speak with them okay but i'm not allowed to legally but other people can there's nothing stopping you from going over there and making these proposals towing is an absolute way of ending all the illegal parking but the suggestions being given a million times well we don't need their approval no i think you do i think you do so well if they don't have a belly or beach permit on their car and you can tell um fred reilly can i i didn't bring my inner local agreement tonight i don't believe i have it but i believe is it paragraph five where it talks about strict enforcement and it's kind of vague who is supposed to be strictly enforcing the permit system i can read it and easily come to the conclusion that bellerin beach is responsible i could read it and say well bellar beach is only strictly responsible for issuing tickets right you know the parking stickers okay we certainly know that this crane isn't parked anywhere in bellaire beach and if you can show it to me i buy you a bottle of your favorite scotch because it's not here because we don't have a crane business in this city so whoever issued this permit or if no one issued the permit and that was improper i just read you the statute the police missed us guys i love you you do a great job how the hell did you miss this frame it was there until at least 5 p.m lioner says don't enforce it so you don't enforce it well liner is wrong and i had the guts to say i told him that so i'm not saying anything behind his back remind him gentlemen that i told him at our emergency management services meeting that he was improperly enforcing this law since he doesn't return my telephone calls so mr riley if we hire a towing company and start towing cars that do not have a baller beach parking permit sticker are we liable for any type of damages [Music] can i answer a different question which size shooting i i've wanted to comment for 45 minutes so i have several comments everything i'm going to say is oriented towards solving problems that is the absolute objective so i'm going to segregate the problems into two two categories two things and two things only so if you want to make a response please don't bring in other things stick to the two things that i'm going to use as examples the the first one is the buoys okay there's a safe statue that specifies what you have to do in order to have buoys or replace movies and then there are florida administrative code provisions that further define how you should do that okay so that that's a establishing factually what the situation is state law requires that you do certain things so fundamental thing for me you should comply with the state law okay i am in no way diminishing the safety issue that you have very passionately set forth but my job is to tell you how to make sure you don't have problems and one of them is i can't solve the problem related to somebody that's drunk in a cigarette boat but i can tell you how to implement a solution consistent with florida law and that to me is very clear-cut the city of bel air beach has jurisdiction and the city of bel air shore has another jurisdiction they do not overlap where bellair shore ends delaira beach begins and that's up to stan key so the point that i'm making is you as the city council can fix the problem within your jurisdiction and lynn contacted me last week and asked me to prepare a change to the ordinance so it would be consistent with florida law and consistent with the administrative code and i [Music] put together the the code change and got that back to them in a day and a half so that has to be of course considered by the city council one of the nuances of state law is that for this type of ordinance change you have to submit it to the commission for them to review it before it becomes effective so that was written in to the the ordinance change so lynn has that i he hasn't told me this but i survived it from what something he said earlier i think he's probably already sent it to them to look at to for them to at least give us some initial feedback we're still going to have to if you want to go forward with it go through the procedure or bring it in up before the city council in october and then in november and then in november once assuming it's passed then it's submitted to the commission and they finalize it if they look at it before um you have your meeting in october which i would hope they would do then you should it should be a absolute they will approve it later on but you know people sometimes act inconsistently so for purposes of the movie issue the solution is being done and i leave out the discussion about the permits and all that stuff um i i don't know that much about that because i wen did not ask me to get involved heavily in that i know there's been a lot of uh communications back and forth i really don't have much to say on the status of pubmed but i do have tell you that you have a solution waiting in the wings which is to change your city code so that's what i would recommend you do so that that to me is a solution to that problem the other city if they choose to run their jurisdiction differently then that's up to them i don't know what uh mechanism there is legally for the city of bel air beach to make the city of bel air shore do something in relation to buoys within their jurisdiction don't know if if you trust me for a a suggestion i would suggest talk to your state representative or stateware senator and you it sounds like you've already done that i mean this should be to be a pretty easy thing for the cities to work together on but at this point in time uh bel air shore has chosen their path and you you're trying to choose your path so that that's that one issue i'll go now to the other issue prior to you explaining this i had no idea there were cranes on the lot okay i'm just not aware of it if and i was aware of the film crew months ago and of course uh hope that that sort of thing wouldn't happen again but um apparently something similar happened with respect to the cranes my suggestion on solving that problem is that the council authorized myself and lynn to address how to get this resolved with the other city and if the resolution i don't know when your next um workshop is but i i would assume it's within one to two weeks that we come back to you and with a several options as to how you address it part of the reason i suggest you do it that way is i i'm not challenging anything that anybody said here this evening um i i will take it as you're you're telling me factually accurate manner of what happened but the appropriate thing to do before anybody starts talking about let's file a lawsuit is let's establish factually what the situation is and i've read the interlocal agreement i've read the deeds i've read all that stuff numerous times but i don't have instant recall and can't tell you all the intricate nuances of that stuff off the top of my head but between now and when the council next meets for a workshop i i would suggest we len and i work on trying to figure out a way to address that specific issue with the use of the parking lot and again i'm not diminishing that either i mean if it's your your property and there's something bad goes that goes wrong on your property then there's always going to be initial liability and the points you raise are to me very legitimate points to raise but the solutions are establish factually what the situation is and then come back to the council with options so those are my two recommendations well could you look into putting a buoy at six and 12 street [Music] if the appeal was successful it would resort back to the joint permit of 2002 which is bel air beach and bellair shores hence uh belarus shores would have to submit their own permit to have i guess our apartment or the joint department modified is that buoy within the del air beach's jurisdiction or their jurisdiction station it's still there it's within it's in within bel air shores jurisdiction well it's office yes so within your power shows jurisdiction if it's within their jurisdiction i don't i don't know what mechanism you have to force them to do something within their jurisdiction and the question again is you know we're going to change all the verbiage on ours which that billy i believe still under our apartment i think the coordinates is i've had to check the coordinates again i don't have them here but i think it is so we so belair shores has one buoy then yes okay what term it's adam it's just my understanding he's just one of the buoys that's it's the only movie that's left so what happens is like i said they break away uh and how they're put in now they don't drill them they put them in on a concrete concrete thing and going back trying to find them to put another buoy there you'd be chasing the wind then lr shores has one permit or one buoy with no permit so they're in violation of the fwcf it just gets i think it's technically you're right yeah and and and what is the fwc and that brandy the the attorney doing about that nothing frank let me ask you this because it's going on eleven o'clock here what do you want tonight from us what do you want out of i mean we can we can have an action item tonight okay you can ask for something you know action-wise as long as it's not related to spending money we said that was okay you can have an action item tonight we can do this as a work session for more information i don't agree with having liberty to do anything across the street so i have a problem with that um we just went through that for the first half hour we're not doing that game again i have no problem with fred reilly talking to people across the street but i gotta accuse myself that that's gonna happen okay so i'm not putting any leverage on these people whatsoever and make that perfectly clear i got a lawsuit i don't care what you do as a city of bellar beach okay again it's in motion we're not related on this thing i'm gonna do what i gotta do i'm gonna get them completely removed as trustees that's gonna be the end of the game that's what i'm known for you can do whatever you want to try and settle it but it's not going to change me one bit just understand that now i want to know from you though i want to call a question what would you like the question is i would like i'm a teammate steward's addis i would like two buildings one placed at sixth street under the submerged lands as our deed says and one place to twelve street but what i was hearing is that there's at least from our legal person who's saying that that might not be possible so we have been asking him to look intense so we're asking him to do the research to see if it's possible to put a buoy on 6th and 12th provide safety for our residents okay now i think we can do that so the question before us is this council authorized fred riley to do some research within reason obviously you're always reasonable so within reason um as to is it possible given everything and mr vanguard is the expert here uh to put a bully on six to put a movie on 12th given the current clinicians fwc the rules the hurricane rules you name it we just heard you know this is mine there's a lot of stuff here um are you asking me can that be done can you research that yes i can i can look into it if it's something that this city can do right and the caveat to that is this city may not be able to make that happen and then you've said that and if we can't do it then i have to step as much as i want to have safety i can't authorize us to go out and violate somebody else's you know sovereign space i'm not going to do that um other people might have one um but you know if you tell us if there's any way of doing it then let's go for it it is safety and it is our number one priority um i don't think we're asking i hope we're not asking for too detailed of a legal research thing here but sometimes these things tend to go crazy you never know the solution is for me to call the attorney that you've communicated with and i i will talk to them i mean i've read over the emails back and forth and you you have done a stellar job of trying to figure out how to get something done and i may hit the same brick wall that you get i don't know but i that would be the first call and i i will not spend endless time trying to figure it out then i i say again the starting point is to establish factually what you're trying to do and who has jurisdiction over that that is the starting point meanwhile you have the proposed ordinance that did you send it to them okay so it's now in front of them and i will gladly call that the attorney for that the commission and talk to her and see if if we can expedite them giving us some review of that statute or the ordinance there's nothing in it that they should reject i mean i went meticulously through the code or the statute and the administrative code provision to make sure i was using all the language that they used in both of those two resources so there's no reason they should reject it but that's up to them and it just has to be noted though about those deeds and our access and submerged land part of that when you're talking to fwc can i make a comment to you or are you done with the board well i guess i'm done for now thanks uh before we take that step uh wouldn't it be um feasible to go ahead and get you to send all these public or all these records that you state that you have showing all your communications so we can at least look at something a little bit more than just going to send in our city attorney to do something i mean i'd like to see all the documentation that you have so uh yes i sent it through uh except for the appeal i sent everything through uh our city account okay so they were representing the city versus you i thought i heard you say earlier you did that on your personal account on the appeal of the department but the rest of it has been done on the city can you send that a building then as well so that i can i can afford it mr banker you might want to review that public records rules personal lawsuit isn't public record so you make your own decision or speak with fred riley about that you don't necessarily have to provide that perhaps okay i know mine is a personal [Music] is what you're entitled to with regard to um so we're going to call that question um and and with regard to this parking situation we really don't have much that we can offer you i will tell you this and it's going to be extremely cryptic for a reason okay by the next time we meet i might have some more information and that's all i'm going to say okay about this issue okay um i i will know something that's quite important okay um that's all i'm saying okay um so let's go ahead yes it has and what was in the spot no we don't but i'm not questioning that i'm questioning the lots that are deeded to us in the submerged land language which i believe is not under belarus jurisdiction because if you read into it uh as soon as it goes into the submerged lands it's actually in florida yeah in florida it's florida trust so that's that's where i believe we have the argument plus that would only protect our residents if bellar shores at fourth street wants their people to go out there and get hit by votes request uh city attorney to look into installing 1 billion 6th street 1 billion 12th street under the language of the deeds that we were granted back in 1944 with the submerged language the suburbs land language along with the florida trust public trust that's the question does everybody get glenn's nodding everybody understand the question i'm not going to try and repeat that okay so a yes vote will authorize the city uh city attorney to move forward with the investigative process within recent the work with frank vanguard who has the information and actually it sounds like a lot of it has been put in the public domain already okay so um with that we can do this as a voice vote all in favor aye aye opposed i step seven to zero no i'm unknown six to one anybody else opposed let the record reflected six to one read a smoke is the net is the no okay because i want that in the um even though we're doing a voice vote i want the accuracy of the vote maintained every one of those was yes and that's the no so it passes six to one so mr riley you'll move forward um good luck yes sir frank thank you thank you your your dedication to the safety of this community is incredible i i'm in total admiration um unfinished business item 23 do we have any none city attorney due to the late hour i prefer not to give any report this evening okay city manager yes mayor console i just want to give you an update on [Music] the sign and bird issue i asked ms ronero to send me that information at the last meeting she did send it to me i contacted these people nick jennings from the for for our wildlife commission and i spoke to him i spoke to also spoke to the florida department of transportation and i also so spoke to a mark rachel that they contacted and based on their comments there there is no requirement to do any environmental study and they the information they were given by whoever contacted him and i'm not sure who did contact them rather it was denver mall or ms rodero based on the email i got mr rachel sent me an email saying thank you for reaching out to me i don't believe there would be any negative impacts to birds that nest or roost on the intercoastal islands located a thousand feet away there's a buffer of vegetation and residential development that would obscure any direct line of sight the fdot said there's no permit required they don't do any environmental studies so whatever was said to these gentlemen it appears that it wasn't clear like maybe where the location was signed or what kind of birds they were the gentleman from florida wildlife commission told me that there are no endangered birds here the only thing the fdot said they would do is for the sea turtles on gulf boulevard so we're not on an issue not an issue i think the information was just maybe misunderstood or whatever so in your opinion at this point nothing further investigation is necessary you can move forward with the installation yeah yes yes based on what they told me city council before we let that go i just want to ask the city council if anybody has any objection to it uh city manager or the city manager moving forward with this it doesn't matter whether you were for or against the sign there's no permit issue the sign passed does anybody have any problems with him moving forward please move forward okay uh i told you at the work session just want to remind everybody because this meeting's take that we did retain our 20 reduction in the national flood insurance program for the citizens and uh with assistance from kyle and mark beam participating in some things that we got some extra points for i that that was very positive and i appreciate their help we talked about the economy virus funds already the telephone system we received email on the 17th of august telling us that our phone system is obsolete and they aren't going to maintain it any longer so i reached out to two or three companies and got prices for the equipment from seven hundred twenty dollars to fifty seven hundred dollars the phone system uh currently would change over to it's called voip voiceover okay uh and it looks like the most cost effective thing to do is uh go through verizon instead of these specialty phone companies uh verizon will give us the equipment for the phones for 700. they won't charge us any installation and then we'll pay a monthly fee for each of the lines which should be covered with the the maintenance agreement that we previously had that's in the budget we'll be able to cover that with that cost so we'll you know unless you have an issue with that we'll just move forward on that because it's like your total anticipated cost cost of the new system uh for the equipment 720 okay for the monthly cost it's 25 line we're going to reduce some of the lines because there's phones and places that you walk across the room there's another phone so we're gonna eliminate some we're gonna end up with nine phones and that'll cost us about 245 a month for those phones so for for the service not the phones and they'll install it for us so uh let me ask a question we currently have automated attendant uh established that's that's is that included yeah okay great then you have adequate bandwidth because while we will be using bandwidth now with this yeah we uh based on what verizon has told me and the two phone copies that and looked others think i think we're okay if we have to increase it we've got to do that they're not anticipating transfer changing our internet provider which is spectrum right now but we've got verizon equipment in the building and we are we do have verizon lines in here we're going to be able to trunk all the numbers over you're not going to have to change numbers no we're going to try to trump them over yeah yeah it's the phones we eliminated were uh we had one in the art records room one in the kitchen one in the uh break room two in the kind of reception area well ten feet apart you don't really need to uh and the what's that other room called archive archive we're going to eliminate those funds but i'm curious as to where spectrum do they close also spectrum doesn't provide equipment they don't provide i went to them first thinking oh maybe they do this but they don't and i verified that again today with another person evidently they don't know who they've called and talked to because they called me to try to talk to me about it so i've given you the county-wide planning rules amendments that's something that the county sent out and also the legislative action agenda from the florida cities uh probably the biggest thing on there for us is the short-term rentals at this point and uh you know they're they're gonna uh support some things trying to allow us maybe to amend our organs in the future that doesn't purpose the last thing our second last thing neighborly [Music] services sent you all a letter asking for a donation we've done that in some years and some years we haven't we have one individual that uses that service what's the constant's pleasure on that do you want to donate or not have we previously donated uh we didn't last year but the year before we did and maybe that was because the pandemic maybe they didn't send us anything but you know we do give money to the uh the sheriffs you know where they take the homeless i'm looking at this since one of our citizens uses his services yeah in the letter they told me that it was only [Music] it was like 22 or dollars in services that one of our residents uses actually it was 2167.55 81 meals and one transportation in the previous 12 months i mean you know we're not a charitable organization we're not a full i'm good with it [Music] fred to look into an attorney general's opinion on public records and fees i i think it's important that we resolve this once and for all if elected officials get paid for public records requests or anybody gets paid for public workers requests and what that fee is and uh fred brad and i have looked into it a little bit but i just want to let you know thank you any questions for city manager citizens thank you city clerk nothing city council comments i don't let's see september um yes uh really all i have to say is i just want to ask everyone in our community to keep the families and the victims of 9 11 in their thoughts and prayers since that anniversary date is coming up you know we normally did a moment of silence in the past form so since that's what we didn't do that this evening i just want to make sure that i mention it thank you i just want you to know i was going to mention that also and um uh particularly with josh's widow here um i would like to hold a moment of silence at the end here uh that is absolutely something we've never had we have a resolution that we passed so we'll do one before we leave here if that's okay with everyone um let's move to tarah i know it's been a long night um i do have one one comment i've talked about this before and i think i'd like to add it to the next agenda or a work session about what to do about these dilapidated booklets docs boats that have not been moved in years things growing out of them it was a it was a a rude awakening whenever our neighbors boat fell in the water and then the storm was approaching and then the uh i think they had dock issues they they tried to fish the boat out themselves and it wound up upside down for over a week uh in our in our area and uh it's all because they had a boat that they don't use they don't care about everything's rusted and the cable eventually snapped um it's it's a hazard and i see them all over the place and uh i think maybe it's time to look into doing something about it dave to your point not only that i'm noticing more and more votes in the in the travel lanes and you know not necessarily the channels but they're all over the place now and we've talked about this we talked about what other cities have done but that's a problem too so maybe we just deal with all of these problems in one shot if you want me to latch on to what you have here that's fine [Music] walls and stuff and it's absolutely yeah so let's deal with it uh is one question this work session to have it right after the special meeting you know i didn't i was gonna say do we need a work session we had a real long session tonight i wasn't going to call one unless everybody else wanted one i certainly have some items that i could put on but i you know we really did double duty tonight so if if you wanted counsel you got it so just let me know it would be after the 505 meeting which should take all about 15 minutes so um but they're already here i'm up for it if others are if no one's in the mood for it we can push it out it's still hurricane season this is a good time to be talking about this because uh somebody or something's going to get hurt council what do you want to do work session yes yes yes everybody good okay so um after the 505 i'll probably have a few items but patty what will be the deadline for getting items on the agenda wednesday this wednesday no wednesday the 15th 15th okay so that's the deadline to paddy by close business okay close business all right that's good right i think it's all right do you have anything else okay i'm last i um i i did want to recognize the folks with 9 11 20 years ago a horrible horrible day in uh new york city in the pentagon and in shanksville pennsylvania so um i'm going to ask that we adjourn but before we adjourn we're going to do the uh the moment of silence i'm not going to call you back and say let's do a motion to adjourn so let's do we have the motion to adjourn everybody in agreement yes yes rise of silence of silence"
