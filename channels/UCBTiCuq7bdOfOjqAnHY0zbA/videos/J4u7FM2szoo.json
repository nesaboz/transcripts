reset that leverage to make sure we one question did you have it sent to your office or did the clerk because you call it it says mail to the city of indiana okay thank you i'm glad that tyler is on the committee here okay new business we have guest speakers we count today jill marcus our supervisor elections and uh we uh she basically is going to give us any rundown on changes to the election process since we're in the season and then just open it up for questions for us all right as best i can do as i speak around the gate but mayor thank you for having us here today it's a beautiful room and uh good morning everyone for election vote just 27 days for you all the primary and we've got some candidates here so i know that you're like thank god but um we have been like it has i honestly it hasn't stopped it feels like 2020 but it deserves a comma two does that make sense so it just keeps going and uh we haven't really had much of a break which is fine but it is what it is but we got done with redistricting which was a huge project we got done with a lot of things that we can't do in even years because it even years you're just going there going you're going and you can't get other projects done so in odd years which i know is when a lot of you have all of your municipal elections but that is our time when we get things that we have to get done done for example we had a huge average point project for our gis to help us with listening as with addresses that took a whole year to get done we couldn't do it in 2020 for obvious reasons this year so we had to squeeze that in 2021. we get pm done on equipment we get updates on software all these things get done in our odd years um so 2021 was a very aggressive get it done year we had to pay attention to a lot of this legislation that was coming out of um 2021-22 and it's just been going and going um so leading up to for redistricting everybody got their voter info cards i've already talked to people who um say they uh it's probably sitting in a pile which brings me great um pleasure in knowing that we are speaking to our constituency that everybody has their card you don't need it but it's a requirement under law so we mail it so you can use it for homestead and whatever but you know what you can vote for a very confusing question that folks have right now is well who's my current person representing me it's who it is so nothing changes right now so you're it's like who you had as a representative for their term is who you have through the end of this cycle what's under card is who you are going to be voting for this fall or in the future depending on when your term is up so that's the biggest question that we're getting in regard to your district who's now in who's going to be that's how it will be so once we have elections in 2022 in the general and everybody raises japan they take office those will be reflective of your card does that make sense okay good all right the other thing is we mailed out 300 and i'm sorry guys i'll try to come back over here so no i'm in love with you guys okay so we mailed out 345 000 mail ballots just like we have since the beginning of time you have to request one of those we don't just like it mail so that's you know one of these things that just has been has had some wheels and i can't i'm trying with all of my mind to stop that car from rolling down a hill we don't just blanket mail ballots you have to request one if you want one go on our website make a phone call a small change to law which is what it is but you do need to kind of like it's a multi-factor authentication concept where you have to provide your florida dm number or your social we have to match it and then we can get your requests on file same with any address changes uh party changes all that needs to get done through providing additional information it's a it's just an extra step to protect the integrity of the process and not come across as being the difficulty for folks but it is new that is earned senate bill 90 from 21. uh so let's see what else changed okay you still can return your mail ballot by mail make sure you get that ballot back to us a little later than election day that is something else that florida was great law they all have to be in by 7 pm election day and we can start counting them uh weeks in advance so we will start counting mail ballots uh i think it's the 16th of august so general election will be a little bit further back from the election because you're just looking at volume and plus it'll probably be a two card ballot uh but so those are good things we can count ahead of time and the battles have to begin by 7pm election day and you've had other states that have different laws and then you can see how that can be um because you've seen how that plays out so those are good and with mail ballots you can also take them back to i would want calling them for the sake of simplicity return locations remember those the return locations um so instead you take them to some place you can return them and there will be 24 of them for this election so they'll be spread out all over the place they're within uh what is it three miles within everybody's home yay and they're very convenient and in pinellas county we've been doing this since 2008 this is not a new concept to us this is something that we've always had stacked we've got two employees that are there the ballots have always come back they're reconciled there's chain of custom procedures we actually are the model for what is in statute now i believe it's a safe and secure way of providing a way as an alternative to returning your ballot by now you can drop it i'm sorry return it to one of these locations great and it's secure how many people have returned valid to one of these locations you see it the person sitting there two put in the box walk out comes back that day and we put it in our system so and you can track these outs online on our website go on our website track it when did you get your request in when did we mail it to you when did we receive it was it counted or not it's all right there for people to track the purpose of our office is to maintain transparency integrity but not at the cost of access so there's always that fine balance between elect when it comes to election law or how procedures are carried out to carry out those laws is access and integrity you have to in a republic of people voting obviously right but you can't have such a free for all where you sacrifice integrity but you cannot use integrity into such a degree where people can't vote so balance that's how elections work find the balance so we do everything we can to find that balance and integrity in pinellas is not a new concept i don't need a law to tell me to do elections right so we are all about fair accurate and secure elections no matter how you vote so if you go early because you're like i don't want to go back early and you know what i don't care how you vote so if you choose to vote in person for a primary just because of the data it's all about stats for us so we have our three early voting sites at all of our offices it'll be a week prior to the election by the way all of this is on goldmiles.gov but it'll be at our free offices about a week prior to the election you can vote in person and oh let me go back to mail ballot return locations this is a big change ballot drop return sites will not be open the monday prior to the election that is significant because it's been like that since 2008. so on monday you have to bring it to our three offices on tuesday you can drop it off at our three offices other than that you have to vote in person on the third option election day so if you want to vote on election day make sure you go to your home precinct please look at encouragement i'm speaking to government here that's kind of what i feel like so what i'm saying to you all is what i'm hoping you'll message out to your people that's what i will be your voters message this out so that monday before even it's in the instructions in the in the ballot kit is so new and fresh that i'm afraid people will be showing up at these locations on monday and being like what the heck why can't i drop this ballot off here and you can't because it has to be within a certain time frame under statute so i'm asking to push this information out to the people that you know so on election day it's really important that folks look at the precinct finder on our website or look at their voter info card which in my opinion is like the second they get it it could potentially be outdated because they move the next day so what happens is that people like people will show me cards it has like dying bubbles name on it and i'm like okay i loved her because i knew her personally but she hasn't been with us since 2000 so you should get rid of that card unless you want it for nostalgic reasons but for purposes of information you need the most current card based on your information so if you get a card in the mail and you move the next day and you don't tell us your card is outdated does that make sense so your card is current it's your information on our system so i prefer people to go to our website precinct finder to know where they're supposed to vote we've had with redistricting we minimized polling place changes 90 of everybody who in our county had no change but there's still folks who did so go to canals to find where you got to go encourage folks to do that so we're well underway information is on our website candidates are prepared we've got a couple contests i don't know where i know that you guys are along the um the water but district 657 because of the lawsuit uh that that contest is over but none of the notices to tell anybody of this could make it in the first 307 45 000 kits because of the timing but because somebody was removed from the ballot even though you're going to see their name on it because printing already took place it doesn't matter if that contest is gone um district four for county commission is a universal primary which means it'll be on every person's ballot within district four it's confusing because people are like why do i have two republican candidates on my ballot when i'm not it's because you're allowed to vote in that and that's a really big law change that happened like a million years ago because in pinellas we had a sheriff contest there was two republicans that ran for office and it was a closed primary so what does that mean that means only republicans were allowed to vote for the sheriff and the winner was the winner and they represented everybody so they're like okay we should probably change that so they changed that law they created what they call the universal primary so if there's only one political party represented in the primary and there's no opposition in the general everybody in that jurisdiction is eligible to vote for that contest so that everybody got to vote for the sheriff is that any sense so in boarding county commission district 4 that's what you'll see there we have two other pending lawsuits one we don't expect an appeal and one is set for trial on thursday that impacts congressional district 14 which has nothing to do with you guys but that's where you are on the other side um what else questions oh the mail ballots you have to continually request them or once you've excellent thank you for that question okay so here's the deal mailbar requests if you have a request if you got a ballot between 2020 and now okay you're good you do not need to request a ballot for the general election however please please fill out the request info in your general election now ballot kit if you want to keep voting by mail because the statue did change for this everybody's mail ballot request which has a very healthy and robust mail ballot process people enjoy the convenience of voting by mail so we did not put guns to people's heads they just got on and thought this is excellent i can vote this way it's convenient fantastic and they've been doing it since 08 but all of those requests are obsolete and invalid at the end of this year which means panel starts at zero so we like whiteboarded this idea and that's not a joke we went through and tried to think of every possible way that we can connect humor me when you're in election vote right you're like okay i'm gonna let you vote how many of you guys are thinking about elections in january nobody is no one they don't care you're like yeah i'm done thank god that's over right it's out of sight out of mind so my mission to staff was no one is going to think about elections or doing something with a postcard in the middle of january no one's getting here no one's going to return this concept so how do we make it relevant in election mode where people can make it convenient and we don't make another issue so we whiteboarded a whole nother bunch of ideas we came up with stick something inside uh have another envelope do all these different things but then you think well that's a good idea another envelope yeah that's a great idea until they put a ballot in an envelope that doesn't have their name on it or any information that we need to count it scratch that idea so what we did we come up with this is the best idea that we can come up with to try to capture as many requests as humanly possible before we all come off in december 30th we came and that impacts your municipal elections by the way that's what's so scary is you start at zero and all of your municipalities are having elections in march and no one's on the system to get a ballot so we're doing this guys for you too because it's important that your elections have people voting in them also um not to ease the phrase but policies are local it's important can we request now no don't request now that's the problem you're requesting for the general so what we're trying to do is we're trying to we created an um we have an envelope you know how you sign the outside the envelope how many of you check the box i'd like to keep voting by mail you signed it you were done well you can't just have that now now you have to have a place for a person's driver's license or social security number last four digits so that we can verify that information on your voter info in our system in order for us to put on a request it sounds wonderful i get it it's a multi-factor concept i get it but it also is a very difficult thing to administer and get people to respond to so what we did is we're like okay on the outside of the flap okay where you seal it underneath there we put a box that says i want to keep voting by mail with the info that we now need dl or ss or a qr code so you can go do it on our website great and then you seal it and you sign it great please do it encourage people to do this it's a very secure way of getting it back to us and then in december the beautiful thing we get to do that used to be a very automated process is we need to spend a cool six plus figures on opening and flapping it and putting all this info and verifying all this and we get to do that in the month of december so that we can get folks on before with your marketing elections but it's going to take time to educate voters on this to get them used to this concept um and we'll see how it goes but it's better than starting at zero that the mayors [Music] kind of uh taking that question a step further all of the mayors here have always communicated with my constituents if you could put together some kind of a primer uh then we can i think we could i would incorporate it i think legally in our massachusetts residents so they can understand the process better because as you indicated it's a bit confusing so if you could put that together for us i think that would be an excellent yeah this work will work together with all municipalities and we'll uh send something out that you guys can maybe put on your website email to your community whichever way we can just get this information out because it is that in and of itself to me this is the biggest significant change specifically for pinellas county because of the impact it could potentially have on us getting folks re-signed back up and keep in mind city st petersburg is putting the question on the ballot this november about changing their municipal election dates to even years which means we don't have the city of saint pete which we normally have in august in november of odd years to kind of anchor all of your elections also so going into and what i mean by that is kind of a it's a there's a whole lot elections when it comes to municipalities in odd years you also in essence support each other that's why we're able to keep election costs low and i'm just putting out on the radar not for everybody in the room but for the cities in towns i want you to just keep in mind that there may be some increases like the city of seminole needs to um consider do they want to still have their elections in november because they are the only municipality that will be having elections in november in this referendum or charter sorry changes their election dates and that is going to significantly increase their election costs because when you have elections where a lot of you are together we we're able to it's kind of i hate to say this like like election socialism we're labeled to distribute costs across everyone because just being just mailing ballots alone and having to set up our mail system to do that is thousands of dollars so the city of st petersburg because they have 130 000 registered voters is able to absorb most of that cost or the city is somehow it's less but if the city assembles the only one having them you get all of it does that make sense so so we don't have the luxury of citizens being exposed to this male ballot change and i'm afraid going into the presidential preference primary we're not going to be at 340 05 requests i'm afraid we're not even at half does that make sense because that's huge huge so it's it's this thing and it's just it's just it is what it is you got to try to do your best with the laws that are passed but it doesn't make it it's very difficult to get voters into new concepts julie yes you mentioned 345 000 mail and ballots went out how does that compare to the last election and then can you explain the vetting process for mail and balance yes thank you we actually look at these i promise you have to be a registered voter to request a mail ballot once we nail you the ballot you then have to sign it which is review every single signature is verified by staff every single one and the law does allow for a cure option so that if we see that a signature not suggesting fraud but people have strokes people things happen you have some 18 year old that sign really fluffy with his heart and all this and then now they have a kid and they have a house and all this stuff and they're very professional about it change so we cure signatures but all of that has to have ids you have to sign an affidavit there's all these tiers of verifying mail ballots now ballots are not horrible so these pictures you see that is just randomly all over the place that does not happen important because they have to come back to us uh you cannot request the mail ballot to an address that has never been on our file over the phone it has to be in writing where we can verify your information and your signature to make sure that wherever you want us to send your ballot it's you asking for that ballot to go there and then when ballots come back we have to verify those signatures we have to verify that uh first here's something else that you may hear out in the world okay because this is a big we have that last 35 days prior to the election but people can change their parties up until 29 days before the election so what happens ballots go to i'm not picking teams here just saying a democrat right then they change their political party to a republican on the 29th day we have to mail a republican ballot because that's not what they're registered as so what do they have now at their home two ballots let's pretend they return both the first one receives the one that counts period so let's pretend they returned the democrat one back in the past the candidacy board would get those and they count the contest that that person would have been eligible to vote for regardless of what ballot came back right which would be the non-partisan contest if they returned the right one which was a republican because that was the last thing that they updated it with it's good to go but the point is you only count one another thing that happens is people move all the time so they may get a ballot like an old address have it and then they get another ballot and the new one they're like it doesn't matter you can only count one so the first one we get back that's the one that counts that's important too and you can track all of this on our website and you can show off to all these meetings we do not conduct elections in a closet have all of our meetings where we open up ballots or we test voting equipment when we conduct audits when we conduct recounts all of it and i know that these small municipalities have recounts all the time thank you but the point i actually dig them i don't mind recounts it's not that something went wrong it's just it is close and let's look at it again we had elections where it was a one vote different it was like just months ago and the vote didn't change we had ones where there's ties in the boats don't change the referendum failed in one of municipalities because it was tied and it didn't pass because i've seen elections this is why i'm kind of like i'm like how many did you lose it here so you're down by a thousand votes i'm like yeah that's not gonna happen i see five quote become a difference i'm like oh that's going to be a tough one to get because for every vote you get if it's top that close then the other person's gonna audience it's just very difficult recounts to me i love it because it proves our system's work i'm like bring it let's show this show once again we've had four recaps since the 2020 general election for [Music] we went out and bought a system that's completely separate from our tab system not staying company they're not connected in any way shape or form totally separate this system you go through i'm sorry let me tell you how it works so you told you i'm so when we count balance they go through our tabulation system right which is an island like that it's like an island it is by itself it's contained it does not get email traffic internet traffic it is a stand-alone system period now in our room so we're processing these valves they're going through high speed scanners that's their only job they don't think by the way they don't get hungry they don't not wonder where the kids are at they're not wandering you know off because they've been looking at the 400 000 ballot and they're tired right we're just counting not just ballots but dozens of contests right we had like a million cars a million cars in the 2020 general election and there were dozens of contests so how many votes is that because these are the encounter people that i really want to be like really we want a hand count i just have a system here that i tested publicly every single one of these systems has been tested not only certified but then accepted tested by us and tested and the system's just counting it's like the same thing that happens in a bank we throw a thousand one dollar bills and the system says yeah there's a hundred dollars a thousand one dollar bills and you're like right and you accept that do you not who's sitting there going no one is you take your little piece of paper scrapped around you're like thank you very much everyone what are you doing with a thousand one dollar rules but okay the point is is that that's what our system is now attached to it's always going through the scanners and you're putting them in during early voting around election day right it's going through scanner now battles provisionals go through the high speed scanners all the battles come back right we put them through an independent audit system so you can stand again by a totally different system so the safety primary we audited 100 precincts every single contest every single vote cast so there's like over 77 000 postcasts those like opals it was absolutely the same the same 100 accuracy that's how amazing this system is and i stand behind 100 000 i feel very strongly that we cannot have a healthy republic if people do not believe and have confidence in our system and i'm telling you here today as your canals county supervisor of elections you can have faith that pinellas county is counting your ballots fairly accurately and securely at every single step this is what we live breathe and do every single day i do not waver from that amen [Applause] so i want you to have faith i want you to go into these elections knowing it's good to go and at the elections that you guys put us in charge of because it's it's a it's a contract we're not required by law to conduct municipal elections but we do it because it's a good community service maybe we're really awkward for municipalities to be doing this on their own you'd have to go out and get your own systems you'd have to do everything and it would be cost prohibited if not near impossible so we do that we have this great relationship working relationship and i want you all to have faith that when you get elected or that you cast the vote then it matters you guys are valid mirrors or you're a valid loser which by the way by the way 50 of the people so anyway i appreciate there's more questions i got you guys more questions i would appreciate if you could stick around in case anybody hasn't made it yeah private questions hopefully a quick question i appreciate okay yes were there more or less mail-in ballots that went out this time i'm sorry yes so for the general election of 2020 there were by the end of it we had 411 000 requests so why are they why does that drop off to 3.45 it drops off because people move we have to do the statements and people just come off um through that process people will get rid of their requests and choose not to vote by mail anymore so it's a constant moving thing um i believe by the time we get to um october or 2022 i believe it'll go it'll be beyond i'm hoping 375. we'll see but i think i think that this is why i don't like major overhauls after something that could have been an anomaly so 2020 that you know we had you know pandemic and lava loss you don't know what people where their heads were because you had this completely random thing happen that never has happened before so he made people maybe a lot of people voted by now on that one literally because of coping and they'll never choose to do that again you know what i'm saying so i think this is this is where pinellas is my fear is that i'm afraid that because all the requests drop off at the end of the year it's going to take a few elections for us to get back in a few elections means oh my god 2024 is right around the corner you know what i mean okay thank you very much [Applause] [Music] got lots to think about i'm sure i created some questions um moving on to fort pinellas representative of the bbc i'd like to nominate alan johnson as our forward house representative second luke yes i'm willing this she's a good salesman wow is it we have a couple more things we're trying to get done like what glenn is the next speaker and we're still trying to get all of you for the safe streets because that was one goal as a chair this year for us to get all of the 24 municipalities clearwater still hasn't signed so i think i'm going to come down and talk to whoever um i i don't know what the issue is but yeah i love frank so i'm going to come down and i have to talk to him anyway so and if you're if you have concerns please call me call wit we'll be more than happy to meet with anybody with come up here for a sec because you're next anyway what um what any of the cities here i don't mean to single them out because they may not know um any of the cities that um are here that haven't done their safe street just you know because i have a meeting with city manager and um i will see frank today okay so i would love to come and talk to him if he wants we can talk it through whatever it is okay we're sorry about that anyway we're working on a couple more things that are very very exciting but i'm not going to say anything until we have our meetings with the county and and our chair but they will affect the beaches so i'm super excited about it you know it's always good to go out with the bank so i hope it's a nice bank you got to get that done by the end of the day yes yes yes okay thank you very much why do you push that out to 2045 i mean that's 22 years from now should we have a shorter objective than that well we do we have a target of 20 production in fatalities and serious injuries on our roadways over a two-year period and we chose that 20 because we looked historically at the last five years of crash data and we looked at the lowest year and that was 20 lower than where we're at today so we know we can achieve it it wasn't that long ago we had 20 percent fewer fatalities so that's our target the goal it's an aspirational goal zero deaths for our roadways we signed up to that tampa signed up to it the city of saint pete city orlando the federal government and the state of florida the florida department of transportation has a vision zero goal but it's a goal it's an aspirational goal and that's can you kind of pick a year so that's the horizon year of our long-range transportation plan um you know we don't accept uh any deaths on our airlines you know if we killed 300 people a week with planes dropped out of the sky we'd be talking about that if trains killed 300 people a week we'd be talking about that but we just sort of accept 300 people in our country on our own and that's not acceptable so that's what we're trying to change is that attitude that mentality and i've had mayors um not anybody sitting here in this room tony well everybody cares about safety but um you know what's that applied but we got to get some work out and speeding is a big problem with our injuries and fatalities on the road aggressive driving is a big problem impaired driving is a big problem but impaired driving and distracted driving isn't the big percentage that's been reported it's not 80 of that it's more like 20 or 30 years so there's other factors that are involved and a lot of it is the design of our roadways had a bicyclist killed up in pasco county last week i looked at where that bicyclist was riding there wasn't a sidewalk there wasn't a shoulder uh and and you know it was a road that was lined by driveways for residential uh homes all along that's pasco but still you know and that bicyclist you know you say well maybe he didn't have lights maybe he wasn't wearing a helmet or maybe he wasn't he was wearing dark clothing somebody still ran that bicyclist down and that's that's a challenge we have on our roadways and it's not just bicyclist curly road and us-19 is our most dangerous intersection in the county we have crashes there involving very serious injuries and fatalities weekly and and you know when we build the overpasses on us 19 guess what happened to our crashes they're not happening on us 19 as much they've shifted underneath they're now happening at the underpasses at sunset point in us so we've got a problem and we need to be serious about it i am happy to say that the florida department of transportation is a great partner and they really want to move the needle on safety uh it's not just they don't just say safeties are number one gold they're actually behind changes in how we design and manage you know we're not we're not going to prevent everybody from doing something stupid but if you take a safe systems approach you recognize that people make mistakes and you design and you account for that in your planning and development of your transportation network and that's what grass is going to do is think a little bit differently last night i was really happy to hear that uh city of turban springs adopted the safe streets resolution so that's one more check i think we've got seminole we've got ells park and clearwater uh and so that was great um really the resolution does not connect you to any specific actions and communicable partnership it commits you to working with us to identify demonstration projects it commits you to working with us on law enforcement working with us on education all the things like that because it's not just about building and designing things and if we can work together i think we'll have a much better quality of life for our residents here and i'm happy to answer the questions well we've also got an enforcement problem and i see it every day along the beaches and that is uh the enforcement with the pedestrians themselves we've got crosswalks all up and down madeira beach they can be 20 feet from a crosswalk and not use it we've spent thousands of dollars with lights and crosswalks they don't push the button at night people are invisible you've got the car lights you've got dark clothing you literally can't see people and we also need a program to educate these pedestrians i think everybody knows it is just inherent laziness you know with a lot of people because if they don't happen to walk up to a crosswalk they're not going to use it and so if we don't have enforcement there's not an ordinance out there that is any good if you don't have that of course yeah we do have uh we work with law enforcement a lot there they serve on some of our committees and and they are good partners i think it's a it's a manpower they can't be everywhere all the time so education and and getting some tickets and getting some warnings to send a message what i've heard from chief slaughter and clearwater in particular is it's sometimes hard to change behavior with enforcement and ticketing if you're taking a visitor who's going to be gone and then you're going to be replaced with another visitor who's probably never seen a rapid flashing beacon light and doesn't know what to do so there are some unique challenges is there something that um it's a john's point that we could do as far as education where we could go into some of the cities or uh and have you know some kind of a event where people could come and we could you know send some of our staff and we could go just to sit down and say these are because you know i get calls a lot about why aren't they red you know and i explained you know why are the you know beacons read all this so uh and it's just informational i mean could we do something like that in two or three different in the past areas i'm happy to do that again we are about to hire a safety and dedicated safety planner who will be the person for all of this and that person will help do that we're also hiring a communications person and that's going to be one of her key responsibilities is helping develop those messages and education campaigns that fdot is also really able to amplify that and they have a much bigger budget than i do in terms of developing videos developing materials so i just need help from the local governments and all our partners to identify opportunities for them years ago we used to work with hoteliers on the beach beach communities to put hangers on the doorknobs of the hotels uh we would work with the general managers we get information to all the visitors um so when you checked into your room there's some safety messages right there from the center so there's a lot of things we can do that i think help raise awareness one quick question um the the targeted number of them have twenty percent reduction is that a per capita thing in just a tracker it's it's we have a crash data in the input system so we track that every year we're by the federal highway administration to establish those performance measures um so that is something that we track we you look we get all the crash reports uh same threat in the back there is part of our team that does that so you know we've got a really good way of monitoring that and we're required to every two years renew that performance of gentlemen yeah if you got any movements but i mean i know we fought this thing about the rrf fees right and where we could put it when we couldn't is that going to come back up again or we won that guy i think we won that battle um with that um the state of florida did change some of their design statements for where those flashing beacons can be located they cannot be on the six lane road anymore that can't be on a road with a speed limit above 40. and there's a different device you could put on a road like that if you drive down a park boulevard you'll see there are pedestrian hybrid beacons that actually do flat they turn red so it's a little more of a clear message that you've got to come to a complete stop in those locations on higher speed roads thank you so um my question is has there been ever any comparative studies are between countries and the reason i say that i'm blessed to be really well traveled and you know whether you're doing the circle in sean did you see in paris or the rotunda pirenza or those horrible roads in montreal where the weather and poor road maintenance there's no lanes i just went to buenos aires where there's 17 lane avenues and i've also been in roads where there's no limit to the speed limit and all of that i've looked into have less fatalities than we do so has there been a really in-depth analysis of what is actually causing our rates to be so much higher than other places in the world where they have more dangerous um environment no painted lanes no speed no speed uh limits um huge you know eight lane circles and i i i'm afraid to drive there like i'm literally afraid to drive there but then like i used to live on currently in us 19 and you're right there was an accident every couple of days so i'm wondering if there has been an in-depth study on either driver behavior or or culture that's something that's at least should be included in analyzing the results of the fatalities yeah that's a great question and there have been a lot of studies over the years the transportation research board is national academy of sciences probably behind many of those i don't want to sit here and quote you all the reasons i think you've touched on some of the culture is a big part of it uh we have kind of a driver's license vending machine here in the u.s where it's pretty easy to get a driver's license um compared to some other countries and then i think the uncertainty that you cite and maybe a little bit of fear is another factor when people uh are uncertain in their in how other people are gonna behave you're a little more cautious um and there's been some experiments in the u.s i think there's a famous one in california right now where they purposefully painted the lines on the road not straight but curved so then you're forced to kind of drive this way and they've also created some roads where um it's not clear how you share the lane going in each other direction so you're gonna have to yield if somebody's coming on that you know that's not something that's common in the us so there's a lot of criticism of that but there was one city i'm trying to remember where it is maybe el cajon and california but they've they've tested that so it'll be interesting to see as we look at some of those things maybe that's applicable but i think it really comes down to culture and our you know we are in love with the automobile we've developed a lot of our cities and states around all the good travel and the need for speed is real for some people thank you very much lighting alone would help these crosswalks and that's something you may want to consider is when one is put in at least have it out of a street light we have a big lighting project coming from the state of florida i think we're spending i want to say it's three or four million dollars to enhance the lighting on a lot of the state roads we still need to get some more lighting on county roads uh and that's something that i've talked about specifically at crossings thank you thank you very much for watching okay moving on do you want to buy the cities or do you want to buy the big city if you're willing to do it we'd love to have it well let's do that and then mayor i just wanted to remind you that for your appointment with us we need your i'll make a motion that we endorse endorse the uh resolution for safety a second motion a second all those in favor um okay discussion right here um i know there's one that exists on indian rocks beach i'm working with reddington beach right now to kind of keep this idea going and i wanted to just touch on why i decided to do this and what i've found in doing so and i think this is important earlier this year i just as max rhyming takes off videos of picking up trash on the beach every morning and earlier this year i kept noticing that there's a lot of plastic exploits being offline so i wanted to figure out a way that we could come up with an innovative way to change that like i said indian rock speech kind of gave me this idea so i created my own little one and i put it on right into the stores and then the box got taken away so i went to the council and i was like can we put a box there and then we all voted yes a lot of the issues and concerns leading up to why this box necessarily wouldn't work where what if kids are stealing the toys out of the beach what if it becomes a glorified trash can what if it's stolen so i just want to go over when i dropped the box on the beach earlier this year around march first uh on the long journeys and shores i didn't chain it to the p or anything i literally just left it there the box is still there to this day i check it every other day and sometimes it's full sometimes it's empty so that lets me know that people are bringing toys to the box to leave after they leave and then also we have residents here that are finding those toys to be fun and bringing them home and away from the beaches off of the sand away from the ocean um and then on top of that like i said i go out there every other day i think i found maybe two pieces of trash in there um because it's a very noticeable box that says take it's boiling sway box so and it's constantly being used throughout the day so if you're that person walking up to a bunch of kids playing in a toy box and dumping the trash in there and leaving you're kind of that guy and i don't think many people are doing that so um just constantly checking in with it or just keeping an eye on it and making sure that it's in the right spot not on the places that uh for example pci might not be the best thing because there's not many kids up in pci um but residential hotel where like where you know families are bringing the children to play in the toys that's where we want those toy boxes and i've talked to a lot of people who are just wanting to um they'll also pick up the plastic toys out of the sand and instead of throwing them away they're super excited to have a place to leave these toys instead of just throwing them off into suggestions yeah any of the discussions i had made basically was keeping all those beautiful they said that when they do the beaches the most often found trash is plastic toys and stuff that kids have used one thing i didn't think of when i was listening to them about that was the fact that maybe a good samaritan out there finds a toy just drops it in the box and way off the beach so maybe it works both ways yeah and i've been on i've spent a lot of time every morning on all of your beaches and there's a fine that every beach which i find so fascinating has a different group of people out there every morning being on trash um i became friends with a lot of those morning residents along the beach and they they keep saying the same thing there's always there are always finding toys um so there are people out there spending their mornings doing that so providing that place i firmly believe that every one of our beaches should have a trash can a recycling bin and a toy box just as ways that we can further keep you know our beaches keeping keep our beaches beautiful for everyone [Music] yes my phone number is 727 742-2323 and my email is trash common spell c-a-u-l-i-n gmail.com i would like to say working with readings in beach uh has been so fun figuring out how we could the way we went about it at first was i put the box out there and got a lot of useless talk but it went out so we were able to figure out like how can we make this an interactive educational experience for teaching younger kids how they can get involved in their local community and figuring out ordinances and just kind of getting stepping into this space of like how we can educate the youth and the way that you know passing ordinances are figuring out how they can get involved in their community so it's been really awesome to have that connection and partnership i'm glad to hear it's working well some of our residents are uh people in our administration had concerns but uh a good example now we've got a test yeah i'm employing the associated pre-writing speech it's out of the long gear i'm not a carpenter so it's not the best looking box i like daniel beach boxes way better but it's out there we've had one in our town for about 30 years behind the doubletree works great really nice great thank you very much [Applause] we have legislative update i don't know if any of our current legislators representatives um any public comments anybody wants to uh get up and give us a few minutes of their time okay we have the i just do channel running over time sorry i'm leaving i gave you the information anyway so tomorrow at the tampa bay beaches chamber um i just wanted to inform all of you leaders up here that you're invited to our upcoming event it's honoring community leaders it's also open to the public i have more information on that it'll be august 30th in clearwater beach so you're more than welcome and i think you all should already have an invite from our ceo robin miller but if you need any work getting registered just come contact me or send us an email and get you all set up um just one more comment also um i know what you were talking about old things that maybe the hoteliers had campaigns working on educating our um visitors on safety and resident evil crossing safety so the chamber for a long time has had key to safety cards that we worked with our members as yeah so we still have those key safety cards they fit into hotel keys um and we work with our businesses that are hoteliers on the beaches to hand those out to their visitors with their when they check into hotels so if any of you at the cities would like to have those physical keys at their locations we can disseminate those to you and i know tyler we had to barkley have those so police chiefs or any cities they're little parks that just educate our visitors on crossing properly using the crosswalks wearing bright colors all those safety tips for you know crossing properly and hoping to minimize those accidents so that's all i have thank you very much what's going on nothing no it's quiet that was fast all quiet in bellaire beach always good welcome back all is well in reddington beach not so much as events but two great developments um imagine clearwater is on track for um our great park is on track for uh opening next year we have chosen with eckerd hall to manage our incredible beautiful outdoor amphitheater and we just chose the developers to develop a boutique hotel as well as 600 units on the blood so i'm hoping that downtown clearwater will finally flourish and be self-sustained thank you it's just another beautiful day in paradise and indian speed in the uh of what all of you are going through getting our budgets together and wrestling with hotel renovations but i want to welcome the mayor being shore is back after her surgery it's good to see you and uh gas thank you so much for the environment we've got a nice job tonight with that unless there's any infections"
