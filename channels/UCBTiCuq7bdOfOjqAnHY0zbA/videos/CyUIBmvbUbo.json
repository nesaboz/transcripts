please come up state your name and address and how you doing Randy L 103 13th Street um just to let you know an incident from Saturday night we had a we had a little dinner get together for my son-in-law's mother's birthday and uh one of the guests 85-year-old fell named Rick castelle from the need and he couldn't make it till about 8:00 anyhow when he left he found he he had a $55 ticket for parking on the street from an officer I think his name is II anyhow uh I know the sheriff's just do what they got to do and that's all fine going good but my issue is for the council he came in off the bridge he turned on golf bullart he made the ride on 12th and looped around the Horseshoe to get the my house okay on when you turn on to 12th probably about 50 ft up right past the first driveway on right inside you've got a 25 mph speed limit sign and a No Parking anytime on the street sign okay the the speed limit signs are 24 in High by 18 wide the little sign that says no parking on the street is 12 in wide by 18 in high okay it's it's very it's very at night an 85-year-old I mean I know not the park there somebody comes from out of town you're not going to see it you make the turn and you're looking ahead and you don't you can't read the little letters on it on my street if you came if you would have turned on 13th Avenue 13th Street here's that same sign that's 18x 24 the speed limit the no parking sign's 24 wide by 30 High okay so if you look the the other signs on the corner at 12 that's out on Gulf Boulevard the neighborhood watch signs 24 by3 uh the uh go up ahead to where the crosswalk is between 12th and 13th there's a don't block the intersection that's 24 by 30 I just think it it's it's stinky that the guy got a ticket for missing a sign that's that's basically 12 by8 with little letters you know it's just I think I think the sign should be uniform in size know that that's that's the only thing I got to say it's it's very easy if you drive up 12 you'll see it's a little sign that's below and these two speed limit signs these two speed limit signs way I took them but they're the same size okay the speed limit signs are the same size and you can see how narrow this 12th Street no parking sign is compared to the one on 13th 13th is like like all the other standard side that don't block the intersection neighborhood watch and all that but you you put a little tiny one in there I feel bad for the 85y old guy to had to pay a $55 ticket because of some little sign that soon as you make the turn at 8:00 at night you know you're not going to be able to read the little letters but that's it thank you for your comments would any other citizens like to speak all right citizen comments are now closed uh we're on to item three which is a presentation on January 22nd a man on C ski capsized in Rough Waters at the six Street access a strong undercurrent prevented the man from getting back on his vessel while he was also being pulled further out to sea fortunately two brave men came to his a and helped him back to the shore one of those men is here this evening Chief Jeffrey Davidson would you please join me all right Chief Jeffrey David in recognition of your courageousness and lifesaving actions on January 18th 2024 the city of Beller Beach thanks you for your selfless Act of Val thank you for your [Applause] service oh speaking of the fire chief we're on the item number four which is a presentation from theel sunos fire and rescue District good evening thereor council members and Community Jeffrey Davidson fire chief P Sun Coast um wanted to give you the monthly report for the month of February um in the month of February there were uh to b beach there was 15 calls for fire and Emergency Medical Services into b beach um the district is moving forward we've talked about the purchase of the land uh on the Northern end of IND Rocks Beach to better Ser B Beach uh that property is only 1.2 mies from this location um and it's going to greatly improve our response times and the current plans are to House advanced life support uh fire suppression engine there on the Northern end uh with three firefighter paramedics in the meantime uh we have obtained a transport cable Rescue Unit from the county to be utilized when Staffing permits over the next year uh we are in the process of purchasing a new Rescue Unit uh with a written agreement from the county forthcoming and we're also working with the county to get that unit funded with two paramedics over the next two years uh then it'll be here permanent in fulltime uh we are also getting ready to award a contract to build their fire space in an emergency Operation Center on the mainland with a anticipated completion date of August of 2025 and that building is going to replace the 50y 58-year-old fire station and serve as our Emergency Operations Center uh Kyle has a open invitation to stay at the EOC during hurricanes and major events so he can stay closer to b beach a jet ski with a rescue sled has also been purchased I was was a funded by a very generous donation um to the district and as you know sunos were the busiest Marine rescue program in the county and the additional units going to ensure that rapid access uh to to get victim to get to victims in the water uh we're in the process of outfitting it and training IT training with it all of our members right now and it's anticipated that unit will be in service around April in January the fire department participated in the causeway cleanup efforts and we would like to participate in all the future events we're currently in the planning stages of the hurricane Expo with the city of b beach with the dates to be determined and our firefighters and paramedics completed 860 hours of fire and EMS training during the month of February thank you Chief uh Council any questions or comments yes conratulations question is a transport okay um that is a an ambulance that's capable to transport to the hospital the way the system works here in pelis county is that all the fire departments every Unit H is an advanced life support unit and we work off a first respond system so we're the first people to get to the emergency the first firefighters and permic all of our Personnel are either firefight are either paramedics or emergency medical technicians and having the quicker response sign on the ambulance company we are called The First Responders um the transport to the hospital is done by a private company currently and there are times and certain criteria where the fire department can transport to the hospital if it's a life-threatening and the ambulance is a certain distance away they haven't gotten there yet for example then we can transport that patient get him to a Trauma Center get him to the emergency room faster but currently we don't have that capability so we have to wait on an ambulance so this is something we've been working uh as a team with the County EMS Administration and we have a 2-year plan that we're we're um getting towards the end of to have that be a permanent unit so in the event that we arrive on scene of a critical call that we need to get that patient to the hospital right away and the ambulance is not quite yet there then the fire departent can transport with the medical director's permission well that's um much better service to the citizens question yes yeah a quick question on the second bullet Chief is the uh the purchase of that land is there already a facility building there or are we going to have to build one so no there there's not uh a facility there it's a portion of land um that belongs to a business that we're you we're going to purchase just part of their property and build on but with the contractor that we are interning an agreement with to build our Mainland they did a b a bid for that station as well so we'll be able to move forward with that one um pretty pretty quickly perfect thanks right thank you any other questions comments okay I have just one question um moving the firehouse to the new location yes what what will that do to response time for us how much how many minutes will it say oh many many minutes so the average response sign will to B providing that they're in quarters or in the area will be 2 minutes um yes yes sir and that's what you know we try the county standard is 7 and a half minutes we try to get our unit song scene in four minutes whenever possible not always possible especially with the gulf traffic but that has been the challenge for many years is that the distance between our station in inrocks beach and the next closest station is almost 6 miles so we've been working on this project for years and it's finally kind come to fruition but in the meantime we'll be able to St that Rescue Unit um they call it an episonic unit so whenever we have the Personnel uh for example spring break we're going to hire back to make sure that that unit is Staff we're going to give a Kyle to um make sure our Personnel can stage up here and be able to come in and use the facilities if they needed to um I owe your phone call but um that's going to definitely U provide a much better service to this area because our Station 27 in New York is very busy the station at Clear Water which is our automatic G partners and the station over the bridge in Largo we all work together it's quite a long response time uh especially if they're not coming from their station and you're getting a unit from the next closest station so we wanted to always provide the best response times that's the plan we've been working on for many years now you've been uh you've been working on this project for a long time and I appreciate you not giving up and let F on we we all realize that we doing importance thank you would let you know that as it um moves along and of course we want to have you come to any cemon that we have with that and we look forward to getting that unit into Service as quick as possible absolutely looking forward to it all right thank you very much thank you may all right we are up to item number five this is a presentation from the pelis county sheriff's office beginning with the monthly law enforcement report good afternoon mayor councilman um so as far as the shair off report for B Be monthly stats are consistent with December there were no property or personal CRI for one second can you announce your name I'm sorry I'm Corman with the Sheriff's Office okay so again the uh statistics for January there were no property crimes no burglaries no thefts um no motor vehicle thefts or anything like that reported um on top of that there were two people arrested within the city um both being misdemeanor for driver's licenses and one for violation of probation after that our deputies have been really keeping up with the director patrols that have been requested by the city and the citizens um so between the director patrols traffic stops are up to we had 118 traffic stops uh last month which which is really helping to keep some of the speeding and other traffic violation enforcements down more so for The Pedestrian safety and stuff like that too uh especially as we get closer into the Spring Break and summer months U beyond that everything is pretty consistent again with the month prior um minimal ordinance violations the vehicle uh illegally parked and stuff like that we actually only had 26 last month for any illegal Park in citations or [Applause] Warnings there were two only two traffic crashes actually um in January and both of those basically had no outside influence over just accidents um nothing that appears to identify any problems congested areas roadway deficiencies or signage any questions or comments for corpal yes Mr um not sure if you heard citizen um remarks about the parking on the street violation yes sir I know fot has a million different requirements for like Signs and he pointed out the 25 M I know speed limit sign has to be a certain standard sign yes Size Doesn't a parking sign have to have the same typical neighborhood so yes any and all roadway signage uh included for pedestrians and sidewalks and stuff like that uh do have a federal or a Florida Department of Transportation um regulation so they have to be a regulatory size in order to be enforceable a lot of times those sizes are based off of the speed limit in the area the size of the roadway and stuff like that and again all of those even from the Department of Transportation in Florida conform to the standards of the National Highway Traffic Safety Association which are consistent throughout the country yeah what I'm saying is the sign that he pointed out um according to the visitor it's very small lettery um I don't think it conformed with the the other side I think that would be a good argument to have a ticket removed I don't think it can be done at this level but um so yes that can be directed towards the County Highway uh they the on that normally regulate and would it be County or would it be our city so your city would ultimately be responsible for changing out that sign and then normally is facilitated through County Highway um they're the ones that have the signs Rel available where they can be purchased from and you know any of that thank you um but yes no it's if it is a Department of Transportation sign which there will be a sticker on the back of then it does conform to the standards for that roadway nothing saying though that a larger one can't be put in place and if it doesn't have that sticker it's not conformed correct any other questions or comments yes I have a question about the enforcement of flashing pedestrian signs yes lights I recognize that if somebody just takes a home car recognize that it's there but it seems as there's a lot of people straight through them what is the enforcement process and experience so actually it's interesting you bring that up um here just last month and the end of January and in February I believe two times um this particular shift that we worked we actually conducted traffic initiatives for The Pedestrian cross walks and the violations and that's violations between pedestrians and motorists so either people not pushing the button or waiting for the signage or just running across the road or just not even utilizing them at all um so we did do an initiative on that I don't have the numbers with me I can say that they were highly effective we actually did that amongst all of the deep cities from belir Beach All the Way South to madir beach um those actually seem to be quite fruitful um most of it was general education uh that we were you know more so just informing and trying to remind people please utilize these things they're here for a reason they really do make a difference in in that safety um um so we have been actively uh just on our own accord looking into that and trying to enforce it more to have a little bit more visibility a lot of times deputies now especially during the night hours are sitting there somewhere within the vicinity of these crosswalks in order to be able to see them observe them and be visible in that same area hopefully just to provide a little bit more enforcement and guidance I'm going to add to that um I'm hoping that they're also watching the pedestrians because there is uh some personal responsibility you don't slap the button as you're entering the street it it's uh there's been many times where I've had to lock them now where people just are not paying attention or taken for granted that that light is going to automatically cause me to hit my burs yes and that's the big thing uh when I say that we were equally enforcing it between any violations with pedestrians or motor vehicles um a lot of that being the situation where a pedestrian will just Stu out as you're describing and causing a motor vehicle to take evasive action or you know some sort of defensive action um normally by hitting the braks pretty hard so you know with that uh I do agree you know that is a major portion of it and the education that I put out to the deputies um that work for me and stuff along these beaches and during these initiatives was you know if we explain it more so to the citizens that regardless of right away if the light's flashing you know and you feel you can safely walk doesn't beat the laws of physics so ultimately who's going to win that battle um when we're pushing through that so even more so just kind of a way of putting it in their minds while we're talking about safety and saving lives um I have noticed that lately more than I've ever seeing uh these fast motorcycles uh they suddenly don't follow any rules any laws whatsoever and they're leaving between cars uh I was coming home day before yesterday oh no no no was Friday I was coming home and one of those little Japanese Racers decided that he was going to pass all the cars entering Causeway Boulevard uh on the on the basically the shoulder of the bridge uh and he was probably doing 60 um I see it all the time but what I don't see is in getting pull over um is it just bad timing they know what they're looking for what's going on with pis County so in general um just from my best understanding and my enforcement actions on it um it's interesting to say that just actually one of these statistics in here I believe for the driving license suspended was mine in which uh there were two motorcycles that were going in towards Laro off of the beach um I clocked them at well over 100 milph on the shoulder passing a series of cars the hard part with that is the speed of these motorcycles their capability of maneuvering and stuff like that it's hard for us to be able to catch up to them in a manner enough to efficiently catch them um and catch up to them without them noticing that we are there following or something like that so we're trying to utilize a little bit more strategy um if we can we'll just try and let other deputies that are in the area or other law enforcement that are down the road in the direction they're traveling know so that way we can kind of pick them up as they are and in that we're requesting our helicopter a lot of times um to see if they can fly over get eyes on them and then hopefully we can have a little bit more of a an effort those violations and stuff like that take more time a lot more resources and so those traffic stops or that enforcement is happening way down the road or even at a later date in time as we are doing research to find out who those operators are and then administratively opening up citations and stuff and sending it to them okay I appreciate you answering that question do we have any other questions or comments no all right thank you so much all right now we're on to the monthly code enforcement report good evening mayor councilman I'm Deputy Trump of the P County Sheriff's Office uh we actually had a pretty good month for code enforcement um with violations actually being down we did have a few new cases of excuse me unpermitted remodels of which um all of the cases have been able to work with the people work with the contractors however we've been able to close all of them with most of them obtaining permits um other than that we had um I just had 33 entries but basically it's a variation of all kinds of different ordinances anything from we're still working with a couple of pools to uh maybe some uh uh overgrowth in plants and things like that but for the most part uh the homeowners and everything have been pretty receptive as far as me going up talking to them or working with them and trying to go through the problems um with that I would like to um just add one thing if I could uh to anybody that is watching the citizens of Beller Beach is if you are Contracting for some type of a service please make sure that they are um licensed contractors and make sure that you have some type of a contract written contract so that you know exactly what you're getting into and what your responsibilities will be and I'm just going to use one example without names or anything else but I came across a u uh residence was uh just beginning a solar install and I checked uh the contractors out and found that they had no permits through the city no permits through the county the company had not even been registered through the county uh or the state we found out later they had a parent company which begins in California and they were registered with the state but basically there were no permits I had made contact with the uh elderly lady that lives there by herself uh she had been approached by this Solar Company and they gave her some extravagant story that she would not have to pay for any of this and that it was all going to be installed for free and she had no contract nothing written she had only one phone number in California uh for somebody that she could attempt to call and excuse me working through working with her and also working with pelis County it was found that uh basically they had no permits or anything else no contracts and with the information that she was uh able to give us and work with uh working with her she ended up basically telling the company uh that she no longer wanted her Ser or their services which was probably the a wise and Brent thing so just just a reminder to everybody is make sure you have contracts make sure you know what you're responsible for and make sure they're a licensed contractor so you know they are doing a good job for you I'm I'm curious uh would this be the same company that had to door to door solicitors it may be possible but I I didn't get that far in I'd have to check the record on that doesn't bring just just curious there was a Solar Company that was doing okay uh any questions or comments for the de yes Mr B I want to jump on the mayor being w solicitation because seem to get a lot of like magazine people I I I I I don't know you're I don't want to know you're we don't but it seems like early late afternoon spot I see right what I can add to that is at any point if anybody has any solicitors or anything else or suspicious people for that matter if you don't know who they are contact the sheriff office let us go and make contact with these guys and we will take care of business so with no problem that's what we're here for and and you know going back on that as far as my hours my hours vary a little bit and I'm going to especially as we're going into the warmer months here and going in the spring break I'm going to start varying my hours a little bit more uh because we're going to be trying to do or I'm going to be trying to do at least a little more Beach patrols and everything else for the ordinance or the ordinances out on the beach and everything else so I vary a little bit just so I can do different things and work Sundays once in a while so that we can like I had one day you know contractors out working at a house on Sunday and may contact with them they're very nice but we told them you know can't do that so I okay any other questions or comments I will add that I had some solicitors come by my house the other day and so I actually bought some of their product as evidence but the box of cookies did not last that the rest of the evening so never mind well the evidence is gone then thank you very much D okay sir thank you all right now we're on to item six this is the city attorney's [Music] report thank you Mr Mayor uh as we sit here now it is March 4th 2024 we are in what should be the last week of session absence some extension I don't have some inside knowledge of one I just you never know what may happen um there's a lot to track and not a lot to report right now there is some clear division on some significant bills between what the Senate is doing and what the house is doing while not of the same import here by way of example the short-term rental bill has passed the Senate passed the house but in different versions they need the same version to pass both chambers before the governor can sign it and there's only 4 days left for them to do so um one of the challenges we we face in tracking and and accurately predicting what will happen in the legislative session is during the last three days of session the CH the um each of the chambers are able to suspend certain rules and make things happen a little more quickly or or by some not altogether um unpredictable but unorthodox means um and so until until it's over until uh that handkerchief Falls for siny die on Friday um it is hard to say precisely how this will shake out this will not be like last session where there was just a ton of legislation approved by the super majority and signed by the governor um I think each chamber as well as the executive branch are asserting a little bit more of their independent judgment which we didn't see quite as much of last session as evidenced by the governor's veto in the last week on the social media Bill uh so we are tracking it closely we'll get an end of session report from from my office on in terms of what what's come down as well as any uh Florida Le of cities updates you may be tracking that provide um legislative updates otherwise um continue to we as as you know from uh our meeting last week we've begun the Land Development code review um and your input is critical to that um subject to all the cautions and advisories I gave you at that meeting but uh with that uh I'm happy to answer any questions you have and otherwise look forward to what should be an interesting month in March with our elections here um we I will be closely tracking the results and also how all of those play out in the event any one or all of them don't don't succeed or if they all succeed for that matter what that means for us and providing you an update post elction day on okay now what uh so that's that's the issue I'm probably following most closely for this committee any questions or comments for the City attorney Mr the shortterm rent um there's only days left divion matching up but um would that either version would that impact us fell Beach because I'm getting a lot of residents no no one knows how to read things I think that's a really accurate way of saying this no one knows how to read these including the legislators um the the the short answer is yes and no the know of it is it doesn't change your rules yes because it applies Statewide if you were to to do something to change your regulations question if if you rock the boat don't get away but but if we we don't rock the boat in their current form and of course they can change this in the next four days in their current form they preserve the the language in codes for any restriction adopted before June 2011 Your Land Development codes governing duration and frequency preate 2011 here you should hold an underl line should be fine however when you look at the Senate bill for example it has language in there that says not withstanding the preemption in [Music] [Music] 5093281422 short rentals and by just adding a notwithstanding this it suggests they're trying to broaden and say oh always meant this everybody knew that so I can't say for sure and and I think there's good reason when you see some of that confusion on its plain terms it doesn't it does not void or strike the Safe Harbor for pre 2011 stuff question on its face it does not do that will they attempt to say it does otherwise somehow who knows either version either version does not so for this commity Community that's why I said at the outset it's a less concern here I still think it's a concern because it's a new preemption and every preemption should trouble us as as communities that thrive on home rule and again my my to the extent I'm I'm sound like I'm equivocating it's only because they're adding some language that I think is sort of changing the script and saying it was always this way so that's just clarifying a thing you could never do um but I don't think it will void your pre- 20101 restrictions in its current in either current form again and and by the way when I say they're not the same the differences are significant it's not simply like one of them has a 60-day resistration the other is a 90day the Senate bill um for example allows you to regulate or have a registration based with an occupancy limitation based on two per bedroom plus two with add some additional permission for certain square footage the house version uh up until recently said sleeping accommodations they're suggesting that that's going to be be interpreted based on the fire code well the fire code was never intended for overnight stay it's intended for how many people can safely evacuate a space during an event so if you have a birthday party how many people can safely get out not many of people can sleep here generate waste here and all those other things so those are some differences the the house bill for example also has language saying that the registration process to the extent communities can create a registration process will be administered by the tax collector that's never been a part of the discourse before this year so and and it's not in the Senate version so if they're going to work it out they have some real differences to resolve and the the house sponsor uh representative Griffiths as recently as last week in the Press was saying the house will not be taking up the Senate's version so it sounds like there's a little bit of a game of chicken legislative chicken happening on who's going to Blink which just seems every legisl session for as long as I can remember something comes up you know have yeah uh and and and those that's frankly the thing that's easy to focus on there's a lot more preemptions that we haven't been talking about and once we know the lay of the land we'll talk about there's a bill that I think is going to be unsuccessful that dealt with when you could hire and fire a city manager a City attorney you know I I I don't know what purpose that serves the state but those are the sorts of things that it's more than you realize and more than your average citizen might take interest in but definitely affects your job up here whether you're four or seven any other questions or comments Mr Mor I I did have one question I um heard Rumblings of a possible bill that would or maybe it was an amendment that would exempt those currently serving uh from form six has that g any interaction in all if it has mayor I'm not not aware of it I'll search for it I imagine if it had gained traction it would be closer to front page media given the dozens of resignations across the state but I will continue I'll look into that and if I find something I'll circulate it I would take silence as a no in terms of my followup I I want to say it was early last week I got this and I just I wasn't able to move on I I didn't think it was going anywhere but still I'll pass it off to you information I appreciate that it is a challenge when you're tracking the legislative session because something like that can't get buried in a bill that has little else to do with form sticks it's just an Ethics code and you know they throw this writer in so if you do have any resources and and and that goes for all four of you if there is something that you while while I generally work for the council as a whole if there's a discreet thing you say hey I heard this is this true about the session or here's somebody's telling me House Bill 8675309 does this is that true I'm happy to look into it if it's related to City business I just assumed it was going nowhere because uh I think it's the safe assumption big of a deal as it is it's not being talked about all right any other questions or comments uh not all right thank you Mr Mo I appreciate all the updates all right now we're on to item number seven Mr reefer city manager report thank you mayor um Mr stepped out but um addressing the uh no parking on the street signs I do know um it was 2018 we downsize those signs but I will check into the requirements um I tried to do a quick search couldn't find about get some guidance from the county on what what size they actually need to be for our residential streets um I wanted to mention to him I was in sure he was aware that we have the uh the on street parking um you know the residents can call in and let us know that they're having a party and then you know we s it to the Sheriff's Office and then they're aware so that nobody gets ticking it um the uh going through the city manager report the Golf Boulevard undergrounding we're still moving along with that um the uh we're going out the north side we're getting uh refusal uh signatures if uh Duke Energy is requesting that we have our easement for the resident where the equipment is going so um that is what the uh utility uh contractors of Florida are doing right now they're just uh getting a hold of people and either getting a signature yes or no if they can get an easement for that property um again sou side um South the col way is pending on Duke at this point um so we're waiting on that I will say though that we have received all of our funding from Penny 4 up to this fiscal year from the county so we're all up to date on that we paid and and received the reimbursement the uh storm water Improvement project the start date for that is going to be March 18th excited to get that going the uh code review project we are going to cover chapter 94 zoning at our next work session and um that was chosen because it's a very broad section and it kind of dabbles in a lot of different elements of the code um and I think discussing that up front will help us um as we go through other sections the uh RFP for auditing the services uh last year Salt March came in in the March meeting um with the draft um they do not have the draft complete but it's supposed to be done this month but the way we're going to do it is we're going to get the draft take it to the audit committee have them look it over make any recommendations and then we'll bring it to council where salt marsh will do the presentation for the acceptance um the new website launched last Thursday I S an email out just to let you know um we're still kind of working through some of the The Kinks making sure all our content got transferred over um but uh we we are uh excited to have the new format it's based on the city plus layout that uh a lot of cities City e talk of all their use um but hopefully what this does is we can set it up in a way that our citizens can find information quickly that they're looking for but any suggestions you have when you would you preview that site please just uh we'll make adjustments I think the uh new website looks great um it's probably easier for someone who's never been there because I knew where to go for everything prior to the new website so it took me a while to find the the code and things like that nice job and uh well we got an idea from what other cities have done we want to open up a uh a photo submission for the residents um that we can use on the website so um modern phones take some good pictures these days that's the way to kind of get capture all the different images of the city get some good Sun sunsets and beach pictures um we've been interviewing for the admin assistant uh we've had so far out of five interviews we set up we actually had we have two candidates that were considering um when it came to the question and we kind of saw this coming um for the hourly wage we were advertising at the $18 per hour um the candidates that we have considering the position uh suggested start at $20 per hour now the $18 per hour um was our lowest paid uh wage but but we uh raised the uh service worker to wage um last meeting that went from 18 to 20 so right now with the vacancy that we've had in the admin assisted position we have the money we don't need to make a budget adjustment to make that $2 increas but I wanted to get the council's consideration on that because it would have to pass the next budget to maintain this position no we could just do it inal V it's not a budg change this year yeah just everyone's thought I think we have to recognize current Marketplace and that's what it's demanding and I find that too low you end up spending more money you get intive so right cidate yes that $2 an hour might actually keep them around whereas 18 might get them trained and then they go to another municipality so I think it's a good idea I do as well so the candidates that you've already interviewed di yes had they been amable to whatever our rate was at that time would you guys in a position where you would made the offer to one of them based on their skill sets and background and ability to do the job so the two candidates that we interviewed that philadel City application did not indicate the wage that they were um considering for the position so it came up in the interview um we had an advertis on the website at 18 per hour but that's the only spot so if they didn't if they saw the administ post on the sign they might have thought maybe it was negotiable but just by the candidates that we have are best candidates um 18 was a little low to start okay so if we raise it to to 20 which I think we're all fine with do you feel comfortable that you have a candidate in mind that would be willing to accept that yes okay I'm not clear on that so did you have a c no the only the only two candidates um that we interviewed that we feel are qualified both of them have indicated that they would like to start at $20 per hour we have one candidate in mind that we would select but I just wanted to get um the council's approval because it is a budget thanks something more Contin particular any other questions city manager I do so Kyle on the storm water improvements projects has the contractor had the opportunity to sit down with the city and lay out a plan with respect to what streets they're going to begin and so on until the project is complete we have not had our uh preconstruction meeting on site but um they have been agreeable to whatever we need so um given that Mr FL is doing the study right now for the 9th Street area um if that is complete and we have the presentation where we know what we're doing um I would consider that the southern part of the town the more uh crucial to get to um before storm season so as long as we're ready and we know what we're doing I would recommend that we start on the southern okay but right now there is no schedule okay and I completely say budget um well oh right we need to we need to find out what Mr FL needs to come back and let us know where we're at on that I'm sorry that's fine I just want to make sure and I have complete confidence that you and your staff when the project starts when we get in um question where somebody would say would you is why was this before that street that we prepared to have um and I know you will have you'll have an answer for why whether it was based on the current condition of Street a b or c was Works off based on the studies that we did that type of thing so that there's some um semblance of reasonability there as to why we did Street a four Street B and so on down the road so we'll be prepared for that and then when we have discussed with the contractor um you know grouping four five streets together so um I think they'll be looking up to us to give uh Insight where where we're starting um because we've already kind of had conversations on you know where depending on what we're doing on nin street so does that make sense we don't want the contractor jum back and forth from the north side in the sou Etc so that's all good thank you and they they will be doing um the door hangers GL before and and interacting directly um with residents for information um you know when they come through on those streets so they'll be they'll be put they'll be knocking on the doors if the resident answers you know explain to them what the project timeline is for that area and then um if they're not there they're going to leave a contact information so that they get the information that they want and they will be working um you know as far as where the on one side and getting access to their driveways and all that great thanks anyone else yes his timeline was was one to two months I can follow up on and find where he's at be pushing next working session is well mayor I think we may be speaking to that but we're trying to figure out the timing on the next working session given the election and other scheduling concerns for four members [Music] true I'd say whatever he's got the report we should just get it immediately that way we can look at it on our own time not have to wait on presentation okay I was that your question okay I had a question also um we spoke briefly this morning about the bridge closures did you get any detail on that right now um I heard back from Brian M with the county he said that that he does not know of any closure closure scheduled but that he would check into it um because they update on a weekly basis and then let me know what is the work that they're doing on the bridge that I don't know I'll find that out they're putting signs on the bridge can somebody explain to me why we're closing the bridge during the busiest season it's it's the the sign says lane closures and I think it's at night not during the day 10:00 morning I think that that bridge is wide enough for three lanes in the middle um so they're probably going to have you go around whatever GS together but um it's definitely has raised some concerns in the community because everyone's wondering if they're going to have to go down Indian Rock beachs to get to public so right now no but if there is any concern with the way they are doing it just let me know if you uh if you do hear anything def would you mind sending out a newsletter just to let everyone in the city know um I just want to mention real quick the hurricane information night we're going to be doing is is on uh April 3rd which Wednesday um and that's going to involve Theos fire department um the city the the Fells County Emergency Management we have uh experts in the field of meteorology uh Mike Clay's already committed um and uh insurance agents to give updates on the current state of insurance in Florida and trying to get FEMA a FEMA representative there um but yeah 6:30 to about 8:30 30 and um the idea is that we have tables to set up for information for these different organizations but also have a general uh like uh lecture area for audience seating um where you know every 30 minutes there a presentation that it that is it any other questions or comments all right thank you Mr reaper now we are on to the city clerk report hey I have nothing further to report okay any questions or comments for the C thank you very much all right now we are on to the consent agenda this is items 9 and 10 this is for approval of the February 5th 2024 city council meeting minutes and approval of the February 27th 2024 city council work session minutes do I have a motion to approve motion to approve is written present motion made by Frank Banger do I have a second second second by Mr Roberts all in favor I I oppos all right consent agenda passes all right now we are on to the regular agenda item 11 this is for consideration of ordinance 24-1 this is the second reading uh City attorney Mor happily Mr Mayor this is ordinance 2024 01 an ordinance of the city council of the city of Belair Beach amending chapter 2 Administration Article 2 city council division one generally to create section 2-31 of the city's code of ordinances entitled annual salary for members of the city council of guidelines governing reimbursement providing for the implementation of administrative actions providing for codification providing for cability and providing an effective date this is been a second and final reading of ordinance number 20241 by title Mr Mayor thank you Mr Mo before we proceed with any like to comment on this proposed ordinance see as we have none citizen comments are now closed Council I need a motion to approve ordinance [Music] 24-1 motion made by Lloyd Roberts do I have a second I'll second second by council member Elliot Roberts you have the Flor yeah we've uh we've discussed this and we've discussed the benefits as to why we think this would improve our city interest uh for people wanting to be on the council is the main driver I believe it's a it's a Minimus amount of money compared to other cities in the area and I think our mayor did a good job of providing us with that information showing what some of the other cities were paying their council members or commission members So based on those facts I think it makes sense for us to do this and I think we should put it to a vote thank you Mr Roberts anyone else like to comment on this topic I I would just like to uh to add that um if this passes it does not impact this counsel but it does give future councils the ability to uh to to at least give something back to people um also I believe that this goes hand in hand with uh items that are appearing on the ballot in the outcoming election uh so there are no other comments gr would you please call the council member bankard yes council member Roberts yes council member Elliot yes mayor gtis yes and so it passes unanimously to nothing and thank you very much Council for assisting this coordin all right now we are on to unfinished business we have any unfinished business so as we have none unfinished business is now over with now we're on to uh item number 13 there was no 12 there was no uh let re see there was no 12 or I just add uh so now we're on to city council comments this month we begin with council member Bank um just briefly uh I've been working with Senator Scott's office still with this nfip suit uh which is going back to ashy Moody now because she's the attorney for the state but um I appreciate Council and my co-council person K with this study that's coming up the flooding because there's so many residents in the southern end of the city we have one right here it's just pull her hair out frustrated over the 50% rule the values of homes are not I hope believe that be given uh it's really they're telling us all the ter down um so I'm going to keep working at it so I can promise you I I feel your pain could happen to me it could happen to anybody here so um I'll be out tomor your house thank you Mr Banker uh up next is council member Roberts thank you mayor as uh most of us know we have some items that are going to be on uh up for vote coming up on on the 19th so anybody listening to this meeting I would like to um recommend that you take the time to read those items and understand them and if there's some questions you may have um please make every opportunity you can to contact anybody up here on the council um Pro not probably I'm going to be making my rounds around the city knocking on doors asking anybody if you have any questions if there's any way that I can help clarify some of the information we're going to be voting for I would absolutely do that it's an import set of of changes that we're proposing to the city Charter and I think it's something that everybody should consider very closely um I believe all four of the items will help our city and I'll be more than happy to talk to anybody out there from the citizen standpoint to answer any questions you may have thank you thank you Mr robers next coun it is sorry about that it's been a while um I feel very privileged to hear live here in valair beach and enjoy our lifestyle very very much um because we live in a Coastal Community I'm very acutely interested in environmental issues and so with that I'll be obviously looking very closely at our storm water Improvement project and I am attending a meeting uh Wednesday uh to hear a report from St Petersburg regarding their own storm water uh Improvement project that's way so I'd like to hear about their plans and anything that else that I could bring back to this group um with that I attended the beginning launch of the uh uh pel's beautiful effort for their litter abatement and so I did that U last week and um I'm getting involved also with the Sierra Club and um we'll be learning more about some of the environmental issues that they're involved in sorry I'm losing my voice right now so um and to um follow up on what you said um Mr Banker the um oh yes 50 thank you very much the 50% rule just so that people are aware um I did hear of another house that is likely coming up for sale because the individuals are just um constrained by that rule and um with the increasing risk of flooding they're just finished and so losing another sometimes important issue I thank you very much council member Elliott um since we're talking about 50% ruling I I know that if we do move forward and reduce it to one year it won't solve all the problems but what it will do is give a more manageable timeline uh if you if you do something your house and with a little bit of patience and planning perhaps some of these homes will be able to get the upgrades that they'd like to have um 5 years is a long long time especially in an area where we're uh subject to salt water things Break um if you're in one of the lower Ling areas U storm water is a problem uh there's many many reasons why five years is just way too long for belir beach and uh whenever I realize that there were other communities that U seem to be reaping all the benefits without all the time it only seemed fair that we should be look into that and I know that city manager Reaper is is uh looking deeper into this to make sure that we're doing the right thing uh but right now it looks like switching one year is the right thing to do and so stay tuned hopefully we'll get this cleaned up a little bit more where it's not quite the pill swallow all right as always I'd like to thank everyone who's here tonight or watch this meeting remotely as a resident of belir beach I'd like to also remind everyone p on what you just said of how important this upcoming election is to our city four Charter amendments on the ballot address the recent intrusive legislation designed to keep good candidates out of local government I and countless of others believe that local government is best run by the people who live within its boundaries Tallahassee preemptions and overregulation tear away at the threat of our unique friendly and beautiful Community as residents of belir beach it is up to us to demonstrate that only we know what's best for our community these amendments will reduce the number of council members and send a clear message to Tallahassee that we are a strong Community willing to adapt to protect our Island Way of Life on March the 19th please join me in voting yes for m one through four with that being said do I have a motion motion is made by Frank banker and second by Kim Shaw Elliot all in favor I any opposed all right good night"
