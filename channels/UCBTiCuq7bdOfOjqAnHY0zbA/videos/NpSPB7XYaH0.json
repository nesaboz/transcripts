actual procedures we follow there's a series of questions that we ask so here's how it's going to take place for each case that we have tonight I will read the various requests then the city manager

recording this then we can all hear you and you are welcome to make your your statement for your representative is also able to make that statement at that point we're going to have open discussion with the board and with the advocates followed by that we actually vote on six different items for every case the board will be asked to vote and each of those items will be voted on individually by everybody up here we will then ask for a vote regarding the variance itself and then at that point we'll do a roll call to see if the various passes or the variance fails is any questions you can stop me at any time at this point we'll go ahead and ask for various requests number 23-04 for the owners of 120 14th Street and excuse me by pronounce your name wrong but I believe is it Raul thank you very much they're requesting your variance from division two swimming pools section 10-7 during the setbacks the Heights and the widths the height of a swimming pool shall be no higher than 18 inches above the crown of the road and he structural part of any permanently installed in-ground swimming pool or Spa shall not be built higher than 24 inches of public deck including raised Spas pool beams upper level decks and raised water levels auxiliary deck mounted equipment such as handrails ladders grab rails diving boards and slides shall not be subject to the hike requirements set forth in this section their request is to construct a pool 62.64 inches above the maximum height life Allowed by the city code Patty have we received any correspondence at all for this case I had one phone call inquiring if the pool was going to be in the front yard in the backyard and that was their only question are any of the neighbors by chance of the applicant here this evening that would like to speak I know you've got a representative from your pool construction company at this at this point I'd like to ask Kyle now that I've read what they they are requesting to do Kyle if you'll make a report on behalf of the city thank you chairman so our city engineer Larry Flutie or Gemini engineering prepared he reviewed the plans and preferred a letter stating what the variance needs are he used uh everything in the in the measurements of feet I'm going to say it in ages because our code references to 18 inches it might be easier to understand that way um so this is the property at 120 14th Street they have an existing pool that is a higher elevation than that is allowed by code the crown of the road in front of the residence that the code references that is 22 and 0.2 inches the existing pool deck now is at 86.4 inches and this is inches above sea level and the proposed pool the plans that are included in this packet is going is requesting to be at uh 102.84 inches above sea level given the crown of the road being at 22.2 inches the maximum allowable by code elevation of new pool is 40 inches 40.2 inches above sea level so the proposed pool being at 102.84 inches above sea level they need a variance to cover an additional 62.64 inches above what is allowed by code so basically we're asking for something that's five feet higher and what we allowed like roughly five feet two inches one question on the 86 inches that's is that the sea level is that from the crown of the road the existing is 86.4 inches above sea level of sea level the existing um is 46.2 inches above what is allowed by code thank you so how much higher of the existed deck as it stands now that they're looking to go they're looking to go an additional 16. uh four or nine inches above the current pullback to 16 inches 16 inches yes okay thank you so the old one before the the representative comes up the old one as it gets torn out will be replaced by a higher pool yes as for votes that's the first okay the other board members have any questions before we asked for the owners Mr you're good okay you folks are welcome to make it a statement if you'd like for your representative is both a make a statement yes sir my name is Steve Geiger I representative Cody pools um the biggest reason that we want to raise the pool to the height of the patio is the existing pool now has stairs right it's more difficult for the homeowner to enter in and out of the house down to the existing pool that's there so right now there's technically Three Steps from their existing house to the existing pool deck so what we're asking for is to build the new pool to the height of the patio I know that it already exceeds what the current code is but the pool already does so as he's saying we're asking for another 16 inches more than what it is right now and then as far as the footprint of the pool the foot the new footprint of the pool is smaller than what's actually existing there concrete wise some of the existing concrete is as close as three feet off of the seawall nowhere anywhere with the new project would be any closer than I think it's 11 or 10.9 somewhere in that range so you didn't have to or you don't plan to alter the tie backs no sir and I have a letter that I turned in with the um package that has a copy for my engineer on the Seawall okay so let me do you have your pool plan in front of you with your elevations on it I I did yes sir you're showing an actual finished elevation on the fall of 8.57 yeah the spa would be 9.57 and then the pool would be 8.57 okay so the sponsor for another foot yes and your pool deck um will will finish as as you'd like to have it finish at the 8.57 even with the undercovered porch yes sir is everybody on the board have to stand there we've got step Downs all over the place once you've flank the pool um so that'll take him down approximately what is the state about four feet on the back side yes correct okay um any other comments on your behalf I think that makes it clear yes sir I do have copies of the survey highlighting the existing pool and the proposed new pool along with pool construction drawings if anybody'd like to see it they have all of that stuff so you have a demolition contractor lined up sending the approval of the variance that's all we're waiting on yes sir okay have you applied at all yet for anything we we did apply for the application and then we've this is as far as we've got yes sir okay yeah any questions from um board members on either side of the deck this is north and south drops off and then you have the grade of the land right their intent is to put um glass wall you know obviously for trip fall purposes all the way around that's getting you installed anybody in the audience want to speak on behalf of this case just a guy here thank you very much thank you this time board members I'd like you to go ahead and take out our criteria sheet and I'd like to ask our vice chairman James wanted to go ahead and ask the questions around behalf we will be asking ladies and gentlemen six different questions for which you must receive the yes vote to move forward with the with the variants so number one have you demonstrated that the special conditions are unique circumstances exist which are peculiar to land structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other similar structures or buildings in the same zoning District to the requesters need that proved as a yes and no it's a deny Mr Beam no Miss Connery Mr Elia Mr Gardella yes Mr gatliff yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes pardon yes that's three no votes and four yes votes number two demonstrate the variance request is the minimum variance that will make it possible for the

five yes number three they demonstrated that glancing the variance requested will not confirm on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter yes it was approved no equals denied Mr Beam Ms Connery yes Mr Elia no no Mr Gardella yes Mr gatliff yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes to no five yes okay number four have they demonstrated that the variance requested does not change the abuse of the property from the used characteristics mandated for districts one and two and sections 3051 and 94-252 in an article for division three of this chapter yes the schools approved no equals denied Mr Beam no Ms conry yes yes thank you Mr Elia Mr Gardella yes Mr gatliff yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly to know five yes [Applause] and safeguards for supportive adjustment May prescribe including but not limited to reasonable time limits within which the action for this variance is required shall commencement or be completed as schools approved no equals denied Mr Bean no Miss Connery yes Mr Elia yes Mr Gardella yes Mr Gatlin yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly one no six yes hey number six they demonstrated that the variance requested does not violate any provision and requirements set forth in chapter 62 and chapters 74 of the city code yes equals approved no equals denied Mr Bean Ms conry yes Mr Elia no Mr Gardella yes Mr gatliff yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly to know five yes I'd like to ask for a motion questions or vote please I think we need a motion I'll make a motion to approve the variance request number 2304 we have I'm Sorry Miss Goldman who seconded it I couldn't tell thank you Mr Beam Miss Connery yes Mr Elia no Mr Gardella yes Mr gatliff yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes to know five yes folks your various is approved so we wish you the best Steve move forward with Kyle as soon as possible yes good luck going up to Clearwater to get your your building permit from the camp thank you very much for your time [Applause] uh I just want to express my happiness thanks thank you very much our next variance request is number 2305. the address is 305 Harbor Drive and the owners again but I hope I pronounced it correctly Demetra and constantinos Step Up to doubles okay the requesting your variance from chapter 30 which is our marine structure chapter plans of specification the young plans and specifications the length of a residential doc shall not exceed 30 feet from a sea wall for waterfront property line involved to allow an existing if you're requested to allow existing residential debt 31 feet farther from the sea wall that are allowed by code at this point Kyle could you come on back up and give us a city report staff reporting hey thank you this is for 305 Harbor Drive this mayor there's three variance requests in its for an existing Dock and Boat Lifts so it's it's required to have three variances from the code to replace what they're asking is to replace the existing bottle that's when a new boat lift and the reason that they need the variants because the dock itself is longer than is permitted by code the lift has filings that are further out there created by code and the projection of the property line is closer than what is provided by code so talking about the length of the dock the existing dock is 61 feet from the sea wall the code provides and a DOT can be 30 feet from the sea wall with an extension of a 15 foot catwalk the way that dock is designed if the dog is technically on the dock structure is 61 feet from the sea wallet that's on the existing dock they're doing nothing to that dock but they do need a variance because the lift is part of that box so they need a variance of an additional 31 feet from the sea wall to keep it as the existing dock then the next variance is appearance to allow the existing Boat Lift police to have elements pilings out it's 69 feet from Seawall the code provides the uh so this would be 69 variants to extend the Hoist uninitial 24 feet in sea level and then the last variance is when dealing with the property only projections and the way that the law is shaped if you look at a parcel is it's kind of a pipe he's getting skinnier towards the sea loss so when you're trying to help the property lines they kind of squeeze in um this but at the distance Where The Boat Lift is which is the 69 feet from the seawall and you project those property lines out instead of being 12 feet away from that property line it is only nine feet away so they're asking for a variance to be three feet closer to that projected crop your line on the sell side of the property and again that's no closer than what this thing situation is any questions from the board for Kyle yeah so I don't understand not replacing the dock I just replacing the four plylands and into ten thousand now left yes in the exact location and it's currently at lifeline thank you Kyle is just because this is an ancient variance from a long time ago um the doc the original doc was built before the current code was adopted so this is the code got more restrictive after the knock was installed and to your knowledge is there any interference because several of the board members that are all voters and David lives on that channel are we interfering whatsoever with that first 25 on on this property which I have a computer for that reason very good 305 Harbor is right here so we're a Parcels highlighted as you can see it's open water clear across the channel there so no interference you zoom in a little bit and take it in the greenstone house so the dot comes out and there's the existing a little hoist to lift and you can see on the property line projects this way leave that on the screen if you look for a minute David I'm actually surprised to see the Nightfall from that extended property line the way that looks so that's good all right on we're not extended anything it's exactly where it is now I have a question so Kyle the existing boat look now is 19 from the property line on the South Side yes and they asked him to go further out you said it was 61 now it's going to be 69 for the new one or is it going to be the same distance so the dock um right here where it ends is 61 feet and then the little voice is a little bit further as and there's already docks on either side of that of relatively the same the same length so any of the fiestas other docks that are longer than Dakota one more question so this was put in prior to a board of adjustment hearing when it was original playing right because they don't have variance foreign any other questions where it talks about um today and if you need to this property is it not going to be any to other properties as time goes on I'm looking at the input that they've explained what their request is needed um the properties vary as you go along these the sea walls um there definitely are some of that more prominently submits in shallower water I can't speak exactly [Music] it continues to grow I don't know the answer to that would the applicant or representative of the advocate care to come forward thank you please introduce yourself and pull the microphone down if you need so we can hear better okay thank you yes hi I'm Lisa Ryan with Advanced Marine construction and I am here representing Miss Dimitri and her husband um we are proposing as you have mentioned to keep the existing Dock and lift in the exact same position it's in right now just to swap out the boat lift on new poles yeah any questions or yeah while this while it's up on the screen yes we're seeing it back over here um what other cowl answers this or you answer this David has lived on on the canal for years and years I lived down on the Harbor Drive for 18 years for the north where the analysis all this is voters are always concerned about Shoals and as you come around that corner that's a that's a tough I realize you're not going out any further but Kyle how far across is it to where you you go are you familiar are you familiar without it David you can probably trust him on this one hey well from where it starts getting shallow there on that picture is probably 60 feet maybe 100 feet I don't know are you saying from the dock there's a natural channel that runs right there which is nice so where it gets darker there yeah it shows in real bad on that right side yeah and I did not measure that no I don't know that exactly the fact that it's existing is is helpful because to obviously get greater percentage of that 25 that you're allowed to put that venturing into that particular area so it turns to happen hazards the navigation guys I guess we're not dealing with that nope the only thing Mike that I would say is that you guys lived down here any worry about moving out as far as a dip at a low tide position or safety and voting slowly runs around now because the existing dot that's been there we all avoid it coming in because it it starts one or two houses to the South and I think one or two not even in that in that shop okay thank you at this point we'll go ahead and do our questions for our Criterion worksheet change if you take over there go ahead I'm sorry and um you guys didn't start me in and I'm a lawyer so you want to swear me in because I came in three minutes late I just feel bad it's like I feel like I'm lying do you solemnly declare affirm that the testimony you're about to give in these proceedings is the truthful truth and nothing but the truth I do I wanted to say that um since before my first son was born so um it's real shallow out there and it would be if you guys don't do this tonight it would be like pretty much unusable and we as you know we're not trying to change anything we just want them to replace the lift so that we can use it and it is it's just really shallow you guys know from being out there so and then we do the nice thing is we do have that nice Channel out there so I don't think we're bothering anybody any more than anybody else that's out there we're trying our best so maybe one of us has run into your diet not bad because we can't even rebuild it after that thank you accused anybody else want to speak change yours so variance requests we're going to start with 23-05 the first question is have they demonstrated that special conditions or unique circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land structure of building involved and which are not applicable to other similar structures or buildings in the same zoning District yes equals the variances approved no equals did not Mr Bean I'm Miss

Mr Kelly yes seven years number 2305 is approved for coming to part two you've got three to go we have to do this again twice we know the show's not too terrific we've got to do it again so bear with us that's right the variance request 23-06 first question is have they demonstrated that special condition to unique circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land structure and building involved and which are not applicable to other similar structures or buildings in the same zoning District yes equals approved no equals denied Mr Beam yes Miss Connery yes Mr Elia yes Mr Gardella yes Mr Gatlin yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes seven yes question number two have they demonstrated that the variance was quite possible with reasonable use of the land building or structure yes experience improved no variance denied Mr Bean yes Miss Connery yes Mr Elia yes yes Mr Gardella yes Mr Gatlin yes yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes seven yes question number three if they demonstrated that Grant experience requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter yes he was approved no results tonight Mr Beam yes Miss Connery yes Mr Elia yes Mr Gardella

with Kyle and our permanent procedure and again a lot of navigation up in Clearwater and we wish you the best thank you thank you thank you guys thanks hey that moves us on to our third marriage request of the night at 907 Harvard Drive it is very we have two variances coming up the number 23-08 to construct it out to encroach 25 feet farther into the inevitable waterway that allowed by city code Mr Brown I presume this is yours okay the second variance will hear is 23-09 same address requesting a catalog constructs a dock at catalog 15 further along 15 further [Music] floor is yours okay so this is at 907 Harbor Drive and he's requesting two variances the first variance Bruce addressing the 25 percent encroaching more than 25 into the navigable Waterway the engineer looked at the plans looked at the image so that is 907 Harbor and the engineer calculated the Navigator of the Waterway the utter distance of 140 feet that distance he calculated from the land to the bird Island it was 140 feet um he just his explanation when I asked was he wanted to make sure he checked all the boxes of what could be um interpreted as in having a Waterway as you can see it's you know a couple probably three 400 feet off of Bird Island to the north of the property but that is how he determined that they made a variance of an additional 25 feet because he kept going to hit the 25 of 140 is 35 feet and then the dock itself with the catwalk extends out 60 feet so maybe a variance of 25 feet further but it's fairly Open Water right off Mr Brown's cup yes I just wanted to point it out and then when it comes to the plans for the dock he has an existing dog that you can see I mean currently has a lift 50. he's dead in a bit but what his plans called for is extending a catwalk off the end of this existing 30 feet to get out deep enough to put the left for the boat to be so our code allows you to construct the main knowledge 30 feet from the sea wall and then you're allowed 15 additional fee from the dock as long as it's four feet or less in the width of a catwalk that is not enough he's proposing doing an initial 15 feet from the Knoxville to be 230 feet of catwalk to extend the lifts out so again that's a variance of 50 feet longer than the federal law by code any questions from the board how long is a dog out now Kyle I mean the farthest Pile in there of supporting that lift is that 45 feet is 30 and it looks like it would be under 40. so I mean the docker itself builds out as like a dock that runs parallel to the sea level that is Worthy from the seawall and then from there so this is four feet and then it goes another 26 feet to the end so that's the 30 and um and judging by this if you just like if this is about halfway it looks like the left doesn't go probably goes out right at 45. I don't have the existing plans and we're looking for another 15 feet past that point yes [Music] okay so they're confirming that the lift is within that 45 feet from the sequel they existed any questions anywhere now can you just pull push it in a little bit so I can see the you know a couple of water on the side there just a little bit you don't have to go like that you cut in even more just so they can see what's going on the right thing about to ask her and then this this is part of the parcel they actually have some submerged land so just cutting it like this doesn't apply to the distance of the dock off the property line because the way the code reads just it's projected so one of the Sacred areas we're not really worried about feet where the drop in life and the nine foot is just internally so it's fine we do have the 12. they do over 12. okay thank you guys Mr Brown Mrs Ryan even if you care to come up my name is Scott Brown we purchased a home in the middle of February I've been trying to work on a suitable plan since then the issue is that the the water around the dock and at the end of the helm there is very very shallow it becomes dry land completely dry land about 20 foot off the sea wall at low tide there's also an abundance of seagrass in that area so I had originally looked at trying to move some of the sand out of the way and create some depth stretch it and dredge it but the what the county uh spoke of concerns because of the seagrass in the area and so they would prefer us to give it a variance or later so so that's why we're asking for those variance uh the property the navigable Waterway there uh there's there's really two that are directly behind the home there's there's an East-West navigable waterway that runs all the way out to the main Channel uh in the harbor and then there's the north south that everybody's familiar with runs right next to here so that area is extremely wide in terms of navigable Waterway out there there's there's my estimate and measurement uh was in excess of 400 feet from the sea wall behind my house so there's there's a lot of water back there that's deep inevitable uh and as Kyle mentioned the navigable waterway that the engineer spoke up was to the island but the island is nowhere near my property it's several hundred feet to the South um so we really are just looking so that we can use the dock in low tide and even mid tide preferably we would have a request of 25 feet to ensure that we could use the lift at all tide levels but the variance application asked us for the minimum so that's why we are seeking 15 it will probably prevent me at some points in time with extreme low tides from using the lift uh but I think that's a pretty rare occasion and so that's why we're requesting 15 feet so we're trying to to be as reasonable uh and keep it as short as we can from that and I just also want to note that in our application our neighbors have reviewed the plans and approve uh the plans and agree with those Brad you are correct is this board looks very um realistically what the minimum request the parents request is that that's very fair if you need the 15 feet that's that's what we'll consider some people are shot for the moon and the whole variance goes down right so your application is commitment thank you I appreciate that I also just want to introduce as well John McKenna who is an environmental consultant that I hire with Florida permitting and Florida Urban who's been around for 34 years in the area and so I hired them to advise me with regard to the seagrass and what would be acceptable just to begin and thank you very thorough letter yes sir thank you he's going to reporters definitely helped support any other questions for Mr Brown or Mr McKenna or Miss Ryan you're there too board members questions thank you okay Madam Vice chairman you can take it okay here we go around very entry the first question is has he demonstrated that special conditions or unique circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land structure of building involved and which are not applicable to other similar structures or buildings in the same Zone District yes equals approved no it equals denied Mr Beam yes Miss Connery yes Mr Elio yes Mr Gardella no Mr Gatlin yes Miss Goldman yes pardon thank you Mr Kelly yes 106 yes question number two they demonstrated that the variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land building or structure yes equals improved no equals denied Mr Bean yes Miss Connery yes Mr Elia yes Mr Gardella yes Mr Gatlin yes yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes seven yes question number three have they demonstrated that granting the variance requested will not confur on the applicant any special privilege as denied by this chapter yes it was approved no equals to nine Mr Beam yes Miss Connery yes Mr Elio yes yes Mr Gardella no Mr Gatlin yes Miss Goldman Mr Kelly one

you've got your variances you moved forward to deal with water in them and go from there Mr McKenna while you're here we're going to pick you for it and please get under the podium for a couple questions and we'll help not only our board members but our city manager because the the your letter is terrific and in the past this city has had to deal with maintenance dredges sure on a city level is where I show my age we actually have a sandbar out here past Mr Brown's area that David you'll remember sold in so bad that we approached the Army Corps of Engineers for approval and they were dragging their feet and we started doing the legislatures Because all we wanted was a maintenance dredge we had clean fill we checked all the boxes in the corps of engineers said No at that point we said because when he shoveled in the currents blowing under the bridge going north where I don't know Kyle can you pull that down really gonna show the bridge to where um John can get a better shot at because it's the December is still there David isn't it yeah it comes out you can see how narrow it gets John and that's where the currents start ripping a lot of non-residents fishing on The Sandbar and we actually said what's it going to take for us to be able to to get this approved Pinellas County agreed they would do it where our land is outside here we were willing to put the film there and and have it all the way and don't charge through the city Kyle you may have heard a little bit about this but this this got to be quite an issue and ironically a man who was fishing there over Labor Day weekend in 2003 or four I can't remember drowned he slid off the um of The Sandbar his body was found just north of the bridge I got a call from the police chief at the time because I happened to be mayor and he said you have to do an interview with the channel 13. we just lost the person the ground because of that sample be amazed how fast the Army Corps of Engineers gave us the approval for a maintenance church can you kind of explain what a maintenance stretch is like I know Mr Brown I do accountability too sure sure a maintenance dredge the State of Florida has their own definition of it Pinellas County has a similar definition armor Corps of Engineers also has their own definition but essentially it's any valuable Channel A Boat Basin a mooring area anything that was dredged essentially artificially and normally the way that we determine that we're putting our purpose together is going back to historical Aerials you know if we can go back to the 50s 60s even the 40s and show that something was dredged then it's easily maintenance dredged the other caveat is for the state if an area fills into the point where it's no longer navigable they will not consider that maintenance then it's essentially a new dredge because I can't say that was our first maintenance stretch but it had gotten to the point where it was dangerous for even a voter to try to get through their kayaks to get through there because their currents were ripping Mr Brown the current's still bad going through there that's pretty strong yes sir it's pretty strong through there yes so because you have CBS is that virtually wiped him out from doing it yes at what was partially seagrass and partially because the mistress or Mr Brown's Mooring area was never dressed itself the adjacent north south channel was and Pinellas County for premises will not allow new dredging they would only allow maintenance dressing and then on the state and federal side and yes they were concerned about the seagrasses and they the state may possibly have permitted it with some mitigation but the department Corps of Engineers most likely would not have coronated we have gone through about six months of the dials so that must have been our initial request for maintenance trips uh yes and then did they issue the city of Maintenance judge eventually it sure did okay well now that you have it it should be easier to get in the future from the agencies kind of would this be our second one or is there been I don't think there's been one since that initial one in 2002 or three I don't know anyone since then but um you might want to look at the park if you have any idea we haven't had a great systems the key to why the county agreed to do it basically for free we gave them a stationary right outside here just south of the bridge where now there's the Gaze over the slammed up there so the county was thrilled with that I think Army Corps of Engineers did it because somebody died and it took that of course it was on television and legislators were all over the Army Corps of Engineers Etc so the county ultimately after it dried out all the Phil was here for two weeks for three weeks all the water ran out they hauled their way um which gave us some new light for that channel I was now choking again so I I bring this up because your letter uh highlighted making stretch as well as the brown could have possibly done but um didn't have to based on our action today so just one more thing though you indicated in your letter that president s that already that other people have already got their Docs yes there are some docs down to the South that looking back through the Aerials in our measurements that looked like they were they were further out okay tell me you care some neighbors have been dressed too haven't you know no no we haven't not that not since I've been there okay did I misunderstand you or did you say that um Pinellas County will not issue a dredge for private citizen they will not issue any new dressing areas if it's if it's an existing Channel or a boat base and they will issue a maintenance stretch permit but if that area has never been judged before Connor or Patron with Pinellas County Water navigation which who I spoke with and he had indicated that in very rare circumstances if you can show that you're providing a public benefit of some sort they would allow new dredging but he also said that was essentially limited to public peer stocks built ramps it would be very difficult he said for a private citizen to do that so in Mr Brown's case if he did not have the sea grass that he needed to dredge it the county would not and he never had a dress in the past it can't even not issue with him correct correct because it was never trenched can't I have any citizens approach you lately for a maintenance stretch I haven't seen a judge come through permitting over a year I know Fred and Tony have got a neighbor um up close to the corner of Toledo I guess Leo one or two back where it showed in some badge out of that um yeah they've got beaches behind their house interested enough your old house okay my neighbor like he had a dredge done within the last year and a half produce Kennedy's got a 45-foot cabin brand out there the five Refrigeration I don't know what you got to do to get it I don't think he had any seagrass issues where he was at but he just he's interested out with him last year we're going to explore because they have a brand at large now they they pumped it out and pumped into a truck there in the street and yep specifically for his boat that's there and he took three or four feet out you know if that means he must have had a thing instead to the Past correct yes yeah that was probably it actually made a slip at some point we're dealing with some residents who need a real bad and it's going to drop it turns left yeah we've uh you know last two or three years we've done a lot of Permitting for that type um mostly in Manatee County but it's uh it's become a very popular thing everywhere obviously if they have a drink it's not like they have to come before us for various and they can't do that who would need to be not not much navigation yes and we may see more of you any other questions John thank you very much for your information sure thank you all right thank you a little entertaining a motion to adjourn if there's no further Vision before the board Mr Elia penny in German thank you"
