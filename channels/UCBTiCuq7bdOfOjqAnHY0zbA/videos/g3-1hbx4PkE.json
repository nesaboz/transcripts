on the agenda as item two but it's actually now item three uh this is consideration of resolution 23-9 Mr MOA would you uh please read the resolution happily Mr Mayor this is resolution 22319 a resolution of the city council of the city of Beller Beach Florida extending the prev previously noticed and advertised qualifying period for the March 19 2024 election to run without interruption through noon on December 18th 2023 providing for the qualifying process and providing an effective date as you review the resolution before you council members you'll not it sets forth the the history of the resolutions we've ad we've adopted relative to the election and what it does is extend we had already noticed the qualifying period to begin on uh 8 am on Friday December 1st it was originally ex um contemplated to end on Friday of last week and uh upon request we are extending this through December 18th at noon that is the pretty much last minute that qualifying could conceivably be open we have to report to the supervisor of elections on December 19th with ballot language which would include the name of names of the candidates so this is the longest uh we could have the qualifying period uh and of course that has to allow time uh for anybody who submits a packet to have the packet verified and reviewed so with that um that is the resolution before you and uh otherwise Happy to answer any questions thank you Mr MOA before we uh go to the council I need to go to the public would anyone like to speak on this topic seeing as we have no one wanting to speak uh citizen comments are now closed uh before we move forward on this I'm going to need a motion to approve this resolution so Move Motion made by Leslie NATO do I have a second second second by Lloyd Roberts uh miss nario you have the floor FL I think um Mr Morrow made it very clear I asked him why it goes through the December 18th as opposed to like maybe going through the end of December and that's because it that's there's the date that we have to have the stuff to the supervisor of elections so December 18th is really the last time we can accept qualification papers whatever you want to call them that's a Monday and I believe that's Tuesday we have to uh that's the official deadline 5 PM Tuesday the 19th is the deadline for the supervisor of elections and we considered going all the way to the end but um in the event that there's an onslaught of applications um Mr reefer is going to need time to uh help put all that together so uh okay any other comments from the council yes sir why are we doing this we are doing this because we have five open seat Well actually now we have uh we have five open seats potentially five or three it depends upon how the election goes currently we have one qualified candidate yes there there are four seats that will be subject to had um I thought the last meeting if if I'm correct didn't we have three people acknowledge they picked up their packets and sent in the information I thought it was two but no one turned them in so I had two additional uh potential candidates pick up binders quity information but they decided not to submit here's a question for you Char Mitchell Charles Mitchell feedback from Mr Chester's microphone in the airport so you can continue Mr sorry Charles Mitchell won't be reporting to this m since we already had a resolution to for December 8th my concern is it doesn't matter if we have one or 20 people that qualified or submitted what if somebody challenges this now and that one person that that qualified or whatever doesn't get one um and we have to re is there I don't know what the filing fee is three four $500 I mean could it how much would it cost you this City to R rerun an election or could they rerun an I guess the bigger question is would this open the door that you could rerun an election because we already had a resolution well we we as a coun you as a council enjoy the ability to to do what you've done here in terms of Ren noticing something your your election qualifying period had already been noticed if somebody chose anytime you folks take an official act any act you open the door for somebody to challenge it so every Act is another potential and I have to acknowledge that here and always anytime you do something it's one more chance for somebody to challenge it I I think if you're looking at it from a practical policy standpoint you have here the desire to make the election more inclusive rather than less inclusive and less apt to a challenge in that sense but of course we something to be challenged we'd be prepared to address that um this was offered as an opportunity or or a a mechanism by which this city could solicit candidates for a longer period of time to ensure as it says in the whereas Clauses to amend and extend the qualifying period to maximize the opportunity for potential candidates to qualify um so it's rather than foreclosing it I would be much more concerned if we were taking a qualifying period that was a week long and making it three days long rather than in in and anybody who qualifies would still be subject to all the same requirements um so it's not some kind of fast pass in the door that somebody else could not have taken advantage of yeah and I understand everything we do can be challenged but I mean I think we open the door Pandora's Box a little bit wider when we have a resolution that expired and the results weren't I don't know if the results weren't what we wanted but the results are the results I mean and then you have a charter saying those slots aren't filled then you should have Council filled that that that's my whole question I think it I think it someone could file a a a suit against us and we'd have to rerun this election Mr Banker we we could chase our Tales all day on the hypotheticals but the way that I looked at this whenever I called for this meeting was that if we don't have candidates how are we going to appoint somebody and Dave do you understand what I'm saying abut it's the same it's the same opportunity I would rather that we we actually had a real election and had enough candidates rather than having to appoint everybody on the council because that's whenever you're really opening yourself up uh for uh a possible challenge um I don't but this this Council has the opportunity to vote on it and uh do you have any other comments no I'm just saying we've I've been here two and a half years we've had many positions opened up um and we've always had more than one qualified candidate to run so I don't know what the problem is right this is a u Senate Bill 774 problem is what this is um I think we've all discussed it already many times would anyone else like to comment on this no no no I'll just say I agree with you when you say Senate and problem yeah yeah yeah exactly okay uh well if there are no other comments then let's take it to a vote Miss Rose would you please call the role council member bankard no council member Chester yes council member Naro yes council member Roberts yes uh council member Shaw Elliot yes vice mayor Shirley hi and mayor gtis yes and did we get Mr Chester's vote Yes he voted yes yes okay so one two three four five six okay six to one then uh this resolution passes um and that's all we've got I appreciate everything uh you've done for us Mr Moore with putting this together and uh making sure that we're covered and uh I appreciate see manager putting this meeting together and uh if there's nothing else I would like a motion to adjourn motion motion made by Frank Banker do I have a second second I'm gonna give that to time delay Mark Chester all any oppos I all right thanks for if we can do this take care everybody you in happy holidays same to you that lady with two first names she always kind said happy holidays shley Shirley Jody I what's your name have a Merry Christmas"
