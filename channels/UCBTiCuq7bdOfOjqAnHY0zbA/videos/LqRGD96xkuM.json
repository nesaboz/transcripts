    "transcript": "need approval of the minutes um from june 14th anybody have any questions i do [Applause] um at the last meeting we had a discussion and we briefly touched on uh bringing code enforcement back in house there was a little bit of explanation about it but it i was not aware that the committee concurred totally i realized there was no formal vote taken but i wanted to make sure that more discussion was planned and that this statement was not that every committee member agreed to that it was a good thing to bring code enforcement back it's a little missing because it says the committee concur um was supportive of further discussion that would be anything other than we all concurred because if we all concurred there were no need for further discussion until we get to them how do we do it and that that was my only comment about them i'm not going to take if i remember right i think the rationale for bringing it back in house was to save money yeah and listening to council discuss this issue either in work sessions or at the regular council meetings they wanted to keep going with having danny do it the simple fact that uh he was an extra deputy an extra set of eyes and some examples were given where he did you know when he see something or had to do something in relation to law enforcement he stopped the clock on code enforcement and then resumed it once he completed the law enforcement so the good news is that's all it's all behind so in the final budget process we um they approved to keep deputy dougherty in place so i know that means yeah because i had some examples of that personal experience with deputy dory and it was really a good experience yep i've heard nothing but good things and last week i was rather surprised i see this suv stopped across the street from me and i'm thinking what did i do wrong now and it was danny delivering the packet and we talked for a little bit so that was the first time i'd actually you know engaged is he a sheriff's employee yeah he's a retiree you know they're called reserves and they've branched specifically for him yeah oh interesting we've dedicated that's not what he's getting but yeah it's got the sheriff overhead all right so do we want to move on to glenn talking about the uh undergrounding well do we want to i got this crib sheet here to do minutes and patty's got this approval of the agenda so uh oh so we need to back up and approve the agenda and approve the minutes of emotion for okay he's talking down here on the minutes we will back up we need an approval of the agenda yeah that's the first item no yeah approval on the agenda who are you pointing at do you want to end up what was it no mark approved the minutes or i'll i'll motion to approve the agenda okay uh old favor all right same with the minutes all favor aye did you get the roll calls i just checked people off as they arrived and i broke down excuse for uh bob rosenberg he's with work all right for the um minutes mark minutes motion passed um we're missing two right now so it's actually four nothing four zero i'm gonna put a question mark here at them for jody right now and if she shows up i'll make a check mark it wasn't their council member that was only for the audit leslie was required a council member and because of the council last night these extra papers wasn't in our packet that we got but they put a project on us to turn them pretty quickly so we'll go down so there's there's an amendment to the i guess there is an amendment to the agency okay okay all right so then uh glenn you wanna yeah uh i just wanted to get kind of bringing up to speed on funding and the costs that i've obtained from for the gulf boulevard underground project yeah glenn excuse me are you going to take us back to the beginning or am i the only one that would love to hear well it's been accomplished okay uh and who paid for stuff okay mel pinellas counties uh it's called penny for pinellas and there was a penny three which was the previous penny and it had money for gulf boulevard beautification it paid for the bicycle racks on gulf boulevard the beautification in the marina the landscaping and what have you and it paid for portions of the well paid for all the west side of gulf boulevard underground project um along with a portion of first through twelfth first spectrum to take their wires down and unfortunately they're still working on that but they've been paid for it so you know they'll they'll get it done sooner than later i hope because with the first the penny three money that money was mainly used to try to get rid of all the cross wires going across global barn and then we had enough to fund the west side so we undergrounded all the electric we've got a couple pockets of spectrum still on the west side that is paid for they still have to underground that duke has completed their project on the west side so the beach mayors went back to uh the big c is who did it went back to pinellas county a couple years ago when they were trying to promote the penny four which the voters voted on and approved okay with the caveat that they would give the beach 35 million dollars and it's it's uh broke up depending on the linear footage of each community so that's that's where we're at right now today um so this is the penny for money penny for money and uh we got about 400 000 last year we rolled it over because we're getting 990 000 uh a year from pinellas county and part of that money is bell insurance money they've given it to us as they did in the last project the share was last time it was about 3.6 million this time it's right at four total well it's four million fifty one thousand dollars uh i did go to bellaire to talk with them about doing the same thing this time they didn't have any problems they're fine using their money for the east side yeah because i use part of our money and their money for the west side all right so the penny for money is a total of how much 4 one thousand eight hundred fifty seven dollars four million it's in your package okay physically does that money exist in a bank account or it's coming or no what what happens is uh the city has to pay pay the money as an example if uh let's say duke sent me an invoice for one million and fifty five thousand dollars the city would have to pay that invoice and then we would submit that in for a paid invoice would copy the check to pinellas county and they would reimburse us the reimbursement's usually within 30 to 45 days so it's pretty fast so we aren't out the money for any length of time uh so we ask them to roll the roughly 400 000 that came in last fiscal year over and that's what we did with the last project we kept we rolled it over until we had enough money to do something so right now uh with this year we'll end up with uh somewhere around 1.3 million uh which is not enough to do any project other than maybe pay for spectrum to finish their work you could do that and i would think we would roll it over one more year then we'd have enough to do start the underground project but the bigger problem is the total project we're short almost a million dollars at the end of this year we'll have 1.3 yeah at the end of september next 22 yeah and then we'll have to get another 990 and really rolling it over is simple they don't give you any heartache about it and you could do the projects like the little spectrum projects under 92 000 when you get spectrum out of the way but the bigger issue is the shortfall and there's two ways to look at it you could do phase one take phase two and ask uh duke to break it up and then you end up with phase three at some point in time [Music] uh and there's a possibility in the next penny time they voted they could give them more money again but it's a four or five year project so i i just wanted to get some feedback more costly if you break it up into these phases because they got to keep starting to stopping and i'm guaranteed well that's part of the problem that the costs will change because these are the their initial costs and their their guarantee but if we don't as an example if we don't do phase one then sometime march or april the cost will change which we we won't have enough money to do phase one and i'm talking phase one of duke and the the underground because i went to the uh undergrounding company utility consultants that we use for bei and the original cost from duke was 5.5 million for their portion i went back and told him no i don't want you to put the conduit in i'll go out and find somebody who's gone to it so after that we ended up saving about uh 600 dollars by going to a second you know an outsider to put the conduit in and they they've done a lot of projects with duke so it's not really a big deal so that's where we're at with it but i don't expect the project to you know unless we just uh get rid of the spectrum stuff and then start when we have some accumulated money with phase one and go north but i don't know what your feeling is to break it up into thirds and then take phase two and split it kind of like what uh spectrum did because that's the only two phases they have left use 12th to 22nd 22nd day heirs so what i gave you i gave you copies of the duke estimate i gave you the schedule of values from utility consultants i gave you copies of the spectrum invoices which they submitted to us and then also we're gonna have to get some uh easements from some of the residents along gulf boulevard uh this company that here they work with duke energy and they've been very successful at getting the easements and it's a minimal cost it's less than ten thousand dollars there's 11 easements they need along gulf boulevard to put you know they have to put transformers and what have you so which is brings me to one of the questions that i had after reading through this uh explain to me a little bit about the process of eliminating the fold is now undergrounded next to the sidewalk right how are they going to get underground to the first hole between the back doors of the houses they'll shoot it okay so that's these are no wires until it gets to the first pole right above ground to the first pole right behind the houses right okay and mark just i i don't i don't know yeah i don't ha i'm not terribly knowledgeable in all this but i can tell you i'm in a condo 3210 up there and when they took the pole down in front of us they had to get those wires buried that had gone in the air to the building underground and they shot it if that's the word they shot it under our whole parking lot all the way from gulf boulevard to the to our building underground to our big transformer box or whatever it's called it was an amazing thing but they did it yeah absolutely i just wanted to make sure that we weren't going to be stuck with some stubborn pole that's feeding well you're still going to pull you're going to still have street light poles that's going to still be there because i looked into the solar lighting and it cost another half a million dollars for that size for that span yeah but there's much power what powers those lights the power will come into the pool yes okay so no yeah so there are wires going across gulf boulevard there's a few still left what are those those are cable wires meaning spectrum spectrum are they the bane of your existence for them i can tell that right away yeah they're the worst they had a gentleman and i don't know what happened but he kind of like disappeared from the world and they brought in these other guys and they they've gotten a little faster but they're still you know not efficient you know at least with duke you know you you have to keep pushing them it's kind of like the underground project that we did in bbi you had to keep pushing them but they got it done yeah uh but spectrum is the worst uh well frontiering much better because as an example if any house that's got poles behind it going down like first through 25th street there are old verizon lines that frontier now owns on there that connect to nothing and to get them down you got to pay them they won't take them down pay them pay who's here okay they won't touch them we actually in the underground we had to pay frontier i want to say it was 12 14 000 for bei [Applause] uh to take up you know a few views that haven't been used in years yeah so when they undergrounded and turned it fios they just left them i still have mine i still have my box i never took it out they'll phone connection box yeah they won't they won't come and take anything that's just the problem you know and you know i've talked to them i've got them to take out a couple places but i had to tell them that you know they were causing damage just you know this or that i got them to do it that for nothing but for the most part yeah so so what is the difference between duke's work and utility consultants work duke puts the actual wire in the ground and does all the connections utility consultants does the uh conduit they shoot that underground uh and then duke comes up with the wire through the conduit yeah all right so duke's decent figures here for duke energy that's their cost to actually run the wire in the conduit and connect it and connect and connect it bring in the connections to the transformer energize energize you know all that those numbers any home that has on gulf boulevard and i don't think there's very many of them that has a liar from the street to their house that's on them who's them the homeowner so our condo which does have a wire from a pole you don't think that's spectrum who who would that be verizon that's probably spectrum yeah so i'd have to go negotiate with them to either put down yeah city's not going to write a check for me no so and i'm sorry i was late but um what is your question for us well you're asking advice because we have a million dollar shortfall is that yeah yeah and and the other option is to go back to duke and say hey i want you to break this up in thirds or force or something i mean it seems logical to me you're going to want to spend the lion's share right in other words well you have that price locked in from duke you want to do the bigger portion of the project well but we don't have that money available to us yet so is this this money this you know 4 million 51 that's what we're going to get over the life of the penny for yes okay but so today we only have a million three yes and then was it ten years no uh you'll have three more years of roughly uh 900 and was it 900 so it was a five-year deal yeah three years yeah the first year we got like 340 thousand something like that and then we're getting 930 9 30 9 30 9 30. that's what that bottom line says i need better light or something so uh really what i'm kind of trying to find out you know is it better to ask duke to split it up into smaller chunks and go as far as we can as soon as we can or is it or go to the city and say do you want to spend the million uh or do you want to just use what you have and if you want to schedule this today when would it be done are you are you scheduling it now for three years from now i'm getting the i got the preliminary prices from them so if as an example we if we went to them and said we want you to start phase one that's 1.8 million we'd still have about a half a million shortfall but if we could get them to start on it then we could probably make that shortfall up first of october next year they wouldn't be finished by no and they wouldn't be finished because there's lots of design work and other things they have to do so okay the city would have to front that money but they'd get it back next october because you so then you'd have about four hundred thousand dollars left two years to go so you'd end up about you'd have about two two point four million left uh or two three to finish whatever project you wanted well the possibility to finish it after we looked at the phases really is break them up or make them into smaller phases and finish what you can each year so try to go so we're spending a million dollars a year rather than yeah whatever it would be but it's never been currently you don't have enough money to do the whole project is the problem now uh the other option which we'll talk about with the the second item i want to talk about is the american rescue money [Music] that's what was hanging in my head was where are we using that money that there's eight hundred thousand dollars uh right now it could not be used for this there is a bill in congress to give some more uh what i call a latitude the spectrum piece is going to be used for because it's providing you know high-speed internet no no no because it's not we're not a rural area right it's not we're not we're not putting in broadband and we're not needy okay i think everyone already has so so there's eight hundred and two thousand dollars uh that we're going to get from the american rescue we've already got half of it in cash uh we can take that money and use it for whatever stormwater projects are already in the bucket and then use that storm water money to come here does the stormwater fee allow us to use that money what oh we're not touching the fee there's money just in that so that's why we'll make sure no no no it's it's not the stormwater fee it would be the money that we trade i think that would be restricted we transfer out of reserves funding for the stormwater projects because the fee is not bringing if we were covering the stormwater project the fee would be 70 a month because it's what 130 000 a year or something in total 140 something this last year was a kind of a portion year and we took in 140 something and it's going to be a little higher this year so what you're saying is the money that's budgeted for the stormwater projects we city council can move it but they can't take the storm water fee money right that's strictly for me no i know i know yeah so reallocate what's the total budget for stormwater well uh we've got two projects this year which is uh which is on on here that's the reason we have uh the private project from last year that's going to roll over and the reason that happened is the engineer that was doing the design work got ill so we had to go out and get another engineer oh that's right i remember that yeah yeah so we're looking at 15e we're looking at uh yeah 15 e and 15 g those are the two projects for this year which which amount to about 700 000 but that's an option we could reallocate the the city council could reallocate that funds and put it in the air and then we'd still be a couple hundred thousand short over the long term well i it seems to me that we should move forward with trying to get as much done as we can with the money that we have just because we've already done so much of the are these estimates no they're they're actual costs they are they're clear are they binding yeah finding estimates okay so they cost so we know exactly what it's going to cost us and you said on the west side if everything is done it will be the only thing that's left to be done is spectrum well yeah but everything but all the power is down yes just done so we're talking about starting at first right boulevard right that's south of causeway yeah and then phase two of that would be the causeway and and you know i kind of wanted to get some feedback there from you guys to say hey is uh maybe i need to go back to duke and split that ask him to split it so then we can actually do a project almost every year yeah because you're almost spending this is three million then the next project would be almost two million right so and then you end up only with a couple hundred thousand so um yeah i mean it seems like if we and if we did 300 000 so we get 9 30 [Music] annually for the next four years is what you're saying starting this physically yeah and we have nothing in reserves nothing left over from no what happened was there was like i think it was like seven thousand dollars that was left we had no way to you know none of this so anything that fell out of that it fell off the system so but we used everything we could with trying to finish the spectrum stuff on the west side and bellaire shores is definitely in on the project with us they're not going to they're sure no i went to their meeting i had a meeting with the mayor privately and then i went to their meeting okay there's no issue with that do we have that in writing well i mean word is one thing but you know when this is the interlocal agreement that says we i'm just saying you know with everything else that's going on with i i don't think that's you know i and the mayor said if we want something right he'll give it to me but we didn't have anything in writing previously it's an interlocal agreement that's signed by all the beach cities okay and there's a stipulation in there that the money for bellar shore can be utilized with by bellar beach uh for golf delivery yeah yeah this project the only thing you can use it for is underground okay so i'm not that concerned about it but you know if the council wants me to get a letter from them i'm sure i can do that i'm i'm right now is there any chance big c's going back to the well to see if there's another i got to think everybody's coming up short well what most of the cities are doing is they're just going as far as they got and and what i expect them to do is do what they did this time you know if they're short they're gonna the four years is over they're going to say hey i need you know 20 million but they aren't going to go the county is not going to give us any additional of the 35 million they already allocated so it sounds like we're probably better off breaking it up into another phase and then that way in the event three years from now they'd be said to do petty five then otherwise you have to write a check for any of the right unknown well i think the same thing you know you look at these numbers and it's just like we just said you know one of these is at a million the next one is almost two and you're you're making the argument that maybe we're better off to break this into three phases so that we have enough money each physical year to do things we're not driving peter to pay paul so i'll go on a limb i'll make a motion that we go back to we go to the past we we we go to the face person that i have to go back to utility consultants all i gotta do is tell him you know he's he's wonderful to work with is that still uh mark yeah no he he's he's doing uh the reddingtons they put it out we'd just jump off that contract and uh he's doing the reddingtons all right so we've got a motion to uh for lynn to go back to duke request if we can bring it into three phases and spread it spread spread the dollars and the expenses over those three phases is there a demarcation point down here where you'd like to say okay now it'll be from the causeway going north too well if you look at spectrums spectrum has got basically 12th through 22nd and 22nd through harrison so we'd probably it seems like 22nd would be about halfway yeah okay we probably want to use use the same situation we're gonna you know what are your thoughts about asking the consul to use the american rescue money to do the product the stormwater projects well we have a motion that has not been seconded and we our recommendations have to go to council you're right so is anybody going to second the motion to go to three phase phases vice-2 yes i would second that but i think you said duke and i would propose that all you know all three contractors get oh yeah yeah okay okay all right so i'm gonna make my motion to do undergrounding in three phases vice to secondly by jody all right i know we we do this best backwards but it's fine all right so we do the discussion and then we do the motions when it should be the other way around well once once we're done discussing uh so we have a motion in a second all a favor hi hi any opposed five zero no six zero we have one excused i keep forgetting it's still fine it's still still five zero okay so then to follow up on you know your next question the funding shortfall do we recommend you you're you're asking us would we recommend reality re you're moving the buckets around take the 800 000 from the rescue plan and use that for the budgeted storm water repairs that's going to be take the budget and storm water repairs explanation yeah no i think you know you i i know all the people that get up and complain about their storm water issues they don't think they well you got to understand they're not taking you're you you don't you aren't taking the money away you're actually putting more on into your front we've already been paid for i think it needs to be presented that yeah using the american rescue for the storm storm water i agree on that yes okay now we've got this money in the budget for storm water that we won't need to use can we allocate it to another yeah because the the thought was move the storm art projects up further down the line that was an option also because this is an example we had the 800 000 and that's why i gave you the sheet if you look at 22 23 20 volt 324 your like 700 000 in your shortfall of about you've still got about 150 160 000 left give or take that you could start on 24-25s project so you know if you if you did that then the stormwater projects would actually move in move up in years because you've got the money now if you wanted to reallocate the 423 and the 3 36 uh let's say that's we'll just round in the sense 800 000. then we'd have to ask the council to rebudge that money to the undergrounding project and use this money for those two projects and that's probably you know there's many things you can use this for but if you use it for infrastructure and stuff it's it's not an accounting nightmare if you go out and try to give money like uh i'll give you an example pinellas county gave every employee in pinellas county 750 for getting vaccinated okay they used some of this american rescue money hillsborough county gave 500 pasco gave uh 500 uh and some of them gave 500 plus two days vacation uh but those are big places and a lot of them are hiring consultants to take care of this money because how you have to report it where if we kind of stay the line of using it for uh infrastructure then the reporting for it is much simpler i mean it gets into payroll and the taxes and you know and uh is the current infrastructure bill that was signed yesterday is there anything coming to local governments we don't really know that it hasn't been really washed out they they talk but you know what wasn't uh because i've read a little bit about it and there's been some uh webinars about it and they talk like well you're going to get this for this and get that for that but where's it going to come from and what are you going to let us do with it and how do we apply for it that there's going to be where this american rescue money is in the bank i got 401 000 in the bank already they ached the amount we had to sign the agreement in august and september they gave me the first half they'll give me the second half sometime in august or september of this year or 22. that's what the plan is and you have until fiscal year 20 till the end of 24 to to commit it and then to finish paying the bills you technically have to go 26 but most people are saying you better pay the bills by 24. because they're good right because because it's you know you're just dragging it out and if you spent the money why wouldn't you just try to close yours out because you've got how many cities in the united states and so let me ask you this even if we had tried to fast-track some of this storm water with that money there's only so many man hours right there's only so much that you can't have every street the city torn up you can't so you can't really fast track it there you can't take on these projects faster than we have them scheduled for anyway can you well you could you just gotta get the consultant to do the engineering work for you and how fast they can get into that and be able to manage it right yes right because you'd have to you know just spit them in sections you know and that's how they broke out if you look at them they're they're broke out going to work pretty much and then next year we're coming back to 9th street over here and 19th and 20th so you know pretty much after 9th street's done the south end of the city is finished it's been done uh we're on 12th and 13th and that project would have been done if we wouldn't have the issue with the engineer uh health issue because it would have been already out to bed and let's be working on it well don't follow this right i take a picture of it and blow it up so i can see the numbers so 21 and 22 using using the 2122 number which was 336. yeah and then add the two for 22.23 no i'm talking well you could do that too uh or we could use the 2021 money that's rolled over into it because we didn't get it the project started it's rolled over into this year's budget how much is that one four twenty three three two two hundred it's in the gray area do you see that it's out to the right it's 12th and 13th street yeah that's the one that's currently in design and we've asked for a proposal to do the design on is it 17th and 18th yeah so you put that out together you have an engineer hired to do it now for what for those the design of those two the 12th and 13th we have the engineer we've got a i've asked for a proposal from the engineering firm for seven to 18 also but the 12th and 13th because larry got sick we moved into another engineer and we did we weren't i didn't know yet i didn't know all that so yeah he was in the hospital for like a month and uh he's not able to do anything he can't even drive a lot now right now so i talk to him like once a month so so who are we hired now duel yeah i talked to duel i talked to cardinal and cardinals got such big overhead the pricing is ridiculous and and duels doing our site plan stuff now too oh they are yeah i was told we weren't doing that anymore yeah i think they charged me 125 an hour you know larry had flat fees so far we've managed to squeak by with that yeah so then if i look on this schedule and i see in fiscal year 25 414 900 for 14th and 16th street but it doesn't get re-typed in the total column is that just a typo or yes it should be in the total yeah okay i'm good and all this money is in the budget right well you you make a six-year capital budget right so that's what these these numbers are at but that's the proposed future budget for things go through the whole thing i mean there's painting the building hvac all of this stuff so what's in the actual budget for this year is 336 000 plus the 423 200 that is rolled over from last year because you can roll we already budgeted for that project and you can roll it into the next fiscal year if you haven't completed it we would have already started that one if what happened that happened so if we're 9.77 short on the undergrounding we still have to figure out how to cover that shortfall yeah it's still um still a couple hundred thousand shorter but you know you have to i guess you have to look at it for a couple hundred thousand dollars we improve the appearance of guilt boulevard is that well fine but do we need to propose wouldn't have budget that uh [Music] yeah but it's not in a actual fiscal budget yeah it's just a proposed budget can i ask kind of a stupid question but elder schwarz's benefit is benefiting as well we've used all of our money up to this point you know hitting their side yeah hitting that side of the street while their money as i can see here is a little different than ours um how much are they willing to get into getting the rest of this stuff i don't know if they're willing to do that but i mean they've got to be getting some of the same money that we're getting from you know from who yeah they're getting 50 000 well i mean are they i haven't asked that question you know what i'm saying i mean it just seems logical we're in it together you know i mean i know we have a lot more homes than they have but i'm just if you do the pro rata report where we get three quarters a day a quarter right roughly so if we're 200 short we find 150 an iphone 50. well i mean we could ask that question but i don't know where that'll go well i think that we can make that part of our recommendation that we asked that we asked yeah they got i think it was 50 from the uh ara and and i'd have to go back to see employees they got a shot here to all their employees they got a shot well they're one employee well the other thing i would have to probably look at is what did that site cost based on what they contributed last time well that would be an interesting thing we probably should come up with i guess then there's a question would the rescue act allow them to fund the project well right now no the rescue act does not talk about underground and and that's what i mentioned earlier there is a because they're not benefiting from any of the um groundwork stormwater no no but do they have storm water i mean are they getting any funding for anything that no they don't they don't have any storm water uh i certainly see some catch basins in front of the parks and stuff that's all that's all yeah yeah they don't they don't have any alcohols or anything that's clogged yeah yeah it just goes into the county drainage system because i'll go over i mean it's worth it looking at what we've done and you know what the allocation has been right and you just kind of look at going forward okay we've got you know a similar allocation is there something you know is are they willing to contribute something we contributed everything we had over there we're trying to get the job done well i like i said what i probably would need to do is go back and pull the invoices to see what that site cost us yeah yeah because from 19 south is that we should have contributed a dollar uh from 19th south right whatever that whatever that portion cost us is did you contribute that amount of money you know i don't know that factually i'd have to pull the invoices and uh yeah i'd love to see the history on it because based on this i mean you know we're covering two thirds or three quarters of it they're covering a quarter of it we've got yeah i like it i i i know i'm hitting you with a lot i know i'm hitting with a lot but i think it's worth it no no i'm excited to go back to kind of get that information go back and find out what they contributed last time and if what what we did on that side right and what did you know what what was the how much was collected from penny for pinellas how much was spent how much was ours how much deserves right that sort of thing didn't you say it's linear feet yeah is that am i wrong but about three quarters of the work done on the east side would have benefited gulf shores not city of bel air beach about half only half yeah i think about going it's one okay okay it's one point but it's not one quarter it's not one quarter it's definitely more than that yeah no it's 1.9 miles but they don't have anything on the east side no i get it i get that yeah but it would be interesting to see what what our contribution was and how you know yeah from the last one and this is just a recollection like 525 000 a year from the last minute i'm we're still haggling over here and then they were money for them and i don't know all right so when we look at the um american rescue plan act funding you've got the 800 6 000 in chicken right 802. and we're recommending that we um re-allocate the budgeted dollars for the rollover and this next year for stormwater to be moved to the general budget to cover not general budget but to the capital budget for uh continuation of the undergrounding of the utilities and then use the rescue act money for the planned uh stormwater uh capex and then it'll it'll add that jody makes a good point it adds another forty five thousand dollars i recommend budgeted storm water money yeah roll and this would be the 4122 for fy 21 22 plus the rollover from i budget he's 7.59 [Music] you were taking a penny that's what i have he's he's the accountant that was a former life about the same issue yeah okay yeah yeah i i just tried to give you whatever data stuff i could find and i gave you the complete grant award and all that and then it'll give you ahead on taking the proceeds of the american rescue plan act funding so where is this must be planned doing the undergrounding that's boring yeah okay [Music] yeah to apply to the storm water store water projects they're budgeted stormwater budgeted projects so they're going to be using one two three one to four and the six yeah nothing small big pot you're going to also need to use i guess since it's about 750 760. yeah is is the um see he did use it i did i did i'm sorry so it's like 42 000 right right so then we're also gonna have to allow it to fund because it can only be used for storm water so it's also going to need to then fund part of the future yeah with the remaining balance remaining balance to fund future stormwater projects perfect and that like i said that could change because there is a bill that has been proposed in congress to give more latitude to this but all right with remaining boundaries uh like if infrastructure included underground utilities yeah then then we could skip this step and just doesn't that mean it's not all right so we need a motion uh to take the recommended here already take the recommended budget stormwater money for fiscal year 2122 plus the rollover budget to be allocated to capital budget for completing underground and gold boulevard utilities then use the american rescue plan funding 802 868 to apply to stormwater to the stormwater budget of with the remaining balance to fund future stormwater projects jody's word all right so that takes care no you didn't go for a vocal oh all in favor aye aye aye any opposed oh i i too okay so good uh so then we have um down on the agenda to general business which we were appointed a project last night in the workshop yeah i gave you that was a handle this is it this well there's a lot of reading here you're gonna boil it down just to give you a little background uh because of the the sign is beautiful because of the digital sign and a couple people's controversy uh there's this fear that every condo and hotel is going to put a digital sign in and they want to regulate it and our sign ordinance doesn't really regulate digital signs you know john so you're probably going to put one in so we can't do it well those are already there i'm going to say i don't know what other things are but they're they're already on the side and a lot digitally so how can we well what they so what you've got in this packet you've got the bell air one the portion of their ordinance and you have tampa's orders which is very detailed and what they're asking and really tonight what you should do is take it and read it and then we'll try to schedule another because it's what they're trying to do is just put some parameters around the the condos and the couple hotels to you know if they want a digital sign then this is the parameter and it can be on from this time to this time or ask you know that type of thing and the current code doesn't address much now so they've been wanting to redo the sign ordinance it's been multiple discussions multiple wasted hours in um city council and so they were thinking they were having this in the workshop last night to come out with what the digital sign language was so they did they approve a sign organization next month with with an exception to having to do an amendment for a digital sign right uh sign ordinance has been back and forth for months a year i mean that long it's been we think we got the product defined and then it's got 10 more things wrong with it so uh and to be honest with you it's it's not bulletproof either you know not me but it's 27 pages so it's a big sign and it doesn't cover anything in here it excludes it doesn't talk about it because it's more our sign ordinance was more for residential like you know we had the stipulation that uh you could put a political sign out i think it was 45 days before the election and yeah steve's trump better hang out yeah they don't want that they don't want the guy i mean john's got a cul-de-sac and i mean he got told about this and he can't put a sign in there that could be seen because he's got landscaping in it but i literally measured from the in back side of the curb rain gutter eight foot and it's up it'll be up under my palm trees you'll never see it the only place i could do it is on the grassy area is that the proposed sign organization no that's the existing one i think that's the first reading the first reading yeah the newer of the new one yeah that's where i would put this real estate song out yeah but it's could only be this size it can't be so no political science no no you can put a political sign out but what they ended up doing the sign is an example whatever kind of sign it is it can't be bigger than four square feet okay so because there was talk to say okay well we could have a 15 square foot sign a three by five political sign and they went back and forth and they agreed to four feet or two two by two it could be one by four two by two eighteen by whatever and and most of those political signs are eighteen by twenty four so they're not even two by two you know is there a limit how many you put your front yard no that's what they should be worried about how long can they stay they can stay until 30 days after the election 25 before no 45 before as an example you can put a sign in your yard today and i'm going to use our elections in march you can put a sign in your yard today if somebody gave you a sign to put out but you have to pick it up 30 days after the election for you can be blocked oh you can put it in you go in today yeah well once this ordinance has passed what's the 45 it should be hopefully we don't have any more changes says if it does then you're starting over again they started getting a discussion last night in the workshop about the digital sign and you know some people still don't like the digital sign so they don't even want to address it but then the mayor said this has to be passed in under the current city city council so that means they're looking for direction from us that they need to read in first reading january council meeting and then approve final approval of february so we've got six weeks to figure out how to give him direction but you know my question to you and i thought about it driving uh back to tampa today is is there who would write this isn't there going to be fred will write it but they just want i guess from the committee is some direction in your thoughts and if if you want us to get some more research on it i'll be glad to get back on what other cities if if other cities even have it i mean if you look at bel airs it's pretty really nothing it's like the campus is going to be more because you know you have the billboards that change and flashing right you know dale mayberry and all yeah there was establishments there i mean there was a lot of discussions you know with this sign you know we don't want flashing signs because it'll give you a seizure we had a person get up and say that so the question is you know my question when when they said that i said at the time but at some point i'll say it so that means we can't have flashing crosswalks flashing uh stop legs stop lies too much time on these things yeah yeah yeah so uh you know i think you know it was just a reason to try to prevent a sign that was already sitting there you know that's all it was you know we started with the birds that we so what's the general feel that we don't want to allow digital signs i mean what was this city hall the feel from the work session was no because city hall has one they feel like we have to have an ordinance for gulf boulevard beller beach hotel as a practical matter the only people that would want would even think about putting up a digital sign would be the three hotels if you were the non-hotels yeah by the way the beach club the nautical watch nautical watches well even though the owners of those places that do more renting than anything else i don't see them spending the money for a digital sign they won't they they won't but but it's better to be i guess this council is saying be yeah proactive and get something in writing that in case that happens yeah because if they wanted a digital sign yeah they could have had it already yeah so one of the council members talked he's getting into all the type of ambient gradient lighting that it has to be and then the speed at which the message can change because at 35 miles an hour it should the the visual should be 15 seconds before it changes and scrolls and so i don't think we need to i mean we can't spell out every purpose i think they're getting to that point of trying to micromanage this thing too damn much and you you know well what i'll do i've given you what the attorney provided them last night okay and i'll pull up a couple of other smaller cities ordinances and see if they have anything with digital signs yeah i don't think tampa is going to apply i think we need to that's what fred gave me yeah maybe even bellar bluffs i mean they don't have they don't have a center board not to that no i don't i'll look and see if they have anything about maybe even largo i mean at least largo has digital signs but but they're not they're not that many but actually mostly they're in the park yeah all right so for under general business we'll know in the minutes that city manager presented the seiden ordinance project we had a discussion around it and uh we'll review what was handed out and get back together here we go thanksgiving to include this from the shows they're already working have to start backwards why didn't we include this on the side we're against that all you have to do is change one word add digital in front of the ordnance standard and digital we'll have to have them separate from the conversation to explain that actually you know anybody who has participated in that could explain it but we're gonna end up with two earnings no no no it'll be an amendment to the ordinances they want to get this on the books before the election right not the digital one they want the the sign ordinance they want no he said he wants this done too i i understand that but not before the election he wants it they want it done before the this consul changes which would mean they'll discuss it in a work session in january and then they'll put first reading second reading in march but the sign ordinance that's existing they they want to so that way it would be done by yeah the march election right but by that time the this this is really nothing that would pertain to the election yeah no yeah it's just just an optic yeah any other business anything else going on in there no i gave you this this is just you know some information kind of gives you all [Applause] i don't want to prolong the meeting but does anybody have any comments about the two-lane turn here off of gulf boulevard i almost got sideswiped i will say because i was in the or the curve that the left-hand lane should stay adhere to correct they tend to wander over all the time so so um in there that would work is hi"
