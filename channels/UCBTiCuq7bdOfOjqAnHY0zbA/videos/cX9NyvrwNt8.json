deletions about the okay did everybody get a chance to peruse the minutes any additions or corrections nope order to accept please discussion of these city cities number 10 right [Music] that was like it beat up reading that but it was so it was extremely thorough of course and i've gotten some feedback from some of the council man i would like before we start to get some comments from the city manager as to directly what the council wanted to pursue in reference to this code you're talking uh and 20. okay okay well i went through and made some comments of my own and then i got your comments and uh some of the things that you picked up on several things there's a couple things i want to talk about so i think that to clarify that i think there needs to be uh some type of time frame when somebody abandons something or they don't keep their boat or slip for you know because they took it out for maintenance well you don't take it out for maintenance for six months you take it out for maintenance for maybe 36 to 90 days but i think there needs to be some kind of time frame put in there because right now it says 30 days but then it talks about you can if it's going to take longer you can send a letter but it doesn't say what that window is because we have one example of that happening now unfortunately because he's out in the country but that slip's been empty probably what 10 months so but he still pays for it but he has a quote so i don't know i wanted to get some feedback on your thoughts on how to handle that even though the person is still paying for the spot the marinas you know and then other people that are on the list see it and say why can't i put my boat in there so he's got a lift here without a boat and then the other thing that i wanted some feedback on was how do you make somebody take their lift when they do leave you know because that's an expense to the city i just wanted to see what your thoughts are on that then in section 3052 says an applicant for a permit for a dock to construct the dock to be determined but i think we need to probably add some words and say replace and or repair because there is a requirement in the landmark conservation code that says uh you have to be a permanent for repair if it's structured so and our code really says replace maintenance of docs and that's under 30 53 dash 7 h it talks about maintenance and preparedness and that shall be issued on the condition that says construction will retain a safety condition that's an area where i think we need to add something that's to the effect that says if the doc is in disrepair it shall be brought into compliance within 30 days of some time frame because that is an issue with people their docs are in disrepair so i think we need to put a window that says do we want to address and improve each of his issues now as we're talking about a little if he wants to highlight well how do you want us to handle that well i'm just going to give you my highlights and then if we've got some discussion we'll have some discussion about it um my memory isn't at home if we don't do it now okay get it done so i'm just picking out you know i haven't got a lot of things but it's a few things that i thought was important okay you're correct 3053 h you mentioned it's in disrepair do we need more definition on the term disrepair whose opinions is making that call i i think i think the mad beach specifications probably got a little more detailed detail and i kind of like what they said i can't understand i'm 30 53 30 53 h h yeah i think both angela and i quoted a lot of stuff from the madeira beach codes and i think they're a lot more specific than just disrepair yeah i would agree that but we need to look at that section to put something in there to get a little more teeth in it to get it repaired so yeah madeira beach had some things maybe that's the learning we could use are we allowed to do verbatim what they put in theirs yeah because i thought that this whole madeira beach thing was a whole lot better than ours very specific just right and i think some of it they have commercial dogs and we know so some some of theirs is not really applicable right bellar beach [Music] now yeah so the area and this has come up recently in section 30-124 number two it talks about motorized vehicles on the beach is a battery powered bicycle so i think that needs some clarity because we've gotten you know these people all of a sudden they're riding these battery-powered bicycles down the beach they're walking on the beach evidently they're we've had several complaints about that so that is one clarification and then the other thing that i talked about was the stuff so those are the things that i thought were important and i'll be glad to answer those questions when we get to all right let's just continue on with your situation and we'll make the round table again because we've got restricted area they restricted an occupation uh who's monitoring that innocent being enforced now well we have no other than the sheriff's water patrol that's all it would end and there was something brought up in the council meeting about mainly the boats that are anchored across the bridge you see a lot of it okay but that's not in our jurisdiction if you go to the top of the bridge and look down the waterway those boats aren't in bellar beach they're in bellar gloves or other areas there's there's one of the europa styles that every now and then seems to get over into our site but they never stay more than a couple of days and then they go back to the other side right so our code is pretty much you know there was some discussion sent um to you patty maybe we did if the at the last concert meeting the console brought up something that was they asked for something asked the city attorney and he sent this out it was madeira beach's code and and i did talk to the vera beach and our code really our restrictions on 72 hours that's what it is in their beach okay but they have to get a permit well in talking to venera beach they don't have any way to go out and get them either they don't have a boat that they can drive out stop somebody uh they basically said it's the sheriff's office or official wi-fi so they may have a code and our code pretty much says the same thing but how do you enforce it it's you know you don't have a vote so where where are our where is our line where basically if you take the top of the bridge that's the very top that's our jurisdiction a lot and like i said if you look on a regular basis there's no boats in our jurisdiction there might be one once in a while like but there's not any they're across the bridge so that has really nothing to do with seeing bellar beach and if bellar gloves wants to do something about it i guess they can but uh you talking about the abandoned ones that are floating yeah i see i don't think it's i guess my feeling is it's not really a problem i don't know what you see but in my mind it's not a problem a marine whoever's in charge of the ocean is that their rule like you can't sit for more than 72 no that's that's just been written in the code like ours says you can't moor unattended boat watercraft of any water into the city for 72 hours or more in a 30-day period it's kind of like i'll use an rv you can't park an rv in your driveway over 24 hours and you can't do it 24 and we'll take it away for 24 and bring it back for 24. you've got to wait i think it's eight days or so so it's not like a coast guard regulation that they can only well if somebody did park their boat out there for longer than 72 hours it would be a problem maybe for some homeowners so you might not want to get rid of it no no i'm not saying get rid of it what i'm saying is the our code already covers it so we don't need to dwell we don't need to change it it already covers it but the question was who who monitors it and that would be the share and i don't know how much monitoring that's done because of the marine patrol and it's no different than what madeira beach told me how do you uh they don't have a boat so they have no way of going out there and enforcing their own rule nor do you but i guess it became a problem then we contacted the chair that then though you know if we saw a problem that was continuous as we come along right but we haven't seen that problem not on this side now there's half a dozen boats over there that are sitting there all the time you know but that's not color at least that's what it was so i this is just an aside to keep in mind i went to a conference recently and they were talking about human trafficking and that's one of the modes that they're using now is to go into nice communities and put these young women on [Music] yeah some of the problems that were in my mind were the proper anchorage if the boat's going to be sitting out there a month and if it's not properly anchored you got a good wind coming up it could go into one of our homes or the knots the other thing is is there anybody monitoring the pump out you know is it full uh is the boat seat worthy closer okay or is the boat insured if it's going to be more in our area and it does break loose so they have a proper insurance if it does break loose the paper or not for any other damage it may do or do they have uh salvage insurance so home sinks and our waterways can be removed you set our problems in the city what does that do that's the coast guard official okay you want to continue on just in general on the docs parts of forms and data there was a section i think i pulled from again man beach on construction repair alterations are racing to conform to provisions of article it's a unlawful to build construct repair raise or alter you see what cap bulkhead growing dock jetty are parked there already any projections or following nations their evidence without conforming and prescribing to the provisions of this article so that sort of takes in your whole maintenance you know don't don't do anything unless you're this may not even be sufficient wording right the wording will give to the attorney okay well and i i think that just kind of covers your whole thing but i think maybe they see even a little more pointed than that and then you get down into the section on removal of residue tools and equipment again i looked at then i thought well maybe when you've got commercial boats and you've got the commercial fishing thing out there like they do in madera beach they probably have more trouble with this than we do but still you get people who are kinking around on their boats they leave stuff laying around on their docks so there you get into debris residue tools and equipment so maybe we want something in there that says don't leave anything laying around or letting it get blown over into the waterways then going on to plans and specifications 30-52 there was a lot in 30-52 and chapter 30 you know that seem to not quite duplicate chapter 94 and i'm wondering if maybe there should be some more consolidation of the wording on that maybe put a little more of the teeth from from 94 into 30 and then just reference to the other section so that somebody might read something in one section but don't don't go to the other section and read the more detail was it but i'm complying with this but you're not complying with that right and then the question i think angela brought up as well about the covered boathouses and i know we don't have any of those here do we and and then in 3053 on construction our wording again this back in maintenance saying we'll be maintained in safe condition at all times a little vague so i pulled the section out of mad beach [Music] basically said that the city manager this designated representative may determine that a care from our dock has become dangerous and without notice thereof should a written notice they'll be given by mail any parties so informed shall have 30 days of wish to remove or repair such structure conform i think well then that's what you were suggesting as well right don't make this kind of rewarding huh yeah because it's not it's not very clear you know the way it's written it sounds more like it's just uh supercharger too casual too i guess i would call it but vague that's a better and then i also thought that the enforcement duties of city manager that i pulled out of med beach was a little more definitive and maybe that was something we could adopt as well and then when you get into division three seawalls bulkheads and retaining walls i thought this would be a decent place to reference that seawall handbook on construction and compliance and maintenance rather than copy the whole thing that was those are my points i think you wrote our final report already it's very second any further discussion specifically from the city manager it's a matter of housekeeping as far as you're concerned yeah you're really cool as well right okay all those in favor opposed um i read this and me as i keep reading and reading and cleaning up some of the languages fine but as i wrote to me it's really a matter of how much an advocate the city wants to be for strip code enforcement because you start talking about strictly enforcing all these codes you're talking dollars big dollars so that's really not our purview the city needs to decide how strict it wants to be and how much it wants to spend on enforcement and when you start talking about enforcement you have to have a real expertise of someone who can go and look at a dock a sea wall and know the proper methods for determining how structurally sounding for instance i just went through the whole process of evaluating and repairing my complete sql we used larson there was a 300 charge for him to come out and give us a detailed report on the status of our sea wall and what repairs should be made or didn't need to be still a 25 000 investment recapping and i didn't replace or face i just did a cap replacement on high backs and the drain application so it's with the number of sea walls in the age of the sea walls we start enforcing those strictly and i really think we should there's going to be a large outbreak of people once they understand they've got to spend at a minimum i want to say 20 000 to i think by high bid on a complete job with like 35 so that's a significant investment but they don't do it and it's allowed to erode then not only create a problem for that piece of property but properties on each side and so again to me yeah we can go by and go through and look at each of these codes but the bigger questions pointed out the council that it's a matter of how much money they want to spend and how strict they want to be and you have the people because you go tell somebody they need to spend twenty to thirty thousand dollars and they're going to want to know that that person is an expert at a recognized authority or an engineer it may be a requirement we look at there be a requirement that um they sit down as lord was pointing out if you're getting ready to sell a piece of property um that it have a report from the certified engineer approved by the city before you sell that property you've got to have it in there if you're on the water the status of your sequel so there's the new person coming in who's got this pension report be safe this has got to be them that may be another issue or an item that we could put in so my thoughts are there the only thing i really found housekeeping wise is on 94 17 [Music] 30-190 d very last sentence or a line that is caused or related to the use of his order did you say 190 or 190 it's 30-191 the last nine indeed there yes i agree we're not in a position to say we're going to enforce or ask the city to enforce or create demands to enforce something like this i don't think it's our jurisdiction to get bored to do that no they're just looking for recommendations they're looking for recommendations uh i will say ruby's comment maybe that's something that we need to do with when they as we get uh lead searches and code compliance on every outset maybe that is something we need to put in our code that says you're going to have to provide something you know some kind of inspection that says that seawall's okay because that's what happened to that house on bay shore we went for a code inspection a solid budget holes of sea wall and he notified the goat people that it was bulging and they needed to probably have an inspection well unfortunately before the household seawall fell in he said that if you have a house inspection isn't that part of it if it's on the water no no we do it as a our code enforcement person to do that but you know if actually i was the one that did the code inspection on that house uh because our coat guy wasn't here that day and i said i'm gonna do it well i saw the sea of balti so i made a note about the code thing but realistically i'm not an engineer it's you know i could have said all that's just because it's volatile it don't mean anything and i assure you that the uh the deputy when we caught it you see that you know he's not gonna probably look at that when he goes out there he's gonna just look at you know is our fence falling down is there he wouldn't caught that but i think that might be a good idea to put something in the code that says upon the sale of house you have to certify that that seawall is if we were buying our house 21 years ago have a look uh because ron knew to ask for that we asked our inspector to look at this to look at the sea wall and he said that it was that it needed to be replaced so we wrote that contingency into our sales contract and the seller paid half of the cost but we had a good seller that doesn't mean that everybody's going to work that way but i think having having something like that it's reassuring to this to the buyer and might actually be an enhancement to our property values right then you can add doctorate households yeah but on the docks truly the issue you don't see until there's a problem is what is the internal health and well-being of the pilots because thereby birds and borers that come in from the soil you don't really know that status until it gets hit by heavy waves in october and you find the entire center of the pole which is widened and even out how do you respect that it's not an iphone you have to know what you're doing to tell that right i would entertain a motion that this committee recommends this addendum be placed somewhere in the code on sale of property that an inspection remained in the dock and seat ball yeah referred to the city attorney yeah require a certified engineer yeah because again you're telling somebody they're going to spend a huge amount of money i think it needs to become some certification right sure yeah yeah surprisingly appropriate people well i would say a certified engineer and and just as a just as an argument at this east we made the city council i think that would be totally in compliance with our strategic plan right it actually enhances the value of the property and the services that the city provides to our to our residents and to our i would buyers that motion a second notion all those in favor or is there any further discussion well i think first we probably should the defense needs to be precisely worded yes i understand get that done and break it back yeah but let's say in motion you do have that written up yes okay when i second that we're asking the city manager to have that written up so we can look at the later meeting with everyone question on emotion all those in favor simple success really covered most of the ones that i had as far as i think i guess i just had some questions again i agree about an engineer on 30-53 midair madeira beach talks about a city manager or designee for that specification of dogs and it just seems to me again that you know if the city manager isn't an engineer somebody with that expertise needs to be looking at the dogs and these walls well i know when i went to build my dock i had to get a permit and it had to be certified and everything else that's all taken care of when you right that's why i said i didn't know if we needed to include the wording engineer it didn't look i didn't spot anything completely succinct when i went through it but the okay because uh again the midair of each one that we were referring to that we were going to adopt said that upon determination by the city manager or you should be an engineer okay so that's how we're accept okay because it is permitted houses we don't have any of those it is 30 days enough time to make the repairs to a seawall or a dog no absolutely not [Music] so the 30 days really shouldn't say they have 30 days to repair it they have a 30 day to get an assessment [Music] right and then there was wording about periodically inspecting the existence and condition of all sea walls bulkheads groins piles pylons it did that just seems like a huge task and i guess speaking to what you had brought up rudy how much money does this city want to spend on people going around it and how often what does periodically mean just when there's a problem or is it not to hear that's usually when it comes up you don't want to create problems well i don't think the city's ever really done except in the last year maybe once the year should be at the end of hurricane season yeah because that's when the problems that occur when the storms come through yeah now we do you know if there's a hurricane of course you know there is a uh even a county has some advantages on the waterways and stuff but um and our only way to see that damage is from the front because we don't have any unless you know we're on like hibiscus or something but like this year uh councilmember gaddis took us out to vote document and uh we can get the sheriff to do that on basis they will do that for us they'll take somebody out we ask them part of the problem with that is their boat and even constant normal gas boat you can't get that close to that seawall so you may not see everything you know because it's a because of the depth of the water in some places our boat has a shallower draft yeah but an example like down here i mean to get a boat out it better be high tide where you're not going anywhere just at the town and you have to be very careful that's common place everywhere around us right [Music] you know verbatim because again it talks about that the city manager's responsibility and you'll periodically do it and i don't see how you can do that with everything else you have to do well it would be somebody else but what is periodically that's the question and there again to ruby's point about how much money do you want to spend on this that's right you know the city doesn't have a problem so we're at the mercy of either the sheriff or a resident of volunteers or the riverboat thanks well how many sea walls are in disrepair right now it's more cosmetic than a seawall crash you know it's uh and some of them we find with you know somebody will call and say hey i've got a they'll think it's a storm water pipe that's leaking and causing the indentation in their backyard well they'll come to find out it's your seawall yeah you know then that happened recently so when we did the thing a couple months ago we had data five because it was 28. and those were things like docs and sea walls but most of it was kind of measured like their cat is it's broken off and there's no metal that is published there's a chip out of the thing for the most part that's what was wrong the sea wall itself you know it didn't appear that there was much damage to any of them it's just some people need to repair their cap and that may be sea walls fine maybe they need to put new tie backs in the report so it's not a i wouldn't say it's a huge problem thank you and when you see a cat that's what they call spalling or the country is breaking off in sections um that's usually a good indication that there's more going on right but what's breaking that cap is the rust of the rebar that's within the concrete and a lot of that is started by the wall itself is starting to shift and that's what's further inspection right and we go so far as to say if that's if you have a cap is breaking apart you're now required by the city to have an inspection time to spend that 300 certified engineer to have that inspection done so you truly know your status and that's that's what we were asking for to put something in the code that made a requirement because you know if you're not a true parson i can't tell you just because your seawall is cracking or you're never doing right that's again that was the reason for me we need to add the language about an engineer and that you won't be the one who's having to get out in the little dandy and go look at all these sea walls well we wouldn't we wouldn't hire an engineer to go and drive around with the sea walls but if we found one if we gave a courtesy notice to that person then if there's something in the code that says we've notified you that you have a problem here okay so now you need to certify to us and your seawall is okay are either of the engineering companies that we have on retainer or are they certified to look at sea walls and dots and things for every certification they're for the most part they're not that type of engineers no most of them are infrastructure what i call infrastructure engineers because they don't do that i mean i will say in pinellas county you either use rude and then there's a guy that works with him john adams i don't i don't know of a bunch of seawall engineers and that's what they focus on uh in pinellas county and where do you did you when you did yours did you go find another engineer to look at it or did you just use room i just choose room yeah from the time you said harrison i think even 22nd he was the consulting engineer right yeah see there's not a lot of those that focus specifically on seawall now these seawall companies if you look at the documents that they bring into us for a permit i'd say 95 of them they aren't anybody else so i'm guessing really not a lot of people do that type of work but i i do feel that you know we tell somebody through a courtesy notice that at some point they need to get a certification now if it's just to me a little cosmetic piece of chunks of concrete maybe uh i don't know i do guess damage well that's a different story i'm talking about when you start seeing metal stuff like that right then i think they need to certify that that seawall is safe and then i guess just really quick the other ones were do we have any concrete block construction sea walls none that i know of because nadev said that if they had concrete cloths and i've never seen anything oh no i know years ago they they did that but i haven't i don't know of any and i haven't seen anything like that for a long time so we don't need to use that in ours and then there's an article for i guess for the beach is that number seven the tents cabanas canopies umbrellas that you can use them we were told you couldn't use them no you can use them in bellar beach but you can't leave them overnight so you can use them we don't have it out so this would get us somehow important we've already discussed that not nothing in particular some picky little things that um that's it okay i also presented a slight uh guideline by one of the city he said councils and that's what we're trying to do with this motion too is the basic seawall inspection points sinkholes slab joints hydrostatic pressure which is the drains i watch mine when when there's a porn rain if you get out by the dock and watch all the water run out that's a good sign you think it's very this overruled and if you see a crack in your cap etc these are the basic inspections it could be could be made but if you write that presented and patty shoots it to us and it emails it we can take i'm well i'll get it he lied to me [Applause] go ahead all right i just like to go back a little bit to section 3063 and here you go back to section 3053 section m i had some experience years ago i had a new document in 2001. according to the codes they used galvanize in some areas they used a ceramic coating and others after seven years they were gone and it was due to a chemical reaction on the wood dock and the wood under structure or main structure of the box and chemical reaction between the galvanized the acid let's see what the seawater and i had to have the whole dock re-screwed probably after seven years after having detected me too so ten cents it's pretty smart to do a little investigation and maybe eliminate the galvanized screws in that second i would agree i am all stainless when i did right now maintaining the cosmos not that much more thank you you're on those three places so you're saying delete hot dead galvanized basically to remove condensate and say aluminum brass problems or stainless steel right those in favor off the record i did the same thing with fine stainless steel screws [Music] [Music] is there anything in particular 94 you wanted us to focus on because this is i remember this one we spent a lot of time on this uh i've got a couple things in my other notes that i'll probably bring into the next one can you shoot an email to each one of us please uh just because really like the sections about you know we went through and did all this detachable things things of that nature we've already went through it uh two years ago uh setbacks none of that i don't that's towards the end of it i don't think you're going to have so what i'll do i'll i've got some notes that i can throw it up but mainly there's a uh things that i wonder there were one code to the other and i want to make sure [Applause] to focus on because yes we spent probably two weeks on this last time and there was a lot of discussion let me send you an email with a couple things that we should focus on for the most part it's not most of this is just cut and dry it's more about your recovery and and we did go so i'll send you an email i mean many things that i will focus on but i wouldn't spend a lot of time after all right any unfinished misses that anyone can think of that they would like to bring out is on this board so last week i mean last time we met we had a discussion about um garbage being left out on the side of the road and i don't know that we ever really came to an agreement about what to do other than you know we would record it and and that's a health and safety issue you know trash and brings varmints and whatever and i was just curious about what we could do to remedy that situation if somebody was leaving town and they didn't have a neighbor to put their trash out and i had a thought is there any way they could bring it here and put it in the bin like if they notified you they were going out of town could they drop it off well they could put it in the dumpster but that's what i mean but i i think we have to discuss the fact that it needs to be put in a trash can i think it needs to be enforced yeah it's got to be in a trash can so it's okay as long as it's in a trash can yeah it's got to be in a trash can with the lid on it which is which is out there the other issue is because of the way our recycling is done uh if if it's recycling material maybe we've got to be more clear about it's got to be in the recycling container but we need to get clarity to that that says okay you can put your trash can out five o'clock the night before the thing you can't look i i thought it was people who were going out of town and weren't coming back for a long period of time so i was talking about well that that's that's who's causing this problem right i just wondered if it was allowed for them to bring it here and drop it off well they they could put in the dumpster but technically they aren't supposed to use they somebody might consider that company which but i don't think we in the case of the one where they just left it on the lawn if i look at that it looks like it's mostly recycling well you know what the recycle guys picked up everything even the five plastic garbage bags with the food scraps in it recycled guys took it all but i guess what i'm saying is they shouldn't just leave it on the ground they should put it in a recycling container maybe that's what we've got to add to the code that says it's got to be in a recyclable because basically what this person did they didn't break anything down they just went out there and threw their empty boxes out on the side of the road in this picture that's what they did and you know if you're recycling it that's fine and handy but you can't just throw it out like that is it just a does something like that actually put it into code right it does it really does or yeah because as an example uh our code says all garbage has to be in a covered container okay now and that's in the code it has to be there because before people would throw out you know their garbage without a lid on it or anything and then it flows down the street now the code doesn't say that you can't put vegetation out in a can without a lid because i mean i'm guilty of that myself i i put it in the trash wouldn't fit the kitchen wouldn't fit in the game yeah but it says the vegetation has to be cut by our contract to four feet and it's supposed to be bundled but our our trash collector doesn't require you to put a string around and bundle it you don't want it they're good about that but the the problem with the situation like this is they basically just took their empty boxes out of the garage and threw them out of the street well they shouldn't be put in some kind of container if you're talking recycling then yes it needs to be in a recycling bin if you look at that too there's five garbage bags there yeah you don't know what's in them but you know what the dogs do the dogs do okay but there again you don't put your garbage on the ground and our code is says that but our code doesn't specifically say you know recycling material has to be in a recycling bin i guess we need to change that to clarify yeah would you like to work something like that in your well let's just add to what the we're we're in the code and i don't remember exactly where it's at you know we'll we just need to change that section of the code that says it's got to be in a container it cannot be left out on the street you're not [Music] okay so what needs to be put in there is your can cannot be put out before x time the day before because this is one of our contracts used to say that the waste management or whoever the provider was would actually come up into your driveway to get your can empty the trash and then bring it back up is that no longer in the contracts they've never done it well they there was a list of people but because how it was out there was the fact that you had to have some kind of debilitating that they would go up to your house and bring your can back okay but over time this list of people got to be people that i don't know how it ended up that and we re-looked at that list and now it's down to about what seven or eight houses that's not many houses anymore because that was that isn't in the contract they just it carried over you know we used to have what we call side door pickup and that was more for people that had you know maybe uh somebody that's 100 years old they just got we have a few of those we have a few of those okay we do but then it got to be people started getting put on the list that just lazy that that's very true and they shouldn't be on that list and we've shrunk that list because we went or the house sold and somebody else moved into it so we did a survey in the city and found out that well these people weren't having up but they were on the list because it was a new home over and he's putting it out the street like everybody else so they got taken off the list but we've still got a couple people that really should be on that list but well i don't want to reinvent everything but no but why don't you just we just need to add where it talks about the can you add this to your email the bullet points that you want yeah we can we can just add that to the same section where it talks about the price you know and then right here uh section 12 we just need to add that the trash cannot be put out until next time the day before the crash and it needs to be brought back to the house then there's an enforcement there that we can say to people your garbage can was left out and you know also at the point about recycling material should be in a container at a point there about the recycling material should be in a container in the recycling bins yeah so that's that's a simple fix but i think we do need to put a time in there i was your point to anyone is about people going out of town and needing to leave their trash out they're going to be gone for a while it seems like to me we could have something set up in the city that they called in the city staff and say i'm leaving they want a one-time pickup at the side of the house or wherever their garbage cans are and we notify waste management that that house or one time needs to go pick up their trash so it's not left on the street overnight or something that's something i need probably would ask have to ask questions if they can do that are either let them well this i think this particular one this is a reoccurring yeah because they they'll come up they'll come on the weekend and put their trash out and go back to tampa for a few more days and come back the next weekend so this isn't something comes one seven states a month no these these folks come back and forth several times wrong you know that's just wrong again we're just talking about one situation yeah but if we put something in there that we can give them a code violation that says first of all if if if that white bag was garbage they've already got a coke violation because they didn't do what the code said in the 12. they didn't have a container with a lid on it but you know that's they've already got a coat foundation you know if it's garbage uh and i don't know if we gave him a courtesy and i don't remember you or did we give him a courtesy notice yeah but we didn't give them a notice to to tell it you got to tell people regardless if it's gone after the fact well people won't read your code but when i know every month the city sends out this email they're recording can their little identity put in there also yeah people that seems to be assuming yeah you just update notification yeah and because people even okay we got this notice and it wasn't there we probably should at least put a courtesy notice on the door that said you had trash in your thing you left it out and you didn't meet the code that says you've got to have a lid on the trash can now we need to add to that code that says it's got to be and then you know we've got this co brochure we update that periodically and maybe what we've got to do is that's going to be part of the email we're going to send out you know it's kind of like the fire department says something to me about not having addresses on your house okay and i think somebody brought that up so now we're going to have to make some kind of effort that says hey and that's going to be a lot of houses because they don't have a number on the front of their house even though they don't say you got to you have to have an address on the front of your house well there's a lot of houses that don't have an address right there's that many of them so we're just going to have to do what we did again after we get through this process we'll take this brochure and rebuild it a little bit like we did last time we mailed that to all the homeowners again to remind them that hey you need to fix your stuff and occasionally we're going to hit some of those maybe one day a month that's all we do is give courtesy notices uh penny so put that in your friends to add recycling and to add a time the can can be out and it must be removed pull back you know maybe it's a five o'clock on let's say 5 p.m the day before and once the can is empty it's got to be brought back to the house or something for that okay unless they're working and they can't get it back till they get home well that's why i'm saying if you put the can out the problem is there's nothing in our code that says what time they you can out to the street and what time it should be retrieved on the day of trash by the end of the day or something i don't know how you do that i was going to say you might want to put some wording in there for um yard waste because a lot of people will do their trim their palm trees and stuff over the weekend and start that's what we do you know do all the work on saturday and pile it up at the edge so but that should be okay right and the facts with the grass clippings right but what i'm talking about more is trash well that's why i'm saying we might need to make a little distinction there so people don't think they've gotta wait until five o'clock on sunday to put the trash to put the yard clippings well that's why i say it's for trash can we're talking about coffee garbage yeah not necessarily anything else it's just garbage that's the issue with and it needs to be the the day of the trash it needs to be retrieved from the front of the house by the end of the day on trash base that's really what it needs to say and then we can say if if this person left the trash can out it's tuesday well the crash is over the day before so then we can say to them why don't everybody on this board come up with a suggestion and we'll discuss it next week in coherence with what the city manager comes up with okay yes i think there's some problem with the landscapers on friday they'll cut trees or prawns off palm trees leave it sit and that'll sit there until monday but the other thought i had maybe once a month to do a sweet the last week of the month any garbage cans left out at four o'clock on friday or recycle bins get picked up and they can find them at city halls [Music] anything else under unfinished business with the board we have any citizens comments we have the inspector here i'm dan doherty i just want to come and introduce myself and i have any questions thank you very much for attending i appreciate that thanks frank becker i'm running for city council from that recycling issue there's a great recycling place right at 28th street indian rocks beach for recyclables there's uh cardboard right across the city wall speech it's actually wasteback in sight where they use these places riding garbage is all another issue i hope you guys keep in mind these landscapers when they do cut down palms and all like that they're limited to one day a week you know if they're doing this so i think the neighbors really get quite upset the citizens here you said you can't bomb branches out in the morning or thursday morning but anyway i've been knocking on the door they probably hit about 400 doors horses or so i'm leaving flyers in that game i'm not littering officers but i just wanted to say hello i think you guys do a great job here i think okay thank you nothing else to come before the board i'll call for the german term i was in favor [Music] all right that was the fourth ambulance"
