    "transcript": "good evening everyone and welcome to the work session for city of bel air beach monday november 16 2020 [Music] council member robynocki here councilmember mark beam councilmember dave gattis councilmember jody shirley here councilmember rita swo vice mayor glenn gunn here mayor joseph manzo city manager len reeves city attorney fred reilly here okay thank you let the record reflect that um mark beam council member beam and vice mayor gunner appearing telephonically this evening i can barely hear glenn going and with regards to hearing um the clerk has asked that we speak directly into the mic like i'm doing now if you're two inches away it's going to work if you're any further we're not going to be able to hear yet and then she can't get the right recording um with that move to item number one which is discussion with forward pinellas in pinellas county on traffic issues we had the pleasure of having two gentlemen here from pinellas county with lanton from forward pinellas and tom washburn from pinellas county gentlemen can you all address us over here at the podium this well good evening everybody thanks for the opportunity to have us here uh we appreciate it uh tom and i work uh hand-in-hand a lot of things i handle more than planning things and tom handles more of the engineering side of how we deal with transportation i think our main objective tonight is to hear from you all and make sure we understand what your issues are and you know mayor we sat down back in february or so with uh with your city manager [Applause] and suggestions that um you know i think are viable and so we'd like to kind of go over some of those again this evening and hear from the council members no i think what we would like to do is then take the input we get tonight go out collect some additional data look at conditions and then come back to you with some recommendations on what we can implement in the near term but with that i'd like to turn it over to tom just to see if he had any quick observations or thoughts good evening uh appreciate the invite tonight it's been a while mayor and uh mr reeves um we did speak back in february there are a couple of things that we have on the horizon you know with the situation how it unfolded there were some things that got put on hold in terms of our data collection um but back in paper we talked about the speed feedback sign out on gulf boulevard in the vicinity of 17th street so what we wanted to do was to collect some traffic volume and speed data we were able to collect that back in early october teams got somewhat back to normal so we've got a worth of traffic data and speed data northbound on north boulevard so we are proceeding with installing a speed feedback sign we do have a work request into our signal shop to do that so that will be facing northbound traffic right in the area of 17 streets and again the idea there was i think the thought on the weekends was traffic was getting a little bit congested northbound due to maybe people not driving the speed limit in fact didn't want to collect some before data just to kind of see because this is a somewhat different application than we've used these for in the past so again you'll see that going up very soon um i also talked with mr reeves here recently about an additional speed feedback sign out on bellar beach causeway and coming down off the bridge similar to what miller bluffs has in the eastbound direction that they use for for speed enforcement and uh so we've got a location picked out it's right across from town hall we've got an existing speed under 35 sign so we'll take and replace that with the speed feedback sign that'll also have the speed on the 35 sign in here the nice thing about these speed feedback signs is it collects data continuously so we'll get continuous feedback on volumes and speeds we download that on a regular basis we can provide that information to you but we also provide it to the sheriff's office allows them to target enforcement if they do notice patterns where there is a speeding problem and then i guess the last thing i'll offer is i did listen to which presentation at your last meeting went back in preparation for this so i understand there was some discussion about bellerin beach and gulf coalheart i think some of the suggestions are feasible so we'll again want to listen to any addition which you have tonight but you know our next steps out there will probably be the collection traffic data turning moving counts specifically and to be able to use that for some modeling to see you know how we expect it will work with some of the changes [Music] if there's any questions or any input or any additional discussion i'll do my best to answer any questions tom to bring everyone up today um it was almost a year ago i guess last february that we all met the city manager myself after speaking with council i think some stuff got pushed out to the public in the wrong way and i don't know how it got that way i'm cleared up tonight and i have a new gentleman here lynn reads this out number one one of the suggestions that had come up was trying to hold the bridge we found out subsequently that that's not possible because it was a federal um federally funded okay glenn reeves made the suggestion of congestion pricing i have not heard anything about congestion pricing certainly not we can't do it on the bridge but is there any other option okay i would like to know if that's an option i had discussed with you um actually going back to meetings again the idea to me it looks like there's excess um land if you will on the bridge that could be meant uh gotten and i think you even agree with me by maybe redoing the lines or doing the uh the paving without sacrificing anything i don't know if it gets us anything that was a question mark but um certainly it was something that was going to be looked into that what you're referring to the speed uh signs this other one's a new one this one coming down i i know where that came from i know law enforcement had said something about them probably passed that on to lynn reeves i've heard the same thing i think it's a good suggestion providing it's not in front of anyone's house i don't want anybody looking after a window at a speed sign all night um but the one on going on called boulevard it was law enforcement's uh speaking to the on-duty sheriff's that and my own example by driving up and actually into the traffic jams around 17th 18th street here is where the traffic would stop miraculously there was this misnomer that it goes all the way up to clearwater i never saw that including easter sunday including sand festival it was here and i think the only thing i could attribute it to and i think what you just mentioned i think people are sightseeing they actually are going too slow in our city in that spot on the weekends on when it's traffic they're backing everything up to the bridge so that's where that sign idea comes from those were the four ideas we had now i don't think we had a chance to get back with council so maybe council has some other ideas people had a lot of opinions on this in the city some people said nothing could be done but maybe so but you know if anybody has ideas this is the time to bring them up to these two gentlemen because it's not going to happen unless it happens through them but i want to just get it see if i can update on my suggestions and then certainly go into everyone else's ideas sure um i'll let whit speak a little bit about the congestion prices that's really not my area of expertise we did look at some the feasibility of tolling the bridge and we followed up with you on that and found out that that wasn't feasible because of the way that was funded back during construction in terms of re-striping on the bridge we do get to a pinch point if we need to maintain the bike lanes so we don't really gain a whole lot by trying to re-strike i think we were looking at two lanes in one direction one lane in the other direction we did do some restriping recently to try to get some more left turn storage as you're approaching gulf boulevard but we do run into a finish point so we run out of space when we get onto the bridge with that striking idea so that really will not help to do the restricting okay the um the sign that you're talking about coming off the bridge that's going to be away from people's property and i don't want someone looking at this out their window i don't think that's right yeah the way these work this will be right across the street where you've got to see speed limit 35 um and those signs remain dark until somebody's approaching and then they they kind of flash the speed at them so they're directional towards the direction of traveling so you know there shouldn't be any and i think it's far enough to the east that it won't shine in anybody's front but we can adjust that if necessary that's about the first place you've got some brass areas you're coming off off the bridge so i think we're clear of any property across adjacent to it did the study the preliminary study that you did on gulf boulevard prove out the information that we had at around 17 18 we would get bottlenecks the speed study was interesting the uh we collected it for seven days so we got a weekend and you know five week days worth of counts there is a time period where the overall the 85th percentile sits around 39 as opposed to at 35 so it's within the range but the median speed is actually down around 30. and when i looked at the data it gets real concentrated not just on the weekends but just about every day you'll see the bulk of the the speeds we separated into five mile per hour increments but between 25 to 34 there's a concentration so there's a noticeable slowdown and when when the off-peak periods for northbound you can see it starts to switch back and speeds a little bit higher so it's it was an interesting uh analysis that we looked at the other thing you had spoken about with us was camera control at this intersection being able to adjust light timing and stuff but i know you put that into place it's kind of hard to tell last year because you know we got hit with this virus we really never got peak season the way we normally experience it what were you finding in the meantime though um well as we discussed our traffic control center operates 24 7. and so we had asked our operators to keep an eye on this intersection in particular especially on the weekends as you get into the afternoon periods and i believe they were making adjustments as necessary when they started to notice some boundaries it does become a point at times where it's just too congested in all directions you know so you can only service so much but i think they've done a good job of monitoring it they continue it's part of their slp now on the weekends and uh you know i think i i give you guys the number but we've got a number directly into our control center it's 464-8926 that'll get you right to the operator who's on call at the time it's [Music] 464-89267 of course right so they're you know if they get a phone call they can actually take a look at whatever the trouble spot is in real time and if they're able to address it from the control center they can do that otherwise they can dispatch a technician almost immediately um council penguin um i was just going to say that you know we've had a lot of complaints about speeders on golf especially at night the motorcycles um i think that slow down at the 17th to 19th is because of those two gigantic houses and i don't think anything's going to change that because they just draw people to slow down and observe i've even seen people stop and take a picture before going um would there be any benefit to lowering the speed limit to 30 because i know farther south it drops down to 30. have we looked into that and thought about that to help with the speeding and and i don't know the speed limit is 30 and people are slowing down to 25 to look it may not be as noticeable but congestion just a thought we've been working with the city of indian rocks beach on a vision for gulf boulevard and that was a big issue there too and one of the recommendations we have for them is work harder to maintain the 30 mile an hour speed with feedback signage with additional enforcement with other measures maybe pavement markings things like that because it is 35 north and south and people don't pay attention to that too much they get they get to the point where they're comfortable and gulf boulevard is a straight road it's really easy to get up to speed to 40 45 if you if you're not delayed by the vehicle in front of you i think from a travel flow standpoint you would move as many cars through the corridor at 30 versus 35 but what you have to be mindful of is if you don't change the design somehow to temper those speeds then you just kind of get in this do loop of enforcement enforcement enforcement so what we like to do when we lower speeds is not just change the speed limit sign but to figure out some way to [Music] to get motorists to react and drive slower it could be through pavement treatments you know sometimes there are speed tables or rumble strips or things like that that are used that send an audible signal that may not be desirable in a community because you can hear that the textured pavement where there's a speed bump um it's not not a speed bump it's a speed table so it's not like you're driving over a parking lot in publix or anything like that those are pretty effective or you can in some instances you can shrink down the lane widths a little bit and that provides that side friction so there's some techniques we can certainly discuss but i think just arbitrarily lowering it from 30 to 30 35 to 30 without some of those design changes you won't have as much effect so indian rocks is 30. they are 30 only through the city of indian rock beach and when you get down to eating shores it's back up to 35. right because if you're going north and you're at 30 then also you said 35 that's just open for hey let me now go 45 to make up time so that's why i was thinking if you're going 30 you just keep going 30 and hopefully i think it would make sense to have consistency um the mayor recognized you okay thanks um i couldn't hear um all the conversations unfortunate this quarantine has got me going nuts but anyway back to the speed limit on bell boulevard uh let's face facts it might be posted 35 but with these six the six other uh miles per hour it's 41. and the big danger is at 41 when people try to pull out of that any of our streets from the car's way up to up the clearwater borderline it's it's dangerous i face fats especially on the weekends or on a busy holiday and uh i don't know what else to do about it you know we asked tom we ask you guys to continue the traffic turning on a red well that's fine it works good but it it doesn't give anybody that lives here a chance to get out in the center lane safely and and kind of barge your way into the traffic going south it's just it's just not safe at all uh i don't know what the answer is i don't know what you can do to help us but as long as clearwater keeps developing uh there's nothing we can do to stop the traffic we've got to figure out a way to make it safe for the citizens even someone walking across unfortunately a lot of the people do not use the crosswalks and that causes another problem so that's enough talking about that one i'm going to go on to the close weight and uh gulp over an intersection going south we have three lanes or a left turn lane and we have two lanes to continue on south the south lane then merges into one but if we took the center lane going south and also made that a turning lane to go to costly we do have a merge area that's about a block a block or two long on after that left turn would it be advisable or safe to take center lane turning left as well as the left turn lane to move traffic to stop the backup i mean there's been a lot of talk on one wanting to eliminate that that center island near the crossway well i tell you if we do that you're going to see traffic back up all the way to 19th street um and again you're not going to be able to get out and get in that center lane to merge south and either our residents fell or shore and be able to get out of their homes or into their homes so i'm sorry i missed out on some of the conversation couldn't hear everything i hope this was helpful thank you joan i would i don't know i just put that back on i'll address the issue of the gaps in traffic that he mentioned you know there's a number of ways to do that not having the right turn on red a certain one the flashing beacons or pedestrian crossing would create a gap as well for people to get out so i think that can be looked at i don't know that you would need any other signal warrants for a new signal but you know anything that you can do to sort of create a little pause in traffic to allow vehicles to exit from their homes i think would be would be the kind of issue you would talk about and that's what those flashing beacons would do for instance i don't know if you want to talk about the south left turn lane over there yeah the southbound left turn is what i was talking about initially um we'll collect some tournament accounts it does seem like it's a feasible alternative at least to look at and to model the trade-off you get when you go to a second uh southbound left turn lane is with the phasing right now you've got four section signal head out there so unless somebody pushes the pedestrian button there's a gap in northbound traffic southbound left turn you can go ahead and go when we go to a dual left turn movement the only time that that movement will be able to go is when they've got the green aero indication but there's a couple different ways we can look at that we can take that center lane and make it an exclusive left so you've got two exclusive lefts we can also take a look at that as a shared through left and just kind of see which one works a little bit better they both have the same impact on phasing so again we'll do the modeling my expectation is that the level of service will still be acceptable and we might actually get a benefit with the timings and be able to accommodate some of the westbound movements a little bit more regular by being able to service the southbound left turns a little bit better and more efficiently aren't you just going to back up the southbound lane if you do that great south balance you only have one now going through if somebody's hung up you know making the left now you've got only one lane passing through yeah that one just says that intersection is it's very difficult to get through when you're heading south trying to get off the beach late in the afternoon when everyone's leaving the beach it's tough to get through that intersection and it really just bottlenecks because we have the crosswalk there and those medians and so you can't you can't stack in the center lane to turn left and you can't get around those cars that are trying to turn left if you're going straight so it's it's a big bottleneck you've got one lane where that crosswalk is and that's where the traffic is bottlenecking it's not so much trying to stacking out because there's those lanes are clearly open and it's just backed up people trying to make a left turn and you can't make a left turn if the light spread can't get out of that intersection so really ideally and i think we keep going back to that crosswalk may need to be moved north or you know that median removed to allow more stacking in the center lane that is an ongoing problem and as well so is it going north because cars back up because the crosswalks lit up someone's trying to walk cars trying to go north they stop there seems to be a lot of accidents right there i think people see the red you know the right on red they turn they slam into the back of someone who's stopped at the crosswalk so it's um it's a it's a problem area it's the crosswalk that that cross wall should be at the light and not at the median half a block down the road and i think that's the biggest it's a it's a flawed location i don't know who who installed those but and i do agree we probably could use additional crosswalks throughout the city we don't have enough a lot of people yeah a lot of people don't walk it and and then i know yesterday i was out and tried it walking in trying to get a car to stop even pushing the button that's ridiculous they don't they don't respect the fact that people are in the process you know so it's it's a problem and i you know i don't know if it's adding some grass medians or doing something to slow traffic uh we have just a lot of traffic issues that are i think the high speed limit i think the wide open road that's that center lane is wide open for turns and people jump in it to pass slower traffic we don't really have a bike lane so to speak so i mean maybe it would be a process of narrowing some of our lanes and opening up a bike like doing some things that will make it more pedestrian friendly and people would be a little more observant because it seems like bellar beach is really the only stretch of golf that feels like a highway to me the rest of the beaches seem a little more pedestrian friendly so i don't know how to go about doing that is that talking to you all or and who funds this you know knows counting have funding for any of this type of thing yeah i can give you a little bit of background on those the rrfp crossings where we've got the islands i think it was probably six seven eight years ago that we studied the entire county section which includes indian rock speech building the city of clearwater we counted pedestrians and bike usage and vehicle usage but those islands were located where there was crossing demands at the time and the idea of that three-lane section is just to put a pedestrian crossing across there without any median refuge didn't really do anything to increase the safety for somebody wanting to cross from the site to the west side or vice versa that location i was chosen was one of them where we actually saw a concentration of pedestrians across and that's kind of what we found as a best practice when we did the study was you know figure out where the pedestrians went across because that's where they're gonna cross and then make that location as safe as possible so that was just that was one of the work they got chosen we went back a couple years after everything was installed and did updates just to see how they were functioning just to see how the demand was and i don't think we had any recommendations for changes in valuer beach in indian rocks beach there were a couple locations that we actually moved there was a couple of the islands that they wanted taken out for the same type of reasons you talked about now those prohibiting some left turn movements so we did make some adjustments and this is something that we continue to go back and forth with and take a look at is it still serving the purpose that it was intended for but the county funded through cooperation with the fdat all those improvements there's no cost to any of the cities other than any of the aesthetic features in the unions the trees and the lighting and the irrigation that was all left to the cities to take care of i'm jody's point um got me thinking about something and i think she's right about crossing the street you wouldn't try and get across it are we going do we have any option right now all of our crosswalks are monitored like i'll call monitor light type crossover you push the button you get a light it's got special features it's you know raised pavement what have you as i look at is you know sixth street has a crosswalk i don't think there's anything between first and sixth i don't think there's anything north of six until you get to this center island i mean if i live you know on first street and i want to cross the street i'm not going to walk up six blocks to cross the street in a crosswalk i'm going to just guard across the road which isn't probably the safest thing can we have crosswalks that are not lit you know if you will with the buttons and all that kind of stuff then we have these paint some crosstalk signs because i think to tony's point they don't yield sometimes when they get the lights but you know the state law still says deal to pedestrian and crosswalk so if you're in a crosswalk you at least have the law on your side i don't know if you'll get the car on your side but um is that possibility or they all have to be these special equipped prospects now there's actually uh warrants if you will for those crossings there has to be a certain minimum hourly demand typically over a course of a day so you know the locations that we have on that theoretically met those warrants at the time in terms of just striking a crosswalk across the road with some signage you know the research shows that doesn't really provide any additional level of safety to just somebody crossing the road if we were to do that what we have to do is make sure that that crossing needs ada standards so we've got to tie ramps in to the sidewalks so there is an additional cost of above and beyond just just painting stripes across know but at a minimum it would be you know a crosswalk with your pedestrian warning signs and probably advanced signs um but like i said the research you know repeatedly shows that that doesn't provide an added load of safety over having nothing here we i think we have something like that on morgan street but it does have the pedestrian crossing lights but you brought up another question for me and that is who is responsible for the ada standards along gulf boulevard right now the sidewalk is maintained by the county so any anything that's deficient is the county's responsibility okay the only reason i ask is we have several of those truncated domes that are completely loose i think i asked the city to pick them up because i run the sidewalk and those things will slip out from underneath you um so there's at least two that i know of that are gone right now and a third one that's loose from causeway north so i don't know how that gets maintained but we've got serious problems with those throughout the city we'll all take care of your work request in your operations okay thank you should i [Music] [Music] first off thanks for coming out spending some time with us and giving us some attention as far as traffic goes uh what i'm seeing is anything that you do now is only for now because we're already well above people many times throughout the week especially during the holiday season and spring break those types of events there's no way to make this go away instead we what i think what we really need is we need a way to to curb it to send the traffic elsewhere another path and i know it's it sounds impossible but clearwater beach already has a really nice bridge and i you know as much as i don't want to see another one i definitely don't want to see their traffic anymore and it sounds like an act of god whenever i'm saying it but the truth is it's not going away their bridge reaches maximum capacity and they come right down here there's people that all they're trying to do is get from somewhere on the main side over to clearwater beach and it's the same thing all the way back and they don't care about our laws they don't care about our speed limits they don't care about our pedestrians they don't care about anything especially they don't care about belair beach so we need to we need to seriously start thinking about what to do about clearwater beach and their traffic because that is the real problem as far as speeding goes that's something that we can actually take care of but what we can't take care of is the volume of traffic everything that we've considered has been it's just been met with with a brick wall there has to be a solution and it's not something we can start planning on in 10 years this needs to start today and i'm hoping that you'll take this message back and um and and start you know getting on the stump for bel air beach because everybody between our traffic light and sand key experiences the same kind of issues and it's not right we're not we're not ranking in the benefit that clearwater beaches is with all the income that they bring in we're basically a no income municipality and i don't know what the solution is but we definitely need help thank you yeah thank you for that i'm i'm well aware of those issues and i certainly sympathize with you you know it'd be a real heavy lift to get a new bridge built but we have tried working with the city of clearwater to look at any number of avenues that would free up additional capacity and flow along that corridor on the memorial causeway bridge and the challenge we have is it's not just the bridge it's the pinch points on either end of that bridge one of which is right outside my office by the courthouse so it's a pretty expensive fix to facilitate that but it is a priority of our board to enhance access to the beach communities it is a priority that the department of transportation and pinellas county recognize what i will do is bring it to the attention of our board and our january meeting and just let them know that i continue to hear from you all and continue to hear the frustration and you know are there some things that we can do a roadblock frankly has not been the willingness of the department of transportation to consider things it has been generally speaking the city of clearwater's unwillingness to consider alternatives that would dramatically change that bridge structure for instance they have the landscaping down the medium and they want to protect that landscaping and that medium so we've suggested a few things about maybe you could have a dedicated lane when peak direction is one way or peak direction the other way and have it converted but you take out that landscape and they've got mangroves on the north side which you can't you can't address those mangroves because there there's no more mitigation in that basin apparently so it's just it's it's a very finite space but we will continue to look at some options and continue to advocate on your behalf for those senator jeff brandes has also suggested your point about congestion pricing that maybe we need to look at all the bridges and look at some means of moderating demand when pete gets to a certain point that is a real challenge when you're talking to all the beach communities that do benefit from tourism so that's a real dialogue and it's and it's going to be a hard one but there are some you know new york city is considering a congestion management program like that our staff has just initiated work with a consultant on a congestion management process which is using updated data we'll be identifying some key hot spots in pinellas county and we'll be looking at sort of a toolbox of solutions for those hot spots so i will make sure that our project manager is aware of this issue and we can direct our consultant to focus some additional energy on that that issue that's all i can say right now is we'll continue to look at it thank you very much first i just want to add something today as well something that i learned at one of mayor's council meetings which you might not be aware of because i don't think they publicize it that much this happened the month before the fire was hit but the intent of that whole visit st pete clearwater promotional activity which they spend millions and millions of dollars on it pretty much maxed out what they figure is all the outside the state people coming in their focus their big focus is going to be on getting people inside the state to come and use the beaches more so to your point it's bad if that and then the buyers hit the next month but it's going to get a lot worse if they get their way so gentlemen we just got a referendum a year passed that said we're supposed to use our strategic plan as a guidance in every decision we make traffic control appears twice in our strategic plan that's how important it is so this city thought it's uh important enough to include it twice in the strategic plan we need to do something about it it does it's absolutely right uh yes and i want to thank you guys for coming as well i have a question and you may not know the answer to it but has clearwater beach or any of the other beach communities considered a water taxi to where you could have parking mods like up there by the clearwater beach um bridge and that way that can handle a lot more of the traffic coming over to the beach areas instead of them traveling via a vehicle i'm glad you asked that because that's when i can say yes we are we actually formed a committee of our board to deal with waterborne transportation and provide guidance about how we will fund it and sustain it there is a clear water water taxi operator today one thing that and i did the study to look at the feasibility of water taxi service here in 2003 as a consultant the one thing we've learned in that time is that the private sector alone cannot sustain that service there needs to be some level of public support to have the frequency and the coverage of water water transportation so that it really does operate as a transportation option for people so that's what our committee is tasked with and the idea would be to make that more like a form of public transportation not necessarily making it publicly operated but where there's like a more a more logical framework to how it operates and how it expands what public dollars can do in terms of either capital or operating one of the issues is that dunedin has negotiated a water taxi service with the same operator in clearwater but dunedin negotiated a i guess they negotiated not as good of a deal because their residents are paying three dollars more per trip than the clearwater residents are paying and so that inconsistency from jurisdiction to jurisdiction is kind of a problem uh belair bluffs has advocated they actually have a commissioner on our on the committee they've advocated for bringing it down to uh the location at the the bait house um and then indian rocks beach wants to have it come down there as well you know that's not going to stop your traffic congestion but it might provide an option for some people and and certainly in clearwater beach i think it has the most potential because a lot of the workers who could not find parking on the island were using that to get to work back when it first started so i would encourage you to um participate in those meetings the next one is going to be december 18th and i think it's at one o'clock in the afternoon i'd be happy to get you the information if you'd like to come if you're interested in our topic yes thank you council common city manager um this is a work session but there aren't several members of the public here council do we have any objection to hearing from the public since we have the representatives that need to hear from everyone any objection there being none does anyone wish to speak i'm going to ask that you do it from your seat this is a rare occasion but we have them up here i think it's going to be inconvenient to have everyone out there so if you can project loud enough and do it from your seat that would be great a couple things [Music] and this happens a lot i've seen motorcycles racing down the center and they also will drag race all three lanes heading toward the nearby's beach in the middle of an eye or during the day so my question is small beacon kind of source nothing some being more that would impede any kind of home okay but just enough to break up that that piece there and meet them [Music] my other thing is um i saw in largo their crosswalk now who would cross west bay drive okay uh they have a meeting going down the center and then crossed off but the key thing here i i noticed was their crossing times were so brightly lit that i mean it actually starved me i was not used to seeing something so brilliant from a crosswalk so i mean can we not look at something like that then my last point is driving down gulf boulevard and i'm going down towards the indian shores okay and i saw multiple people crossing without using the walk now other people stopped we had to stop for traffic for people walking across and i said you know there's there's a crosswalk sign i said there's a button there and the link said i didn't see it so is there any way we can highlight the buttons on these crosswalks so people that aren't familiar with the area are not from this area or visitors see that that there's a button for them to push so they can get across the road safely and i don't agree with just a plain crosswalk without some kind of lighting whatsoever because that is thank you [Music] so anybody coming out of the park if they overran the stop sign coming out of the park that would be possibly an accident it's our way of making at least putting a right turn sign there maybe so no one tries to pass on the right something else to you know what i'm talking about where's that location it's going into the county park oh yeah you come in okay people are crossing there and then you're supposed to just supposed to be a tournament and then there's actually a turn out length you are going right across that roadway there and you're not even paying attention and i just think if somebody is in the bicycling [Music] down the center but that would certainly be a deterrent and and i just worry about introducing additional liability you know that would be the thing but i agree with you you know it's frustrating to watch people speed past you and use that return lane as a passing lane that's not what it's intended for let me give that some thought uh and i'll look into the other issues as well yeah i'll say those two lf turn links we see that activity just about anywhere we've got them you know if you're out on state road 60 they've got you know seven lanes you know three in each direction with a two-way left turn lane we've been working with d.o.t on curley road as you get east of vault 19 they've got a similar three lane section and there's a couple locations there where we're going to put some we call it quick curb but it's some of the plastic curbing diagonal in the turling to kind of break it up a little bit and prevent you know people using it as a passing lane um you know we're trying to figure out the local well we figured out the locations there but you know the trick there is very nice locations where you're not going to prohibit left turns either onto or coming from the side streets so we're working on that right now actively on curley road dot's got some plans in some of their areas where they've got two-way left turn lanes to do the same type of thing it's somewhat of a inexpensive boot fix short of putting in a raised concrete median but it still serves the same purpose in terms of and you can see that quick you mentioned the boat ramp if you go just a little bit farther east of there there's another location that has a right turn drop where we've added some of this quick curve so that when somebody gets into that right turn lane they're sort of forced to make the right turn so they can't jump back in and ask somebody so that's certainly an option if if that's what's going on in the boatland and we can certainly take a look at that through some observations and see what the issues are and uh that uh rov that you mentioned in largo that's kind of the first of its kind here in the county so yeah we were made aware of that and we went out to look at it and you're right it is pretty impressive [Music] anyone else citizens counseling last comments i have a kind of a question what is kind of what's the takeaway of this meeting well i know you're you came to talk to us but i don't want it just to be a discussion and then we leave and there's no follow-up so what is the take away i was just going to invite him back because you got me you beat me too so you got two invites to come back when would you like to come back yeah uh well i think tell them no next february is not good enough yeah yeah i think we need to what we wanted to do was hear what you had to say and uh you've had some good comments and some thoughts here so what we'd like to do is have a plan for data collection and give us a little time to collect the data we need to collect and then we'd be happy to come back to you as soon as we're ready with a game plan for what we think is peaceful what's workable and then let's go from there i see some of the things that you're talking about maybe being incremental in nature like there's some short-term things that we could go probably do and then there may be such as mr gaddis's comment or maybe some longer term strategies that we need to kind of figure out how to message and build a little more of a dialogue but let's start with what we can do and i would say about a couple months maybe come back early part of 2021 january well i don't know how quickly we can get the data collected and i'm always leery of collecting data in november and december but it's a weird year anyway it's a weird time anyway i don't know how soon we're going to be back to normal but we will put our brains together about uh some ideas when uh you're free okay thank you city manager to let you know what a time frame might be that's good yeah i mean just keep in mind i mean obviously you know it's you know i don't know how busy the busy season is going to be but the busy season is coming so anything we're going to test february march april great time to test it so um you know i mean once you get past april it just by itself kind of goes away for another six months and then it you know comes right back right and you know um i just need to say that this the region is growing um so it's not just the tourism there was a million and a half more people moving into hillsborough county there's another 500 000 women in the pasco we're not creating any more beach so as the population grows we're going to continue to face these pressures so i do think we do need to come up with some good long-term solutions here that anticipate what the next 25 years are going to be like thank you for coming mayor the vice mayor had a question sure we have one last question glendon yes thank you very much for coming out to address the council glenn gunn here i did have a question the the city of bel air beach recently uh put it into effect a traffic calming policy and i would like i believe the county also had the traffic calming policy and so my question is is how do all of our concerns and uh requests uh online or or fit in with that policy or whether we go from here does it circumvent some of those those concerns i'll let tom address the county's calling policy but it's not unusual for cities to have those different kind of policies and a lot of times traffic calming is a combination of engineering and enforcement so you know it's your own resources and what you think you can do in your community so they don't conflict necessarily unless you're talking about a state maintained or a county maintained roadway and then there's obviously coordination that needs to happen oh yes that's exactly you know we don't own gulf boulevard so my question is is how does the county or the state traffic calling policies uh uh fit over that and how do we interact with that because you know all of the things you talk about tonight you know changing the reaction to the drivers not just changing the speed limit but changing the the attention of the driver and the physical barriers or even just the visual appearance of a roadway has effects on traffic call me so i'm my question is does the kelly policy i mean when we put in a request i mean does it circumvent some of these issues and uh needs for studies and that sort of thing or how does that work i think it's mainly it's it's a it's a level of coordination it doesn't preclude anything but it just means you have to have a dialogue and a conversation i guess what i would say is our our traffic common policy is specific to residential neighborhoods it's local streets and it's it's dealing with uh speeding and cut through traffic um in residential neighborhoods so our policy as it sits really doesn't apply to roads like gulf war or the causeway so we look for those other engineering measures and we make sure that we've got the data to support whatever changes that we make absolutely and everything that we've done out there has been in coordination with the city of miller beach indian rocks beach um and that's the way we intend to continue so you know we'll collect the data we'll make recommendations but we'll rely on the partnership that we've got for implementation thank you danny i can just barely hear the speakers thank you very much okay we move on to item number two this is to discuss remove restrictions regarding discussion items on the regular council set up this thing's fogging up discuss remove restrictions regarding discussion items on the regular council session agenda by vice mayor gunn the description is experience has shown that council should utilize all opportunities to discuss slash debate relevant issues in a timely manner postponement until work sessions often results in lost momentum lost public awareness and often gets superseded by other issues with that i'll turn it over to vice mayor gunn yes i can just barely hear everybody speaking and uh so i'm going to kind of broadcast in the blind here uh lynn riesel be familiar with that term but i'll just cover what i what i've i've made some notes here i'm hoping everybody got the handout that i provided tonight and it kind of outlined some of the things the uh first of all the neat there's a bad news with that we'd like to optimize the time available the council only meets two times a month right now and the real question is is it really enough to get all the work done we have uh routine business of the city the tactical stuff and that's what we tasked with the city manager and lynn reed and his staff with and then we have this strategic and the uh the procedural stuff that's required by ordinances and resolutions and all the uh the formal business of the city so the question is is really do we have enough time and or is that time being utilized in the best manner that's possible uh some food for thought and b uh other places uh have a best practice of having work sessions just before a council meeting so that all the discussion takes place beforehand it's expressing everybody's mind and you can go right into the uh the formal procedural stuff and and knock that stuff out so uh optimize the time available there's obviously a unique distinction between our regular counsel sessions and our work sessions and i'll come back to that in just a minute there's some anecdotal feedback we're getting hey you know some of this stuff is just too rigid which results in adversarial kind of relationships and uh fostering a frustration and then from the public relations perspective some of the feedback and they were stifling their resident engagement and feedback there so coming back to these unique distinctions between the regular council sessions and work sessions my subjective opinion is that i see a huge difference in the congeniality the collegial uh engagement of everybody between the work sessions and the regular counsel session it just seemed to me that the work sessions are much more collegial seem to get more done much more effectively and move right along and then we get into regular counsel sessions and we get into some heated debates and passionate kind of uh things start to overflow there so my question that i've asked myself and i've been doing uh some thinking of that is what is what's taking place between the two that result in such uh uh uh opposite end of the spectrum reaction and uh getting stuff done there and uh i think a lot of it goes back to this rigidity and uh so the good news is we've got the charter amendments coming down the road and if you look at the existing charter section 2.04 it says we can't change some of that stuff by ordinance and obviously as long as it's not in conflict with the charter then we do have some latitude within that stuff but coming back to the differences between the regular challenges sessions and the work sessions i've done a lot of thinking about it and and in my mind i think the primary difference has to do with the role of presiding officer in these two things it in the work sessions it's much more relaxed there's a there's critical thought and some uh uh logical discussion in some of this stuff whereas when we go into the regular council session that we start the governing by robert's world of order we get pinned down into hey a very formal motion and debate debate kind of thing how long you can speak limited uh discussion uh that sort of thing and what i'm starting to something that starting to come into focus for me is the thing that's been causing the frustration in these regular counseling sessions is the role of the presiding officer and i've done a lot of work and if anybody goes into google the role of the presiding officer what would you do what to come up with is that the presiding officer is there primarily to facilitate and keep the order in a productive fashion there he's not really meant to take sides in the debate or discussion and that's where we're running into the sticky wicket here because our charter the conflict arrives is because the charter says every council member votes and yet when you go in and you look at you google some of the world of presiding officer again he's not there to persuade the vote he's not there to discuss he's not there to try to say who's right or who's wrong he's just to preside over the meeting and the members of the body and i think that's where we've been getting into this conflict here because it's been kind of a fuzzy line of distinction between the two and it's called from frustration rather than just raising the gamble and running the meeting there's been some participation in the debates and the discussion and that sort of thing so that's where i think we need to go back and kind of think about this thing a little bit i'm not saying what's right or what's wrong i'm just kind of i'm getting something into focus here that's saying i think that's the source of our frustration here and once again the good news is that the charter amendment has come down the road and we now have the ability to change some of that and bring it into a little bit uh different order of how we want to conduct business so the second thing is the areas of focus and uh again i go back to this motion debate issue versus intelligent discussion without the formality the emotions that sort of thing again presiding also though the time factor limitations a lot of this stuff uh that removed discussions from our agenda was based on trying to conserve time and now i think we need to start thinking about possibly bringing discussions back into this thing and that's certainly doable because there's a section of robust rules that kind of relaxes those things for small parties and committees and i think that may be a little bit more in line with what we're trying to accomplish here it'll allow for voting by unanimous consent because you assume there's a motion and uh if there is any kind of descent then you can take it to a formal vote again along with our charter section 2.07 roll call votes are only required for ordinances and resolutions so we can go back and kind of start thinking about this whole thing how do we how we want to relax things obviously they're going to think that need to be very very formal when it comes to enacting codes and ordinances and resolutions but what are those areas that we can kind of relax and have some intelligent discussion on and go back and forth and facilitate how business is done and possibly engage our residents right this whole thing about uh of uh alienating our residents to the point where they feel like they're being uh subjected to ridicule or something needs to end because i think we're getting ourselves into a position whereby people don't want to come to council meetings because they're fearing that they're going to be suited out and questioned or or whatever and i think anybody's been to the uh florida league of cities training they talk about the aspect of a uh a virtual sunshine in fact where you create an environment where people don't want to come to a meeting and therefore they're creating a virtual sunshine conflict implementation goes back to this thing now we've got the the charter amendments i think city manager has probably some perspective on what the next steps are to getting those things to the state improvement process or whatever so my question is is what's the timeline for the implementation of these things so that we can be moving forward and kind of building a straw man how we want to facilitate future business and and how we want to turn on and turn off certain aspects of what we want to relax what we don't want to relax how we turn it on how it turns off that sort of thing and that's it draw the boundaries and exceptions to some of this stuff so i'm just trying to provide some proof of thought and a lot of them again it was a subjective opinion and just some some thought and look at some of the stuff i've read online so i'll just open it up to discussion from there first do you want to go first no i mean i i understand where you're coming from because our meetings do seem to go on but my observations and my increased doodling tell me that it's because we do a lot of rambling i'm more of a get to the point say it be done so i think if we started discussing in concise points and not rambling and hearing ourselves talk that would speed up time um as far as you know what you addressed i made notes about the residents coming and them not wanting to come i would say more residents are coming to our meetings since i've been on council than from previous years so i don't see that as a problem yes we should respect our residents and allow them to talk but in the same suit they should also respect us so respect goes both ways and i think robert rules of order helps with that um one thing i must say as far as the residents going i think we can tighten up and fix our order of our meetings and maybe obviously speakers go first like we did tonight but then after that because i know some people might be here to talk about like the marina or this sign instead of you know talking about the law enforcement if we can put some of these hot topics up at the top that way the residents that do come we can get to those points and then when they're done and satisfied then they leave that way we do get maximum resident engagement so i think that's one solution to that um another thing is i guess about the the regular council session versus the work sessions as far as the formality i think it's because in the regular council sessions we have to make decisions there's a sense of finality with the work session we don't make decisions we discuss it so then when we finally get to work or a regular meeting we can make a decision and hopefully not have all that debate there and have it here so i think there has to be a different dichotomy with regular versus work versus formal versus informal so i don't think that's going to change and according to our charter if i'm not mistaken the presiding officer he gets a vote so i think he should be part of the discussion because why are you going to vote if you can't give your opinion um googling is always dangerous in medicine we always say do not contact dr google dr google does not have a medical degree so in this case dr or google doesn't have a uh legislative degree um and i think that's my main points my concise main non-rambling points for now thank you i am going to go next and going to bring you around here to the other side um i agree a lot with what you just said robyn number one it is a two-way street when i see residents showing up with video cameras so they can grandstand and put it out on social media you know that the respect thing isn't working both ways over here um whatever and i've been preaching equality since the beginning so whatever rules we have that and i think glenn glenn said this the other week that as a elected official we're supposed to take a certain amount of uh i'll clean this up garbage okay no no tell me in the charter where it says that it doesn't say that anywhere i'm not taking garbage from anybody and i don't get it back either all right so it the bottom line is whatever we allow residents to do is what we're going to allow for each other it's going to be equal because this is a limited public forum we can make the rules in here fred riley can tell you all about limited public forums i read a 60-page dissertation on one the other day we can make rules as long as we make them equally but yet we don't do that sometimes we allow residents to speak about lawsuits but we don't allow ourselves to speak about it that's a problem that's a big problem um so we need to kind of clean that up in terms of the rigidity of the meetings i i love the the work sessions they are looser and it's for the reason you just said we're discussing stuff here tonight in a council session we have to come to a vote and you have to stand on your boat okay as for the presiding officer vote that was never subject to charter amendment and um absolutely zero uh way that the charter officer that the uh presiding officer in this situation is not going to vote that's in our charter uh and that goes with the mayor's position or whoever is terrorist meeting so that's a non-starter as far as i'm concerned um in terms of relaxing rules we have been given authorization by the uh overwhelmingly by the citizens and thank you that's what the charter committee wanted to relax our rules if necessary when you start putting in discussion in robert's rules of order just discussion only we've done this already folks i'll who's trying to call me remember we talked for an hour and a half on traffic calming one night and i will never forget jody shirley looked at me and she said what do we do we're at the end of discussion and i looked at her i said we can't do anything and she was frustrated and i was frustrated and the citizens were throwing up their hands we spoke for an hour and a half this is the night when we talked this is if it was congress this is the committee if you will and if we get it past the committee and everybody likes what you have to say you get it to the floor and that's where we vote on it in terms of how we take the votes it doesn't matter um i think that you should go on record with your vote i don't think it takes that long for patty to call the role we have seven people but to do it with unanimity that's fine i mean it's not a problem if that's what we decide all i'm going to ask is that whatever rules we make that we codify these rules that we have something that any presiding officer if i'm out or anyone else or the next presiding officer be able to read it and know exactly what is expected we can loosen it up as loose as you want i've spoken to commissioners in other cities who went this fights with each other you could loosen it up all you want the sheriff had to step in that's not what we're about so i'd rather we not loosen it up that much okay i think we have a decent amount of decorum i don't think it has to be more rigid but we're not here to take nonsense and we're not here to give it back okay it's and it doesn't start any discussion off the world when people start that right so that's all i have to say um turn it over to the other side of the room see no comment no i i think that i uh i spoke um at our last meeting and um you know i think this is as good as it gets uh for this council and um i know it's been much much worse at times and um certainly i am not opposed to having two work sessions during the month if that's what it takes to get it done and maybe if we didn't wait so long after a regular council meeting it would still be a hot talk in our brains i i just don't have anything else to say about it to that point i mean there are other cities that have team work sessions i don't agree with having them before our council meetings because our council meetings go on for quite a while and i know it presents problems for at least two or three people here you know i can get here at five o'clock but that does not make it easy for i know two or three individuals on this council and that's a real difficult floor so i don't want to see it starting earlier um but we have to have two of them and if there's ever anything that's so important i mean i can call it as as the mayor i'm allowed to call it on um i can call one on no no with basically limited notice i can call it tonight so if there's a point that somebody really wants and they're dying that it can't wait to the next week let me know during the work during the council session and we'll call a special session i mean i can do it right while we're here and it saves everybody from having to get two or three people together which then you get into sunshine issues and everything else so if it's that important to you we can hold one i mean it's not a problem so anyone else council member bean yes councilmember mark dean yeah i'm sorry i couldn't hear everything but just a comment uh as far as the work sessions i think we've done a great job with this council with all the work sessions and the dialogue and i know there's some cases where it came to a decision and we had to kick it back and i think that's from literally thinking about what the work said what we did at the work session and rethink before we make a vote on anything and i don't mind the dialogue i think it's good we've got seven people up there that you can definitely say everybody's thinking about what's going on and making the best possible decision they can make at the time uh if we have to warm it around another month i know it it takes long and it's unfortunate that the residents can't be in every meeting but on the other hand if they haven't that much interest to complain about something that goes on at the uh council meetings then if he hopes them to come to the work sessions as well or at least call one of us or talk to one of us or email us and ask us questions about what went on so they can get the answers they need i like what we're doing you know i i don't want to slow things down by all means sometimes it is but i think we're doing a good job doing what we're doing right now thank you thank you marv yes i would like to say um first off vice mayor glendon i appreciate all the work that you put into this and your thoughts and your explanation of it great job i also agree with all of that and with councilmember dr aki's comment about stating your point and moving forward i agree with that as well things go into you know for lack of a better word rambling on and on and on and that has nothing to do with what we're supposed to be deciding and we spend hours talking about stuff which we can resolve our entire meetings i feel like as small as this city is and with no none of the big issues that other cities have we should have a city council meeting an hour an hour and a half long in my opinion i've seen city council meetings that go that long and accomplish a heck of a lot so i just wanted to state that during the city council meeting he spent roughly 25 minutes just discussing on wider movement from the agenda when it could have been just left on the agenda and discussed at that point because you spent 25 minutes just discussing on whether to move it or not so i just think that we should stick with agenda items each one of us state our opinion where we stand out on it and go for votes and that's how i feel about oh joey it you want to talk to him like you were going to oh yeah one more comment when you're done okay we're going to jody first and then we'll come around for the second go round robin was up and then you're next okay uh glenn thank you for all your work i appreciate your input um as always you've provided us a lot of information with food for thought things to think about how to make the meetings more efficient um you know i think that there are there are some efficiencies we can get out of this i i agree with uh things rita said and trying to stay on task and get your point across quickly and no need to dwell on conversation um just a quick decision if we all ran our lives like this nothing would get done um you know i and i just go back to uh residents emailing us and that sort of thing i always reply to residents emails and often hear that no one else does so just a a thought is that if you get an email it'd be nice even just to say hey i received your email because that makes it goes a long way with a resident they think that it's falling on deaf ears which is why they come to the meeting upset and maybe griping as uh you know as marv mentioned but i don't think they all come with grievances maybe just with opinions and it's good to hear those opinions that's our job but glenn thank you and it definitely gives me food for thought i think we do need to think about how we preside over the meetings and make it a more friendly environment for our residents and fellow council members and staff back to robin no i agree with jodi completely about we need to make everything more friendly i mean at the end of the day our best interests are for the city whether i agree with you or not my bottom line is i'm i'm giving you my opinion best of what i think is for the city and i expect that that's what your opinion is for um i think in our council our vegans go along because we address a heck of a lot more topics since i've been on council than previous council so i think that we could use some of this to kind of structure it down and i think that in the past if we've had an item on the regular council that is up for discussion like that one and a half hour i mean we take the opportunity to do it even if it's not productive so part of me is kind of confused about this item this seems kind of redundant to me because i think we already do talk discussion items even when there isn't a vote on them so that's it i think it was glenn that was asking the speaker vice mayor vice mayor yeah just one one last point to to consolidate dr google for some of the other members in the room there is if you go in and you look at it i mean there are some very distinctive best practices for presiding officers and i think the point that's being missed here and i'm all for efficiency and i'm not advocating that we have to have more than two meetings per month as much as there are ways to clean up and optimize the time that we are live dancing but what i want to [Music] underscore here is the loan with the presiding officer and i think part of the reason why some of these former council meetings are getting off track and causing such a huge stress level in this thing is because the work session is the place for the mayor to provide his leadership role and his vision of where he wants to take the city the the formal council session is the place where he puts on his presiding officer hat and manages the protocol of the meeting doesn't lecture doesn't try to persuade doesn't try to move the vote or say who's writer who's wrong preside of the meeting and take your vote that's all i'm trying to say is that's the distinction and that's the conundrum here the mayor must provide a vision and a leadership for this city but the place for that is the work session and my subjective opinion is that at the formal counsel session his role and responsibility is as the presiding officer let the body do the debate and make the decision that's that's his role at that point that's all i have thank you other than your citation is there any citation in our charter to that because if you're going to look at the presiding officer's role when you're talking the house of representatives or the senate that's a different thing than what we have going here there is not another council in this county where the presiding officer does not participate unless it's a strong mayor and if you want to go to a strong mayor that's wonderful you can do it when i'm no longer mayor because i'm not interested in it but you're trying to basically advocate that the mayor has no voice that's against our charter that's against the way we run things here and if you're going to do it please start with the next mayor and not with this one because i am not going to go for that no way no way that is not in our charter and that's not what the presiding officer's role is up until last tuesday this the mayor in the city didn't even get a right to bring a motion but the mayor can participate in every discussion and if we're going to let the city manager who's a non-voting member participate in every discussion you're not going to stop the mayor from speaking and i'm not speaking for me i'm speaking for the next mayor and the next mayor and every mayor that's come before me this has never been the rule so i don't know where this is coming from i think i know why it's coming but um i'm not going to get into what reasons it's that's unacceptable that's that's against our charter and that as far as i'm concerned it's a non-starter so um and i think it would be against the charter quite frankly so um one last comment uh yeah robin wanted to speak so we're actually hang on we're on second go around when we look to the other side of the room and then we'll go back for thirds there's no hands now just to address that again i guess i'm confused because again like you said the charter because in that case what you're saying is that every single item that is on the regular should be first on the work session so the mayor has a chance to discuss the options and then when you come to a meeting he doesn't discuss and he just presides so i think that would be counterintuitive and second of all if you just want somebody to preside then you just have to have someone like lynn just say okay next motion do this do that and then let the mayor be a discusser and since we are a council driven on our charter not a strong mayor or strong council where the term is i mean he has an equal vote and it has nothing to do with personalities i mean whoever aimed for me or next i'm just talking in charter i just i don't agree with that i don't agree with that in fact my my observation subjective opinion is that this is a situational recommendation i'm taking a look at the past experience in our meetings and kind of extrapolating from there and some of it is personality driven what i'm trying to do is make a recommendation to facilitate future meetings and i think everybody has a certain leadership style and i think every council has a different uh composition and how it's going to react a bit and i'm i'm purely making an observation and a suggestion that given the present situation i'm just making some recommendations and uh i think we need to start thinking about this anyway because the charter amendment says that in order to take part in the debate you're going to have to pass a gavel and if you look at robert's rules and the guidelines for that is anybody who wants to participate in the debate typically doesn't take the gavel so if you have a body of only seven council members and you want to make a debate and nobody wants to take the gavel where do we go i'll suggest you go back and re re-review the thing that the voters approved a thousand to two hundred last week and it does not say to take part in the debate as when the mayor wants to move something okay i'm looking at the charter now and the way it used to be written is the mayor shall um the mayor shall vote on all matters as a regular member of council that shall not move or second to motion and that was what was just changed okay so now i agree with you if if i decide to make or if not many any presiding officer decides to make a motion the gavel must be passed and we agree with that as charter on the charter committee that we pass the gavel and because it's not fair if you're the motion bringer even though you know it happens that you're the ocean britain that you can't control the um discussion that doesn't mean you can't participate in the discussion um section 2-62 b of the city code addresses this issue so let me read that the presiding officer or other such council member as may be presiding shall not move or second an issue but may enter into debate from the chair subject only to limitations of debate as are opposed by this section on all council members all council members the presiding officers shall not be deprived of any of the rights or privileges of a council member by reason of his acting as the presiding officer that's the current rule that's in the code so if the council now that the charter amendment has been passed if the council wants to further modify the rules in some respect then that's that's something you can do by making a change to the ordinance but those that is the rule as it currently stands if i may make a couple other comments the um one of the things that i think is pretty basic to understand but oftentimes it should be said anyway is that the rules are there to ensure procedural due process and if if the rule says you should do a b and c and you do a and b but don't do c then there's a question as to whether you've given due process so there's there should always be concern about what are the rules and are we following the rules as as they're written in good faith at this point when this was discussed at the city commission or council meeting a couple weeks ago i i thought a question was raised as to whether this was premature to discuss and i at that time i thought it was because you didn't yet know what the uh vote was going to be on the charter amendment now you know what the vote is and you know that if if you as a council want to change the rules which are contained in the code to make them less rigid in some way than you you're able to do that and this is to me the starting point of considering those types of things i'll make one one more comment about the the um [Music] the pres presiding officer is that i i've said in the past that and in my opinion the rules are pretty rigid the the one that you mentioned mayor about the the city council can't discuss prospective or current litigation is i i've had to several times advise the council that that that is your rule and my advice is follow your rule there's a good reason why that rule is enough in actually written is it's so that you you as a council while something is potentially pending is a litigation item you're not here discussing it and running the risk of making a admission against interest in some some way so that that's the policy reason to have the rule and effect the the anomaly that's present in that one is that the citizens can bring that up and there's no rule that prevents them from raising it as an issue and you know as much as i'd like to tell you there shouldn't be anomalies i'm afraid to tell you they're occasionally there are going to be and you have to work through them as best you can and to that point it's more than an anomaly when i had a discussion on this it's a constitutional problem okay you're allowing in a limited public forum citizens to speak and what really concerns me isn't so much current litigation because current litigation you can do in the shade florida makes a um a special uh provision for that you can call a shade meeting if your council wishes to discuss current litigation but prospective litigation florida actually and i'm not going to discuss any cases but florida gives you six months as a council you have to give six months notice on a tort claim and the reason why florida gives you that is so that your council and your attorneys can get together and say should we settle this thing should we get rid of it should we fight it we can't talk about it so do you realize if someone brings a notice of lawsuit you almost guarantee because you can't settle it without going public you're guaranteeing that it's going to to a trial or to a natural lawsuit when you might be able to nip it in the book so that's a bad call i said this before that one i'm going to bring a motion to change that one we either take it all out all the discussion out or we allow anyone to talk about it for the prospective litigation current litigation florida protects the floor doesn't think anything about prospective litigation that's not subject to shade um so we have to be mindful that if you're gonna allow the citizens to come in and start saying stuff in terms of making personal accusations against people on council the council can't answer it you're really denying someone their right of speech and to your point of procedural due process if you take away the presiding officer's uh right to speak in the middle of a term you're going to have a problem i'll leave it at that okay you can do that at the beginning of the turn when you say that okay as presiding officer you're no longer going to be allowed to speak but if you're going to take away that in the middle of the term i think you're going down very dangerous right want to speak can i say something with regards to all these issues we're discussing right now are code related we're about to split up the code um or review board i think that that's the appropriate place and time to discuss it this me this is not going anywhere tonight there's we're getting off track talking about lawsuits and things that aren't necessarily um on track on point to this conversation so my my perspective is it's a code issue something that can be addressed by code review and should be handled with that board i'll respectfully disagree i don't think the code handles our meetings i mean they can they can certainly talk about city ordinances and things um but when it comes to how we should conduct a meeting i think that's council's decision i don't think it's planning boards well i think when you spool up a committee like this you're going to have people on that from the council on that committee and we're reviewing for a code as a code review if it's a code question then those questions or recommendations get brought back to counseling council can make a decision you know it's just they're not doing anything they're not making decisions if it's an issue if we see it as an issue and it's something that needs to be discussed they can discuss it and bring us back recommendation it can be added if you wish yes i only use that as an example and now i regret using that as an example that's why i say a lot of things uh really when it gets down to it but the the starting point is where you where you're at now if you all want to discuss and consider changes to the code then you can do that and if it's too rigid and you want to do things to make it uh less rigid present language and then we'll put it in form and it'll can be debated and go forward that's what should happen if you all want to make make some changes i'm to your point i'm i wasn't advocating undermining the what's in the code now about the presiding officer that i didn't say you did i'm just saying that's not a good idea to my knowledge here and what everyone had to say i i don't think that's what the direction you ought to go i mean it's you have a the presiding officer is a city council member and has the same rights and obligation to debate uh and to give their their opinion on anything that comes before the council that's that's a fundamental point as far as i'm concerned fred i do have a question for you though with in light of the charter amendments they all passed okay procedurally for what past not what we may want to change what counts what do we need to do now to bring our official published charter if i pick up i'm saying this correctly into compliance and anything else any conflicts for example conflicts in the between the ordinances and the charter i think we may have a few now what do we have to do so that we can actually implement that we've been given a mandate so what do we do well the next step i've discussed that with patty and with lynn the next step is when you meet in the first meeting in december there will be a resolution where the council authorizes the clerk to submit the text of the changes to the community code so they can implement them and once that's been done to send it on to the secretary of state which is the procedure that should be followed in talking to patty today she checked on um the certification and it's my understanding that the certification has has now been obtained so up until she got that she couldn't go forward with those steps but she's poised to do so at this time and since based on what the language of the charter the city council should take another step which is what you will do by resolution at the first meeting in december now last question and i um just dropped a note on this just to consider the second phase of our charter we had several charter suggestions and the second one is due on the ballot for march of 2021. i remember last time we had about a three month window that you had to have the questions in in advance and spanish and everything fully approved do you know does anybody know what the window is and it seems to me like december might be the due date stuff i'm just hungry we discussed that today at length two and paddy checked on that the the uh deadline for the ballot language is 12 30 120. so if you do want to go ahead with any amendment charter amendment for the next election you you would have to take action on that pretty quickly i believe correct me if i'm wrong anyone who was on counsel i think it was all the group two and some of the group three items come in i think that's what we all decided that was the recommendation of the charter committee jody's not a yes and i yeah yes one more comment if i get a chance yes go ahead yeah well what i'd like to say is the only opportunities we have to talk about these sorts of things or really in a work session if if i had the opportunity i would love to talk about some of the stuff over beer that's not going to happen because we have some limitations on how we can interact so what i'm trying to get across here is a personal observation and i want to see this council succeed i want to see our mayor succeed he's got a vision he he's got a direction he wants to take us in and i'm trying to give him some feedback on what i think isn't working and how to make things work better the answer and solution isn't always to jump to an ordinance always to jump to a resolution always to jump to a charter amendment it's to listen to some of the feedback take stock and think about it and that's what i'm trying to do here tonight is provide some food for thought for everybody on on how we're doing business what's working and what i don't think is working and maybe how to uh improve the process so that that's all i've got that's my last comment on this thank you very much for your time thank you um fred back to the point though on the charter uh for this everybody i think is in agreement and again somebody speak up if i got this wrong i was under the impression that the second phase of questions are supposed to go on for this next march election 2021 and the third phase supposed to go on final phase is march 2022 the list you know we prioritize these things and the second group is if i'm not mistaken so that is the intention of the council then we we will put that together phase two and we will have to put it in ordinance form and have it to you for the first meeting in december and you'll have to have a second workshop to or a second council special councilman needing to approve it the second time council we can't vote on this but do we have consensus on that that we can get fred doing this i think it's all in the charter committee's report in terms of what the second group is and everything so if there's any confusion we can come back to the report but you don't have a lot of time unfortunately you have to get to the first meeting of december and then it goes automatic but does anybody have a different understanding no comments so like mr riley if you'll go ahead with the group two of the uh of the amendment of the target amendments for consideration and i'll lean heavily on my good friend patty gentry to help can i propose something just because the for our meeting is not until december 7th can we have a special media meeting on november 30th to review uh those charter amendments so we can have a final reading on the seventh and be done for him that's the 30th is the last monday in november is anybody well let me ask mr riley i it's for my standpoint i can call it right now based on that recommendation but does that give you enough time to pull this all together or do you need that little extra time because i mean we could have one on the seventh and we can have one on the i don't know the tenth or something like that too so yeah i just don't know you know it just takes a little while i i just want to pile them on top of each other [Music] but we can't have two back to back we're very close right we're not limited as to how close we can have patty or lynn no right so i don't know if we have a december work session i think we may skip that but if we do have a december work we can have a short one you know this is an easy one the second read is gonna be it passes the first time it should all pass the second time yeah typically well we haven't we haven't had a december work session but uh you know doing a second special meeting we should be able to do that you know if everything's good with the first read on december 7th and there's no issues then we'd just be reading the same thing twice and said we do have to advertise it though the second room so maybe we do it like monday and wednesday or something it may have to be the next week 14th maybe the 7th of the 14th yeah because she has to advertise the second reading it has i don't think there were as many either in the second one i think they're smaller they're not as detailed so as i remember it i i just don't think we had as many but you know it was months ago we did this but i think it was a lot less so that's fine we'll get working on it tomorrow all right thank you um does that conclude this issue so we've got some food for thought appreciate the comments and we'll take it from there and move on to the next item good uh it's 7 40 is everybody okay to go to the next time and the next item is going to be a discussion of the short term rentals i just make a suggestion i know some of the residents are here and it looks like they're here for specific items i don't know if those items are at the bottom can we move it up just for their sake do you guys okay with that i just i'm fine with that i just feel bad that they're here well you're more than welcome to stay too but this way if you decide to go you're not missing out on your issue so we'll move up um number six number six discussion review of city uh city community centers uh sign design concept we'll move that up to uh well move that up to number 2.5 how's that nobody objects okay so item 2.5 discussion and review of city community center sign design concept i know you put this on the agenda for tonight right what i've provided you is three different concepts they can be a letterboard or they can be digital but what i need from the console is some consensus on what you want the sign to look at look like then we will put out to bid that sign with uh the letterboard with an option to make an early crime so you see multiple prices but what i've given you um there's this this side here is more a monument sign they'll all be v-shaped if you look at the second page their show diagram with the v-shapes that was one of the issues that people continue to say they can't read the sign there's there's two versions of the sign basically with letters and digital okay so what i mean from you really is feedback on where you're at with what you feel is the best selection and i have a question for you i mean you know to me there's one and this is i'm not gonna tell you which one but there's one from here that just jumped out at me it was really sharp looking not blah and i'm going oh my god we have any idea what that's going to cost in relation to the other ones do you have any idea price wise price-wise you know because it's nice to say yeah i'm not the real fancy one but you know if that's gonna cost 10 times more the answer is going to be no well the problem is the the designer gave us concepts he he doesn't give us you know we know that putting digital on what existed out here was going to cost us about 20 000 and i would think that if it was digital that 20 000 is still there but it's probably another 15 to 20 for the basic sign because you want it in v-shape but until we pick something we aren't going to have a good grip on the price and that's kind of where it's at right now is it possible to do it i'm going to say that if you look at this one that's eight by 10 versus this one that's 16 by nine and a half right you're probably looking at twice the price i like the one that's 16 bucks but i just want to go with the trash can because i'm sure it's a lot more money why can't we bid two of them you know like to yeah you just look at the area of the sign and then you've got the little feature well the digital portion of the sign on all of them is is if it's digital or letterboarding it's going to be the same right but i'm saying the sign size you're going to have to pay this yes it's going to cost a little more money but you know what i'm trying to get from the console there's three concepts that we went to a designer to ask him to give us uh he actually gave us four but we didn't give you that one because it had an umbrella [Laughter] yes okay the thing that i noticed about the digital signs every one of them is the same sign which means it's a full color matte daddy and i mean well i gave you some other pictures of reddington's digital sign they're they're in a small uh it's it's not it's not the size it's the colors it's the it's having full color digital display board i believe that's where it's really expensive all of a sudden well no that that digital sign that we were going to put on that you could have done this but we were but the price was still the same it was twenty thousand dollars it's just what the console talked about originally was they didn't want all this color they wanted red or light or whatever right i'd like to be recognized thank you the sign company that's what they told us so there's no single color sign available uh this is what he showed us you can you control the colors i get that i get that you see what i'm saying is that you ask for a sign and then you get these you get one that's pretty much a shrunken down version of what you see a football stadium it's full color you can do anything you want with it and i don't i'm wondering if that's what why it's twenty thousand dollars is it does it have to be twenty thousand dollars or could it be something much cheaper and it is uh well it looks like this and and is that's still a full color sign but they just haven't turned the colors on for those words right and so that that's my question is are we i don't think they've given us all the options well when you go out to bid because really what i'm looking for from you right now is the concept i'm not looking for what this is going to be or is it going to be a letterboard all i'm asking you is what do you want sign wise and then we will give the option for them to give us this this would be the base and with an option to do something else that's what that's what we would ask them for in the bid document i want this for the price of this me too what you wanted which one are you showing actually i don't want the digital sign i want this for the price of this i think what dave was pretty much asking is can we get the price options for the black and white screen tv versus the color screen tv kind of like the tone we'll just make it as an option i just want you to pick sun right and that's fine because i mean i i agree this is quite in your face a little too extreme for bellar beach and i think our neighbors would be very upset with this so i mean if we could do an option for a subtle digital sign i'm hoping and we're going to hear from the residents it would be a little bit nicer that's why he gave you this because if it's just black with yellow and it's not blinking so you know it's it's the difference you know i can say to him all we want is uh i would say probably color wise you know a red or something that's at least shows some vision and i i think that's our debt okay glenn wanted to speak i believe and i don't know about mar but we're coming around that way so if anybody on the phone let's go to glenn first and then mark if he wishes to speak go ahead vice mayor yeah i would just like to uh echo dave gaddis's sentiments my my feeling is we've asked for a lock and network came back rather than doing a acquisition by requirements i mean we're just given a handful of pictures rather than starting off with what is it that the city wants what's the minimum maximum size how bright what colors not to be obtrusive what's the field of view that sort of thing and then come back with some some uh options but start with the requirements rather than just going to a contractor and say hey we want a rock and that's i maybe i don't have the full package here but i'm just kind of looking at what i printed out for the town of reddington chores i mean i've got to say that none of that's really appealing to me i would rather sit back and take stock of some of these other things i mean a lot of uh other communities deal with this they can have ordinances about this and we should probably go out and take a look at some of the best practices that benchmark some of this stuff that's all i have so i i guess my question is where is the console with what i've heard so far is this is the basic sign that you have more interest in right but this one's probably financially more so why can't you get us prices for two women yeah basically i i'm with joey i think you know we all well i shouldn't say we all at least two of us or three of us want that real fancy one with a nice top on it it really looks nice it's contemporary our building is still contemporary looking it's its largest building well it's not going to hurt us to go say okay i i want the cost for this with these two options or three if we want to say we want the reader board or we want just black and white or we want color i mean that that's pixels that they would come back to john's point this other one is much larger so if you can shrink that a little bit i mean it's nice that we got these gigantic letters that say community center but you know maybe we can somehow get this nice fancy one that everybody seems to like shrink it down a bit yeah right and so that's what i'm trying to get from the council of consensus on this is the design that i should go back and start i like this look design no i i don't know are we at community center are we city hall what are okay well if digital is the way we're going why can't we just do a little small digital read rather than having a ginormous digital board that have you know that kind of just feeds through information if we're going to have anything digital i'm not in support of digital i don't think we should have anything digital i think we should continue with a small informational board out there this sign could be half the size it is and still have the look so i you know and i think those but you can't take a guy way down the road without you know we gotta get some pricing and how many designs you're gonna have this guy do so i you know and then send his design out to everyone else in town so there's gotta be some respect from that perspective too right yeah yeah that they gave us three that's what we paid for uh you know we can go back and say hey i want you to if this is the concept you have interest in then i'll go back to him and say okay we want to shrink it a little bit do you not want the community center on there do you want the community center does it matter i'm in favor of getting the price on that one um i don't really feel like we needed the word community center on there but we did have it on the other one and some people that you know moving to town has done may not know this is actually the community center building a lot of them don't so i'm leaning more towards leaving it on there i would like this sign shrunk it is pretty big it's gonna yeah he just gave us some concepts so we've got a starter point because i didn't really have a starting point no consensus from the console on you know what you really wanted unless we just replaced the same old same sign we had i think mark wanted to speak and then we'll get a quick polling here and then i just want to be clear joe you said it i'm going to echo it i'm not in favor of digital either i want to see prices for both of them fair prices because unless somebody convinces me otherwise i i liked or to keep that and i guess it's a question ultimately for fred my feeling is probably again equality okay whatever we do at city hall you know we're gonna have a condo or a motel asking us for that same kind of sign outside their front door and i don't know how we're going to say no if we have some big thing like offense or anything shorts but something but we don't have an ordinance that would prevent that right now right right when they see it they may like it no they can do it right now yeah but would just do it as long as they met the county building council member bean uh yes as far as the signs uh i think going with the angle top fits our building uh community center yeah how about just baller beach across there and the logo above it but as far as a digital sign i think there are important things that come up such as hurricanes or flooding or broken water line that could be in red maybe as a warning you know sandbags available etc and that normal messaging would just be black or white or gray and white or whatever you might want to say but i think the option to have the color in there may be important depending on the severity of whatever happens that's all thank you let's go to the citizens that's why we moved this up so i know you're you're in close proximity to this sign um i'm going to ask so it's on the mic so everybody can hear you he'll just come and speak up here at the podium i will say that councilwoman surely does respond when you send her an email and i thank you for that i think it's important for the citizens to hear back i apologize for getting information to you late tonight but um that's all the time i had to put it together um we live across excuse me i don't want to just put your name on there i'm debbie mall this is my husband roger we live at 115 causeway which is across the street here we're on the west side of the pond and we are very much against any form of digital sun going in as are a number of our neighbors so i just wanted to bring that to you all's attention and the information that i emailed all the council members tonight i have the same concerns that you did mayor about if we allow it here then i the hotel all those are going to have digital signs as well but i didn't know can you please speak writing his mind has heard marge say he can't hear you that's not better i usually have a pretty loud voice mike's only picked up from like two inches away so you can get as close i did not realize that we don't have an ordinance banning digital songs so i would encourage the city council to pursue that because i can see that coming um i in the information that i sent you all i i know y'all can read so you probably don't need me to read this all to you but some things that i think we need to consider um are that um the maintenance of it when those things go out they are a blight and so who is going to take care of that sign on the weekends when it goes out on a holiday weekend for instance um who's gonna do that and i'm really even against black and white because who's to say that in a year or two or three we might want to change it to color um we have a lot of windows that face this and we're gonna have that sign blasting into our windows let alone the people across the pond from us and then um the people directly behind the pond so we have enough light here just with this building and all the exterior lighting you have to remember that um parking lights they shine down these signs shine out um so they're not they're not just a blight to us they also uh have effect even on the birds that migrate to our pond here so we need to i think be concerned about that issue as well another huge issue i think is the traffic disturbance the digital signs cause and i know that when i was at the park and um at the park board meeting one of the things that was discussed was you know ways to get information out to residents and that this digital sign would be helpful because people would see it and you know um i think when you were saying you know make it big enough so people can see it well it distracts drivers to the you can't i mean if it's going to attract attention it's going to distract the driver and honestly i live on causeway boulevard the last thing we need on bosweed boulevard is destroy more distraction for our drivers there all the people who live on causeway and who live on these side streets here we all have issues with people not paying attention we are signaling to turn into our drivers or to turn onto our streets i cannot tell you how many times you've almost been rear-ended so to have a sign directly across the street distracting them i think is a huge issue that we should take under consideration the other let's see um i know that we're looking at i think scientists said in reddington shores i really would hate to compare our city to reddington shores um we're not reddington shores so i don't think that's something we really want to emulate there i think we need to think about that as well um i did call um eller plus bel air and indian rock speech and i as you all know they are larger cities than we are they do not have digital signs and um they have many more residents and their residents are far more active in their cities than our residents are and they offer far more activities and so i think we want to communicate to our residents i think this is an old-fashioned way of doing it i think we have far better technology available these days to communicate with our citizens than putting a digital that's pretty much all i have to say thank you for your time you guys i really appreciate all your work that you put into this thank you thank you um roger and then june roger if you just put the name on your name on the record too you know who you are but i'm roger mall i live at 115 causeway boulevard beach so hi everybody uh and lynn i appreciate all the work because you did exactly what what they asked you to do you gave three proposals and i didn't know this was going on or i wouldn't plan on speaking but i want to get right to your point and i actually heard a point about making it quick but my concern is is that what is this board for if we just take a step back and say do we need another taj mahal because quite frankly this place is lit up like the taj mahal for no intense purposes for anybody but somebody's ego because we don't have to impress anybody from any other community we are our own community so putting up big flashy stuff i see no purpose in it what we need is what we had before but something with slackers that very quickly a resident can look at and say okay there's a council meeting tonight or there's committee we don't need to spend ten thousand dollars or more on one of these signs we can just give them the information the old way because we don't have to impress anybody else in any other community and so i would say and then if we put up a bunch of lights i don't know if you've ever seen these in other cities but there were god he really did that and so we're trying to make a positive impression the last thing i want to do is to put a color item there now also if we're doing lights i can just see the environmental committee going why do they have all this to put up that they've got three meetings during the month um you know we're looking at doing something i think emotionally it might feel good to have a fancy-looking sign out there but it serves no purpose for us to defend the community so i would vote against it and so as a matter of fact i think i would back off of the color of the fancy light thing altogether but thanks for your time i appreciate it thank you [Music] june vancouy 7th street beller beach um i'm hearing from one of the residents tonight how they had flooding this week and we're thinking even twenty thousand dollars on a sign we have people having flooding on their streets and we were supposed to be taking care of those issues with valves that's money we could be putting in and fixing our streets i i just i just can't see how we could justify putting twenty thousand dollars out when we have all this other stuff to maintain the other thing too is this city has prided itself on not being in a commercial kind of city to put up a flashing sun when we don't have any kind of commercial businesses within our city i i just think it's a is a waste of time and and i think it would be tacky and and just would not beautify our city anymore yeah i think it would just go against what the city has basically stood on for so many years not trying to commercialize it the other thing too is we keep saying that we want to be a premier city we want to be a quiet city then why do we keep trying to buck what we keep saying we want okay we put in parking meters oh we don't want people to come in from the outside but we put in parking meters inviting people to come in i just i i you know we contradict what we want constantly and i i just don't understand the reasoning behind this i i just it makes no sense whatsoever so now we're going to put in a commercial kind of grade of sign to so outsiders can see it i mean we have the i actually say can say that the cities actually improved their communications as far as putting up announcements on on the website and and and letting people know what's going on i just don't think that twenty thousand dollars is feasible for our city in any kind of shape or form thank you thank you anyone else bring it back to council and then we're going to give you some kind of vote here some so if anybody else has any comments but if not i'm going to even though it's not a formal vote it's a consensus vote will you do i'll say that one more time i know what you want i'm gonna get it for you right now but does anybody have any comments actually i do have a comment and uh unfortunately liam it's not about the shape of the sun okay i know everyone is afraid that we're going to have this big flashy red light and blue reddington shore club that is not what i would ever stand behind if you recall we had a white backlit board with black letters on it you can actually get that in digital the exact same thing same brightness and our staff doesn't have to go out there and change something in the rain and you know we never talk or whenever if something happens on a whim and then or we have an emergency they would not have to do that but i guarantee you there's a there's a solution out there that will give you what you want but still give us digital so that if we need to put in bigger black letters instead of the same size every time with every single message if we have an emergency going on we can certainly make it bigger bolder you know change the shape the font whatever to accommodate to get the message across better so people can see this as they are excuse me as they are getting ready to cross the bridge as far as the old sign is concerned yes the v will help but i struggled to see it and i did use that sign every time i crossed the bridge either direction i always wanted to know something was going on that i hadn't heard about yet so i would not i would recommend not completely shoot down a digital sign until we actually have something to present to you to look at because i i can assure you i will love no one must okay thank you thanks dude just just to clarify he wasn't sending us this he was just giving us examples like okay last week we had a we had a storm that sign was changed remotely it wasn't changed it could be changed i could be in north carolina and change you know because it's a it's that's how it's set up and that's all he was giving us he wasn't giving us this i was just showing you some things if a hurricane came well you can put that up there and i wouldn't even have to be here i could let it let everybody floyd [Music] mainly those are for some kind of traffic but typically they don't they didn't they didn't pull one up last week [Music] they didn't put one in hurricane irma they didn't do it then so you know i i i don't want i want you to not miss what you know you can do with the other as opposed to the other but all i'm asking you for tonight is if i'm going to call the question that we can get some consensus on can i ask just a question because you know like we're looking if you're looking at that sign where it says community set on the bottom or the base of the sign could you not do it smaller because what i'm seeing on these samples we have are enormous digital signs with a lot of information if you have something that's small and narrow like this at the base is that something that's doable i mean is that something i'm sure it is i think you know i know we're getting back i mean we're getting into some details but i mean if we say we want this sign and we want to trump down are we still going to have it looks like he's put a lot of focus on that digital sign and i know you can get a much smaller digital sign that will provide you with the input right a place to put information you need we can i think he can take this concept shrink it down a little bit uh i'm trying to remember what the width of the other one was i want to say maybe if you look at one of those you know one but the smallest one that he had i think was right yeah okay so you know maybe you can shrink it to to get the look anyway maybe shrink it to 12 feet you know it's still it's still going to go in the same spot it's not going to change where it's going you know whatever we put there there's going to have to be some light on it anyway because you can't read it you know after dark if you don't have light on it so there's going to be light on it regardless the previous sign was down lift you know it was uh because it had the little roof on it to look like this uh so what we'll do we'll go back to the company and say hey this is a concept if this is the concept you want then we'll go back to him and say we want to reduce it a little bit and is there an option to put the abcde type sign with some digital reader board at the bottom of it i don't know you know but we can ask him that and to reiterate we don't i'm not finished with the citizen comments now i'm going to take this to a bulb here um the uh this is just to get you going we're not deciding on anything okay so i'm gonna this is a non you know we can't vote tonight we need to go so consensus let's see if we can god's consensus okay patty you told the two individuals on the telephone okay so the first choice is the square side the square side does anybody in the house want the square side anybody on the phone want the square side can you hear that this do you want the square sign no i want the angle okay hang on that's the next vote next comes the angled top side not the one with the fancy blue thing the angle top okay anybody in the house here want the angle top anybody on the phone want the angle top ankle you got one man for the angle top you better clarify what he's the angle top is the one that has it is um the size of it is eight foot wide by twelve feet high okay the angle is a slight angle to the right going upward okay it's not wavy it's a little angle is that the one you want council member beam yes yes okay so he knew what he wanted all right so we got one book which leaves us with the last one that would be the fancy one with the blue wavy top in the house i'm getting nod of heads everybody wants it in the house glen gunn glenn's still with us you lost glenn no are you still there vice mayor phone line's still open baby stepped away okay well we have consensus no i'm sorry i i have a new button on i don't have the full package and i will abstain and go with the consensus okay that's the way to top one the blue top wavy top take all the comments you heard tonight shrink it just lower the letters as joni said make it affordable is should we should we establish a budget should we see what he comes back with and then we might send him back i mean if this comes in at 50 000 we're right back to the drawing board again we'll be and we're not going to send it out to bid i'm going to go back to the designer tell him to shrink it and i'll try to get maybe i'll give it to one to just give me a number it's going to ballpark i mean they have to know what this is okay so you'll get back to us maybe in a month hopefully sooner this could be a follow-up item on one of the excuse me uh going to go ahead and step out and call it a night so i'm sorry i just i can't sit in this chair anymore okay um yeah it's 8 00 15. by the way we're at half time here we got to do half of this does anybody need a break here we've got four more items to go you can take a break at any time but i'm just going to call if anybody wants it now i need it you want to bring it okay 8 15 with 10 minutes good 8 25 8 26 we'll see you back okay as far as i'm concerned yes anybody have a problem with moving the moon up we have bill lusk here he was the author and uh he um did a lot of almost all of the work on that research for us so uh i'd like to move this up if we can move um item uh seven up to um 2.75 any objections there being none it's we're moving that up so item seven uh which is now 2.75 discussion of the marina slick rental rates and i'll go back to libraries you put it on here it's a follow-up for us the presentation that mr loss made to the console some months ago i took it to the park and record they discussed it and recommended the very last page of recommendations i did throw out another option to them but at their last meeting they wanted to stay with this option because i looked at the inflation over the last time the rates were raised it works out the rate last time it was raised was 2006 in the inflation over the 14 years would mean that you would raise the today he would raise the marina rate about a dollar 89 foot okay that's that would be the inflation rate but and i explained that to him uh but they still recommended to stay with the proposal that mr lusk and i discussed and he put it in here so i'm asking the console this is one around and around and around you know where is the console and what do they want to do because if we want to adjust them then i'll we'll have to get a resolution to put on the next meeting to to adjust it before i get count uh right after you've i'm going to ask bill lusk to come up and take a little out of order if we're all right with this and have bill impart us any information or maybe have him up here and then we can ask questions we have you know lynn and bill here and get our any questions answered and we'll give you a consensus tonight hopefully [Music] that's fine i mean as long as you remember all the questions and that's fine okay so i'll open it up then to the floor i had a question i i saw the proposal and it seems okay in terms of you know it's park board has recommended it now we have to go through it and i don't want to do anything i'm going to say this clearly i don't want to do anything to affect the existing slippers they've invested a lot of money in this some have been long term but when i look at this i got 19 slips one of which is not usable we've got three that are occupied by non-residents one by resident which is probably mr lusk and 13 by property owners and the property owners is what jumped out at me what's what's the property owner these people that are full-time residents of the city well the way the resolution and how they were handling patty could probably speak to that better than i because the this the system that was set up uh the resolution says property owners okay whether you're a resident or non-resident if you're a taxpayer you have the opportunity to and this was in 2006-7 time frame so we need to clean that up so it's not just if it's property owners whether you live here or not that's your rate all others is something else and what the suggestion was was as an example was to incrementally raise the rates on the current people over a five-year period but anyone knew that came in after whatever date we established it it would go to the rate that's going to be in existence in five years so as an example if you go down to the very last line on the very last page of the blue sheets a new renter would pay ten dollars a foot if they're a property owner if they're not a property owner they would pay 15 a foot i i guess my question though is i'm confused you have three different people we have residents property owners which tells me maybe you're not here all the time and then of course non-residents you're not a resident at all my concern isn't again i don't want to try out anything that that's the existing people but yeah if we've got a waiting list and i think last time we were talking about 30 40 people on the waiting list my personal opinion is if you're a full-time resident of this city you should get first crack and then the property owner who's maybe here he may not be here at all they may just be a renter they may be renting the thing out and have the boat slip and then last priority should go to the non-resident it's just my personal feeling and not to disturb anyone who's there but as these slips come up it seems to me that we as council can give a priority to our full-time residents i think that the resident might be the renter am i correct in saying that patty everyone else is a property owner right here so that's the only difference you see there that's but i but to your point that's already the case is patty almost always reaches out to residents before there's a resident or a property owner that is on the list they get first dibs and we codified that just to make it up i mean it's a great policy but thank you um but just to give you some tips on this yeah because i don't want somebody to say well patty's making the priority no he's making the problem that council wanted so that's the written policy it is written yesterday that's that's that's my question i am no other issue it looks i mean to me it looks like our current pricing list really benefits those that have the gigantic boats like the 40 foot 35 and a half and actually maybe hurts the ones that have the smaller boats the 19 the 20 foot because of the minimum so i kind of like the idea of changing because right now is the minimum 30 yeah 30 feet so i mean they're paying they have a 20 foot boat they're paying 10 extra feet that they don't really have so i kind of like the idea of slowly decreasing it down to 20 foot which is pretty much an average normal sized boat and i think that would make it fair for the i mean most of the people on here have you know in the 20s so i think you would make it more fair over the long term because you said you don't want to change it for anybody like right now and i agree i mean you don't want to change your mind but i don't want to kick anybody out no don't take anybody out but i think and if you compare all the other cities i mean they're getting the deal so even with the increase of the 25 foot minimum eight dollars versus twelve dollars resident non-resident they would still be getting a deal so i think it's i think it's reasonable so i'm i'm in favor of i like the recommendations yeah what i'm saying is though with this recommendation we go to the the top end rate to 10 15 because that's what it will be over the term for any new person coming in that's their rate whether they're you know if they're property owner slash resident or however we award the resolution because the current resolution when i went back and looked at it uh says property owner correct it doesn't say resident it says property owner whether you're a resident or not you get a break because you're paying taxes that's that's i guess was the theory at the time and the policy was resident or non-resident so they didn't they had a kind of a different policy so going forward this is the suggestion is reduce the minimum to 25 start charging raising in a dollar for everyone in the marina and then any new person coming in they would go to the final rate which is the 10 or 15. you know uh mr lust did a lot of background on this uh some places for non-residents i think it was done even is double it's double the price which you know makes it more reasonable and then people know what that road is up front well here's my feel my feeling on it is i agree we you know the whole point of going through this exercise was really to say we've got a great asset we need to maximize that asset and make sure that we're making money for the city not in favor of reducing the minimum i think that that needs to stay in place it's been there forever should not be reduced it's a fair price and i think we need to look at moving forward for new renters or even a year down the road give notice but here's our right our rate increase that we expect to have in place but um the whole point of going through this exercise is we said over and over we have assets in the city that we're really not utilizing to the best of our ability we're not we're not using that asset and i know that you know it's a benefit if i lived right next door and could walk to my boat in town and not have to get in the car and drive to dunedin that's a huge benefit i think that [Music] we should make sure that we're being good stewards of managing that asset and i don't think it's out of line to have a slight increase i think that there's a lot of benefit to having your vote in the neighborhood i mean to jody's point and it's a very valid one we have to decide as a council benevolence versus financial and and we're charged with both really but we want to be financial we only have 19 18 slips it's not a lot it's not like we have 1800 and we could say well we don't care what you bring theoretically it really behooves us to rent to the biggest boats we can find because it's more revenue you take up a slip either way it's not like we could get two bullet grants out of one slip one slip one boat so really we should be maximizing it but with that said we've had people who've been there for years we want to be fair to them so i guess i'm torn both ways i can see your point going to council to decide whether we raise or lower the minimum maybe the price increases you know we have a consensus on so however council wants to do it it's okay you know what i mean if you just do the basic math i mean if you lower it to 25 instead of 30 you're which then for a resident will do a resident that's 200 what they're paying now is 210. it's not i'm sorry 210. so if you lower it to 25 it's still 210. so that doesn't change it for a resident no but the 25 times 8 i'm talking about yeah that's still two that's two hundred right versus ten so they'll get a ten dollar break so it's about the same versus but if you look at the forty foot that's where it makes a difference but i don't i mean yeah we want everybody who has a 40-foot boat but let's face it some people that live in the city that don't live on the water who happen to afford and have a 20-foot boat are we going to penalize them because they don't have a 40. that's that's and make them pay 10 feet extra so i'm okay with slowly lowering the minimum because either way those 40-foot votes are going to pay it it's whether or not we're going to penalize the 20-foot votes having a marina in bel air beach is is definitely a perk and i think that uh for the little votes i think that this is perfectly reasonable and for the people with bigger boats i think that they're still it's completely reasonable to uh give them a slight increase i'd like to thank his research lots and lots of research and also i'd like to thank parks and rec for looking into this also and reaching a consensus and i'm all for it bill i'm going to thank you personally and on behalf of everyone in the city you did a lot of work and same thing parks and rec ford you've presented it multiple times so thank you your expertise is well and much valued by us i have no problem you know anyone on the phone want to speak council members marvel okay um um we have consensus to move it forward jody if you wish to make a proposal when we bring this to resolution you certainly can make the proposal if bill has any questions but you can certainly make the proposal to change the minimum i mean if there's support for it at the session it could change on the supply bill can you come up here this way that everyone can hear me on the mic uh thanks for everything you guys do those on the phone is this oh there we go uh first of all i'll just address a couple things i'm really curious on how slip number one has become an open slip i don't know how that happened without going through council if anyone needs to hear some scenarios it's become a little less secure because of that that's one um i really provided the research to help you guys and just see what's current it is true that something needs to be done i just think if you're going to do something make it fair and make it something that sticks for a while and that was the purpose behind the research i'll address one of the council members comments on fair i think if you look at something in arrears you can conclude that there are some boats that have been getting an extremely fair deal while others have been penalized so to look forward and not want to reduce the minimum which no other marina has you're not looking back in time and realizing wow these boats have really or however long got a really good deal and they're probably the ones that probably use a little bit more water etc so and i struggle with that personally because i know competitively we're doing pretty good but do we want to chip away and look at longer term and and find more revenue and this discussion originated because of electricity or water and should we just take it equal and split it out by 18. it just didn't make sense so therefore here's your research i appreciate y'all looking at it you know i don't know if you realize that some of the discussion you have 76 of your slips have a lift and what's always missing outside of now what you have is competitive research on rates whether it's a smaller boat or larger you now have data is it those slip renters pay for those slips that in itself when you do the math whether it's fifteen thousand eighteen twenty thousand dollars now in today's money that's a large expense to that individual that enhances that property when you're going by now for the individual it's a choice it's a luxury it's something you decide on when you get that opportunity to get a slip but it's a big expense and that in your discussions and decisions you should always incorporate that piece it seems to be left out a lot and nowhere else do they force the slip renter to buy the lift and then remove it it's really important as you look at that nowhere else other minimums i'll just close with this we talk so much about strategy and strategic plans and it's unfortunate or fortunate that we go through this exercise but every time we do we forget the discussion around a strategic plan for the marina so we're just messing around rates what's competitive spared a minimum who's not we're pushing the rock down the road on them what do we want that property to be it very well may be that someday you would prefer nothing but 35 foot and above now all the slips wouldn't be able to maintain that but that's where the strategy comes in first before you start looking at the research and i just at some point it would be nice maybe even the park board can take that up on what is the long-term strategy and then you get to the rates but we kind of you push this one down the road there's your research i appreciate y'all reviewing it is there anything i can answer do you know why slip one is not rentable and that's a couple thousand yeah i believe there's an output of lynn can you help him yeah there's a thing excuse me they took it out of the service penny yeah and the console had a discussion about that some time ago about opening that end up so the residents if they want to put a kayak in there or whatever so since it's not used for a boat rental that's that's what we did and i think it's it's not quite as wide enough for a boat so it's it's such a slip if you will and i i believe you were involved in that mayor when we had talked about that uh we've now gated off the entire marina there was a time when you could walk the dock and you know kind of enjoy the marina now you can no longer do that it's locked off to any other resident if you don't have a boat there since this slip is out that one is at the end can we open the gate and now people can put their paddleboard in or their or their um kayaks or whatever and the thought was they could launch him i think you kind of suggested it but i don't know can we actually open it or we oh it is open it's open that's good maybe we should i didn't know about that i don't remember that and i mean with 7th street with the 7th street dock being you know under construction now and that whole thing will be under construction for six months that's a nice thing to know that we have that option so it's been open i don't know okay you know i'll share a couple thoughts on that um i like the idea of the the it being open but as someone who's down there a lot i'll tell you just a couple scenarios i've never seen a resident go down there and launch anything since it's been open but what has happened is you're seeing a lot of pickup trucks come in and they're outside the city launching dropping in and then they're using the dock right next to one of the most expensive boats down there holding onto the dock getting up on the dock tying up on the dock at times that gives them access into the marina now that they're in the water uh last week was really interesting we had five days of one of the you know these guys are doing their job building the docks and the pilings they decided slip number one was gonna be their spot for five days i personally didn't say anything and i'm sure the city was aware of it or not but when the storm started to come through i got a hold of the owner and said get it out of there you have a wench on there that or whatever that's called it's 30 feet high and you've got 70 mile an hour wind so again having it open that way i've seen more non-residential situations impede security and safety etc then i have seen a resident but that that might be advertising that might be just how it has been since you opened it anything else does that help man it helps tremendously i mean again we have a item coming up here about additional police enforcement um you know i've seen it on the seventh street dock where people come down they don't have a sticker on the car and i think mr reeves even caught a few people a few times and it's like if we're gonna leave slip one open then it's it's not resident or not and it's just like our parks and that's okay i mean i'm just i'm just sharing a couple stories you're not allowed to park in and well i guess you could work in the marina and launch directly so unless i said anything though that could have been a damaging situation with the storm they were going to leave it there they were tying it down i told them to remove it um anything else i have a question because some reason i just haven't looked at that one particular spot i guess because it's way off in the corner but uh is that something we maybe if we think that it's a problem just allowing anybody to you know hang out thanks to this nice boat maybe we should consider uh maybe a place for a floating jet ski you know something like that maybe we could rent that slip it's i mean it's more income if it's if we don't want people there we could certainly reserve that one spot and that's a little more income well the main thing is it's an outfall that that's yeah so that that is beneficial to leave that and it's a small it's time remember i know patty and i talked about it yeah i don't remember the footage but it is small and i think it kind of angles yeah sure yeah and the other problem we had there a lot of times was that dan's island they would do a lot of different things there and we had issues with them i know that over the years i don't know bill you probably know more about it no it's interesting uh i remember a boat in there for a while there was several years ago but you know i don't know how long at least five right at least five if not more probably seven i would just encourage you to look at that slip in the long term on just and i don't know what that would take when some type of fence that went all the way down right now it's sticking out three to four feet yeah we're trying to prevent someone from climbing over it exactly so what's happening is they're they're getting in but then they're using the dock they're tying up on the dock they get out they go get their car backing it up so it's giving them access to that slip number two well we can look and put events along whatever you think so anyways that's slip number one i've got a comment okay okay go ahead vice mayor yeah i would say that you know long ago we identified that brain as a valuable asset a value one of the few assets we have here and we put a lot of thought in and i called it trying to put all that stuff on the back burner to see what was going to happen it may be time to revisit a lot of those those things now one of the original thoughts was to take that flip number one and even maybe two or three and build a fuel dock there and try to bring the business into that area now you're gonna get pushed back obviously from the people who have slips there but i mean that's one of those things we need to look at i always think about the litmus test which would be if clearwater beach own that property i guarantee you it would not look the way it does six months from now and and the other aspect is we've revisited this lift thing and how many other places can you take a boat in and say i want to put a lift in my slip because i don't want my boat in the water well builder beach allows you to do that and yeah at your own expense that doesn't mean that the next person who lets that slip may want to lift so take it with you that's all i have thank you well piggybacking off of that because i had lift on here and i'm kind of a little bit different than glenn on this because to me i feel like a lift is could be an asset like the next person may want to rent it because there is a lift there so i i would say is if okay let's say bill decides to leave and he has lift and maybe you have a waiting list if that next person would want to lift then why did he have to remove it just so the next person has to rebuild it that just seems like so wasteful so it should be some kind of well that's not true for it so i mean just take over whatever contract and then the next person would remove the lift or whatever if there's no person i would see the lift as an asset i think if you have a nice boat you don't want it in the water so i agree and if you want to provide that luxury you charge a premium board because somebody's got to maintain it and replace it when it it runs out of useful life well i think that's part of the you roll it over into the next one saying hey if in five years this lift that was here that you took ownership of breaks your your costs to do it so it takes it off of the city but it's not an automatic okay bill's leaving so take your lift with you because that seems wasteful where it could be an asset to hey you want to rent this slip here and you have a 30 foot boat as opposed to a 20 here we go here's a slip do you take responsibility for any repairs i have a really good example for that that's a great question first of all i don't think the city should ever take on maintenance and lifts and getting the lift business no way but here's a really cool one that happened recently and i think it's just a phone call type of thing because that slip renter knows they're responsible for removal it's in the paper you just always start there you know it you bought it you remove it leave it the way you enter but the one next to me recently was interesting because this very similar size boat came in or is coming in and the gentleman who was there was calling me from michigan bill you guys are coming down can you help me make sure that it gets taken apart i've got to get it done by the end of the month he was trying to get it removed so he didn't get another month's slip rental fee he ended up giving it away and someone took it they put it in their home and clara water someone he knew a couple weeks later the new slept runner's down there looking at the spot thinking what am i going to do for left it was a very similar boat so at that point you're also limiting what size boat can get in those slits right because both those lips are rated at 10 000 pounds really the question would be a phone call would have sell that but i don't know if that fits with how things work so i don't want to be recommending that i just feel as if in that scenario of you already had the slip renter hey there is this type of slip with a lift would you like to look at it before that guy removes it that that might be an interesting scenario but the city should never get married patty said they have had people that's taken over somebody else sure sure it's less wasteful i mean that just makes sense if the next person wants it the vote is appropriate then you could strike a deal with the existing owner yeah and the city doesn't have to they don't want to be in the middle yeah i know you just say hey this is make you work you can give them the telephone number right i think that's after that just statistically you have 28 of your boats that are below 25 feet so i'll go back to that piece as well everyone knows the number one selling boat is 22 to 26. you got 9 out of 18 that are over 30 feet which is interesting and then you can look at the number of lifts uh 13 out of 18 so that means five are without lifts which are your bigger boats so there's and that's a tough one as a slip renter to go you know that's my fellow voter that's why i've always said well things are pretty good down there why are we doing anything but if you look at the long term just do it right and get it set and we'll keep an eye on it for you so is there anything else let me open it up to this floor if anybody has a question i'm gonna again we'll dispense with the protocol speak right from there because bill is up here i don't want anybody too close questions yes directly so the 21-26 [Music] sized boats my question should be to you or the patty or lynn that in slip what typically what was the typical size that used to be housing [Music] he was there for a while he lives across the street that was a 22 to 23 foot vote okay so was it 22 23 what now did he have a problem [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] but i don't know where the alcohol's position is it's traveled [Music] thank you residents of bellar beach have gone next door said they were looking for for a slipped rent and they have that smaller vote so i don't understand where we're losing this revenue and why this is this this revenue basis it sounds to me first of all june good point don't have all the data but it sounds to me it might just be a piece of research going why exactly do we stop doing that and if it's something i do think that if it was on a lift the out outfall or whatever you call it wouldn't impact it the way it would if it was a boat that was a wet slip but i don't know i don't know why i stopped can we get that as a follow-up item for just the follow-up items on the council i'm just trying to move this one along here and yes mayor yes vice mayor had a comment sure from the citizens first and it's always been because a resident or a property owner because there's always a new developments they could only stay there if a resident or winner didn't want but if the property owner had a new vote that came in he was given six months to find a new place so if we have all these non-residents that are ready i'm i'm curious why we don't take care of the you know citizens and give them six months is the contract structured when is it perpetual or is it yearly how does it work no they there it's perpetual but there's a list and paddy was responsible for the list and she would go down the list and say you got a vote we've got to slip open do you want it okay you went down through the residence property owners whatever you want to say and at that point if none of them wanted it then you went to the top person on the non-president list and that's at times i think from what i understand probably at times there were a lot of non-residents in there because the residents didn't take them there's people that put their name on the list that don't have a boat even i think what he's asking is if we have like however many non-residents right now and there's a waiting list of six residents why are we letting well you wouldn't kick them out i guess that's right almost all of them well six months and they're gone because a lot of a lot of you know i mean like currently yeah well i think we would have to do that going forward if we did it i don't think you can go back well i don't know if you can go back and tell somebody you've got to get out tomorrow if their contract says you can't reach the contract i mean you can't reach an existing contract like your city attorney will tell you that but after the contract's over that's a different story there's no length of tone on the contract yeah it's uh a little while ago there was a lot of information that was put out by the planning committee about things we could do other options with boats and stuff other areas that can be developed we've got a waiting list and you know the virus hit and we weren't able to address some of this stuff those are still very important suggestions and i think this council not tonight but we need to take a look at this because to jody's point we're supposed to be maximizing revenue we've got boat slips that are going unused we've got a piece of property that's going unused and there was a proposal for how we can put big boats in that piece of property i mean this is stuff that the council really should take a look at and um you know and i think if nothing else to mr walt's point we're helping the residents you know residents should get the top priority as far as i'm concerned i'm not in favor of tossing anybody out immediately particularly if you've invested thousands and tens of thousands on a boat lift but as these things come up or you know if we want to accelerate it that that land was given to the residents if you read that plaque that's in that marina the man who donated that land gave it to the residents to so the residents would enjoy it so i'll go back to that plaque that was the intent just going forward i mean i agree with all those other options about the planning committee but i think we should focus on maybe this one let's get started [Music] yes okay and we still have build up here so any questions for bill then you can sit down and then we'll does anybody else have any questions for bill vice mayor no i just wanted to make one last comment on this let me just thank you thanks thank you so much bill for all the work and research advice thank it seems to be a languishing issue along with the list that the marina is not a 501 c 3 operation the overarching question is what serves the city and the residents in general best okay that's that's the overarching principle yeah we'll take into account the data points and the best wishes of the people who've been there for a while but at the end of the day this is not a non-profit operation what's best for the city and the rest of the residents that's it thanks so listen thank you mark you see good morning council member beam the line's open but he's not there just forward then nobody else has any other comments so i think there's a lot of points that need to be followed up on here and i think that was just well said um you know this is supposed to be for the residents and that's what that plaque says so i think we as a council can focus on this but to get this out of the committee because bill lusk is right i spoke to him on the break this has been going i think since um i don't even remember it's been a long time i think six years yeah so to move this out of the committee we have a proposal right now to change the rates we're not voting on it tonight it's just to get it to a a resolution jody to your point before i don't know if i got a chance to complete it but if you want to change the minimums or you know right now i think has reduction as it's written but if you want to change that that's something that can be changed on the fly at the next meeting so you just make a proposed amendment but to move this out of the committee tonight can we get a consensus my proposal would be to listen to what len proposed and that is that we keep the minimum in place and over the next two years have a inflationary rates we have a base that we're rate the rating that we're increasing these rates on and he says an inflationary rate should be a dollar 89 over a period of time not all at once but that it would happen over a period of time so i think that we you know that we consider something along those lines um it seems that everything i buy has an inflationary increase and every lease i sign has an inflationary increase in it and i think that that's a good tangible measure that we can keep moving forward on now how we you know what how we apply that we might want to you know take a look at that but i think that we keep the minimum at 30 feet we keep you know the rates where they are through the term of the lease for each slip rental and then moving forward you know maybe we cut that to a dollar fifty we do a 75 cents a foot increase on the this renewal and on the next renewal and any new renters will pay the full the full price so it's kind of a compromise bill yeah could you just send it to a mic so everybody will be able to hear it or you can use the mic over here if you want to yeah that's fine absolutely uh i mean i'm not sure where that strategy is coming from it kind of defeats it's not looking at it that concept is not looking at anything i would encourage everyone to kind of look around at their own household i can't name anything myself that i pay that i sign up for and i put it in the vendor's hands that the rate will go up accordingly based on inflation i i just i'm struggling with that in general i mean is there anyone that can cite an example of something in their life that it's based on inflation other than going to the grocery store the minimum you're still not addressing we're just kind of brushing across that you're you're not looking at and if you're if you are i would like to see some type of strategy to the marina if and this is just my recommendation you were going to keep the minimum there has to be a strategic plan tied to it because it's been going on for a long time and not one person is able to answer why we have one and no one else does so i'm just in disagreement with that that's all so minimums i don't understand why that's a big deal and to address and then i don't understand the inflation one nobody wants to rent anything having an unknown thank you i think every commercial lease i have has a an inflationary increase in it and i don't look at this any different than elites that's what they are they're leases renting a piece of property from the city of bel air beach i'm sorry because the the the city management suggestion that we were looking at that we've been talking about was the one that came i guess out of the um committee right and that was the one that's on the last page so are you saying to deviate from that i just want to make sure he gave us two options when we first opened this up the first was the last page and the second was his inflationary number that because we've had no increases in how long when 14 years 14 years no increases so that one we don't have in our book you just added that one okay all right i just want to make sure i've got the two all right so you know what sounds like this doesn't doesn't figure in inflationary costs into their business i mean just the holding costs and the escalating maintenance costs i mean the city is finally getting smart about backing that stuff in looking long-term down the road for its uh capital improvement and budgetary stuff and are are you kidding me back again no inflation cost into your business cost that makes no sense whatsoever well to me this this plan from the the review committee is i think more simplified than me and i think if you get into the like he said the unknowns 75 cents 78 cents maybe next year who knows what happens with the economy now it's 85 i mean or dollars or whatever i think that gets confusing so this is more of a structured renters know what's going to happen two years from now four years from now moving forward new renters know exactly what their rate is obviously this can be changed in five ten years if we need to up it or whatever so i mean to me this is just more finite more structured makes sense and honestly the people that have the 40 foot boats are still getting an amazing deal compared to other nearby marina so i don't think they would be i mean i can understand if we're making it like those people with the 35 40-foot boats it's gonna be so ridiculously expensive that there's no reason why they would stay and now they're gonna go to dunedin because they're not residents anyway they don't matter then i would say okay this doesn't make sense but they're still getting a good deal better than dunedin so i like this this plan here on the last page so we have two plans before us we have the plan that's on the last page which i'll call the plan on the last page and then we have the inflationary plan that was proposed by lynn which is to just by a cost of living okay so so that and i don't know if we're going to get consensus tonight we might just move this bolt to the floor and see what happens that night but um let's take it around the room it's not a boat but with fred rod well i just wanted to make a clarification i'm looking at the agreement and you have 15 days with or without cause from either party so you have the ability to modify the lease anytime basically any time you want and terminate if you wish which will make the lease if you want to know okay so if it's okay with everyone if everyone's got their comments in does anybody have any more comments because okay let's see where we stand as a council so um i'll just take it from jody we have uh i'll call it the inflationary plan or the pay the last page plan where we're going to say inflationary plan i'm sorry the bail plan that's the last page plan right okay i'm gonna go with the last page plan also robin last page plan last page plan um glenn i'll go with the inflationary and more councilmember beam it's not there it's still open but he's not there all right we've got three to two it's not an overwhelming consensus i don't know whether we push them both to the meeting and and you know when we have full counsel i'm just going to make a suggestion go let's go forward with raising the fee a dollar in the next you know maybe we notify him six months from now or something last plan okay let's let's raise it a dollar and then we can look further down the road but 14 years is a long time not to raise the rates so my my feeling is just leave it how it is right now and just raise it a dollar and then if we need to do more studies we can do that it will simplify it so you're proposing keep everything in place as it is and just raise everyone's rate of dollar across the board i don't think that ignoring everything that the committee said and everything else i mean well if you want to lower the minimum to 25 that's that's fine but i'm just talking for now just raise it a dollar and that's what the committee let's do this okay because we can go on all night this is i remember this phrase from the florida league cities managing botox and that's what we're doing here and we really are managing them tonight let's we have a three to two consensus it's not overwhelming we're missing two people right now this could easily change i'm going to say you have the consensus it's three to two bring it to the uh to the floor bring it with alternatives but it's okay to have alternatives on a resolution right as long as we advertise the alternatives correct yes okay so put the alternatives out there no alternatives on the fly though okay they have to be presented beforehand and we'll vote on it when we have we'll we've got to get four votes one way or the other if it's going to pass if not go back to the drawing board and bill lusk is going to kill us i have a question yes this is what parks and rec came up with yes last stage plan we employed them to do this and i think it just needs a yes or no vote and if we both know then we go back and we try it again you have consensus it's three to two that that plan is what advanced but i'm just saying if you want to if anybody we have three to two we're missing two members it sucks there's alternatives the alternatives can be presented and i don't think i would if the group consensus is to use that plan and if at the meeting somebody wants to change the minimum because that's dropping then you can do that at the resolution but that's what will bring you that point okay is that fair exactly it works i mean jody i think you still can get the proposals in and uh glenn can also get the proposals and see where it goes it's going to change no matter what the plan is right let's move it forward okay mayor yes okay the phone and the recorder both had a full charge and they're both at the end i need to go see if kyle's recorder is charged so can we break and so this matter is finished right and we're going to move on when we come back number three short-term rentals okay that is 9 17 how much time do you uh five minutes five minutes okay uh nine back on the record here paddy you're good recording here it's all set yep okay good all right item number three now um discuss condominium short-term rentals council member shirley okay this is going to be one of those items it's probably a quick discussion but i know we talked about it briefly at the last meeting and the question keeps coming up and i think i spoke to fred reilly about a little bit of the last meeting how do we determine if a hotel is really enforcing our short-term rental requirements or lack you know we have a requirement that it has to be a three-month rental in the for residential properties we've got numerous properties along the beach that are doing nightly rentals weekly rentals that sort of thing are we how do we attack that is that something we want to continue to allow if not how do we look at it and see how we can overcome having airbnb or nightly rentals on the beach our code permits the short-term rentals so we have the difference between the two codes are we we prohibit residential but we don't predict that so i know we talked about it a little bit last time the the zoning so short-term rentals on the beach actually are legal yet and i think you weren't here last time right i think no i was here and we talked about the different uses and the zoning for the residential medium i think it was and it was a natural low low and so the question was is this is that something we want to look at and let me just add to that is it something we even can look at because this all started with we got that information from um readington shores i think it wasn't they were grandfathered in like us and the wisdom has always been the conventional wisdom don't touch a short-term rental thing or else you run the risk of losing the grandfathering yet they commissioned a team of attorneys apparently and they figured out a way around that at least so far that this serv survived so with that um that's what i know on it i'm going to turn it over [Music] well the law is related to the 509.032 subsection 7 which is 509.032 subsection 7 which is to preemption and the subsection b says a local law ordinance or regulation may not prohibit vacation rentals or regulate the duration or frequency of rental of vacation rentals this paragraph does not apply to any local law ordinance or regulation adopted on or before june 1 2011. so that that's the thing you have to be exceptionally careful of okay having said that there's a attorney general opinion that lynn sent on to the city council members and the question in the attorney general opinion is whether you can you can amend your law and the answer is yes you just can't amend it in a way that is inconsistent with the paragraph that i just read you and what the mayor is talking about is another city that that basically sought to uh put regulation you know just put regulation in air quotes they they sought to put regulation in that did um put in in my opinion conditions in that probably would make it more or less desirable for somebody to go in into the business of doing this okay so they in essence put up conditions that require they meet certain standards and they they were i would say walking a tightrope of some sorts in in doing that although to my knowledge they are still uh they haven't been challenged yet so up until now it would appear to be a viable avenue for you to pursue if you wanted to to really pursue it the thing i would ask is a question is how big of a problem is it and is it a problem you really want to tackle because the problem's so big i think my biggest concern is we continually say we're we have no commercial property i think an airbnb a hotel whatever they call themselves bel air beach hotel which i don't know how that's not a commercial property although they claim that each room is individually owned to get around the whole hotel thing but clearly they're operating as a commercial property there's there are i think three properties along the beach that are operating as a commercial property have check in and check out every day they're renting rooms i see a conflict in our code our land use code there's conflicts that need to be resolved the three properties are condominiums i assume correct good question lin what are they uh according to the tax appraiser based on you know because i did talk to them about that they're being taxed as commercial entities they're just you know as an example uh belarus beach resort a section of it's called the timeshare a person that owns 21 of them in that resort the rest of them are scatter ownership there's about i think there's 42 in there there's 21 of them that maybe somebody owns two of them and another person owns one the preemption that spread's talking about you can't tell them how many days they can rent for it you can't do that it's preempted the state's taking that away from you uh what you could do uh is create regulations and inspections and make them have a certain license and do all that stuff and that's really what i think was ready to chores am i am i right remington george yes okay that's what readington george basically did they just created more paperwork or inspections on follow condos that didn't matter if it was uh as an example nautical watch nautical watch is a time share entirely it's entirely a timeshare and the property appraiser said it is taxed as a commercial property but and operates like a commercial property but he told me and then they are looking at some of those the other two but the issue is we don't have a zoning for commercial but we have residential medium which is 15 units per acre i think that's what it is i may be off there but we so it gets back to our comprehensive plan then is not correct i mean we need to clean up our land uses in our well i i don't think it's going to give you any extra money it's not going to do anything there i think what what i kind of hear is you want to regulate it but you can't regulate it on how many days they rent okay and that's what the you know it says even in the attorney general's opinion but you can regulate them with other things like that i want to i'm not certain that i agree with you there i just see this is an ongoing problem i've heard over and over and over we have no commercial properties we're all residential that is not true that is not what bel air beach is and so either we need to regulate the we need to clean up our comprehensive plan which is due to being which needs to be done um yeah it's due to be reviewed 2020 is the end of what we have you know it's got to be done in 2021 so early and then we and then you know i don't i'm not sure what i'm saying other than our code our property uses things are not there we don't have it set up properly we um i'm not sure if there's more tax benefit to the city if we put these properties in a commercial zoning and if we have a commercial land use i don't know the answer to that but it's something that really needs to be looked at i'm looking at section 54-30 which is fees and it has the the following schedule licenses for apartments motels and resorts slash time shares and it has been a number of different fees so i and until we're sitting here talking about it i for some reason was under the impression this was condos okay if it's time shares there's a certain chapter in the florida statutes that governs time shares and i assume if they have a time share and they are it is operating as a timeshare consistent with that chapter in florida's statutes then i don't know what you can do about it i think and condos and i think the ones i'm drawing at the stage you know what i'm saying i think what we have is kind of i remember when we visited that one where they had adults right it was condos and they have certain rental units but you know yeah it's condos i'm reading the code and the code is says it's contemplating a license fee for a timeshare so to analyze the the problem it would be helpful to know are the three building or three different entities are they condos or are they timeshares and that you know bellaire beach resort the the four-sided yeah that is condoms there 21 of them are individually owned 21 21 of them is owned by one individual okay uh not in the watch is a time share and then what about bellar beach hotel uh i think it's a mixture but don't quote me on that we don't even enforce our code there it's just needs a lot of work well people have come and tried to buy it and knock it down and build something else but they aren't going to build why don't we let them it clearly needs to be done the place is a dump it's not beneficial to to build because they've looked at it it's not beneficial to build to our limitations which is three stories that's it that's you know if we had a that hotel would have sold 20 times before we'd have said oh yeah you can put a 10-story building there yeah see that's because there have been people come here and asked can you can we build 10 stores no you can't can't do that so it's not been feasible to do that with that property and it is an old property uh the fees that fred is talking about that that's one of the areas that we need to look at the code because i think we need to raise those fees yeah because we have these rental fees is that just for residential property single family residential properties or is that condos as well so does every one of these time share units pay it and does every condo in that watch pays this fee and so does the reviews but the resort motel they pay individually the other one pays as a group because it's one hour so they pay these fees which need to be raised since we raised around registration this this speech should have been raised also so that'll be the code change that we might work on because if you're going to raise the rental registration fee for individuals this should be very easy so is this something that we should address in the code review or is this something for the comprehensive plan well the fee issue is probably code review once we hire someone you know we need a planner for the top line once we go through that again planner will probably give us some direction on what to do with those the three you're talking about the rest of them are all condos uh are actually two those uh are you saying that all the 21 units that are owned by the same guy he owns one fee or does he pay the chief for every one of his 21. that's an issue that we're arguing with that individual over because he wants to classify himself as a timeshare than one but the other 21 no they pay individually today we collected i think it was is 53 today from that rental registration uh and we're sending out our second notice because now they have so but as you know i see your point if we want to when we look at the comp plan if we want to try to change that designation you know we will have to go to the county and develop stuff uh why it's the way it is i can't tell you because no one's ever cleaned it up i mean we really need to have a planner on call or someone we can get talk through so this guy is more familiar yeah so but as far as changing how many days they can rent i don't think you can do that based on attorney general's opinion i don't think he can do that and but i think if you wanted to do what reddington shores did which really all it is is a regulation they're regulating it they're doing inspections uh you know well and i think there's some validity to that right if you're if you're paying a rental fee and you're doing a short-term rentals in your condo you're running a business there should be some regulation in relation to that well you know you know that's something that i mean i met a lady out on she said she ran into place out on the beach and she said um i just walk in the beach she said the place was filthy it was disgusting and she drove in from like north carolina so she had to go get it cleaned up you know and i and to to readington's point i understand why they do it you know i of course i go back to if i owned a condo next to the place that was being rented nightly i'd be furious because they're running a business out of that condo and i'm trying to live my life in a home that i purchased to live in and i certainly don't want someone running a business and having a revolving door next door to me well i i will tell you this there's very few condo personnel that complain and i think that's because it's uh it's acceptable now it's acceptable now well i think partially it's acceptable and the other thing that i think is is some of the the people that live in the condos just don't want to rock the vote you know they've got some neighbors and you know this may be their friend that comes and you know so because we've had i mean i've talked to some of the condo people and they say well you know i think this one's a rental and we went and checked and the guy next door you know no no i don't want nothing to do with this so it's kind of hard to catch it i guess you're trying to catch somebody but and a lot of people will say like uh what is it this gentleman came in and told us all there's more rentals in there than you know well how do you how do you find that out because so i guess the takeaway on this is that we're going to look at those fees is that something the city is going to do or is that something that we're going to tag tag with the code no i think we need people we need to 5435 we need to raise that okay it's not going to and we can do that with an ordinance we'll just be just because we already did the rental registration in general okay and you would just get a resolution you can do that by resolution and that's for condoms that's for condos that are balanced for uh resorts and timeshares just for timeshares too yeah okay so the very nature of a timeshare says there's somebody here this week there's somebody else there next week and they all claim to be owners they are so they own that week right right on that week um beyond just hitting them with a fee there's nothing we can do about that not really well you could i guess you could do the inspections and stuff like that charging a fee for that or you know if you wanted to the issue is that takes a person right see the the times here to me is is a bigger burden just because of the very nature of what it is it's a hotel it's a hotel that you've you've dictated you know 52 weeks so you're guaranteed you're going to have 52 well this one and you know i've talked to you about them asking me to sell them parking passes because the police department ever did we did it when we had a police department and i said no bonnie comes out here they want people to come there even if it's not their week of course well that and that's what happens if you don't use your lead you entrust the manager to rent your week for you no they allow them to come and use the pool whether you got a week or a room oh i see like somebody from tampa that's that's what they were wanting these passes for well i i'm going to uh to agree with jody that we've definitely got a problem and i'll just tell you real quick what i observed about two months ago there were four young men that appeared on the beach with a briggs and stratton power winding device they had a steel cable attached to it they were dragging it all the way down the beach unwinding the thing all the way down the beach had a handle on the end and each kid would take a surfboard down there with his wire it would fire up the motor and they would drive away all the way back until they ran out i watched him for about maybe five minutes and so i'm like okay as soon as i get home i'm gonna do something about this so uh we went inside i said hang tight i'm gonna make sure they're still there before i call the cops and so i hopped in the car drove back up there and they were gone the thing is i mean they don't live here and they were right in the middle of the condo timeshare area i couldn't think of anything worse than seeing that particular night but it just this is what we're well uh you know dave i mentioned i didn't see that that's that's a new one um but we get our annual we get our monthly sheriff's report but what doesn't show up on the sheriff's report you can get automatically sent to you from pinellas county and sign up for all the crimes in your area and i'm signed up uh week after week i mean anytime we have something anytime it's domestic violence it's almost always that your bet your life on it it's up in those condos okay so obviously we're getting a transient population here and it is bringing out charge you know needs for sheriff patrols and stuff that from surfing on the beach to domestic violence to parties to we've had dog complaints on the beach we've had them over running our stuff i mean just asking you for parking passes they're not allowed to have them there it's that simple that's it's it's against well they want to pay for it the answer is still no don't do that so it seems to be a problem i do have a question of we've talked about the main places that we all know about what about a regular condo as we go up and down the block here there's a whole bunch of condos can they all rent on a daily weekly kind of basis depends on what their condo not say i'm going to give you an example because interestingly we've had an issue with 2 800 with their swimming pool fence they got a permit to put it in one way and they did it another way and the health department's involved and whatever there's i believe it's eight or nine condos there and all of them are rooms nobody that owns and lives there yeah it's an old old building you know it's it's probably two two condos from oregon park north so uh the one next to it pretty much the same thing the one next to morgan park there's a couple people that live there full time but you know if i went down there and pulled my david thing and ran the plane i'd probably find that the owner of the property and the car that's there is not the same so i mean you know again the citizens asked us to consider the strategic plan number one item is safety right and hearing places of dump the places that i mean and i can only imagine how it is on fire and how it is on egress and all the other things that go into making a these are motels i mean let's you own 21 units this is a motel all right and any 21 unit motel would be inspected and so to the extent that i'm not saying to do anything that's going to mess up our grandfather lord knows we don't want that but to the extent that we can put regulations on in terms of for safety i think we're doing something good for the citizens and also probably helping the people who live there who maybe don't want to have the hotel or motel next to them the fire district does an annual inspection of them i will tell you that of all the condors they're doing in your fire inspection so uh we will look at uh further deeper into what the ratings did you know indian rocks did something with because they messed up their orbeez most of their grandfather yeah they did something like noise or parking spaces and registration with the city you know so we'll look further into that and then at the same time when it's comp plan time we'll we'll discuss that issue with should we be trying to change our zoning to commercial power uh i i think what we were trying to do with the planning board was do the code first and then i was figuring do the comp plan but it doesn't stop me from talking to we have an agreement with the forward cornell's for their planner and we always use them i think we can get to get that okay put something on our comprehensive plan saying they can't unless they have proper zoning yeah that's the problem no one's followed through with any of this the little last cop plan was 2016. it's got to be done every five years but all they do is go check check check yeah okay we've covered everything that's required by the state and they don't really look they don't play in our community they don't they're not doing their job they're just putting in what needs to be done for the state so the plant you know the i don't remember who planner was do you pay last time wasn't it was and they can put a digital sign out there too another code issue that has to be addressed if they wanted to go time time share they they have to follow the state requirements of the chapter and and they they have to do all this disclosure stuff because they they sit like a condo i mean you you're heavily regulated for that type of ownership to be is if it's a condominium but it's an existing all of these are existing so i would assume i haven't i've not looked into it but i would assume that was all done properly maybe that's not such a great assumption but when the condominium is is uh created it has to be ultimately approved at the state level there's a declaration of covenants and that's usually a 50 or 60 page document a time share i've never been involved in one but what little i know about it you have to get state approval at some point for it and there's also massive disclosure stuff that has to be made so if if they're existing time shares then i again am halfway assuming they're complying with state law and if they they are then you know you're the timeshare one i don't know that you can do much about it because it's fractional ownership and that's that's what state law allows you to do but i think on a local level if it's currently as a residential we want to know if you can have a conversion yeah if we have a residential low zoning for which is what linda said that those zombies residential residential medium that condos and time share would only be in that zoning classification provided that's what our code says provided that's what our comprehensive plan says the the use of that is correct if you have a if you want to change the land use i mean because essentially isn't that what they're doing they're changing the zoning for that property and as our zoning based on land use or is it no it's based on the units per acre basically well i'm looking at the first provision which says residential medium district one is some only multi-family use and the use of buildings shall be for residences for a density of not more than 15 individual family units per acre so that's the standard that exists in the code now you know that is working single family right you said the single didn't say single i'm sorry you said multi-family residence yes so if it's a vacation rental the questions you're asking or the right questions it's a whole nother you know topic i mean it's something we need to just look into well the easiest thing i'll absolutely agree with lynn is you get to you have a code provision that charges time shares based on the number of units and it's for up to 10 units it's a hundred dollars so you can easily change that by resolution in increase it so that's that's one way so i have a couple points here secondly if we're going to change any verifying you will change the law or any kind of workflow walking into that i don't expect if we're not so um at any given time within that that being said as well we probably have to try to find some kind of mechanism or something that's something in place so we're always being notified when these things change because you can go from a honda owner into being a time share with just a flip of like i think it's like 300 to change your status okay so and we might not ever find out so then we could begin balances here so we what i'll do is i'll i'll talk to the planner or vanessa and just kind of try to answer joey's questions about you know is it worth the trying to do the land use change do we really need it and i'll circle back to the property appraiser because you know he told me that the categories and that was a are taxing them so he said we wouldn't you know changing what they do you wouldn't gain any tax did you they're already paying that tax so uh but what i'll do is just go back to have the planner and just ask those questions and then we'll get some answers for you thank you that's sufficient journey so [Music] i think you know there's these are there's there's excellent questions it's a complicated issue and yeah let's get some answers here but i i'm gonna go robin i'm not a doctor but i'm gonna play one do no harm here okay i mean we we don't want an indian rocks experience okay they that is a disaster there so let's not do that and they're trying to control it with noise ordinance and parking and i think somebody told me trash cans or something horses out of the barn that's the problem because [Music] some cities that you have to wear after a certain amount of like if you keep having the party house okay after a certain amount of calls you lose that license that linkage that he sells to and now you can't rank anymore for a year so possibility okay can we move on okay um we are now at item number four discuss planning and zoning board draft charter this is the charter for board's review of city codes and i know glenn and um lynn reeves did it i'm not sure whose going to describe it here so well just to give you a quick and then glenn can do the following you know i asked if any i didn't get any responses from anyone about any other code you really wanted us to look at so if we're going to give another shot to this and i i need to find out if there's any council members that want to volunteer as advisers we put out something on the website and we don't have any responses as of today for citizens so at this point if we get a volunteer or two from the council to act as an advisor i think going forward and we just move on because we didn't get any other response because i'd like to get this started in january but through the holidays didn't start now council members could always they're not going to be a voting members they want to attend and throw their two cents and they can certainly come as a guest do that too you don't have to you can either ask to be appointed as an advisor or just come to the meetings i mean we right now have it i think as one person i saw that in this when i read it i i will appoint however many people you know within reason however many people want to do it i'm not holding back an appointment so does anybody have any interest in running this to me not as an advisory position if i was a member i would because it doesn't make any sense to make the commitment if you don't have a say i think since we've given it to the planning board it's not really a separate committee anymore right so it's really we've given this to planning board so well i think about some of the advisors and you would sit at the table with the planning board i think that's kind of the framework we've tried to create here because we could do volunteers right you know so yeah i mean that's all i don't want to go participate in a meeting that you don't have much say in you know and you don't have i mean i don't mind clearly i've done this before dave gaddis was involved i think mar was involved in the past and it's laborious there's a lot of material to cover and i'm not sure that we're covering enough when we cover those sections that you know are neighborhood code related um but and then we're adding into it the sea walls and the docks which there is not much code for at the moment so and there's not much code in any city for seawalls of gods hardening force right very hard um you know that's that would be my only thought i don't mind participating but i don't want to participate if i don't if i don't have a voice so the problem is then we have to create this is an ad hoc committee as opposed to because you can't put tony on the planning board that's the problem right now but i don't want to but like this this was a workaround because we didn't get volunteers if one of the one or more or two of you are going to the just show up and there's a sunshine wall issue that's not almost pointing to the board right yes why can't we just create an advertisement right so i said why can't we take the planning board members and create commit a ad hoc committee with is they'd have to do something is there anything preventing us from just tasking the board too much going on i can't i'd love to help but i can attend a meeting and if they want to listen that's wonderful and if not okay um but i can't commit to being honest and just not even have to vote or anything like that even if i had a vote i don't know that i could personally do it so i wouldn't have a problem uh also assisting uh but we would have to make sure that yourself that's that's the biggest problem what if we i mean there's seven of us guys i just want to have one conversation for sunshine purposes they all have to be open fred i have to have it out in the open whatever you're saying sunshine we're having a discussion about okay and i'm trying to clarify this we've had committee meetings okay and council members have come and council members have talked not on the committee and they've talked to the meeting and made suggestions and whatever the meeting is noticed they can't do that even though they're going to vote on it later i would say it's good those days are gone okay whatever you're going to have a the the board meet and that's going to be noticed and but if you have two council members come and it the question is now you're having two council members that are going to have a discussion it's at a sunshine meeting but it's a sunshine for the board there's just something about it i don't think it's it sounds like it's very good idea what has happened in the past on those meetings is important we've had a lot of times sometimes sometimes even three or more council members but you don't talk to another council member yes you speak just to the chair and you don't rebut what another council member says it's not the best practice okay i agree with that a suggestion i don't know how many meetings they're going to have but if they publish their meeting schedule there's no reason why each we have seven council members each council member can be invited if they have seven meetings each person could have a chance to address them or you adjust it for a half a meeting and then you leave and the next person comes in for the other half meaning you get to put your two cents in say whatever's on your mind they take it under advisement and ultimately it comes back to us anyway if we don't like the suggestions we don't have to accept them so their advisory it's not we're not bound by what they say so that would work and give everybody a voice what's the difference between being there and hearing what she says versus asking patty for a copy of the recording when you talk as long as you hear what she's saying you're good but the minute you if you answer her back that's when you just got the problem but if jody says something and you don't answer her back and you say whatever you want to say but just don't get into a debate you're okay [Music] it's always the second it's like football the second person in this one gets in trouble um well the best practice is not have two of you there that are actively involved in the debate that that's the best practice so with that i mean so we'll com the planning board because we didn't get anybody to volunteer so the planning board does this we will have the opportunity an invitation will be extended to each calendar give us a concern a list and we give it to them right but there's nothing like being there to speak i mean you get the opportunity to you know to hear what's going on and you know and not everybody may want to talk and think so let me get three people who want to go so unless somebody wants to be appointed i mean i i i'll give you the appointment on the next council meeting and it's not a problem what's the time frame to do this you want to do it started in january as we figured the holidays i think two three last time we did it what two months or something yeah it was couple months every other week yeah i think they were done by the first of march or something we started early january the 1st of march [Music] at the point of that too we have a council election coming up in march so if we can get this so yeah it can be voted on it's this council that will have a chance i mean we may have the same exact council but i don't know so we get a chance at least to vote on right now so that's that's why i'm hoping to get it accomplished in a couple of months so we'll move it i mean consensus move it forward with the planning committee we have a charter here i'm going to get you to talk about it it looks very good to me but i don't know anybody has other things to add to it and if you have any others just email it to me and i'll be glad to have it because i'm going to try to have a meeting with them just kind of okay yes go ahead yeah my question is is that council member is not a necessity that's why i was originally drafted thinking there would be some interest it's not a necessity pitch it pitch it to the planning and zoning board and get it started and kick it off this is an important code review and you spent more time arguing about a dollar raised on dock fees than something affecting the entire city so quit kicking the can down the road and get some business done so we'll move this forward december 1st we're voting on this charter getting these folks charged so they can start january first in the meantime they can i mean it sounds like it's a couple months thing there's plenty of time for every council member to come once but that should be organized by patty so you know work out a schedule that's viable so that two of us won't be there at any given time and if two of you find yourself there only one of you better be talking but i'd rather you know i think fred would rather two of us not be there okay that's it we're good one to go all right save the best to last sheriff he's sleeping too last one discuss supplemental law enforcement services here at bellas county sheriff's office patrolled citations etc um i know i brought this up but then you put this on so i'll start with you because i know you did some research and sometimes the sheriff's supplemental patrol is a contract that we would fill out each time we want to use them it's 55 an hour we need to tell them the date of time and we have to give them some heads up time so that's that section i also gave you this sheet because there was a question about how much money you got out of a ticket and uh if you're inclined to i'll be glad to give you this book to figure it out i think it was 20 right that's what i took out of it i found someone at the clerk's office and uh we had a probably a half hour phone call because i kept trying to get him to tell me i don't care i don't understand all these percentages so he finally was able to give me something and send it to me 166 fine the city of bel air beach got 20.7 cents so i picked out one fine so you know it's not like we get a lot of money out of fines it's a very convoluted process on the size of the planet maybe maybe a 250 dollar fine we get 30 bucks but it's it's in the scheme of things it would not pay for and i did talk to the captain miner [Music] the sheriff's not gonna let us direct him to give him give tickets he's it's their discretion and that's the way they want to keep it because there was a suggestion to uh i think it was like 214 tickets if i remember right and our 214 stops warnings 57 tickets you know when the question was asked can we tell them to give 157 tickets in 50 warnings no we can't it's their discretion it should be and i don't think that we're hiring supplemental sheriff or to issue more tickets it's to really just keep the city safe right i mean yeah something here no the idea what i think i threw the idea out and i said if we flip these things this thing pays or almost pays for itself now keep in mind when we had that supplemental service last time the sheriff gave us four officers on several occasions and we were using them like tuesday mornings and so okay we go on saturdays and sundays okay you just stood on gulf boulevard yesterday and reeled them in they were all over the place so you could have you know issued stuff now i agree it's their discretion but if we're going to do this and all we're going to get out of it is a bunch of warnings i don't know that it's going to actually get the point across of quote they've got is don't mess around in mel or beach okay i think that's what we want people walking away with that's what we want in the newspaper that dollar beach put up a stepped up enforcement and you know x amount of people walked home with tickets over here don't mess around in bellar beach and we talk about drag racing down the center line uh passing on the left on the right i mean you know speeding come on enough is enough that's what this is supposed to be 55 miles an hour coming off this bridge here no so that was the intent and if it could close to pay for itself we're good um if we have to pay a little bit out of ourselves that's price of securing the city so i'm all in favor i've been bringing this up since the beginning i ran on this i think it's something that we need to step it up we can't do it all with one sheriff it's impossible so i said that the sheriff called the area we're asking too much of one officer that's not possible but when we had three or four out there we were getting some results to do with something similar to what they did it's going to require two because they're going to have to have you know some of the things like the right turn on grid you got to have what what they call a spotter and then somebody comes free waiting so you know those are potential things so we're going to have to budget some additional money for that and then you know how often do you want to do it i think the speeding because the majority of the speeding tickets that we're given come off this bridge okay and they were out here last week and then the morning of that that caught several that one but i think putting that sign that mr uh warshpur talked about tonight and then i had a good discussion about it and he's willing to do it um council member gas and i had a discussion about it on our boat ride i think that's what we talked about so i think that might help the situation a little bit because when you get to the bottom of the bridge over there what happens slow might be at the down of the hill so uh how often do you want to do it that's a to you you tell me then i'll put some numbers together and come back to you we were talking about quarterly but i think i mean without my personal feeling and just me do it let's see what kind of results we get and you know you're talking 20 of revenue you know i'm not worried about the revenue but i mean if they write two tickets in an hour which i don't think is unreasonable okay let's take care of one man if we have to pay for the other man you know i think that's the citizens have come in here over and over again we have said it over and over again about everything we see i mean sooner or later we open up the newspaper and somebody's going to get killed that's not going to be really nice for our city i mean there's a lot of craziness going on and we're coming up into that season again you know january february all the folks that are you know they just want to get like somebody said they just want to get through bellar beach to get to clearwater well you get through here but follow the rules you know it's real simple so what i'd like you to do and we can kind of throw this at constant comments at the next meeting that gives you a couple weeks to think about how often you want to do it and do we want to just focus on certain holidays or do we want to so just give me that feedback at the december 7th concept and then i'll just announce this i mean you know no no no no i mean i know we can talk about it but last time there was an element of surprise and i think that's relationship okay most of these people that they were catching from what i understand were well i'll say 60 of our residents we have a good influx of our own residents unfortunately so you know just throw out some dates we don't have to say okay and we're going to do it on second sunday and we'll get some numbers together and figure out how many hours we want to do this you covered all the comments but i'm i'm fine with that that's all i was ever looking for on this so i wanted to make sure you knew because this is a revenue so i don't know and i think whenever we originally discussed this we saw what what it would have cost for their services that was 12 000 i think that we he said we would be willing to do like an order of that or something on a monthly basis or something yeah you don't have to tell me the days you just i want you to think about it and say hey i want to give you a little budget for x amount of hours and then i'll give you a number and you'll have to do a budget okay in the comments okay we're done with that one everybody's on the phone is good vice mayor anything marv anything just like to get a general idea has anybody seen the clearwater police north beller beach in the last couple years i've been driving that way for 20 years and i don't think i've seen one clear water policeman up there doing anything so if we're gonna pay for traffic monitoring in our city i think it would be nice if uh clearwater would help out a little bit and at least patrol the north end any comments on that yeah last time george criticos told me where to go and he's a religious guy you know um yeah they basically told me like george criticos is no longer mayor so i haven't spoken with the new mayor but when i reached out to george criticos about traffic he in no uncertain terms told me mayor enforce your laws don't blame me because people are getting away with stuff in your city that's your problem and he's right so i i didn't like it at the time but george criticos was right so um if we want to do it this is our chance to do it but i agree with you i've never seen a clearwater police officer saying so i don't know maybe they don't patrol there vice mayor yes ma'am no i have no invention so moving forward um council comments next time as we will grab it okay our unfinished business whatever you think it's best to figure it in last item is general business we haven't just one simple request pay and lynn uh they gave a number for the traffic control 9 727-464-8926 can we post that on our website so that citizens will know how to reach them if there's any issues okay whenever one where i toured all the all the various areas nellis university or it was called uh they were actually giving out pins with a big stop sign or a traffic light on top and their phone number and everybody that takes that tour they give them that number so it's not a in fact they actually rely on people citizens to call in to help them make uh attitude adjustments to uh intersections that aren't working correctly i'll just verify it just double check it but i mean i thought i got the impression that he gave it to the city and not just to us because he made it sound like it was kind of their hotline and you know it's an intersection you see there's lights that you can call and ask them back then you can call and ask them to take a look at it it just would be nice that you know the residents are sitting in a 20-minute traffic jam coming off the bridge that they can pick up the phone and go hey it's not working you know and let them hear it i mean they can't sense them too they they will they can make the correction on the fly yeah i would like to as soon as we get done with having 5 000 people a day getting sick i would like to tour that facility that's what i haven't seen do you have anything else general business i've got i've got two points uh one is at one time we had an invite to go down and visit the traffic op center [Music] [Music] that we think we do or deserve the second thing is that there's a rough draw for a concept for a standing advisory committee check it for what it's worth that's my sparking shot at those gave you something we talked about in an advisory committee but yeah that's what i said that looked to me that looked very good i didn't hear any other comments from anybody but i thought it was a good document but i think you made last call if there's any other code sections this is it so we're going to charge them next next council meeting so if we need to change it that's fine but the body of it looked very good good job i mean i think you're talking about two different things there's a code um charter charter and then this is this is just an advisory committee to keep oh are you not active advisory committee um kind of available to us if we have to task them with something we talked about that he did he did mention it i have not seen that so uh on call and called swat team basically yeah okay no i have not looked at that but we will um we'll look at that and get back we're fine our next meeting is november is december 7th okay and then we're going to see about getting a quick turnaround there's a quick meeting maybe and if we need to work something we've traditionally for the holidays not had a work session but i don't want to you know mess anything up here but we're going to have to have at least a quick meeting to get that second reading on that ordinance and uh if there's any questions on that will yeah just just a couple other things because i said paddy's on vacation starting thanksgiving day for the next week scheduled i'm going to be on vacation next week but i'll be reached by phone we're going to put the agenda out by next wednesday so if you've got anything get it to us by friday so you're going to get it a week early mainly because of the holiday and patty being on vacation just to update the park board decided not to have cancel all the events for this year 2020 they're going to create a new schedule and come back to the cops uh that should just be put on for our approval they can their advisory so you know we'll accept it obviously i would guess but that should just come up as a proposal next time and you probably should see somebody from the parks court at the next yeah maybe i can get 10 yeah that'd be good yeah so we're not going to do the christmas tree lighting we're just going to light it part of the grant that we got from for uh coven from the law enforcement we put in to video control these doors and i just before we go forward too far with that i don't want to see you with it so that what that would mean is the only way you'd get the city hall is you come up and press the buzzer and we saw who it was i don't know how the council feels about that we're getting ready to go out on the cameras but this was something extra that we discussed i don't remember that florida uh law enforcement grant it was that 25 000 uh so so even after covered you're kind of you're going with the idea of keeping the doors locked and being buzzed in basically and then patty you want to give them a quick update on the survey um so we put everything together that they had suggested kind of compressed a little bit so a little bit tighter more uh yeah so we compressed it a little bit more so it's a little over here they can read it a little faster and then uh sir speedy is going to send it out for us we've got everything uh our all our addresses ready to go and everything so we're just waiting for we want to find out and you want to do it during the holidays that's what i need to know men thought it would get lost in the shuffle during the holidays how fast can you get it out if you if we gave you organization like tonight how i'm just asking you know i'd rather get good response than minimal response yeah whatever i'm pulled off until after the first of the year yeah it's probably better we have consensus postpone it but i think it needs to i think the first week of january that's probably a good idea that's what they used to do with the tax forms they always got pretty good uh responsibility the irs used to said that the tax first week of the year that always worked well so is there anything even come up and say is there anything keeping us from putting the forum online now though no there's no we could do that because if we did that the more people that use it without a mailer the last smellers we have to make alive yeah we've got that ready to go [Music] we can put it out put that up and then even though it's a small list of constant contact we can say hey we're shutting down constant contact we're creating a new list if you want to get on it the forms here and we can call those addresses out that should be crazy yeah that that's ready to go no no we'll call the addresses oh okay well this will be a good test too to see how the film works and if we're collecting the right kind of data and uh just kind of you know a trial run i guess that's a good idea you know for emails or something um that's it okay last thing we had we had a citizen complaint with um a doc busted up and floated all over the place i'd send you something any quick resolution on this or is it totally the city would not be responsible for pulling the lumber out and i checked with a couple other cities no if the when i was told that we would do the same thing if they brought the wood to the road and cut it in pieces we'd take it with the trash and if they brought it to a boat dock unfortunately our boat dock was not open right now but if they towed it there we would pull it out and get rid of it uh and that's pretty much what other students do i didn't talk to burke actually i don't know i might have woke him up because i called him at seven o'clock this morning by accident he got his call and we had emails back over the weekend well i mean the only thing is obviously if we have bad docs which i think was the part of your trip you know we can head it off i don't know whether this was a good dock that got blown apart with the bad weather or a bad dock that was just you know should have never been there in the first place and i can tell you i kind of made rounds uh yesterday saturday and saw that there were probably about five or six dots that are halfway destroyed you know and several that were completely gone with the amount that high tide and the wave action and the uplift the dock will look perfectly fine but it doesn't take much to destroy a dock when you have that high tide like that so there quite there was a lot of damage and we get code out i mean jody found these in one trip around the city can we i mean i know you guys got a kayak there's people you know dave graciously gave the boat i know another gentleman offered a boat one time before this happens and we lose a hundred thousand dollar vote or something can we if we get this if we can get jodi offered yeah i told lynn this morning i said look i'm happy to show you what i found you know there were several jobs completely dominant there were some that we could probably go to the front door and say you're going to have an issue you need to get the rest of it taken care of the problem is right now you probably don't want your boat in the water right now but again safety i mean you know there's different safety do we have issues else thanks for a good meeting local german anybody i have an objection to adjournment never do have a good meeting have a good uh thanksgiving everyone and we'll see you on the 7th don't eat too much"
