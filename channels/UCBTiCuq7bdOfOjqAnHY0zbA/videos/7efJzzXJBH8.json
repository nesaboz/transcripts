    "transcript": "call order is that right the order I guess the first uh thing on the agenda is the approval of the agenda is everybody okay anything they want to add under General business I went back and looked at the minutes from the other one I didn't know if we need to specifically address the signed ordinance changes the way we left it on that um JC did his quarterly board report I want to say maybe October and after he gave the report of the thoughts on the sign ordinance the mayor said that he wanted the council to take a look at it before the planning ziling board maybe we come back to that because I think that was something Kim brought up as as well at the meeting was that that when we left this the last zoning meeting the request was made to simplify the language in it and I don't know that I don't know if that occurred or not if it did it wasn't brought back to the Planning and Zoning that I recall no and um I think between uh City attorney Mora and Mr Cera our code um our planner they're they they're taking that into account and see what they do to simplify it I I it may just be removed moving things that we don't have in my mind I was thinking we have a lot in there about commercial and I think ry's intention was just to cover everything if it ever didn't come up I think what what Kim was after and where we we ended up with at the last meeting was yeah there was a lot of Superfluous language in there that we wanted to make it a little bit more reader friendly for those of us who aren't legal experts right so that you could carefully explain or easily explain to some if they walked in looking for a permit here's here's what you need to know yes and you can't get that easily out of the way it's written right now I could no you got to go through it a couple times and understand how it's yeah together so is that a dead issue now for the Z planning and Z yes at this point it is because the council is going to review it before it comes back here for recommendation you also made a comment that you wanted to bring back to the plan Planning and Zoning pool height a discussion about pool height restriction yes and then we have that in the um no we did not get that in this ordinance this ordinance we we're planning on bringing that but we wanted to cover this one because this one has the look back period and it's all zoning so everything that we talked about um in our reviews with the council that is less restrictive we incorporated for zoning and that's what we're looking at the pool height of Dead Issue then um the pool height looking at they left that at um between uh planner Cera and myself coming back with our recommendation for consideration there's nothing that Planning and Zoning needs to do with it at this point at this point yes and then another question was how many members do we need on on this we need five five full yeah so do we have enough to even make recommendations you have three for a COR three so it's okay yes yes I wasn't sure the way things were changing and kind of the discussions that came about on Monday night yeah all right lastly we used to get copies of this before the meeting is that can we I sent them out electronically I believe I I thought I included a note that if you wanted me to print you hard copies that I would automatic I'd like mine automatically delivered y'all yes yeah if we could that' be great okay so do do I have a motion to approve the agenda I appr second before we move forward Mr Vice chairman can we have a roll call please for the record so we know who's present thank you um board member Angela Barry here board member Brena Brenda bonera here board member Hart McIntyre here city manager Kyle reefer here City attorney Jeremy Simon here thank you okay next is approval of the uh planning and meeting minutes from June 14th of last year um so we do have a forum did anybody have any comments or questions on the the [Applause] minutes and I covered some of my questions questions over here okay no all right do we have do we have a motion to approve the minutes all those in [Music] [Applause] favor so now the next item was review draft of chap code chapter 94 for me I was confused by this because it says 24 up here we do have one more um I don't know if you receiv received the revised agenda uh it's to appoint a chairperson I was skipping over that one on purpose that would be you I was going to ask does anybody want to be the chair right oh you guys already talked about this well no we're saying right now so do we have nominations anybody would like to nominate I'll nominate you are you okay with that yeah but I want to say something about it we're listening what's that we're listening when I first got on here I felt like we kind of and I said something to JC about it I felt like we were kind of just rubber stamping stuff that was coming through here and I'm not an attorney and I'm not a city planner I'm not a developer I'm a business guy there's a lot of stuff that comes on here that I I got to say I don't feel qualified to really say yeah this is the right thing all I can do is look at it practically and I kind of feel that's what we're here for is to look at it as the homeowners and go gosh does this even make sense for us and then let let the legal guys and the city manager and and the planners and all the the people that are really in the know about this stuff they're the ones that have to work through all the gobbley G so are you guys comfortable with that I don't want to attack this from a constitutional position or whether it's written properly it either makes sense or it doesn't that's right is that fair yeah I think that's fair assessment I think we also have to give it then some due diligence when we go through so we're really going back to the council with with a firm understanding of what we're agreeing and saying yeah we we accept this or we recomend I agree all right I mean we're both nurses so you know you give us a disease and we're all over it but we don't I mean yeah so we're just like you okay yeah all right all right F Well then okay so now we'll have a vote there's a motion on the floor and all those in favor I I I kind of so motion passes all righty so is the next thing to go over this ordinance I believe yeah yes sir and and thanks for for keeping me in on this um ordinance number 24 is that that means chapter 94 of ordinance 24 well 24 is just the starting of the ordinance number it'll be assigned to the remainder of the number when it's officially going to council okay did do you guys have any any general comments about this at all do you want me to just run over some of the the changes this covers yes yeah it went over the top here and that kind of talks about the general changes right yes um and these are all less restrictive so it's easing up on some of the code that existed okay and that's why we can do it now as opposed to waiting all the way till October 1 one of the things I was going to ask Randy and to me it was a little bit confusing I just want to understand the proc process here it says whereas Planning and Zoning has board has held a hearing on this matter that means this is after today's meeting yes didn't um one of the things that I saw under definitions that I had a question even though it's not a change I had a question about it on one hand and this is talking about how we determine fair market value it to me it was rather ambiguous when you talk about it unless you're talking about damage then it was very specific it says the value shall be the appraise value what page are you I'm sorry page two 94.2 definitions thank you 94-25 to 1 and I think probably everybody I'm guessing would agree with that yeah we when we put the roof on that's what I found out about about this whole thing at at the time the value of the house really brought it close the value that was on record here so I went out and had an appraisal done and then then it was no problem the 5 year I'm going why would we restrict ourselves like that if somebody wants to make their house better and had value to it why have such a long look back so I think it's good that we're doing in one year what was this the insurance issue that were're talking about in the meeting uh the FEA this is the 50% this is yes so the 50% which with the substantial damage Improvement um that always is going to apply this is covering the section of code that said of a 5year look back period and in our code the way it was worded was only applying to the substantial Improvement not substantial damage um this this is made more sense I should say cuz this is more from a um flood plane management um you know strategy as far as to try not to allow phasing where people would put tons of improvements on structures that are below the floodline um but it also was made a little more sense when we were back on the old rating system which used to grandfather in the people who were pre-firm so preap that were built before they even created the maps um it it allowed them to have a a discounted grandfather rate for being at that l so now it's like they they've come out with risk rating 2.0 which is a much more elaborate rating system it's a supposed to make it more actual risk costs and they've gone they've done away with the grandfathering so everybody who's sit and slab on grade is on a climb yearly of I think it's Maxim 17% until they reach full rating that's a significant um so their their insurance is Raising by a lot and in a matter of years they will be at what it would cost if you were if you were allowed to build a house around slap on grave what it would cost to insure which is a lot so given the situation we're in now it's kind of I mean from a flood plane management standpoint you're always trying to mitigate and reduce um the cost of like what a flood could damage but if you look at it from the homeowner's situation either people don't have their insurance policies anymore because they've gotten so expensive um or they do and they you know if if they do improvements and they have more to insure they're that's going to make their insurance go up too so they're paying for it so it's kind of like does this make sense anymore in our situation and we kind of discuss that in our work session is a whole different topic my house is on grade and we knew that when we bought it and said okay I said the billis you willing to walk home one day after a storm know that everything in there is is going to be gone and I grew up here in Florida with hurricane so it's just you want to live on the beach you want to live on the water that's it but I think the flood insurance stuff is a fiasco but um so this is asking us to go to one year yes this is taking from five to one year so what we would do from a process standpoint um when we get permits and our usually our markers when it's over $20,000 but we're always checking to see how much improvement has been done um we would T we would have them signed kind of like doing something proactively have them sign an affidavit saying I understand the uh you know the 50% Rule and this is what my balances and this is how much I can do in the 5ye time period um and we would track it we put in a system to track you know throughout that 5year period um this for us you know it goes down the one year a lot of people's permits cuz typically either if you don't have a look back period it's permit to permit or or event to event um a lot of cities and this is why we're doing one year have the one year so that gives you an actual time period um but if a lot of the permits even remodel permits they're open longer than a year um so if your permit is still open it's still in a effect um per the like base flood code so it'll be it'll be easier for us to track we won't have to look back as far and keep maintain like a spreadsheet of all the work done so it won't affect staff too much um and one one question that the mayor asked if he thought if I thought the permits would come in more permits because of this I don't I really don't think so I think if anything it'll get a little bit easier to manage with less less look back period so then you get down about Midway through this and says the fair market value shall be used during the five or during the oneyear period but it doesn't Define at least unless I skipped over it doesn't Define how you're going to get the fair market value like it does when you're down under damage damage says by by an appraisal as opposed to a tax rule that's correct so should there be a definition in here so that definition is in the flood the flood plane chapter 74 okay so there's some areas of our code that are kind of spread out in different chapters we want to we'd like to get it more concise I mean what what is what what does the code say is the way to determine fair market value so the flood code you have to go to the definition of fair market value trying to pull up definitions okay so under the definition market value means the price at which a property will change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller neither party being under compulsion to buy or sell or have are both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts as used in this chapter the term refers to market value of buildings and structures excluding the land and other improvements on the parcel market value may be established by a qualified independent appraiser actual cash value um replacement cost depreciated for age and quality of construction or tax assessment assessment value adjusted to an approximate market value by the factors provided by the property appraiser okay so it gives you three options in the definition this is the way our code reads for market value so either you have a qualified appraiser determinate or you have um the our actual cash value calculated um or you have the tax assessment value which you can get off the property appraiser website so then why do we have to Define fair market value specifically in the case of damage why not still apply the code um because in like I said with this look back period they they separated it out and that's this is the way I interpret it there they separated it out so with substantial Improvement remodeling they're saying you can only do or up to 50% in 5 years when and then they they made the damage so wherever you are at that point um you know wherever your fiveyear balance for improvements are if you're done with the improvements and the permits closed um and you're still on that 5year look back period for improvements if a storm comes that season and damages the house where you're doing repairs not upgrad then it's saying we're going to have a substantial damage appraisal done what what the house was right prior to that event and that's how we're going to apply it all right how does this play into the situation the gal brought up Monday night about the repair she was doing was she caught in fiveyear look back or it had nothing to do with it this had nothing to do with a look back period so this wouldn't affect yeah okay right and does the one your affect our FEMA rights it does not I I did do a research when it was brought up and we could have been in credit which probably would have been about 30 points for CRS it wouldn't have made a difference um we did we actually didn't get credit for this so that wasn't getting counted but it's not a significant amount of points that's affecting anything we're still going to get our class 6 20% discount per the CRS okay any other questions on page two we're talking about fences on in 94 172 what about are there fences walls Etc that were built higher than 6 ft for example that are that were there before the code was into place what do you do in a situation where something was there before the code was modified typically it says it in the section of code if there's any kind of um existing and how it's applied um like like for instance our turf section it says something about 10 years or when the turf is replaced if it was already existing when that would into effect so with fences I I can tell you right now I do not know of any fence anywhere in the city either District that's higher than 6 ft this the change in this was to allow the fence to extend over the seaw wall on both residential people from walking down multif family well my point was if you go to the multif Family Properties like 50% of them already have done it so either we allow it or we tell them they can't do it like not yeah the Condominiums the Condominiums and they can put fences well technically it says they have to stop and not overgrow the seaw wall but what what I brought up was that a lot of people have their offenses going over the seaw wall right mainly to prevent people from walking down the seaw wall on their property um so I was like are we going to allow it or are we going to enforce it and then we did the same on the residential side yeah any anybody have I don't think there were any changes were there on page three I highlighted some things just for me three p four five did you guys understand the setback change no the what on page three for 94 220 no okay so this is right at the very top where it says b beach first edition and it says Lots one two and three and then you go over and you look at side setback and it's got 15 crossed out and down to seven so this applies to really only one lot um cuz the Beller Beach first edition Lots 1 through 4 start at um pull my out they start at Harbor I believe it's 9007 Harbor which is the house that's directly south of the Swale you know the Swale at the Bayside Park yeah so that's the one so that's the only house that has which was a 15t side setback every other house if you look through is 7 7.5 or 10 so it's to the benefit of the homeowner it's to the benefit of that specific lot and that homeowner called and and inquired about it and brought up a good point in my mind and I had the planner review it and he didn't see any issues um was that the Lots two three and four are all basite Park so those are those are open environmental space we're not going to develop them he's the one lot one of first edition so he's really the only residential property that is being held to a 15ot setb which is very that's a big a big setback and his house is built the 15ot setback but what he's asking is moving forward can I have it reduced to seven like every other property on the south side of the city and you know so that he can do the similar thing all right anything on page four page five I kept making notes about grandfather because I see things in here that I'm thinking are there are there homes that aren't currently needing some of these and it was more a question how do how do we treat those do you for them to come in and come up to code even if they've been that way for years and years and years so that I plan on especially when it comes to hedges in the vegetation in the front setback areas um when uh planner cner and I make our recommendations to the council they're going to be based on the fact of what is existing and make sure it's clear of what exists what what are and it'll be it could be technically more restrictive we just didn't want to touch on that yet because there needs to be more discussion but we we want to lay it out there this is what we got this is what we think would is something that we could enforce and then talk about how getting to that point because if you look at a lot of houses there are that I've walked by that I know have Hedges out front people some people's come all the way the road that's 20 something feet right away that they got hedges in now will they be able to keep the hedge or if they do they have to bring it down to 3 ft well we we can adjust the code this is where I'm at right now to to maybe make it four feet in the front step back if that's acceptable um to provide people to have legal plans in the front set back now as far as the RightWay people have it in the RightWay we the planner recommend that we don't because it it kind of goes out saying you're not supposed to put anything in the right away but obviously people do and it's taken out expense to put it back in once utilities are done yeah but we're b beach so a lot of times we put things back especially with our construction because it's the expectation of the residents if this was County they would pull your papers and they put a concrete apron and tell you that's what you got yeah but we're a little different so I was thinking when it comes to that that we make it clear that the right away is the city's property and that at any any time C determines to be a hazard or something it needs to be removed it can be removed just to not say you can put stuff there or not put stuff there I mean but just make it known sometimes it's not so much the height is how broad right cuz you can get out walking on golf you can get out walking on Gulf and you sometimes you can't walk can't have two people side by side walking by cuz the bushes are problem you know um and and when it becomes that like that or it becomes someone's like I can't can't see on the road I'm trying to pull out my driveway and that's where that I've gotten involved and said that this is we're asking you to at least do this so that it's not a traffic Hazard and that's usually cutting back to give about 4 feet of view okay I have one more question but I'm doing a little talking yall have any questions on Section 5 paragraph 2 can you explain that to me this is on page five section five property bounded in whole or part by anybody at Water I had a hard time working my way through that one oh here it is and and I will say it's I've got a Prejudice perspective on this because the way our property is set up we cross the street and then we've got property at the very end of the canal and you I've had discussions about what can I do I couldn't go through this and figure out what my limits are right um sorry can you say it by the section are we still 94 it's amended amend section 94251 okay it a this was section five it says section five amended section 94251 fences walls and hedges it's on page five of our package that we got I got so after it says the following reg regulations shall apply to all fenes walls and hedges within the city and then it gets numbered one two three yeah and number two okay was oh number two okay okay so this is it's basically saying any property uh and I'm not playing on doing this but the way I'm reading this technically I could put a hedge up on the North and South Side of our property and have it 8 ft cuz it's not bound by water but you're on your your house property or the piece across the street pie piece across the street I'm not doing that but I'm just I was just looking at it and saying all right what are there pitfalls here I think that's the that's a portion of property that is since it's on the water but I don't have I don't have any I'm not blocking a view of anybody on either side and there are sides to it so the way this is reading it looks like I could put up again I'm not going to do that I'm just trying to play Devil's Advocate when I look at this looks to me like I could put up what is it [Music] 8T yeah 8 ft shall not exceed a height of 8T yeah I see what you're saying it doesn't and ours is very unusual so I think we can write code to have a plan for every single situation out there and then the other argument is that you are adjacent to public property which is another exception yeah in there okay um so I guess if you wanted to you could argue taking it from [Music] seaw wall to your um property line on to the right away with a hedge technically 8 ft I don't think anything covers that no that's yeah so I didn't know whether it from a legal point of you is that something cont or or is it just it's no I'll pass that I think it should be covered because there are uh what three properties uh yeah there's a the difference is when you go down on on hibiscus West to the next block yeah you have a house that there is a lot that comes up it comes right up to to this whereas at mine it's only public property yeah and and on the north side of it my my neighbor there and no big deal they're already they've got fence and stuff that's on our property on I don't I don't really care yeah but I'm just again thinking future how do we avoid the problems just a point if you did do it I don't know I mean what do you think do you think I mean I don't know if anybody would really be bothered by it but I would I wouldn't do it any I think it would look really really awkward it would look weird I I've talked about the only reason I would put anything up is just try to keep people off the the sidewalk but but the but Broward sheriff's been great about working they've been watching it good good good good we but I'll bring that up we'll bring it up that's a good point yeah all right page [Applause] six so um on number seven page six I had the same question you did about people being grandfather is this something new or is this has this always been this way about uh the pools people with pools have to have a fence I know yeah that's county law too okay yeah with the with the pool um so that can't get access to it yeah again I'll use an example of our place we don't have we're not we have a bird cage and we don't have a fence around a pool but our whole backyard property is surrounded by a concrete wall so that would qualify then in that example even though it's not def it's a fence yeah but it's not in proximity to the pool right right but there's no way for a child to walk back and get to the pool you see I I didn't know anybody could do that without offense that's why I was asking is this something that's new or is it old because I think that that's it's been in there but the bird cage is qualifies um as having like a something blocking access to the pool I just know our insurance company would have a heart attack if we didn't have a fence so I don't know who would do that it's interesting that in in the Waterfront the the seaw wall is actually considered the barrier the water is considered the barrier like it still come up by both all right page seven what does 15 mean page 11 15 yeah I put a question mark by that too does that mean that perpendicular to the I don't understand what this is saying the vist of the water area from a waterfront property it's perpendicular to the property line along the water from grade to a plane of 6 fet why is this what is the purpose section the view of the water area from waterr property I guess they want to they want to make sure you can see the water from from your own house yeah 6 so so everything as you're looking from the back to the water everything has to be clear from gr to to 6 feet yeah okay I guess maybe you don't want somebody putting up like a giant bounce house or something in their backyard That Could That Could block The View if anybody else has any insight and let say bounce house cuz I got four kids and the first thing that comes to mind page eight any questions comment surprise surprise Earth Burns we had that question last time number 21 at some point that's going to be something like if some again I'll use our our lot because I'm constantly thinking about how do I mitigate the the canal Rising the way it does now I can't put I can't raise the Earth on on the seaw wall side because that could effect flow over the seaw wall you know if we if you if you look at Water control and you look at Holland and I'm going way out Holland's done a great job of figuring out how to deal with having water above flood plane I mean they're experts at it and they have Gates that flip up or they build BMS on their their properties to protect the homes and I'm I'm thinking okay maybe it's not an issue right now but 25 years down the road and should we be looking that far forward do we really want to restrict homeowners from not being able to put burms then it brings up the whole issue of the the road level because you start screwing up water flow if you get your land too high for for the the the the road over Fort Lauderdale they were deal dealing with that and ultimately they were building up seaw walls and then next thing you're going to do is build up the roads well that's what's going to have to happen eventually yeah and seaw wall seaw wall Heights are going to have to come up but it's it's a long drawn out process why why is there restriction to the burm is it because of impact on road just put in of any other property I think it just afraid if it runs off yours it's got to go some yeah and everybody being so low that yeah like you don't unless you find a way to keep it all on your property to go to drain only to the road or to the law okay uh down on Section 94 255 sub paragraph D remodeling it's last paragraph permits for remodeling shall require certification of total value of labor labor and material including out- of pocket cost should we exclude the cost of the appraisal though specifically I mean why should that become part of the calculation it says all out of pocket but now you're forcing people to get an appraisal and you're going to include that in the remodeling fee the way this is written I got to check on the FEMA I don't it permits permit costs and I believe the appraisal does not count as part of the project it just doesn't say that here just doesn't if if you're a homeowner trying to figure out what you got to decare right yeah I think what they're really trying to cover is just you know yeah just buying the materials and provided by owner I I get it but just you know I think about that and I go all right that's out of pocket that why is that become a limiter when you're trying to prove you've got enough value in the in in the home and you here's your C and there may be people are going to take that right up cap and the cost of appraisal might go over it I think when we look at it that closely um it kind of goes outside the code that's where it's like okay what do you have what are you trying to do let me look through the substantial improvement book and and then it's that's how we assess it all right page nine anything on the business impact estimate okay any other comments confirm no okay so I guess we have to make a motion to approve to send this back to councel have a motion have a hearing first a hearing do they have to hold a public hearing first on the draft ordinance stated was it just they got to make a recommendation and then then we got to go through the ordinance procedures for the first second it says Planning and Zoning has held a hearing yeah so is the hearing public or is it hear well this is a public meeting so the hearing is qualified them yeah okay so do we have a motion to recommend this packet it's okay for the council some words like that yes second second team easy all right all those in favor can we just State for the record that there's no there's no um member of the public present for purposes of public comment and uh now you can go ahead can you get Tom back call so now you can go ahead and uh and either approve or deny the motion we've got a motion and seconded all those in favor I motion passes all right okay any general business I mean our next meeting I mean hopefully we get some more applicants to be on this board we need some positions filled thought we would have ended up with at least two after Monday night if we'd only gotten for it depending on how it goes I'm always trying to get board members um and then so the next meeting I would it's going to be the next time we're drafting ordinances for the Land Development code that's where we we're at right now um and like I said with the sign what is that addressing what does that do lamb develop oh that's that's a section of the code if you go to our code it it kind of defines it um which [Music] is back this section it goes through it's kind of right after the charter and and describing all the um the uh like the boards and the construction but I'm trying to find where there it is all right so it's called subpart B Land Development code it starts um from Chapter 70 up so I mean I would check with attorney Mora cuz I think there's some chapters that we're looking to make some changes in the earlier code that he might think would qualify um for Land Development so I can't say flat out that the way this is organized that that's not what we went through last year with the advisor that came in from pelis County that was a comprehensive plan okay yeah all right yeah and that was good for us to update you know it's a how many of these codes do you anticipate going through here or is it just something that occurs annually and you pick a couple two or three codes four codes my plan is after we you know that we contracted the planner specifically to kind of do an overhaul um this upcoming work session is going to be the last work session that we just kind of say what jumps out um from each council member and the public and then from there um you know the planers made all these notes and we're going to go through and kind of between me and him come up with the recommendations and then bring it back around for discussion um in the form of an ordin um but I believe I'll have to check at that point if Council just wants me to send our drafts to to kind of get it on their radar and then if they're okay with it probably just take it um to the planning you know the ones that need to and then come back but I'm not exactly sure you know we just see how it goes has are you Ware of anybody's expressed interest in getting on planning and it's probably one of the most innocuous committies there is I would imagine so I've talked to a few people and and one of the questions they've asked and I didn't know the answer is can can they attend remotely if they have to the way Attorney Morris worded it is we want to have a quorum in person so in other boards and committees if we have a physical quorum we've had people attend remotely but we try to make sure same with the council we have to have that physical presence of the quum so we'd have to have at least three does the charter have to have five does he say we have to have five on the committee yeah it says you have five regular all right so we're in the same kind of Catch 22 that the council itself is is in if there's only three of us here and we don't get unanimous nothing goes all right yeah do we have the ability to change the required headcount on a committee if again for the same problems that we're having on the council if we can't get other people in this could become a real stalemate um you know you could yeah um it may have to go to referendum though if you're if you're amending your referendum have if you're amending your Charter huh what about my husband if he joined but because we're married is that I don't I'd have to I'd have to ask attorney Markus he's more familiar with your code than I am uh off the top of my head I don't know and I don't want to give you a bad answer yall know anybody that well the two people I spoke to ask if if they couldn't physically make the meeting could they do it remotely we could still end up with a quorum that way yeah I mean if that's some way where we can get five members as long as we can I me summer we're have to be up in the Carol quite a bit so I mean it's not going to change the same problem we're going to have either way right up in the magging yeah yeah so I'd say for now yeah like encourage them and if we got it anybody you know that wants to get on here and can we have more than five if we were that you can have two alternates yeah cuz they they both express the same thing about TR we could do zooms but then what he's saying is without having three members present we won't have a quum won't be able to do it because you can't take a vote on on an electronic when you're on a zoom you can't the way the way Attorney Morris said it is that based on his review his recommendation is that we have a physical Quorum but if we do have a physical Quorum so we have three people in the room then we can have the other two remote and they can vote why though are we restricting it that way I think it's an interpretation of Statute I don't think there's anything that says otherwise it may just be a function of wall um I know during Co things were a bit different but then a lot of those executive orders which permitted virtual appearances were Rec sended so um I'll I'll bring it up to attorney MOA and maybe he can he can offer some inside because they have already made plans to travel just like y'all had plans so they didn't want commit something they couldn't be here they could be an me the issue is whether or not we can get three people here at any one time right and and the odds go up if we do have a couple more people here sure so if if you if you do know anybody um will everybody be back by October yes I I will that's fall cover change the end of October I mean realistically with the way we're doing the if we plan far enough ahead yeah m i mean that's really where we'd be looking to get everything for recommendations sure okay because outside of this this is why we kind of push this forward because it's less restrictive and at least we're getting this done now but then we a plan for the future any other questions concerns comments okay that's thank you everybody do we have a motion to address do we need a motion to do that okay need a motion second are you motioning yeah I'll I'll do the mo all in favor let's get the heck out of here"
