if any council members would like to respond to the citizens comments please hold your responses until we reach Council comments at the end of the meeting before I call on anyone in the audience I already have one card from Miss Vicki Dwyer from uh 111 14th Street please step up to the podium and uh it's my understanding that uh Debbie mall has yielded her three minutes also thank you Council men and women thank you for serving our community my name is Vicki Dwyer and my husband Russ I'm Marine son Peter and I live on 14th Street we moved here just one year ago and mostly love our community I'm here today to address a topic from the February 25th email will come to where councilman Lloyd Roberts is looking for solutions to traffic on the gulf and Causeway two-way turn his proposed idea is to remove the two lanes turning left onto the causeway restore the blinking yellow light use the two right lanes to proceed straight the left outer ring will be the only turn lane onto the causeway remove the existing Island and palm tree but the crosswalk would remain the existing Center merge will feed the left hand turn blade supposedly ensuring that Northside traffic is not affected with the proposed changes 170 or more driving residents from the 85 houses on 12th 13th 14th and 15th streets will be affected after living here for a year I see these traffic patterns because I drive in and around them multiple times a day and I use the crop the crosswalk on a regular basis the amount of traffic turning left to the causeway always far outweighs the traffic going straight what would be the purpose of creating two lanes to go straight toward Indian Rocks when this is not the traffic problem and we're just quickly into one lane anyway as I dissect this proposal I will agree that a blinking yellow light turning left was long overdue the rest I am completely in disagreement with with the ones as a resident of that intermediate area I can attest that there is always a backup of traffic turning left on the causeway during the heavier traffic times but cars are able to condense into the two turn lanes and then make the turn having a flashing level light will absolutely allow them to keep moving currently to turn left I have to sneak out into traffic anyway in the center lane until there is an opening or the traffic clears up with the proposed changes that center lane will not be available to any of us on those streets for this purpose making it very difficult to turn left because of the fact that there is still constant traffic coming set from the south whether it be Bridge traffic or Indian Rocks traffic cars that are coming from either direction will really slow down for cars pulling out it would be much more difficult to get into that turnling because no one is going to let us cut in palm tree would definitely take away a part of the charm of Bel Air Beach it would absolutely create a greater problem with pedestrian Crossing currently it is still not safe to cross toward the beach because cars in general do not pay attention and the flashing yellow lights aren't bright enough to stop the cars as evidenced by cars still running through flashing lights when we Cross by removing the island and changing two lanes to three lanes of traffic will only make crossing a greater safety issue we can all predict that national response for drivers to speed up in order to make that light since there's only one way and we won't be paying attention to light flashing lights for The Pedestrian Crossing after talking with money movers within a community no one can understand why this change would be made we referred with this proposal would be a mistake and a complete disservice to the surrounding residents and will highly restrict our ability to get out of our streets the only part I support is the left turn arrow to a flashing normal as I close I would strongly encourage this Council to maintain a focus on our community to make improvements the centers on the needs and conveniences for us for taxpayden residents of Bel-Air Beach and to be careful of changing or fixing things to accommodate the traffic increases from visitors and tourists as long as we are a thoroughfare for tourists we will always have heavy traffic which can never be fixed with these purpose changes in the only a portion of our own community thank you Mr wire yes please come up and give us your name and your address my name is Kathleen klaser and I live on 21st Street 106. tonight I wish to engage the city council on two items of concern to me both deal with disability accommodation I would like the city to relook the bridge connection from Gulf Boulevard and the beach just north of the Bellar Beach Motel I bought this up to a council member last year and have heard nothing perhaps together you can come up with a plan that doesn't exclude the handicap living close by from using this path to the beach this relatively new bridge structure does not meet the requirements of the disabled residents near its location last year at the end of the summer my son and my handicapped grandson took the bridge to the beach my grandson rides in a canvas wagon as he is unable to walk in his motor skills on his right side are poor my son and Grandson reached the edge of the bridge where it meets the beach and because of a poor design of the bridge the wagon tipped over my grandson and son were tossed to the ground my son fell trying to stop the wagon from overturning soon after my son tried it again approaching the beach at a different angle and once again the wagon was tossed and my handicapped grandson was tossed with his dad onto the beach my grandson is now afraid to get to the beach using this path I walked the bridge to see what the problem was and as a disabled veteran I found it challenging to walk up the bridge and down especially when it's Sandy the handrail is too wide to get a grip and I was afraid I was going to slip and fall the second disability accommodation I would like to bring to your attention is that my grandson is learning to walk with his small Walker and since we have no sidewalks he walks in the street I would like to see if the city can put up traffic signs or warning drivers to be aware there's a small disabled child on 21st Street thank you thank you Miss Glaser yes John hansick John Hansley 22nd Street I'd like to speak to um councilman zabel's suggestion or thoughts on this uh traffic issue for historical purposes when we moved here in 2015 there was only one single left turn lane with a flashing yellow light um being as how I've been involved in safety in my military career and I look at what we have there proximity of that crossed walk to this traffic light did not make sense only because there's a parking lot over there um the councilman suggested that the island go away and leave the crosswalk you still irregardless going to have traffic jammed up no matter how many left turn Lanes you have and again previous administrations for historical purposes have attempted to work with the city of Clearwater Beach to no avail we are because of their problem and that rotary what are the um default to get to the beaches I don't know what the solution is but if I were in a position to help make decisions I'd take the crosswalk and the median out all together traffic being what it is I understand it can be backed up all the way to 22nd Street unfortunately we've learned in the time we've been here we get our stuff done Monday through Friday in a little bit any vehicular movement on the weekends only because you can't get in or get up on the Gulf Boulevard and even when my wife and I walked to the uh to the beach over there by the motel it's next to impossible for traffic to yield three lanes thank you thank you Mr hansik yes sir Mr Mall thank you hi everybody uh Roger Maul 115 Causeway Boulevard right across the street um I just learned about this island proposal to a banish him so I thought like the previous gentleman to get a little historic uh perspective uh originally when I came it was over 20 years ago that we moved into the community and at that time basically anybody who tried to cross Gulf Boulevard was a Target because the same traffic that you see now was there without any kind of controls and especially since uh this first beach access is so close to the turn uh people would take that turn and then just fire up and so when they put in the two islands that basically helps solve that problem because of the flashing lights now with the flashing lights I think they'd be more effective if we change the the color just because every construction truck in the area has Amber lights but you know for you guys I can see see where it's frustrating for the people who live farther north trying to get to that light whoever it was when they made the double turn lanes that came up with the idea that it would be a left turn only that was I think a poor decision because the poor people that are north of the causeway you have to wait forever because you can't turn when there's no traffic coming the other way so doing the fat the flashing light would make a huge difference and I see that as really being the only remedy for the people turning left because if you take out those islands what had happened before they had the islands in is not only were they rushing and not paying attention to our citizens but it backed all the way up even during spring break weekends it almost went all the way to Clearwater so that would affect everybody getting out onto Gulf Boulevard and we're basically trapped inside our community because people won't let us in in order to get out to Gulf Boulevard so I would suggest that you rethink taking out those islands just because I remember the headaches that we had before we put them in and and the uh this the downgrading of safety that was there by not having those islands so so I would suggest that we keep the islands and maybe even put one farther down so that the people that are at the north side of the city can get out when the people trying to get to Clearwater Beach make it so that you can't get by thanks appreciate it thank you Mr Mall anyone else yes good evening everyone um Tammy lavenda 97 Harbor Drive I'm here tonight just to give a couple of save the dates for the new Belair Beach Community Foundation our new nonprofit that we started in November a quick save the date for our spring fundraiser the Earth Day Sunset social on

you've seen them we have the embroidery Belair Beach fanny packs we only have three left and we're probably not getting any more so if you were interested in one of those please make sure that you stop by city hall and we did get new embroidered hand towels in they were out of stock for a while so anyway that's all I have thank you thank you Miss lavender anyone else yes sir Randy love is 13th Street I think the idea about moving removing the palm trees in the island between 12th and 13th is really a terrible idea there's non-stop traffic going northbound to Clearwater I live on 13th and we can't get out uh it's so bad for the people on 12th that they loop around and come out on 13th just to give them a little bit better of a shot okay um I sent an email last week extensively detailing a lot of issues with this plan I don't know who saw the email or the video I took a video out on the street of all the traffic I don't know if anybody saw that I I saw the video either I can't ask here because you don't know I have questions a number of months ago I came here asking about three more benches at the 12th Street access like we used to have six now now they're down to three they're nicer now but they're they're down to three and cleaning up the the real high weeds that were blocking one of the Southmost bench and getting a bike rack so the bikers don't change their bikes to the benches that we have so at least we could sit there um Kyle you did a great job on trimming those weeds getting those weeds stripped up so I I thank you I appreciate that I have no idea on status of getting more benches or a bike rack and I can't ask now uh I'll reiterate again that this policy of not taking any questions from the public is I think is really messed up you can say why don't you email your questions in I did last week regarding my issues my concerns about this uh uh Crossway and taking that Island down no one responded so I have no idea where your your head is with that if anybody even saw it or they care okay I can't always make it here during the day to meet with with Mike zabel during his open Office hours so I get no answers I under I understand your concerns about things getting out of hand like they did it maybe in the past but there's better ways to deal with things than refusing to answer questions from the constituents you're the public that you're you're here to serve uh I I like to say Belair beach has implemented the Walla Walla management technique okay I go to Wawa all the time I used to go to my wife for breakfast and lunch and we they have tables we could sit out there and enjoy our lunch and breakfast and whatever uh Wawa had a real big issue on Missouri Avenue with all the homeless homeless coming from all over the place taking up those tables so the uh Wawa management decided they get rid of two-thirds of the tables that way the homeless won't have anywhere to sit Okay so I think there's other ways to deal with unruly people or people that are you know out of line or asking crazy questions or doing something but just to say that you're not taking any questions where is the public to go to get answers to these questions other than trying to squeeze in a date with Mike the thing or sending in an email that you don't know you're going to get answered thank you and have a nice day thank you Mr Lovett would anyone else like to speak yes good evening Jennifer Pope 523 Belle Isle um I actually for the first time just learned I can't ask questions so I do not have anything prepared but what I wanted to talk about is the ordinance that you are reading for the second time today around setbacks I wanted to get a better understanding of why we have arbitrarily chosen plots and land some sort that is one of our agenda items and I I I'm going to let you continue but normally if there's an agenda item we give you the opportunity to speak while we're discussing it okay so you can continue now or you can continue doing that agenda item it may serve you better if you uh wait until then absolutely I definitely will wait my understanding is that we were just going to read the title of it and vote so if we're going to actually have discussion on it I'd be happy to wait yes okay thank you Miss Pope any other comments yes sir yeah um Ken blanche's uh 1021 Palm Drive right over here on the causeway as far as uh removing the island I just wanted to bring up some more of the safety issues with that um that is my way of getting over to the beach um because I live right here on the causeway so um what I have found if that walk is taken away is that when I go across the street and I'm at the light and I go to walk across the street there all the people that are turning right there that have a right turn on red they're not paying any attention to the crosswalk they're not paying any attention to that little light that says I'm able to walk they're looking to the left to see if there's any cars coming I've almost got hit probably two three times after the latest change walking out to cross the street at that light I'm talking the traffic light so if we remove the crosswalk it's you know that's crazy so removing the crosswalk I think should not even be on the agenda um removing the island also I believe is a bad idea because the island actually triggers people to see that there is a crosswalk um and I've almost got hit a few times even walking across the island with the lights flashing um you know I I totally will sit and wait and make sure that the car is slowing down because the car is you know they they tend to not even slow down unless somebody's standing in the middle of the road so um just wanted to make that safety issue brought up thanks thank you very much any other comments oh all right citizen comments are closed all right now we are on to item number three this is a presentation uh the Pinellas County Sewer Rehabilitation project um yes sir please come on up and introduce yourself mayor and council member my name is Dennis Simpson I'm at Pinellas County Utilities engineering Division and I'm in charge of the horizontal assets and um the lining projects are on the my jurisdiction um I have here um Joe Boggs he's with Public Works inspection and he's in charge of inspection and also how uh you uh inliner contractor and his name is John sutherman um cured in place um Lion contract uh gravity sewer is a trendless technology and um it's basically for rehabilitating um deteriorating gravity sewers and that is done by linen and what is it they do is basically they take a line in uh thing and put into the pipe and by um ear Steam and ultraviolet light to expand the um and therefore stop the filter um infiltration of water into the sewer presently we have a contract which is on the construction here in Bel Air Beach and um from what I understand there were some issues and I'm here to basically respond to those issues sure um what what would you like to review the issues the the complaints that uh or uh city manager uh riefler uh would you like to uh explain what the issues are right yeah sure yes mayor um I welcomed out Pinellas County Utilities uh because uh they got underway with the the project he's referring to which is the sanitary sewer Rehabilitation project um who's the contractors in liner Solutions and uh we did not have any knowledge of uh this project which is you know it's going to be a couple months long spanning this city uh when I first found out about it I didn't know uh I heard about it happening on 5th Street and I they're trying to contact the County to find out the extent of the project turns out it was it was pretty much the whole city so um since then I've been in contact with the county and uh they've provided a continuing information to me which has been helpful I guess at some point um we just kind of dropped the ball on notifying the city that this was coming up um and I just got I covered with the county out you know how important it is for us to know um because the citizens will call us first to find out what's going on so um I I then since being in contact with the county asked if they could come out to the speeding and um just kind of go over the project and uh address any concerns that um the citizens might have um due to the scope of the project and I I guess the biggest concern was why weren't we notified and and I I understand that uh door tags went out but it was the day before the project and I think many people were caught off guard and there were also some overflows where they they just were unaware of the project completely weren't at home and came home to a big mess yes yes um we normally um wouldn't notify but we have decided that on large projects like this because I think we're doing about 60 to 70 percent of the gravity suitors in Bel Air Beach so for a project this size I think we're gonna from here on notify the city to let them know that we're coming normally what happens is that the project gets bid it gets awarded and then when the construction start they would do cleaning at that time we wouldn't not notify the residents but before they do the lining because with the lining they're basically going to be blocking this the lateral flows into the line and that's usually for a segment say 400 feet it only takes about a day of work so they notified 24 hours before by putting door hangers on the on the residence to let them know that they're going to be doing the lining in that segment and as they progress they will do more door hangers have you uh installed any Linings yet in Bellaire Beach or or are you only doing testing and uh yes sir as right now I'm sorry sir for the record could you please state your name Showbox Pinellas County Construction Administration right so at this point so far we have roughly about 80 lines left to line we we started out with a hundred and 132 I believe so we still have 80 more to go um we're trying um I I understand um councilman uh she was affected by it and I apologize about that um that is from cleaning the line um my dentist was saying when we line that's when the notices go out because your sewage is actually being backed up so the more water you use the more chance it's going to flow back into your house and we've also learned that if you give out a notice a week ahead of time people forget about it 72 hours people forget about it so normally what they do is on Friday they put out Monday's notices Monday they'll do Tuesday Wednesday notices about 48 hours is what they've been doing and then you know so Wednesday the Tuesday they'll do Thursday Friday notices and then again like on Thursday they'll go back and do Friday's notices again because it was more than 48 hours we try to try to keep it around 48 hours I don't like 24 because that is a short notice yeah some people they're like oh I had big plans tomorrow my son's birthday party they don't work on on the weekends but you never know who's doing what during the week especially if something goes wrong it could be a very late night thank you um just curious what's the maximum homes that are uh that you've encountered that would be impacted uh during one of these cleanings or Linings it's it's really hard to say because some of your runs might be a 200 foot line segment some of them might be a 400 foot um depending on how many homes you know how big your lots are you know and you might only have well some some of the runs here that we've we've done uh the size tree right over here there's five laterals on it um so you know that's a 400 foot shot um and uh just curious uh about what's the uh time span for that one that one line that you did this the the one right next door right here um what is the name of this street here right right on the other side of the parking lot no Theater Cedar um that day there they was done by three o'clock they started they they started televising at seven a.m and they were completely done and gone by three o'clock okay so you came to my street 22nd Street and we didn't know if you were complete if it looked like you were in one hole over here for a while that was probably the cleaning crew okay and then uh we we really just didn't know we had no clue as to what was going on other than hey uh don't run your water uh after 7 A.M something like that I think that's what the note said but we really just had no information and we were a little afraid that we would come home uh to what um vice mayor Shirley came home to so I think yes uh especially if it's a if it's if it's possible it might not be a bad idea just to bang on a door and just say hey we're starting or something like that because I'm sure there's some people that won't even know that tags on their door and that's one thing that we run across too the the gentleman that's here now um his name is Johnny if anybody if you see him out he's he's the foreman of of inliner he's great when when that normally when the liner goes in he will go to each house and say can I get your phone number so I can put you on a group text and let you know hey okay you're free to use yours you're free to use yours you're free to use yours you know he does he does do that um if we're only on a street that's you know like over here in Cedar it's only got five he'll just go knock on the door and say you're free um hey you know but when you got a lot of times we they try to do double shots meaning 800 feet so you might have 10 15 Services all together um that's when he'll do a group chat with the neighborhood and then you know he's on site walking back and forth the guys are on site my inspector's on site if if you guys ever see you know somebody on the street look for Pinellas County truck yeah his name is Trevor Logan he'll be more than happy to answer anything it was Kyle Kyle has my contact information my phone's always on I always answer emails so if anybody's got any questions just reach out to me I'll be more than happy to answer anything you got great thank you very much do I have uh questions and I just want to add a couple of things and that is I mean I think I voiced my concerns with you over the phone but we've you know the the day I came home you were just cleaning pipes on on my street had no idea this was happening there was no notices no no information provided um came home to an absolute mess because the cleaning just blew through my toilets um I'm sure and I was not the only person on the street I'm sure probably several other residents have dealt with the same issue I called Pinellas County utilities and was told that you guys were not providing any service out there there was no construction going on there was nothing being done that caused and what they told me to do was talk to risk management that was their only answer they would not even research they taught they I made them check twice with their service technicians to see if they were doing anything out there insisted nothing was being done that concerned me I called Kyle because at this point now it's after five on a cell phone I'm sure he's probably home he had no idea what was going on I know you own those utility lines but they run through our city any work being done in our city needs to go through our city manager because he's going to get the first phone call yes ma'am and then all of us will get the call too and there there was no communication with anyone that so that's got to be addressed moving forward then as we move forward in this project you must know today where you're going to be tomorrow it would be nice to be able to for Patty to send an email at least to our residents to know hey we're working on you know whatever streets these three streets over the next three days expect to see a door hanger something so that we're aware of what's happening because that on my street I guess we've only been our Line's been cleaned there's not it has not been lined so I don't know what kind of habit that's going to cause in my house but I'm really not happy with the outcome of what happened at my house that day no and like I said I apologize about that I was not aware of that day that the cleaning crew was even in the city I was not informed of that which then creates the other question is how safe are our utilities if anyone can come into our city and tap into our lines how safe is that as a resident it's not very safe it's causes concern to me oh yes it it does but like I said I I was not aware of the cleaning crew even being in Beller Bluffs my understanding they was in Largo you know so I that's not my jurisdiction that's nothing else I can do um as far as getting the problem with giving you guys the schedule it's a schedule it's it says okay we might be um for instance today I can't remember what street the guys was on today because we had two Linings here today one of them has an offset joint in the pipe they wasn't able to work so I so I don't know when you know if I tell you it was your street today and all of a sudden you come home thinking oh gosh it's over with I don't want to water my bathroom it's done nothing happened so we're going to come back but your the point was I said maybe Patty could send an email we projected to do these streets watch for a door hanger you're not going to hang a door hanger unless you're doing the work right or no the door hanger was up when they went and pre-video this morning they found that the pipe was busted so we could not put a liner in today so you know and and that's and sometimes you know when when the truck comes the liner that you were supposed to do today might be on the very bottom those guys aren't going to dig through 2 000 feet of liner to get that one off I just I'm in the I'm a contractor I find it incredible that your subcontractor can't do a better job communicating with our residents and I'll just say you need to get them in line and communicate better no problem any other comments or questions from the council you're just if I understand correctly you're just doing this main sewer line you're not doing the branches from the houses right no no so how would that back up I mean of course order could back up but when you're cleaning them you're using like a sandblasting tool or afterwards or it's on it's a jet nozzle on the end of a hose yes but if the if your why is on backwards when they when they pull back it will push water up you know it will um if the pressure is too high it'll it'll do the same thing if you're descaling which some of these older pipes you know they do have build up on them they do need to be descaled before we put a liner in because if not you're just you're shrinking the pipe down even smaller um so sometimes you do have to use high pressure and yeah and it does it happens you know it's I'm I don't like when it happens but it it's a flat tire it's like a flat tire yeah I'm just saying the pressure you're using is probably under 160 PS eyes and your branch tail plate coming off the house there's got to be at least 15 to 25 feet so that extent I can't see how that's really blown back into the house Don what are they normally run depression 600 yeah if it's a straight you know a pretty flat lateral it's it's going to blow it up there council member Banker I was home whenever they they whatever it whatever it was that they did on our line and it made it made the toilets bubble we heard things in the sink it it was very disturbing I believe I believe they did our street already 8th Street did you complete 8th Street yet yes I believe 8th Street has been mine and I don't believe I think he did marvelous job the crew was very professional I'm out there uh they start three minutes before seven which isn't allowed but that that's the only complaint yeah but no I'm just saying I I you guys were very professional you tied up our street you didn't even tie up our street you blocked half the Stream and we can always go around South Street but you guys are very professional you had the cones out and everything like that thank you any other questions or comments from the council if not uh I'd like to thank you gentlemen for coming out and answering some questions and uh trying to clear things up we look forward to a much brighter outcome going forward thank you thank you all right item four we have a presentation from the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office beginning with the law enforcement monthly report good evening everyone I am sergeant Roy switch with Pinellas County Sheriff's Office and tonight I'm presenting the activity for January of 2023. under the UCR property and person crimes I'm happy to report there was Zero across the board so there was no criminal activity in the city that month however there were five people arrested and that resulted all from traffic activity so traffic stops DUIs weren't arrests and some drug paraphernalia moving forward for Deputy activity there were a total of 683 events within the city leading that as usual were the directed Patrols and then traffic enforcement there were no crashes in the city so I think that should make everybody happy hearing that and then lastly there were a combination of 174 citations and warnings issued for the month and that is all I have helpful no thank you very much all right thank you and uh I think Deputy clapka is not here um Mr riefler would you like to give us a a summary on the code enforcement report yes sir happily uh so we did this is our second time going around with this new format of the code enforcement report Steve's been working with the template that we put together and um this month we had 51 uh listings in our report uh some of them were closed out some of them are still ongoing um again I did did some pie charts just to show the categories of the uh the violations that are being covered um we also um the distribution of the city streets uh our outstanding code violations um we've had some developments uh the the uh dangerous structure uh we had a hearing for at the board of adjustments scheduled for March 9th um after the attorney has been in contact with the attorney representing uh the resident uh it was advised that we postponed to to attempt to make a reasonable accommodation for the structure so um it's our intent to to work forward to try to come to some kind of uh something that's acceptable to the city um that is within the law and uh we'll give you a follow-up where that goes the we had a hearing since the last meeting on February 23rd for the resident that has some uh some rodent Harbors some overgrowth um so that that was issued an order of fine and um some work's been done on that property it uh it's not quite done yet I'm meeting with someone tomorrow to follow up on what still needs to be done the unpermitted remodel construction nuisance was a roof on North Boulevard we um they've actually done work on the roof right now um we discovered that they never pulled a permit properly so we're continuing to follow up on that that's not closed yet um the uh I did talk because X house is under uh it's advertised for sale there's a title company that's inquired and I have talked to them to give them an update of where we stand uh we have a short-term rental hearing that took place in early February um that was given an uh you know a fine like we typically do with the short-term rentals and um the uh another hearing which was uh just recently on March 2nd uh for another overgrowth and uh invasive species um so that was that was issued in order we have a fine that will be starting uh right now uh we've been told that it will be contracted to be cleaned up so Council any questions or comments yeah I'm Kyle there was a hearing back in I believe September on a tower erected on 8th Street um that's not never been in my view in the code enforcement I mean there was a fine assessment of 150 a day I believe he filed for an appeal I don't see anything in the Circuit Court filed I think there was a email sent to Patty that he was filing an appeal but why isn't that on the code enforcement sheet do you know that that I can explain that procedurally procedurally you're correct that there were code enforcement proceedings in September that an order was issued by the magistrate the Magistrate's decision was not directly appealed which is why you do not see anything in the Circuit Court the the decision of the magistrate at the time was that the um responding party had to submit a a permit application uh the a I believe a preliminary permit application was received and rejected a second attempt was made and in that in response to that second attempt uh your city manager found that it was insufficient and not did not form a sufficient basis for the relief if you will request it in the form of a permit that is the decision that was appealed not the magistrates decision in the course of um after uh informally declaring a desire to appeal that decision the party retained legal representation who is certainly well versed in the matter I've had a few conversations with their Council and we're and we are navigating the legal boundaries around that process and whether or not a permit is a possibility in that context understanding The Limited preemptions provided by federal law and otherwise so that process is being navigated to put the city on the best footing where there to be a legal challenge to ensure that all administrative Avenues have been addressed sufficiently and that's where the process stands at this moment but to your narrower question as to why there's nothing within the Circuit Court they did not the the the responding party did not appeal the Magistrate's decision so the Magistrate's decision is in effect the Magistrate's decision was that a permit application need to be submitted and the parties are working to resolve that submission yes sir okay but there was a hundred fifty dollar fine under each day and and the magistrate found that the party had complied by making a submission uh later in the fall but I've I've was told that the permit he submitted was deficient which was an administrative decision but whether or not the magistrate found it sufficient for the purposes of fulfilling the magistrates requirement as a sort of a separate and distinct analysis all right because let's start from the ground up uh before he put the tower up he had a poor pad which violated our setback rules so why are we not why are we catering to a hazardous condition here for now I guess this tower has been up at least at least nine months um and we're approaching another hurricane season um he has done nothing to remove that Tower I get emails phone calls addresses every day I walk down that street from the neighbors surrounding that house how much longer are we going to give this guy another bite of the Apple before we do something uh thank you for your question I would say uh your question is phrase presumes a few things um but what I would say to answer your question is as to why are we still engaging in this process I would say because the law mandates or dictates that we should and my job is to mitigate the city's risks and uh in their totality not just from the perceived risks of the neighboring Property Owners but also the the litigation exposure or legal requirements as set forth by prb1 and the other applicable legal Provisions so we're navigating the process as I know you attended that code enforcement proceeding my my argument to the Magistrate on behalf of the city was that the the property owner was suggesting that our permitting process was few was a futility and was some kind of charade if you will and there was no point in him applying because he would be denied automatically and my response to that point was give us an application give us an opportunity to be to evaluate it and we will evaluate it on its own merits and that's what the parties are going through his own legal counsel has has stated that the poor meeting Pro submissions can be more detailed and robust and intends to make a more robust submission for the parties considered the parties in this case the city's consideration and so while it may be um that while the timing of it may be frustrating I would say that we are going through the process as it dictates my also my my added understanding of that is that there's been Towers um not necessarily the precise one there over the past few decades in intervening periods um so um this is not the the first um appearance of this structure and we are trying to make sure that as we deal with it we do it prudently well again um there was no Circuit Court filing from what I can find out what you just said confirmed okay so the 30 days have elapsed six months ago um he missed the boat to file an appeal of the magistrates decision yes sir Okay so that decision didn't just say how to refile the refile for the permit the way I'm reading it uh and then he's off the hook second of all again that Tower is still there correct all right and we're not doing anything about it disagree I I detail what we're doing it may not be a solution to your satisfaction but as it relates to code enforcement I work at the direction of the executive of this city uh the city manager uh I've advised the city manager on our legal Solutions options and recourses and as your City attorney I'm taking the course of action that um upon advice the manager is in agreement with I I don't submit that my that the current plan of action May satisfy every party but it is in keeping with the requirements of the Florida Statutes Federal guidance and otherwise in resolving this matter well you said you studied the case and I found this case too disposal versus Marion County and it's clearly says in the affirm the FCC has determined that local governments do not have to make reasonable accommodations for AM radio antenna structures where the structures are prohibited by residential subdivision coming in conditions and restrictions which we restrict again why aren't I think pushing this issue a lower satisfaction remain calm all right I I can remain calm because I don't live where it's going to well maybe it will fly down my street but you have four residents that are very concerned about this and they all supported you Dave all right so why aren't we enforcing our walls point of order what's the point the point is is that you're now you're attacking our mayor I'm not attacking yes you are no I'm not I agree with you know by name I defer to this to the presiding officer I would say only uh member bankert I I think I've answered your questions I understand you're not satisfied or in agreement with those answers I think the holding and dispoto goes a little further than that and it's not specifically limited while that quoted language is certainly in there it's also couched in the Pro the other case law in its progeny uh governing this you look to these federal guidelines there's a limited field of case law on this I've I've reviewed it I'm not coming just from a place of I don't want to get people upset I'm looking at the case law and trying to give I've read the dispoto period the the this photo opinion I've read uh there's two two major opinions out of the fifth DCA there's an opinion there's a few other opinions that all speak to the notion that a government need not simply yield to any requests or any application you can enforce your codes but that must be done on an analysis of the particular antenna at issue especially amateur ham radio which you cannot prohibit full stop you have to consider whether those things can be accommodated in keeping with the aesthetic safety and other measures and I'm saying we can't consider that until we have a proper and complete submission that allows for the parties to evaluate that I'm trying to develop a factual record that the part that the city can stand on whether or not you think that's a proper course of action I understand but I as it relates to code enforcement I'm working with the official and the city responsible for this sir I understand what you're saying there that there's a proper procedure this is erected this is already there okay if he submitted a permit and it got bounced out and there was nothing done I'd be 100 agreement with you but you're telling me I can go build a house okay the court building a house and then say well I'll submit a permit at my will no sir I would submit to you that a house is quite different from an antenna issue and I I completely understand your position sir and I'm working through all I can't change where we are at the end of the day is he going to be fined 150 for every day if he does not there's an outstanding fine now for 150 for roughly nine days that fine is outstanding whether or not that fine is resolved through the process of me working with his legal counsel to mitigate the city's risk and analyze the situation I can't just dispositively say that nor do I have the authority unilaterally to either impose or or remove that fine there is a fine in place period fact will stop um how that process resolves is ongoing I had a nearly 90-minute conversation or roughly almost 75 minute conversation with his attorney just last week at Great length where we talked about the balance of the case law where the issues go and generally the parties were in agreement that a permit is necessary that the city needs to provide to provide its requests as to what data is requested as this is not a common infrastructure I will tell you that my firm does this works for municipalities and nearly a dozen municipalities from Port Richey to Holmes Beach and in speaking with all of my colleagues ham radio antenna towers are not exactly the most common issue and that you have Community to community we're navigating a very very Niche area of Law and trying to make sure that we do so properly as good stewards of the public Trust thank you Mr Mora I appreciate it uh Mr is able that you have a comment yeah I realized that's actually more of an admin um city manager that's the dangerous structure I think number 105. yes okay so it has been listed there okay thank you any other comments or questions from the council I just want to add that I like the new format thank you for your work um tile and other council members that help put this together and it just it's so much easier to follow and read thank you guys thank you thank you Mr reefler all right we are on to item number five which is a presentation from the Pinellas Suncoast fire and rescue District uh normally it's Chief Jeff Davidson but uh this month we have assistant chief Higley good evening it's uh assistant chief Higley but that's all right good evening council members vice mayor mayor Gaddis um Chief Davidson does send his apologies that he's not here this evening to present to you however he is at in Tallahassee at the Florida Association of Special Districts um annual meeting where he is uh taking some classes and learning some additional stuffs about Special Districts so that he can provide uh you know the highest level of service that he can to uh Our Community Partners including Bella Beach um last month in Bel Air boots there were 17 calls for service there were three fire alarms and um 14 or 13 local criminals and one other uh seven six percent of the time uh we met our um call times for ALS um and 90 of the time uh these calls were responded to and eight minutes or 31 seconds or less uh with that being said last Monday we had the pleasure on February 27th of Chicago a presentation here at the city hall where Chief Davidson presented The Proposal that we have submitted to Pinellas County uh Emergency Services the services that we provide to the residents of what we consider North Indian Rock speech better Beach and the residents of Bel Air Shore uh that the president that we have provided to them would be apply for an additional two paramedics and a analyst transport capable rescue that would we're still not decided if if the engine would move closer to here to our new plan station or were the rescue up here um uh folks from there uh talked about the traffic issues and there have not gotten any better so when I read to you those times that only 76 76 that we were making our our same times uh that was an unacceptable to the district and we want to make sure that um you know we can get those numbers up into the 90th percentile um and the plan that we have come up with I may have presented but when it was to do so um if you have any questions about public records and um I'll use some cards here and we can give you that information to the residency community so they can kind of be informed we're probably looking for uh Community feedback and I believe uh some avenues that we can do that and again we can provide you that other question I'll leave those cards um oh yeah there's a process in place so the next step in that process is called the data driven focus group um that room is on Friday and I will be again um presenting to the final chance and some other interested um almost committing about our um request and there's about 15 other um request throughout the county that have been before so we all kind of present our case so the next uh step around is if they approve or recommend that it goes forward uh they'll be What's called the msac emergency medical service advisory Council which consists of some multi-political news and other interested patterns um those requests will go to that and they will vet them and again they'll move those forward up up the chain and um within the next few months we'll have an idea of whether this um and again we hope that the citizens of the but I'll never be sure to support that because I know the end goal is to make sure that um we're providing you these uh fine learning Ms services that you need to pay for uh every year for us um over the last couple weeks uh the men and women of our district we were able to attend what we call an acquired structure so if any of those down here Indian Rocks Beach uh Federal foreign like we do in real life so uh the men around we got to uh in this mid-rise high-rise structure we got to do some uh biofinter safety and survival and some rescue stuff and have been way less similar to many of that in your community obviously the bridge side and not necessarily residential but it's still as great training for our folks as far as district is concerned we've met a couple of agencies we've added paramedics to the district uh Rand is a transfer from Seminole fire rescue who has approximately three years of service uh took Wallace County uh he would be put on the truck and ran away will be able to uh treat folks the other one is a transfer from Evansville County it was a several month process depending on when the classes can get in that it would be a fully accounting paramedic so those folks will be starting by the end of this month and we're providing services to again all of the residents in our fire district so we're welcome to have two analytics and it's a very difficult done right now hiring and firing Ms is a Hot Topic right now there's not there's a lack of qualified candidates that we got over the last few years we've obtained some Stellar um random list case we had a woman in the last one but that will be providing the top model of community which you folks have come to expect um lastly uh kind of uh had a small engineering accident uh here in this room and we have gotten back together um this year and started planning for what we have to be any bigger and better and and uh you know I mean she might have suggested that actually since we have all the Community Partners with the town of Indian insurance and the City of Eden Rocks Beach but maybe we'll make it a district-wide event in that every year we can rotate it uh you folks have been gracious enough to offer up um for maybe our next first annual um event so every time uh giving some speakers um event within the community that everybody that we would like to invite you know whether they are on our own cover stereo or Indian Rocks or any in the shore so we appreciate you folks allowing us to do that and as long as the the financial concerns and there's only running home for me this evening again some cards and if you have any questions please feel free to leave the channel thank you do you have any questions I I have one um actually it's uh more of a can you uh explain what it is you're asking for for the people that did not attend the meeting and and you can make it as brief as possible if you uh if you don't mind okay so bring something to folks here in the community um when I started uh for parallel psychos 17 plus years ago we always used to respond by firearms and and our well that's the way we have we don't have a rescue but our engine down to the northernmost end of our district however um that was a the service to you folks because of the amount of time that it takes for us to get from Indian Rocks Beach to the North End in excuse me Bel Air Beach um that finally we went to closest unit dispatch so unfortunately uh for you folks I would say the majority of the time you're getting a unit from Clearwater Beach right at Sand Key or Extinction 33 um because we do want to provide more homeless level okay and the majority of time in an EMS call and you're going to want it closer is better so what we're doing on doing is regardless of what happens we're we're constructing a new fire station um in hopes in Longwood Indian Rocks Beach with our projected doing now we want to hit the benchmarks set by the counter and we will once again be able to settle some lessons that can put your tax money to us so you're even as far as EMS guns um you didn't pay our fire attacks and we do the science ground level we do come with those I just want to let you guys know that but EMS is made to the county we feel as if since you're on a long residence you do supporters you do pay our taxes we want to make sure that our men and women are responding down here to you folks so what we've done is again every year they open up what's called an enhancement you can put in for enhancement and chief Davidson has been what I feel a godsend to are uh finally win streak and who's been working hard to provide the you know a higher level of service that we have in the past um so we put in for that enhancement again basically it's two paramedics but it actually turns into about seven folks because you have to have two every day and we have three shifts and the rescue so speaking of that the counting is getting busier the traffic all that stuff so we just went uh the other day it's called three of them basically it's like the rules falling apart all of the front of the department units that have transport capable units are transporting their own patients to the county this was not like that when I started it's so busy that the fire department has to take up the slack from the Sun starting units that you have going around the counter and I can tell you the closest unit uh transport rescue is in Clearwater Beach Rescue 41 which is downtown Largo and then the other one and the other one on the beach is in Treasure Island so adding a transport rescue to our fire district We Believe will benefit not only the folks here but there's in Largo and you know down south where we needed to be in it again it all comes back to being able to be um you know as helpful as we can to everyone in the community we're our neighbors regardless of whether you live in this town or or up in Clearwater over in Largo we want to make sure that we take care of everybody so again we have a lot of information that I can provide you we have lots of data and facts and figures and stuff and we'll be happy to deal with that stuff out but we would ask that you email one of us and uh the only other comment that I have which really I'm looking for a confirmation is that this plan uh that uh that you have uh does not include asking for any more money okay so you know this is a uh this will be a completely challenging standard uh what we're asking for so again this is the Elon Musk unit we're asking for it's two paramedics and a transport capable rescue or Implement of the existing fund that you folks already pay into so without getting into some uh additional specifics you folks paid a lot of money and you don't listen to any reason I went back and we'll just find out a little bit of that back to make sure that we can provide and not only you folks but the rest of the county an elevated level of service thank you very much thank you can I just ask one question are you asking our residents to request this from the county are you asking our residents to reach out to the county to request so I I'm kind of confused on what you're asking submitted the request however just like you can even your state senators and say I support this and I support that we do have the contact information phones um decision makers within the county that we'd be happy to provide to um I have to be careful with what I say at the Moon reference publicly but please by all means if you're interested we can email this information and give you a little bit more on that so we will look basically just just today and we really support what Chief David said in the patellas Suncoast fire and rescue district is asking for and we hope we can strongly consider it and I serve on that Council and so I will be speaking that day thank you thank you very much all right now we are on to item number six uh if I could have council member Livingstone join me down front so uh it's not uncommon for council members to um to attend one of the courses offered by the Florida League of cities every once in a while we get an overachiever so I have two awards for the same person tonight so the first one is a certificate of completion uh for the uh online orientation class for newly elected officials awarded to The Honorable Belinda Livingstone council member city of Bel Air Beach congratulations okay and we also have a second one which is the certificate of completion uh for uh we affectionately call it emo but it's the Institute of elected Municipal officials and uh she completed that in St Augustine Florida uh January 20th and 21st 2023 presented to Belinda Livingstone council member of city of Bellaire Beach congratulations all right we are on to agenda item number seven uh this is consideration of accepting the annual comprehensive financial report for the fiscal year ending September 30th 2022 and is presented by salt marsh Cleveland and Gunn certified public accountants sir if you uh would please give us your name and uh and then let's hear your presentation good evening my name is Chuck Landers I'm with salt marsh Cleveland and Gund I want to thank the mayor and the council for the opportunity to once again serve as the audit firm for the city I want to also uh thank Kyle for his assistance to the audit process and a special thanks to Heather and Andrew as well there's no way the audit uh process could be completed without all the work that they do you've been provided a draft presentation of the financial statements if you took the time to read through that draft you would notice that there are some pages in there that say this information is not available that's mainly in the statistical section and it's also where the gfoa certificate would go the statistical section information we have uh this the historical information from 2021 back to 2013 but we do not have the 2022 information yet Heather has requested that most of it is being held up by the county so once that information is available we can put that in the report I point that out because the statistical section of the financial statements isn't covered by our audit opinion so Our obligation is to look at that and make sure that it materially agrees with the financial statements the basic financial statements of the city and then if it doesn't agree then we have to modify our report I can't imagine that it's once it's there that it's not going to agree um the city is going to have to make the decision of how long they want to wait to receive that information before finalizing the the audit there there are a couple options that we can discuss when that time comes the the gfoa submission is the the unextended due date is at the end of the month you can request an application for extension which the city did do last year at our request because we had staffing issues not able to meet the the timeline for that but this year it is really just in the gfoa's hands uh waiting on them and we do not have a timeline to understand when they will issue that certificate or if it will be issued um I don't have any reason to think it wouldn't be but again it's we we don't have any timeline there so um we have you know till the end of the month to really make a decision on how the city wants to proceed with that um so that it's not super urgent at the moment but something that does need to be addressed in the next couple weeks so with that what I've brought to present tonight is the anticipated uh opinion I wouldn't expect it to change so we have the anticipated opinion and the basic financial statements uh here the uh to like to take the time to just go through these in summary uh it's you know over 100 Pages we're not going to go through it in detail but the the important parts I'll point out the most important part of the financial statements that I will say is on page one uh this is the opinion this is the auditor's report so you have to go through several Roman numerals uh before you actually get to page one about a sixteenth of an inch into it so on page one uh the second paragraph we do uh cut to the chase now there has been changes in the auditor's report uh passed down so we do get to the opinions here at the beginning instead of making you read through four pages of Auditors report to get to the opinion but you'll see that in the second paragraph on page one in our opinion the financial statements referred to above present fairly in all material respects the respective financial position of the governmental activities the business type activities each major fund and the respective budgetary comparison for the general fund of the city as of and for the year ended September 30th 2022 and the respective changes in financial position and where applicable cash flows thereof for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America so this is the first opinion that you're concerned with in your financial statements there's going to be a few more opinions as we get to uh some more reports towards the back but before we get there I'll just point out a few of the financial statement highlights on page 17. this is the statement of net position this is what's most comparable to a balance sheet that you would see in a for-profit entity there are uh there is technical statements in here called balance sheet but they don't necessarily represent what you would see in a for-profit business so if you're in a four if you're used to looking at for-profit entity financial statements this is going to be the most comparable you see that in the middle of the page and this is as of September 30th 2022 total assets of the city were 19 million 555 795 dollars total liabilities of the city were two million six hundred and sixty seven thousand dollars leaving net position of 16 million eight hundred eighty eight thousand so of that net position 6 million four hundred and fifty thousand of it is unrestricted and 10 million four hundred and thirty eight thousand is restricted a healthy balance sheet the next page would be the comparable income statement for a for-profit entity but this is called the statement of activities it starts with the expenses on the left side and then goes to the program revenues but really I'd like to just focus on the the bottom numbers let's just get to the bottom you see that the change in net position for the city was a net increase of just under one million dollars for the year 994 000. so that is the second up from the our third up from the bottom line in the bottom right corner again about a million dollar increase year over year from the year before giving a net position at the end of the year of the 16 million eight hundred and eighty eight thousand now I did mention that uh there are balance sheets in the statements the very next page would be considered the balance sheet of the governmental funds the city has two governmental funds the general fund and the capital projects fund so just point that out that you under so you understand what is there the the city has two more funds that would be considered proprietary funds or business type funds the next page I would turn your attention to is Page 23. point this out because most people are very concerned with the budget and budget to actual and that's what this page is is the budget to actual for the general fund the middle of the page is the final budget the or the middle column on the page is the final budget the column next to the the right is the actual and then the far right column is the difference between the two so you can see that total revenues were budgeted at about 2.5 million they came in at a little over 3 million for a favorable variance of just over half a million dollars in the middle page our middle part of this page you can see that total expenditures were budgeted at just over 2 million they came in at just under 2 million for a favorable variance of a hundred and eighteen thousand dollars for a total favorable variance of 625 000 on the year when you have higher revenues and lower expenses the uh the favorable variance there I'll point out that that line uh where the favorable variance of 625 is shown it currently says deficiency of revenues uh over expense or under expenses that needs to be changed to excess of revenues under or over excessive revenues over expenses it was net income so just need to revise that wording the I mentioned this the city has two additional funds on the next page that's this uh is the statement in that position for the proprietary funds that's the stormwater fund and the marina fund you can see that the assets for those two funds combined were 2.1 million and the total net position is also 2.1 million uh roundings there's very few liabilities in those two funds and that's on page 24. the next page that I would point to is page 25 this is the statement of revenues and expenses and changes in that position for the proprietary funds it's basically the income statement equivalent for those two funds you see that the charges for services in the stormwater front 177 000 the marina fund 82 000 for total of 260 000 between the two proprietary funds the total operating income for those two funds netted out to 8 800 just under nine thousand dollars uh between the two there were some transfers in so the total change in that position with those funds was an increase of thirty three thousand after the twenty five thousand dollars was transferred in from the general fund the next several pages are the notes to the financial statements there are a few that I would like to point out Tyler in your report your uh referencing the Hazardous structure and some legal correspondence that's going on with that I would like to draw the council's attention to page 44. in the middle of the section there is a no disclosure that currently reads accounts receivable for the general fund includes 196 915 dollars from a resident of the city for code violations for failure to meet construction schedule timeline ordered to ordered by special Magistrate on May 19 2021 the city has no intention to forgive these fines and believes the balance will be fully collectible therefore the city has not recorded an allowance as of September 30th 2022. that is our understanding of the city's position if that is not the case I would ask that you do share with us to see if there should be an allowance recorded there the reason I am by allowance what I mean is if that's not going to be fully collectible and this is the number as of September 30th it has since grown it's on a daily basis we need to consider the the collectibility the realizability of this asset this is a concentration it is a material amount for the city both in every aspect of our material calculations so on a on the government-wide basis for the for the city as a whole this is a material number and we need security you said that's the antenna this is not the antenna or the not this this is not the tall structure or antenna this is a construction it's not does not have to do with the ham radio okay so anyway I I point out that paragraph because that is something that you have never seen in your financial statements before um it's new and uh we want to make sure that that is correct uh that is what's been conveyed to us um and so we would before before this is finalized we want to make sure that that's still the current intent on this same page page 44 Note 5 this is the changes in capital assets as a municipality uh the infrastructure is a big part of what you have and you see that this carries the beginning balance uh forward to the ending balance of at the end of the year the total governmental I'm in the middle of the page or the middle of the table there there it started the total governmental the capital assets at the beginning of the year were 12.4 million and they ended at just over 12.4 million so not a not a big uh increase there you can see that the the assets continue to be depreciated so the governmental net assets uh they started the year at 10.8 million and they after depreciation was done they ended just under 10.5 million at 10 million 458 000. so that's the governmental activity then the next two table or the next part of that table or the proprietary funds you see that they started at a net amount of 1.7 million and after depreciation they were 1 671 thousand with no additions as a municipality uh lots of times people are concerned about the debt that the the town is carrying or the city is carrying on page 47 this is note 9. you'll see the schedule of the different loans that the city has outstanding and when I say loans are dead loan or Bond and on the far right column you see that the total governmental activities had outstanding debt at the end of the year of a million seven hundred thirty eight thousand the proprietary funds had outstanding debt of 23 000 for a total of a million seven hundred and sixty one thousand of debt at the end of the year now we're going to jump forward several pages about a quarter of an inch or more to page 85 let's get back to the opinions page 85 is the independent Auditors report on internal control over financial reporting and on compliance and other matters based on an audit of financial statements performed in accordance with government auditing standards the sentence that you're looking for on this first page is the very last sentence the last two sentences where we say we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses however material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified but again that's what you're looking for on that page if you turn the page there's a paragraph titled compliance and other matters and the the ins the sentence there that you're looking for is the last one the results of our tests disclosed no instances of non-compliance or other matters that are required to be reported under government auditing standards those are the those are the phrases that you like to see there turning the page to page 87 this is the management letter it's a couple of pages long the important sentences that I would point out here again the very last one on the first page there were no findings or recommendations made on internal control and compliance issues during the preceding annual Financial audit then turning the page to the section called Financial conditions and management the last paragraph in that section section 10.5441 I2 rules of the auditor general requires that we communicate any recommendations to improve financial management in connection with our audit we did not have any such Communications the next section additional matters last sentence in that paragraph in connection with our audit we did not note any such findings and then the very last page is the independent accountants report on compliance with Section 218.415 Florida statute the important sentence in this page is the third third paragraph in our opinion the city of Bellaire Beach Florida complied in all material respects with the aforementioned requirements for the fiscal year ended September 30th 2022. and that gets through the auditor's report question because I I did I did tag that page that you reference with regards to that large fine yes ma'am are you looking to us for some feedback all right I mean you know you made it clear that that needs to be right precise it's my my so so from a financial statement reporting perspective we're concerned is so the asset exists there's there's no doubt about that the fines are being incurred um is there going to be any negotiation of that and a write down uh so if there is anticipated negotiation and that all of that isn't going to be collected we would need to take that into consideration to see if that asset value should be lowered uh we call that an allowance against it because it's grown now to 235 000 yes and you know I and we've never yet collected a fine that large so I think there's probably some opportunity for that too and and so that's although none of us want to I think that that's the reality is we we and so therefore we are asking on from the city uh through city manager and Council what is the anticipated realizable value of that and and that's we need you all to give us a number and then we I have to audit that do you need the number tonight no sir okay well but but it is something that that would need to be finalized before we make the decision of is it is the report going to uh be submitted by the 331 deadline for gfoa will it be extended uh it it is something that will have to be resolved for the audit is finalized but no sir does not have to be done tonight any other questions from the council oh okay so um uh city manager Reaper this was placed on the agenda as uh to accept this report it doesn't say anything about draft um so are we should we table this or um or are you asking us to just accept the draft one for now uh and uh what they expectants that we're going to receive a final copy later yes I should have included draft into in the agenda item the um we wanted to get the salt marsh to come in and present with the audit is where it is now it still needs to go to the audit committee um which we need to form um with one member from Council so I'm going to need a motion from a council member to modify this agenda item uh to uh to say draft uh annual comprehensive financial report so moves do I have a second second uh all in favor all right all right so we're going to change that to uh draft and then uh what I'm going to need now is a motion to accept this draft report so moved do I have a second second all in favor aye aye any opposed okay can I further propose another motion uh you sure can so and the way I understand what uh city manager said was that we need to appoint a council member to the audit committee so can I uh present a motion to um propose a council member to the audit committee so that when the time comes they can review this are you making emotions I am making a motion to elect a council member would someone else like to second that game all in favor aye okay so um now we have to decide on someone and uh thank you for stepping up vice mayor Shirley I'm happy to second I I can't make a motion on that I'll make a motion to uh what council I say to me vice mayor Shirley as the representative to the audit uh committee you'll have a second all right we have a second uh all in favor aye aye any opposed all right congratulations thank you for stepping up again does that satisfy all of your requirements for tonight yes I will get with the CAC to uh schedule a meeting to get started on this and figure out our timeline if we're going to pursue an extension or if we feel we can get it reviewed and approved okay do we have any other questions for uh Mr Landers before he uh we let him go thank you very much appreciate your effort on this yes sir sure Brad zagatic 2219 Donato regarding the five it's not a material it's an asset of the city but it's not a material asset to the operations of the ongoing operations of the city correct so the in the audit uh in the in the financial statement audit we have to determine materiality of a dollar amount and we have to look at the different reporting uh opinions so there's the the government-wide and there are the different funds each one has their own materiality that has to be determined and this number does meet the materiality threshold of all of those materiality components so is that asset going to make or break the ability of the city to continue no but in financial reporting it it is a material amount based on that on the numbers here and it is a concentration in one individual okay thank you any other questions or comments no thank you uh very much Mr Landers all right thank you uh coming here tonight all right we are on to number eight uh this is the city attorney's report Mr Mora you have the floor uh thank you Mr Mayor I continue to work with your manager on an array of issues um though I was not in attendance at your last work session I'm producing the revisions to The Limited revisions to the sign code discussed we have the resolution tonight concerning uh parking charges on my office and and my colleagues have worked on your Park mobile contract review and other similar issues um otherwise continue to work through issues and remain in contact with your manager I would say on a daily basis but that doesn't really do it justice since we talked two to three times a day but any issues that you folks have questions about I'm happy to answer Council yes what is the next process on 105 8th Street and when is the hearing going to be scheduled is that the same topic we were discussing earlier sir the last uh the last place where we left that I had a discussion a lengthy discussion on Thursday with his Council I committed with his legal counsel I can committed to him to meet and discuss this matter with the manager this week and provide him at least from the city's perspective where matters stand we need to determine what the applicable restrictions are with the code if any as it relates to permitting and also what what questions we have substantively about this particular operation on this particular antenna and the specifics of the property so there's not a hearing date set at the moment to answer your question and there's nothing in the near future no so that's not true why there's a I've already told I've as I've stated I intend to speak with their attorney today if you're asking me if there's a code enforcement hearing scheduled there is not if you're asking me if there's a board of adjustment hearing scheduled there is not what we need to determine is what best what procedure is most appropriate and the procedure will be by the work product that comes out of our out of our exchanges not everything is predetermined and that'll be by week 10. my aim is by weeks then to have a path forward I'm I've committed to get information as has his counsel um the process is not as fixed and uh concrete as uh your questions seem to desire it to be other questions or comments from the council no Mr Mora uh thank you uh very much for uh for your patience and uh and we uh anticipate hearing something good soon on this topic right now we are moving on to item nine which is the city manager's report Mr riesler take it away thank you mayor mayor and Council uh we are wrapping up the 12th and 13th and Bay uh stormwater project uh the last thing we did was uh called out the contractor and subcontractors or redo a curves segment on 13th Street which was not uh producing the proper fall to get the water into the terrain that is complete the contractor has requested the uh the rest of the payment or the retainage and we are closing that project this week um once I get confirmation that all liens are released for the city the uh Golf Boulevard underground project uh we we had another progress meeting on March 1st uh Duke we keep pushing Duke to tell us um try to get an update on when the material is going to be delivered and uh the Duke representative did state that they do not have a date but they will keep checking so we our permitting is right on um to be ready as soon as the material shows the Gulf of Mexico blue replacement um I actually did find a cheaper solution from American underwater contractors going back to the helical anchors they've done it in the past for us in uh talking to the contractor they felt confident that they would be able to locate the majority of the existing anchors from their experience and um you know it would be a minimum charge of where we needed to install another anchor I think that's the best way to move forward and uh I remember in 2018 when we were getting quotes the diver team was the more expensive route than doing the uh the concrete blocks but now it seems to have changed so that's positive the stormwater Improvement projects uh we had a meeting on with the citizens advisory committee on February 22nd um where a presentation of the bond issue and some term sheets pluses and positives and negatives of where we stand as a city and our ability to take on debt the CAC and we had a actual assistant resident attend the meeting as well they were all in support and making a recommendation for the chair and myself to present in the March 20th I presume um the third Monday of the month work session so that uh that is planned to be an agenda item yeah the uh code enforcement analysis uh analysis project uh continue to move forward uh continue with the change in the reporting I am getting our community services administrator more directly involved with uh just some doing some of the day-to-day um I feel like the making him familiar with the code enforcement process and the codes in general um given the amount of time that he is in the city a full full-time job that he will assist in uh producing more efficient code enforcement so looking forward to keep going with that uh I haven't heard any change on the April 14th uh shipping Day from the playground set um so we'll just wait until we get a little closer for confirmation the uh the Morgan Park parking lot it was completed on February 16th um that plan on dropping that off of it of this list as well as the we finally closed out all the POS for the uh Seawall and boat ramp replacement project the I am scheduling meetings with departments this week to uh um go over proposed budget changes we continue to work on the budget I will turn that into the financial administrator or our Financial Consultant at the end of the month to move forward we have their scheduled who is our Financial Consultant for the April meeting to present a an overall report on where we stand at the close of the last budget year and what the what changes and Things We Should um recommendations and things we should look forward to um while we start this next year's budget process um and then last uh the you're probably aware that we've been getting some more uh red tide in the area uh the health department or the State of Florida uh provided us with a uh a flyer notice on Friday it was later in the afternoon Friday and uh we we posted that uh to the recommendation um at that point there weren't very many fish on the on the beach on Saturday it was reported that that the fish kill had increased and there were fish on the beach um we went out there starting this morning to in our best efforts with our staff to start cleaning the fish picking up mainly I think they did about all besides what others we actually had residents that collected fish in their own bags they picked up those bags and then I think 11 on their own full trash bags luckily when I went out and checked on it uh at Morgan Park and about 1 30 this afternoon the tide was washing up and it significantly did decrease the amount of fish that were still laying on the beach and I did not see a larger mouth floating in the water but that all could change by tomorrow just depending on what happens we could have end up with more fish or or continue to stay uh fortunate the staff did work for Morgan Park or down south um so if the fish numbers do not increase we expect to have a a fairly significant um you know 95 percent clean up by tomorrow but we'll continue we're committed to continue to keep working on picking up the fish at the fastest uh that we can in-house I have been in contact with the county um they have not started the the outside contractors to be picking up the fish at this point and they have not started their roll off dumpster program that they did in the past where they provided the actual dumpsters for collection um just as uh uh precautionary action we did order uh a roll off dumpster's line specifically for fish from Waste Management just to have ready that's all Council Kyle um came to the council's attention that there's a disabled child around 21st Street I know Gulf Boulevard is a county-owned street or roads excuse me can we put up a sign there through this city notifying traffic and that there is a disabled child and he'd waved to them they do make those signs and I have seen them so it can be installed by our city or by that would happen it's our discretion so it would have to be brought up you know like a work session um there's no major objection maybe we take it to the work session just uh for a quick discussion to see if there's any uh other opinions but um if not I feel like it's something that would benefit that child on the street and we could do it would a motion be suitable for this Council to put up a sign there you're welcome to make any motion you'd like I like to make a motion to put up a sign maybe two signs notifying there's a disabled child handicapped child between 19th and maybe 23rd Street second by Mike zabel all in favor aye aye aye any opposed okay um I just want to clarify are you are you proposing on Gulf Boulevard or on the actual street that the child lives on between 19th and 23rd on Gulf Boulevard because oh because I don't think we can place it on Gulf Boulevard right we can place it in the neighborhood that's why that's a good point Golf Boulevard is not our right away with me yeah that was my question okay we were allowed to do it on Golf Board no we can put it on our private streets but we cannot unless I get permission from the county I can reach out and find out their stance but at minimum we can put it in the neighborhood so let's at least do that that does you can do that on your own and then work the county angle as well but at least have that yeah at least put it on 21st Street that's when they left yeah okay 21st yeah thank you vice mayor any other questions or comments yes I'm sorry yeah on that uh topic is Will can we look at maybe installing a Moby mat um and then if you can coordinate uh with our citizen out here about specifically what's wrong with you know the handrails and try to see what we can do to you know make the accommodations and again the moment basically just hits the it's where it it enters the sand the bridge but it goes out so you can actually take wheelchairs out on this man we found them seeing them over in Clearwater so you can check those out and then report back to the council which you've coordinated with see what we can support you with uh council member Sable I I will uh uh respond to that that we actually had the opportunity to have those installed for free and whenever they came and they surveyed our access as they weren't suitable for for a Moby map and maybe it was something completely different but I just want to keep keep that in mind we'll we'll look into it and we'll see what we can come up with but uh it may not it may not be a conventional solution so all right uh yes sir um kind of this the city hall generator I may have missed that did you did you bring that up I I I left it on there and there's been no change since I received the last quote for the used diesel generator okay I did not hear anything um kind of moving forward with that I just cut it off I mean I think that's a great idea what was the original budget line item for a new one the original budget was over two years we were saving 250 000 um and then when I when we first started looking into this that I um presented to you that the estimate went up to about like I think it was 260 or 270 and then we started like chipping away away for a cheaper so this would be a big saving that's great do we happen to know the specs on this particular one with regards to um how long it will run on a full tank at full power I I do have the specs so I can present that okay in the works okay that's good and also I know we had discussed previously the lining of the two pipes on the 12th and 13th Street project what's what's the status on that uh status on that is that I'd like to build it into uh the next stormwater bid that we do um to get the most competitive pricing for that so that would be the one where we're going to go out to the five projects if approved yes okay thank you any other questions or comments if not then we will move right on to city clerk's report no report this one no report I have a brief question uh Patty I don't have the handouts for tonight pardon I don't have the handouts over on the table all the city council members received handouts I did not receive handouts there's a copy here okay thank you I stole my that's [Laughter] no problem no appreciate that thanks any questions from Miss Gentry no all right thank you very much okay uh now we're up to item number eleven this is a public hearing uh this is a consideration of ordinance 23-01 Mr Mora would you please read the ordinance happily Mr Mayor of cheeks give me one moment to get that on the materials this is a second reading of the ordinance as as stated earlier within the hearing in the second hearing we are it is the final hearing or purposes of the legislative body foreign this is ordinance 23-01 an ordinance of the city council the city of Bellaire Beach Florida amending section 94-220 pertaining to the table of designated living areas and housing setbacks providing for severability and providing for an effective date this is a second and final reading ordinance 23-01 thank you Mr Miller let's go to Citizen comments evening councilman mayor my name is Mark Pope and a resident of 523 Belle Isle Avenue um thank you mrzabel for the detailed notes from the last council meeting we were unable to attend uh the reading by title only of this ordinance my comments are going to cut across a couple of points real quickly first of all after detailed analysis of the table I could not understand uh the kind of arbitrary nature of the setbacks by lot differences and secondly I did not see any commentary that we had done any benchmarking of similar setbacks of other beach towns as well as in alignment with the setbacks recommended at the county level as a personal note our lot I measured today based on the table and my house already is over the limit um and my house was built in 1974 there's been no material changes um and I would just like to present to council that maybe we take a pause on this ordinance have a more detailed study understand how these setbacks are actually calculated and again benchmarking and or um subordinate uh difference to the county standard thank you Mr Pope uh we're going to be discussing this uh right after citizens comments and uh maybe you'll understand where we're going with this uh anyone else like to make a comment on this topic oh 523 Belle Isle I just wanted to add on to his comments around the setbacks I mean the purpose of setbacks are essentially to preserve our views between our neighbors and as we look at this I'm just looking at from a fairness perspective because there are some that are seven and a half foot some are ten foot we actually are the 10 foot and so arguably we should be happier than the seven and a half put because we have 20 feet between our neighbors but our Lots aren't that big and so if there was an opportunity where we said we wanted to add Portico something that prevents us from adding anything to our lot if we want to do any kind of improvements when we don't need 20 feet in between ours and our neighborhood our our lot and our neighbors lot to preserve our view which is really the purpose of having setbacks between your neighbors thank you Miss Pope any other comments from the citizens no okay uh before we go any further I'm going to need a motion to approve Ordinance 23-01 do I have a motion so moved ocean made by vice mayor surely do I have a second second Buy Floyd Roberts uh vice mayor you have the floor well I'm um the way I'm looking at this I think we're just cleaning up some language we're not necessarily changing anything and I may be completely off base but I'm curious to know why that's this is in the packet thank you very much for the question and the manager asked should a question come up that I address it um the setback amounts in in each of the areas identified in the table remain the same we are not actually altering any of the setback proposals by this ordinance what we are trying to resolve is confusion caused by the previous layout of the table and the scrivener's errors concerning the spelling of Bellevue the states where it was spelled with a Vue versus a v-i-e-w the format of the ordinance sets forth that in the form of the strikers and underlines given how much content was in that table it's actually called out in red text additionally which we don't typically do but what we've done here is fix the spelling and and fix the formatting to make it more clear so that the way it was reading previously Bellevue estates had different setbacks for Lots certain lot numbers which is still the case and then further down within the table it said Bellevue Estates Island and had something else and then there was a another row at the very bottom of the table that was not consistent with those and then that was leading to inconsistent results in engineering analysis citizen staff analysis of applications and in some cases those inconsistent results resulted in variances or other administrative solutions to to bring a property in compliance as to individual properties that were constructed before these Provisions those are non-conforming structures those dating back to the 60s and 70s that's a completely different analysis we are not proposing new setbacks be imposed or the demolition of any existing structures this was really to clean up the table to avoid further confusion in future applications and that's what you have before you on second reading thank you Mr Mora any other uh comments or questions on this topic sort of sort of clarify this is just language change it's what is commonly described in many ordinances as housekeeping it is an attempt to to clarify the con the existing content of the code not to impose new restrictions it's not going to impact as the citizens brought up about their lot setbacks it's not going to encroach on that as it relates to somebody's structure that has been in place since the 70s no it does not have an impact however comma if they are applying for some kind of new structure on their property those setbacks as established would certainly apply um so this does affect residents with intending to approach new development and the intended impact most directly is that they have a a clearer understanding and expectation of what they should develop there was one instance in particular where a property a property owner stock development approval staff looked at it and reached the conclusion as to one step back the engineer looked at it reached another approved something and that approved item was not consistent it was consistent with one part of the table but not the other and So to avoid that kind of confusion this this that this was again as raised last time somebody said uh I forget which one of you suggested this was a a good catch within the code and where did it come from and that came from your city manager in the course of administering um applications and saying we can't have this kind of confusion in our code and prioritizing it and again nice catch on that city manager reefler if there are no other comments or questions uh I'm going to uh ask Patty to call the roll Addie council member Banker yes council member Livingstone yes yes council member Roberts aye council members Abel hi vice mayor Shirley hi mayor goddess aye so it passes unanimously um ordinance 23-01 thank you for your uh for your work on this one Mr Moore all right now we are on to the consent agenda items 12 and 13. this is for approval of the February 6 2023 city council meeting minutes and a proclamation proclaiming the month of March 2023 as problem gambling awareness month do I have a motion to approve the consent agenda motion to approve as written motion made by Frank Banker do I have a second second second by Lloyd Roberts all in favor aye any opposed all right the consent agenda passes all right now we are to the regular agenda item number 14. uh consideration of resolution 2023-01 parking rates at city parks uh City parking lots uh Mr Mora thank you Mr Mayor this is resolution 2023-01 a resolution in city council the city of Bellaire Beach Florida mending parking pay station hourly rates at Bayside Park the community center city hall City Marina and Morgan Drive Park and establishing an effective date this is the first and only reading of resolution 2023-01 by title only this resolution as it's been put before you is is work product resulting from your work session held uh late last month just a couple weeks ago and uh this memorializes the terms of those um the law hours the parking fees of 55 per hour on weekdays in the respective lots and then ten dollars per hour on weekends and holidays and and the intended maximum limits and any free parking times I will note during your work session there was as I understand it some discussion concerning um corresponding parking fines you already have language in your code in section 58-37 and 58-38 concerning fines um in civil penalties a resolution cannot supersede an ordinance so we cannot do it that way if we are to change those we would do so uh via ordinance so that's why what you have here is just a parking rates not any um penal element to it as to what happens if you're if you're not in compliance um and and I've spoken with the manager were we to do that and what would be done by Ordinance one of the things that we're considering in in a form of Staffing should that come before you is at least an informal rate study increase of other communities as to where they are so we can make sure we're in line with that and with any two consideration to applicable uh statutes or other restrictions on what those sums can be thank you Mr Moore before we uh begin a discussion on this uh let's go to the citizens for comments would anyone like to speak on this yes sir please come up good evening uh Barry gray 108 12th Street as far as parking in this lot is this the consideration that we're under is this lot included in that yes I have a problem with on the weekends people Park here they go over to the 12th Street beach access they put up their umbrellas and by the time we get out there if we're not running out there at nine o'clock there's no place for us to go it's been taken over by people who are trespassing so um looking for remedy I think this parking lot should be closed off to any type of Outsider parking I mean you're you're you're precluding us from having uh enjoyment of our Beach and bathing purposes so um that would be my comment about this lot thank you Mr Gray any other comments from the citizens yes Debbie mall115 Causeway I I would agree uh with Barry gray with his comments I I think we have to have parking here though I believe for Beach for nourishment is that correct so perhaps we can at least on the weekends make it more expensive um so that we deter people from two different things they come here they'll Park they'll take their umbrellas and things and they put them up there and then they will go park across the bridge one person will and then come back or they just leave them there the whole day and as Barry said if we're not down there by 10 o'clock you aren't getting an umbrella up on the weekends thank you thank you any other comments from the citizens nope all right now we are to the council before we get started on this conversation I'm going to need a motion to approve this resolution so moved second who made the first one Mike made it Mike did okay and then Frank and then Frank all right Mr Abel you have the floor uh just yeah absolutely addressing your comments uh used to be four dollars and five dollars uh we moved it for excuse me uh five dollars during the weekday to ten dollars so basically more than doubling it um to uh basically try to find the pain threshold if you have a parking decal you're good these are for the outside people and also want to clear something up right here in front of everybody we're not stopping on street parking we'll always have that you just call you know City Hall arrange it uh but uh again we more than doubled it to ten dollars an hour so that's I I don't know we talked about that it's more than uh area uh parking charges Lloyd Roberts I just want to clarify so Mrs Mall when you were saying that were you envisioning that let's say we made it a hundred dollars an hour so people wouldn't park there you're saying they would typically drive here drop off their crew then go back across the bridge so okay so you're saying that even if we yeah even if we made it uncomfortable they're typically going to find another way to do that by dropping off the crew put the umbrellas out and going back across the bridge getting somebody a bicycle or getting a taxi or one of those other companies to bring them back over and they're still going to steal the spots in the beach so okay yeah and unfortunately uh there's really nothing we can do about it because we we gave up our rights as a private beach to accept each nourishment I might disagree with that statement I don't think that we shouldn't be incentivizing people to park in our lots and use our accesses and by keeping our part our parking fees are considerably less than of each at Clearwater Beach by doing that we are incentivizing people to park here instead of there so if we will hit whatever the pain threshold is at least deter them I realize we probably can't stop everybody but I think we can reduce the problem to some extent thank you miss Mom can I just add I think that's what we're trying to do is kind of deter people from coming to the beach because we have the same issue at Morgan Park where you just can't even get a parking spot you know that's where we have facilities if you want to go to the park with your grandchildren where you have a restroom facility they can use you can't get a parking spot there and we don't have any reserve residential spaces it's the same problem up and down the beach so we're trying to raise these rates High Enough to deter people from being at the beach too long to we're putting some time limits on it but I noticed on this proposal as we as we talk about that do we need to have the limits on uh Bayside Park and City Hall I was going to make that suggestion because we originally did we didn't we weren't really aware that it was a problem uh uh more than you know at 10 bucks an hour all day long I I'd really I didn't Envision anyone being here all day long but for a hundred bucks it may may be worth it to someone to be here for 10 hours um what does the council what does the council think on uh putting limits on it just like we have with uh the marina and Morgan Park I I would be for that I think it I think it should have a limit on it because then it's going to deter the people from bringing their tents and coolers and staying all day which seems to be a big issue I would say uh does he have his stand up yes sir Mr Gray um they're going to get there um I think the solution is like Belair Shore has in in their uh ordinance that they have they can ask these people who are setting up behind their houses whether they're in the um below the wet sand or whatever um if they're residents and if they're not they make them leave now if these people from who knows where they come from set up in our lot are we uh able to call the police and have them prove that their residents here I don't believe that's the case because we have Public Access okay it's not that the public access on in our areas is not as wait you're talking about 12th well well maybe the Sixth Street 12th Street I think once they get onto the beach there's not really anything we can do about it in the area that is to set up and down but if they're now sitting in what has been designated I'm going to interrupt you right now I I don't think that we're prepared to answer those questions uh I think what's going to require some more research and maybe we will um we'll have this discussion in a work session and see if we can get more information uh from our City attorney and uh it's just not a topic we're prepared to discuss at this moment um uh right now we're we're trying to focus on uh parking rates and securing a new uh metering system for parking so um I I very much appreciate your comments and I would like to to move on um so we're back to the um to the Limit the time limit on the um on on the parking rates I'm gonna need a motion if someone wants to reduce those motion motion made by Frank Banker do I have a second I'm sorry Mr Mayor what is the nature of the motion the motion is to amend the resolution I'm sorry I should have asked for clarification three hours yeah as to Bayside Park and that's the city hall correct I think that that would be uh yeah across the board and I don't mean to be rude I understood that's where you're going I just want to clear in the record that that's the motion on the floor okay and did we have a second second made by Jody Shirley uh Mr Banker do you have the floor um I I think this helps I don't think it cures it I mean I I agree with you Mr Mayor about a work session to address other problems the electric bikes are a big thing now at 12th and 6th Street we make our residents pay for a city tag but these electric bikes is the one resident says take up uh parking benches and everything like that it's it's a matter to be discussed tomorrow or the next day but um I think a three hour limit will help I agree um you know and also this will uh definitely be a good trial balloon for uh their pain threshold as uh uh as uh one of the citizens said and also as uh Mike zabel brought up um if it continues to be a problem and we're just completely overwhelmed with people that uh have no problem paying thirty dollars and then moving on um uh we may raise it even higher so we'll just see where that goes um any other comments on uh changing the limits uh the hour limits on parking at Bayside and City Hall so I know we discussed this at the workshop so if I'm online parked and my three hours are up does anything preclude me from coming back and paying for an additional three hours well you wouldn't come back because there's no physical machine you would just open your app but we're we with this resolution we will be blocking the ability of them to renew their three hours so three hours and then you can't do the old chalk thing on the tire move it up forward it's you're locked exactly exactly with the current system we would not have been able to do that that's right maybe just come back and put more money in correct they're going okay nope yep just your driveway okay so um any other comments on this time limit uh motion before we uh continue forward okay so my my motion's still on there to vote to approve okay as amended now yeah so uh all in favor of amending resolution 2023.01 all right so uh you're making those changes and now we're back to uh we we don't need a motion to for the amended uh what we're we're still on the motion on the floor to adopt the um ordinance you've now moved and approved to amend so you revert back to the most to the original of the ordinance and with the understanding that it would be approved as amended okay perfect okay any other discussion on uh approving this resolution as amended oh we're going to need a uh need you to call the roll Patty council member Banker yes councilmember Livingstone yes council member Roberts council members able aye vice mayor Shirley aye mayor goddess aye so the resolution passes unanimously and we have new parking rates right now we are on to item number 15. uh this is to authorized city manager to execute a piggyback agreement with parkmobile LLC this was placed on the agenda by city manager riepler uh take it away sir this uh this agenda item is a follow-up of our discussion we had in the work session a couple weeks or week and a half ago um this uh I've been in contact with Park Mobile they were able to uh provide the piggyback agreement from St Petersburg I worked diligently with uh Attorney Morris colleague Mr uh essenfeld and uh we uh we we revised the contract to to the attorney's liking uh they were agreeable with all the Amendments that we did so we are we're comfortable and with reviewing the contract make sure it legally suffices for the city's needs um there's a whole background uh We've we've had a I couldn't find the exact date of how long we've we've actually owned a parking me I know it's over 13 years um the way our financial system we're we're operating on a QuickBooks and it only went back that far um without searching um through some of our records um so we've had that we we own all the meters uh we have four meters we own we own them uh and we purchased them in order of Bayside Park the marina Morgan and City Hall was the most recent I know that went in in 2018 because I helped install it um so the uh the manual parking meters uh you know throughout my experience with them they uh they require frequent maintenance um and staff time uh they just do not hold up well probably do better in some environments that aren't so close to saltwater air but we uh we constantly are spending time replacing parts and troubleshooting them and so this was presented in the work session this is a recap and we did an analysis of the revenue and expenditures um showing at least that we would break even if not profit more we're quite certain that the profits will the margin will increase now that we've uh approved increasing the parking rates um and then I I just wanted to include uh if this is approved I will pursue selling the existing assets of which are the parking meters back to the vendor um to recoup some some cost back to the city thank you uh before we bring it back to the council let's go to the citizens for comments would anyone like to make a comment on uh bringing in Park Mobile and replacing our our existing parking meters oh all right back to the council we're going to need a motion to authorize the city manager to execute an agreement with Park Mobile second and the second was made by Frank Banker Mr Sable you have the floor okay going back uh Park Mobile we at all um voted unanimously to select Kyle as a city manager but many didn't know is that he was spending quite a bit of time doing the maintenance on these machines including running out finding Parts trying to get it repaired and we all said we want to give them all the tools available to make them successful and one of those was removing excess work um that's what we're doing with this Park Mobile plan uh he just alluded to yeah we did the spreadsheet um we're looking forward to at least a small profit but that was based on four dollars an hour um coupled with the savings as stood with four dollars and they were talking the increases to five during the weekday and 10 during the weekend um look forward to a pretty uh solid profit off this move so again thank you Cal for hitting this up running down all the numbers and uh your diligence in this matter any other comments from the Council on this yes yeah I just want to clarify I think this decision with parkmobile is a great decision but I don't want to um confuse people by the fact that Mrs Abel just talked about increasing the prices clearly we could have done the same thing with the existing systems so the profit would have been there as well but the part mobile mobile decision is a good decision I just don't want people to think that well wow because we got the part mobile we can increase the prices and we couldn't do that before clearly we could yeah the uh the key with Park Mobile though is yeah you can increase both but under this system you can stop like we just said the Max hours you can't do that with the other system yeah I was just clarifying the cost yeah no I got you but thank you though well we actually did have maximum hours but you you use maximum you could feed the meter yeah and then I had to go back and you were able to walk back to paper and and it uh just so happened to work out that was bathroom time right it wasn't risky any inconvenience that was birthday cake yeah yeah thanks any other comments before we take this to a vote oh all right Patty would you please call the roller council member Banker yes council member Livingstone yes council member Robert aye council members able aye vice mayor Shirley aye mayor goddess aye so again it passes unanimously uh Mr reefler you are authorized to proceed and engage with parkmobile LLC mayor before we proceed through the agenda if I may ask your Indulgence on a procedural matter um respectfully requesting that we reopen the hearing on resolution 2023-01 on the parking fees and um I as I review it I noticed that while it states in the title that it provides an effective date I believe somewhere in the draft and transmission that that language fell off and I would just like to indulge the commission or Council rather to amend the resolution further to State the resolution shall take effect immediately upon adoption so that there's no misunderstanding as to that fact yes so moved I think someone needs to initiate yeah like to make a motion to uh place the effective date on the amended resolution and we motion made by Mike Sable seconded by Frank bankard all in favor um yeah since we have to take public comment as it's an official act and just specify click clarify members able your your suggesting that resolution 2023-01 has adopted be further amended to add language stating that it would take effect immediately upon adoption is that correct that is correct there's a motion and a second on the floor Mr Mayor we just take any public comment before we pass on the matter all right citizens from the citizens back to the council any comments from the council uh I think we're gonna have to do this by roll call vote anyway council member Banker yeah council member Livingstone yes councilmember Roberts aye council member stable aye vice mayor Shirley aye mayor guys hi and so the amended amended resolution passes unanimously thank you Council all right we are now up to unfinished business number 16. any unfinished business can I just add something that I think was created um as a result of this and that is creating the ordinance or modifying the fine ordinance for the parking um is that something that we can have prepared pretty quickly I mean at the next can we vote on that at the next meeting or is that something you can prepare for the next meeting we were pretty on point of what we wanted and I think it was the gentleman that was filling your shoes actually made some recommendations based on what was recently passed in neighboring communities uh and um in as much as there were representations about increased uh fines in um specifically Indian Rocks Beach that I I don't believe that to be totally accurate he provided some insight on some figures I think ultimately the community abandoned uh some of that fee structure as part of how the parking discussion evolved and then dissipated um but that said we can move as quickly as this body wishes to move uh what one we just could not supersede the ordinance by resolution and then two I want to make sure that you folks have whatever information you you deem necessary whether that takes the form of Staffing on first reading I know this community likes to to work session items and you've worked session you did have a work session on it um I've had some discussions with the manager since that work session But ultimately I'll defer to his direction as to how on what timeline whose word product and what the Staffing on that looks like um I already had a discussion with my staff about collecting uh the local rates that are being charged and how quickly we can put that together we feel like we can get that done for the work session okay so then we can have that discussion and then move forward from there okay thank you great any other unfinished business oh okay uh well it's now time for Council comments and I went to the computer opened up the randomizer program and this month it picked council members is able to start us off I love the randomizer hey I want to call out uh councilman Roberts uh the indication is going well so uh thank you for your uh recommendation and carrying it out thank you all right next up is council member Roberts all right of course I want to thank everybody who stayed this late uh that earlier made comments about the the traffic issues that we have up there I know there's one thing that we can all agree on I hope which is the current scenario that's going on up there is not perfect we all know that we live through it every day against the city council I mean by workshops because this has kind of in my swing plane as a civil engineer a professional engineer if I could pursue taking a look at what's going on out there today meet with the county and talk through some different options so we did that I did that I met with the director of Transportation with the county a nice gentleman uh Tom Washburn one of the things that he recommended that we're going to do I know Kyle is working on it is the study that was done a few years ago that resulted in the infamous double left-hand turn lane um is up for kind of a renew they typically wait a couple of years to go back we view it again hire another outside consultant doesn't cost us any money at all and their objective is to see how well is that current system working based on the original study so they're going to do that we talk about many things there's many many options available out there I can assure you the following and typically count a transportation departments will do this I'll make sure they do this that before any decisions are made they will come up here and have like an open house sometimes multiple open houses because they'll have the first one to say after the study after receiving input from the citizens and trust me when I talk about some of the options it was because citizens called and talked to me about what's going on up here so those type of an open house will take place where the citizens have an opportunity we'll probably have it right in here they'll have big white boards up and different things like that to show you graphically what some of the options are where you will have input to say hey I like that or I think that's terrible and here's why and then they'll talk through it they'll typically come back with another one with updated data and information unless the first one everybody said that's perfect which is unlikely um so that so that's where we are that's where we are today I feel I feel bad that some of our citizens like you guys got uh rolled up into this because of some emails that went out by a council member that kind of gave opinions and summaries it would have been better for that not to happen now the council member says hey um we're talking about these things and if you want to refer to um some of the videos out there the tapes I recommend you look at minute 11 or something like that it may be interesting to you that's fine but when we're saying things out there that may or may not be completely accurate or completely um finished with regards to what's going on that causes problems and it causes citizens to get excited about things that they don't have to because nothing's going to happen I assure you until we've studied this thing and have come out with better ideas I know for example there were some comments made about everybody who loves the uh blinking yellow light as do I and most citizens in this city you can't have that with two left-hand turn lanes and not have it it's against traffic rules the only way we can get back the Blinky yellow turn light is to have a single turn lane so that's just one fact that that's out there so there's multiple ways to take a look at this and and we will do that and that that's what I'm doing now um I study it every day every day when I drive through there I when I'm coming from Saint Pete and heading north it's interesting to me the last couple of times I've had I was the first car to stop at the traffic light so I get to watch and this would typically be about five o'clock 5 30. watch the vehicles coming to the South both of them turning to the left nobody follows the white uh dash line everybody's cutting this way my biggest concern is it's not even the potential traffic crash problem of the vehicles I'm thinking more of if somebody's on the right hand side as they're making that left-hand turn somebody on the inside bumps them and God forbid there's somebody walking on that sidewalk with a child or by themselves and that vehicle jumps the curb that's what I'm most concerned about so I I know it is a better solution out there there has to be and that's what I'm working towards but again you have my Assurance we're not we're not going to make this blindly I don't know how the current scenario was approved previously you know in Amsterdam County I said well how did you guys do this before I think he told me well he met with the city manager and the mayor they discussed it and the decision was made so we're going to do better than that this time we're going to make sure the citizens are involved if they see pictures they know what's going to happen and they have an opportunity to tell us whether or not that meets your desires thank you thank you Mr Roberts Now we move on to council member Livingstone thank you thank you councilmember Roberts for that explanation I think you did a very good summary thank you what took place um thank you for coming this evening and thank you for your comments we do take those very seriously I want to thank council member bankert for moving forward with the request for the disabled child thank you very much for that so before the comment thank you and now we're up to council member Banker for the record I was not attacking the mayor in fact actually I noted the impact of residents supporting you and I don't believe that would be an intact but before I know the tower infraction and it is a tower it's not an antenna we discussed in length toilet water pipe gurgling in homes both could be messy but this is a nine month problem that could kill somebody and that's why I was passionate in my plea there was no attack to you you've done nothing but been a gentleman to me since I've since you've taken office hopefully I've returned the same to you um I want to really she left but I I really wanted to thank the Parts director uh last month we had a pet supply drop off for the Pinellas County um it loaded up my back of my pickup truck and uh they were so grateful for all the stuff things that these fine residents hopefully will have another one but it it was very very touchy with all the stuff we got now I don't want to be the Cockroach on the Christmas turkey here but anything that we do to offset this traffic problem for tourists it's only going to make it worse okay if you have tourists coming from Clearwater and they see an easy way now out of Bellaire Beach we're going to get more tourists using that area this is a this is about a 60-day problem we face every year come may we won't even be talking about this until next march or next February leave it alone I think I think just leave it alone that island is beautiful uh that crosswalk is very necessary I try Crossing at that Causeway number of times I have a councilwoman there right next to me she knows it's a hazard that Causeway crosswalk I think we just should leave it alone that's all I have to say thank you all right now we are up to Max mayor Shirley thank you um so I attended the mayor's luncheon um this past week and the league of the Florida League of cities did a legislative update as they enter into that season and it was there they went through a number of bills that are um being discussed right now and and several things to kind of watch for and one once again is the SB 714 is short-term rental which is um actually being supported by uh desiglia um so just kind of some things that you know naming these bills just some for residents and other council members to take a look at there was one they talked about which really affects [Music] um every community in in the state and it's HB 617 or excuse me 671 in SB 682 and it's the league is recommending opposing but it's uh regarding building permits and they're requiring that building permits uh be approved in a very short amount of time really and and if the city can't get it done then there's there are consequences so just some things to look at there um also some things to Land Development code and then I guess just for Council Members this is important that the the league is now offering Monday mornings 9 A.M a call in um you can just call get a live update of what's Happening really probably a good thing for all of us to take a look at and then this is something I would like for maybe Patty we could have available to Residents and it's um you can scan it but it's the league of cities has put together Florida Legal cities has put together um Citizens Voice information so you can go on here take a look at they've got a little QR code you can scan um give you updates and information on what we can do to keep governmental decisions at a local level to give this the cities more autonomy to make their own decisions rather than state level and there is a big push to take City rights away from cities and put it up at a state level so um maybe Patty can get these I'll leave these with you Patty and then you know anyone wants to scan it now they could definitely do that but that's uh I think oh I guess I just one more um couple other quick quick comments is um bike racks I know there was a question about whether we could have bike racks I know we talked about this before getting more event park benches at the beach accesses I don't know if the bike racks I mean I know it sounds like a great idea maybe if we put them out towards the gates or something and not down where the park benches are because this then just gives those same umbrella users at that beach access more access to the if you give them a place to tie their bike up they'll bring them on carts they'll bring whatever they need for the beach for that day and then now they have full access so I don't know if we're creating a problem or not but we might want to look at bike racks and have some discussion about that at the next work session I think that's it thank you for coming y'all um Let me let me comment on the bike racks uh I for some reason I thought that we were moving the bike racks into the parking lot away from the beach entirely did that not happen remember that we were going to add more benches and according to the gentleman that was here tonight nothing has been done is I thought we had we had benches we were just going to relocate them uh I remember us discussing yeah I never got approval from Bel Air Shore so I'll reach out again um to tell them the plan and as far as adding the benches there's no bike rack there okay okay all right I I know we talked about possible locations for a bike rack but uh if if uh the residents aren't using them uh then probably no need to have them anyway but I I don't know if the residents are using them I know that we I see people riding bikes all the time but I don't know if they take them to the beach so make time to the bench that's the problem so then the bench hat then you can't sit on the bench because they've got them right absolutely yeah okay I just wasn't sure if that was us or if that was other communities right gotcha okay so I'll follow up with Billerica too you've not contacted them yet about this is that right I I had like a preliminary discussion only with the the Bel Air Shore clerk oh I see I just move it forward okay all right Perfect all right uh so uh last month I uh I I mentioned the beach nourishment and uh the the problems we've been having uh where it looks like we're not going to get Beach nourishment at least not through the Army Corps of Engineers and the uh the Fed so um I have been working with um with mayor from North Readington Beach uh Bill Queen and also the mayor from Indian Shores uh Pat Serrano and what we've been doing is we've been meeting with all of the County Commissioners to say you're collecting a bad tax and it's reserved for us for Beach nourishment well you're saving all this money so I need you to start coming up with a plan B because right now what they're doing is nothing they've just been sitting on the money and um and and hoping that they don't have to spend it instead they uh they they get money from the federal government uh the the truth is I don't think it's going to happen but um anyway I met with uh Dave Eggers today uh he's on board uh with with trying to uh do it ourselves rather than relying on the Army Corps so whenever I say ourselves I mean the uh the county so he's on board I spoke with Kathleen Peters uh met with her about a week ago she's on board Janet long she's slightly reluctant but she is on board um also the day that vice mayor Shirley was at the mayor's Council she was sitting in for me because at that time I was meeting with Senator Ed Hooper uh to find out if uh what the appropriate path would be to get more State funds to sweeten the pot for the county to want to do this so as it stands right now we the FED would do 60 percent the county does 20. the state does 20 and what I asked Senator Hooper for was to continue matching whatever it is we have to spend well obviously we're not going to get that but you always ask for more and hopefully you get some of it instead of uh none of it so um I know that uh uh Senator desigley is not exactly uh our favorite person because of the short-term rentals but he is also another person that I'll be meeting with soon uh to have the same conversation about State funding and uh and then also uh city manager riesler joined me and we went to the tourist Pinellas tourist Development Council uh combined with a Pinellas uh Board of County Commissioners meeting and that gave me the opportunity to to speak to every one of the Commissioners one by one and introduce them to our new city manager so I I think that we're making some progress on this uh possibility of the county actually stepping up and doing what's right which is to protect the cash cow that pays for baseball stadiums and sports complexes and things like that which is uh where a lot of that money goes to so if you reinvest into the beaches then the money will come back uh and and not only just for right now the the keep hoping that the FED is going to do something and and actually say nah we'll give you another pass and we'll do your nourishment again that's plan a and I don't believe that's ever gonna gonna happen uh Plan B uh that we're we're discussing and now I'm actually getting people to say Plan B which is really kind of cool is that they look at the emergency spots that need sand we're one of them uh Bel Air beaches one North Redington Beach is the other on and it's only Sand Key that's being ignored right now uh by the Army Corps because of those uh those people that will never ever sign those easements uh so um then there's a plan C also which would take a serious look at hardening our beaches so that we don't need uh renourishment as often it's always going to move but eventually uh if if the county will will do the right thing and actually get this project started instead of every five to seven years we may not need nourishment but maybe every 10 years um so we'll see how that goes um but anyway I have uh a couple more meetings coming up uh with uh with various people and we'll see if we can uh see if we can get them to to get this project started also speaking of the tourist development uh the tourist Development Council it was recommended because I attended that meeting that The Big C actually has a delegate that's supposed to be going to that meeting and Reporting back to the Big C well they're not doing anything and so I believe they're going to put me in place to go and sit in on these meetings so that I can actually make sure that Sand Key is actually being taken care of because normally the the uh the County Commission they're going to move on whatever recommendations are made by the tourist Development Council and um we need a voice there so um that's enough about this uh Beach nourishment I don't think that I have anything else to discuss at this time other than I'd like to thank everyone for coming out tonight and for those that if there's anyone still watching on uh on their computers at home thank you for attending uh with that being said do I have a motion motion made by Frank bankard and do I have a second yeah all right all in favor aye any opposed all right good night everyone Senator Lloyd community building the mayor we're all eyes"
