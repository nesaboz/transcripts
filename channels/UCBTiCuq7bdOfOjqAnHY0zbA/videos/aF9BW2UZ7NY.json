    "transcript": "this meeting is now coming towards a special counsel meeting please rise which stands for [Music] council members thank you peggy all right we have uh one item on the agenda tonight and that is to uh have a discussion and review the city budget and how it aligns with the city's the city's i strategic plan bring your budget a strategic plan i specifically remember i made this request i knew that glenn gunn smeared him was far more experienced with this particular topic so um i requested that he present the media and so uh without any further delay thank you vice chairman okay thank you sorry for the technical difficulties here there's been a huge amount of time along with this and that is not my goal tonight the goal of tonight's uh presentation [Music] but i hope to fly through it [Music] microsoft back in the early 2000s they did a uh an infographic and they said you know in the early 2000s the human retention spin dropped from 12 seconds to 8 seconds that was the bad news but it got even worse because they they said that the attention span of goldfish in nine seconds so uh i put together a magic lantern show here so we can hopefully keep you engaged on some of this stuff at any time you have any questions don't hesitate to ask i will try to engage some of you by asking questions okay because what we need to do is try to baseline how everybody thinks about certain things especially the budgeting how we're going to approach issues within the city it doesn't mean we're always going to come to the same conclusion or that we're always going to vote the same way or where that's a given hey when we walk out here we're all big boys that's that's the way we do business you say your words you have your moment you try to convince the other people if it doesn't work it doesn't work that's where we're at here this is a uh the uh strategic plan uh originally it came about in 2019 and there was pushback from the existing council event they didn't understand it they didn't know why they wanted to do it they said that the uh the annual fiscal plan review uh covered everything the planning and zoning they uh helped me out with the comprehensive comprehensive plan covered everything we didn't need a strategic plan not quite sure why that was that way but we pushed it through it should be noted here that lynn reeves and i work closely with using the strategic plan many of the updates are about to see took place as late as march and may of this year this briefing was actually initiated back in the march time frame between lynn and i in preparation to get the new council up to speed and also to incorporate their uh their new ideas in their agenda adjusting today from uh updating we're not going to do anything all we're going to do today is i'm going to do a quick review of this thing and we're going to emphasize the budget process in these things so we should be able to speed through this we're not going to be reinventing the goals or priorities or whatever we're just going to kind of review how some of this stuff came about and baseline was that we just moved forward we're not trying to spend a lot of time we would need another day possibly a couple days to actually build these goals so where i'm going to start i'm going to start at the end of this thing if you were to go through all the slides in the initial presentation of the next thing would be the very end but we're going to go ahead and streamline today's process so we're going to jump kind of to the end of this thing and so again back as as early as march time frame lynn reason i sat down and tried to put new objectives to the strategic plan one of them was after the march 2022 installation of the new council we were going to devote a work session to review and update this thing because we were well aware that new council would be bringing their own personal agents they had new fresh ideas that we wanted to incorporate that captured but again we're not dealing with updates today we're just going to emphasize the budget process the strategic plan what it why is it this is a list the laundry list of stuff that the strategic plan is supposed to accomplish for us okay but the thing to note here is at the end of the day is about making smart business-like decisions and prioritizing limited resources but there's a couple other things in this list we need to walk away with okay one is it's a shared vision we all have a common baseline of how we think about the priorities what the issues are within baylor beach and how we're going to address this if we want a common shared vision of how we're going to approach this stuff and lastly it institutionalizes a process we never had a strategic plan before this is capturing it because we're not here bella beach was here before us it's going to be here long after us and it provides continuity so that as the staff changes out as the council members change out this thing is frozen in how we do business any questions about any of that so far is this the first time that you've ran the strategic plan as part of the budget process that's a good question and and you'll i'll flash up the chronology and say okay so this the original thing was signed in 2019 and no it has never really been reviewed beforehand and i'll i'll get through some of the the timeline on this thing we've kind of gone through the motions we made a quick you know like literally 30 minutes we're waiting pretty much really business research senators we checked the blog saying hey strategic plan before budget classes or has there ever really been any in-depth hold back reviewing the assumptions reviewing these trends and weaknesses last three years were loaded with distractions distractions beat up time unfortunately at the beginning of this term we started off with a lot of distractions uh city manager city attorney um all these things are coming up so um now if you look at this history of the strategic plan what you're going to see is there's a huge gap from when it was implemented in 2019 and then we went through a council where nothing was done i mean we gave it lip service and one of the things that really prompted enacting this thing as the original council went out in 2018-2019 was your predecessor wanted to put a complete stop to the strategic plan and yet he really he did nothing your predecessor did nothing about the strategic plan so looking back 2020 hindsight it was fortuitous that the outgoing council ahead of them actually enacted something otherwise we would have nothing so there were some big gaps in there on the previous slide you said it provides continuity and then you said as leadership and staff change so when that happens when leadership and staff changes obviously the whole strategic plan could change right then well i the way i envision this works is you by resolution adopt a strategic plan okay and that's in effect for the city if the entire council was to get wiped out on a bus trip down to the county the incoming would still have a strategic plan sure now they can go in and change it hey what were these knuckleheads thinking of when they gave us these priorities right but and i'll get to that a little bit later on you know the original intent of this thing and if you look at the original document the intent was for this thing to be reviewed on a regular basis well what happened was we just went through a charter review lately that was yanked to just on a frequent basis of recurring basis where's the requirement i couldn't buy anything any ordinance for us to follow us because as you said it was adopted in 19 put together in 18. uh i brought up the last work session about safety into the teaching plan that he said what happened father so is this more of a new like she's going through this exercise tonight and when we don't feel it because i've dealt with so many agencies or strategic plans and they use it with their benefit [Music] [Music] well i think you've got a good point and it points out a weakness in this whole thing and the mentality is you're dealing with a family of plans here because what you're going to see is the strategic plan is the foundation for things like the capital improvement plan the budget process and all that and it ties in and it's kind of an intuitive linkage and maybe some people can't connect the dots on that thing if you look for the emphasis on using this it's actually in the strategic plan document and you're right maybe one to follow on things one of the next things we have to do is you have to put some uh legitimacy behind this thing didn't we just do that in in the last charter review i thought we said we incorporated the strategic plan in there we incorporate it may be incorporated but where's the mandatory requirement to follow the charter the charter the city charter says you will basically conduct business according to the strategic plan i all council understand prior that we haven't followed it no i think because the commitment was there we have this thing let's use it as a guideline for how we think about stuff are we tied to it absolutely well i think we're tied to it now more than we were a couple of years ago because during the last charter review verbiage was added to the charter to say hey you've got a strategic plan use it and also it will be updated on this frequency can i just add that i generally keep a copy of it in my binder if i have a hard copy then a breaker with me i have it open before the meeting almost every meeting i review it constantly because there are some gentle reminders of how we're supposed to be doing business so i mean that it is a guideline for us to follow i i'm not sure why someone would think it isn't well yeah and i guess what i'm seeing here is and that's a good question that so the question of why this thing hasn't been adopted and embraced the way i think it was meant to be was because and here's the question for you is it indicative of a lack of commitment or a lack of understanding of the significance well it's a 12-page document and i think it's too hard to read i mean it's just okay the original 2019 was a very thin document but what you're going to see is that right now that's all we have yes okay so that's but if you'll let me if you give me a little more time i'll show you how and who has been using it because while i'm detecting some pushback and some lack of visibility on what this thing has done and accomplished for us i think i'm going to bring that out and hopefully you'll kind of understand maybe maybe maybe not okay so uh okay so a follow-on question is is there's a huge gap here where nothing was ever done with the strategic plan some people understand it embrace it other people don't care the initial review from the 2018-2019 was what is it what value is it well if you study uh fortune 500 companies it's a best practice embraced by successful companies and businesses so the question is will will that be the same legacy for discounts hey in action on the strategic plan and forgive you know you've seen it it's not doing anything i don't know so this was the initial 2019 document it was a very very thin document and i'm just going to kind of run through this thing there was a 2025 draft that was never fully adopted we've given it a lot of lip service people like talking about strategic plans as a matter of fact people in their campaign speeches i've i've listened to them on the internet during uh meet the council night and guess what oh they talk about strategic plans we give it a lot of lip service because it's the buzzword of the day but when it comes to actually using it and knowing how to employ it hey i don't have time because i've got stuff to do and i've gotta i've got an agenda let's move forward uh let's see okay 2019 to 2024 the original strategic plan spanned five years what's the significance of that why was that that way because again it's a family of plans and what you want to do is you want to forecast and always have some idea what you're looking at for the next five years the single is supposed to be revised and updated on an annual basis we had a five-year plan we're we're almost halfway through that thing right now so we need to kind of update some of that stuff and we're going to kind of look at some of that stuff here shortly uh again the charter review committee pushed back on the idea of doing this annually again i i don't know why maybe it was just hey we're busy we don't have time to do as well you know if you don't have a plan how are you going to get there if you don't have a plan interval is going to take you there okay so here's some examples of what's been going on in the background based on the strategic plan that you haven't seen okay so here's a couple things we four did some forecasting of the budget revenues operating expenditures and reserves in the out years this was done in 2020 we looked at the reserve burn rate of this thing this is what pushed us towards storm water fees because we looked at our our reserves we started forecasting ahead at the burn rate of our reserves as we tried to knock out capital improvements and guess what we not we burned up our reserves by 2024. so this was the emphasis this is one of those things that emphasized looking ahead and forecasting your budget in the out years we stood here and watched the pinellas coast fire department show us their forecast five years ahead hell they even had one 20 years on head we haven't done this we haven't done any of this since 2020. it's it's a very very simple process hey we've got the projected expenditures based on some assumptions we make we've got total projected revenues based on assumptions we make and there's a gap the expenditures are above the revenues and that's what's causing the burn of your reserves and that's what happens so it was able to focus us on the priorities and looking ahead we we now had a methodology for prioritizing capital improvement projects and improvements never before had we looked at dividing these things out and prioritizing them based on the goals and priorities set by the council it was just hey what makes sense right now let's do it so we came up with a way of analyzing all of these things and here's some of the things we we had a methodology of how we were going to prioritize these things and then we were also going to look at how it rated or aligned with the priorities set by the strategic plan you can see we we even factored in such things as where what was the funding source for this stuff because obviously you can move up a project in priority for spending somebody else's money to do it if we had pennies money for a project or we have an assessment guess what we can move up the other driving project and then build a state's island because we're not spending city money so i mean there are a lot of moving parts of this thing and it was only then that we started looking at this stuff and figuring out whether or not it all made sense part of it is sanity sharing stuff okay so what you see by the brackets there is we we look at what is the primary and secondary strategic plan goal that is supported by this this project and does it make sense you see some orange spaces there where there's a mismatch okay so it helps you identify areas that the goals and objectives of the strategic plan say it should be here but it's not it's not lining up now that doesn't automatically stop where it is in the priority queue it's just to flag a disparity so that we can examine it and say why is that and we can all have some debate about this the other aspect of this thing is it allowed us to develop sequences and timelines for this thing this these are the storm water projects and for the first time we were able to break these things out by the projects and focus on when those projects were going to kick in and announce now that this hasn't been redone since we've seen these astronomical prices for these things this was a very easy chart that we uploaded to our website and they got a lot of attention and traction there because for the first time people could look in this at the website and say hey where's my street being doing i notice i'm doing uh storm water repairs on these streets where am i so real quick without going to a lot of time or details so what was the criteria that was used for sequencing the store-bought projects what did we use for that for example we skipped ninth street we went to 12th and 13th and then i recently saw the next one the 17th 18. yeah park was based on historical experience with those streets and what we did was we set three different levels of severity in the problem one was hey you're damaging homes and personal property two is the street is impassable for say 24 hours and the third was the streets impassable for a certain length of time but it resolves itself within saying in one to three hours so that was the initial cut on how we prioritize this thing and then it was a matter of sequencing things with the budget is your buck blurry do we have that data so if someone was to ask me can lloyd can you show me why this street's being done first and what what criteria did you use and where is it i i would say we would have to go to the plaza because so much of this capital improvements it works like you said like southern third fourth that wasn't it's still a high tide it still has water in my device but some of these streets are just really really important and uh i think kyle would probably associate with some of this the more streets got done first now part of that issue there and we will touch on it in different places is there's never been any metrics involved in measurements so it's purely anecdotal and you know we we don't have a stop watch going as soon as we have a heavy rain okay three hours later the water's gone and it's receding you know twelve inches of the last time you don't need you don't need a mattress but you're walking down the street i mean that's well yeah that's a very simplistic way of the footy day but here's here's the deal maybe you can add a couple other streets okay but here's the deal so you just spent a half a million dollars improving the stormwater situation down there and people are still complaining that the streets flooding you guys just wasted a half million dollars of the city's money and you haven't fixed the problem well before you came on the council we tried addressing this issue because the problem is we've never managed expectations when when residents see a bunch of trucks pull in there and they offload a bulldozer and a backhoe and they start dumping new fresh conduit pipes they say oh my god you're here to fix this storm so we go through this drill we do that and guess what comes along high tide uh wind driven [Music] high tide storm water heavy rain and guess what the streets like we never told those people that hey there are situations where we are still going to have street fighter we've never managed that expectation so what happens high tide winds are right heavy rain first and third street floods yeah but i i understand common sense government died decades ago but putting new storm fights in was never supposed to resolve flooding okay it was supposed to resolve the order moving and and the patient moved 73 years ago we did put check valves we put a check we checked out at march street and the pilot was too low and we removed we never raised them down around third and fourth they put the check out and that does work a lot better i mean you still get a little bit of order there but it's not anything that it was down at first even the check valve at 12th and 13th street if you talk to the residence hall great for living in this place that blast but but take out the equation i don't think anyone ever thought by putting new plates in you're going to resolve the storm i think you are 100 wrong because you know that he knows that we all go there but when citizen saw the trucks pull up in the front yard and unload a bunch of conduit the city was here to fix their flying problem guess what heavy rain high tide i got water in the streets you guys just wasted 500 000 and i still have the same problem we didn't manage the expectations we didn't explain it properly but we haven't we haven't we haven't matched our expectation from the first date i agree with we are in violent agreement on that so the question is what has changed we just we just obligated the city for a 700 000 fix and guess what those people are going to be complaining about about the same thing as the people on first and foremost what's doing the storm place okay if you ever want to really resolve that problem with the flooding it can be resolved with the new pipes in there all you have to do is put a slip plate in there a catch basin pumps and you're out you don't have to redo the whole street just a slick pipe to overflow goes into the catch basin pumps it out having collapsed pipes are not going to resolve anything i wanted to speak that what i would say though is read the flutie report and they stipulate right up front that the long pole in this tent is the outflows you don't have the easements to change and i just explained you're not gonna ever have that with american touch basement and i have the food you're never gonna resolve it unless you're willing to spend the money all right let's let's we digress we can have this back and forth conversation at the end of the meeting quick quick technical question on that these are formula dirt you said the orange blocks you know the excel formula if they're mismatching it's going to pop up oh not in this these are just markers to to to highlight areas more personally closely not in this one this was what i'm trying to show here is that whole cip spreadsheet we had had so many columns i mean literally it's two arms length long but if you continue to move right on this thing you can start to get a picture of what's going on in the out news and that's how we highlight some some of this stuff okay let's see what else did this thing do for us it uh allows us to set priorities and there's money that is turned plan of action it gives us a laser focus on some of this stuff and once we identify what the project is we're laser focused on that and that's how we move forward another thing it did for us is it uh it gave us better business practices for once we were able to say hey you know we don't just throw a problem or a request to a committee or something we give them a best business practice we give them specifications for what we want in the deliverables we give them a deadline so we started embracing some of some good business and some of this stuff and uh it's it yielded results i think as we were going through the different communities it was easy enough to just dust off and do the boilerplate for a different uh community and write a new charter and for the first time they actually had concrete stuff to work on not just hey we had a five or ten minute battle from the base and hey do this take a look into this problem for us we told them what we wanted and what we wanted the other thing this did was it started to give us objective data and stuff we started measuring certain things and guess what for the first time we had hard data on stuff it wasn't just anecdotal stuff somebody mentioned to me as i walked in here that we have this very serious problem you know what's the dare shall we show me your data i'll show you my data on this sort of thing there's an old saying in the uh the fact-checking business just because a story's newsworthy doesn't necessarily mean it's a reality they showed us too was with objective data was again objective data versus just anecdotal what's the number in the denominator okay and for those of you who uh who flunk and do that or whatever you know that's the bottom number right so so when we say that 30 of the parking complaints coming into the city is about boat trails rvs and parking okay 30 how many people are we actually talking about complaining 10 people 10 people complain because the number in the denominator is almost 30. it's not anecdotal or hey 30 of the people i've been talking to are complaining that this this just isn't working well okay so uh well let's see what's the number in your denominator how many people are we talking about well i talked to three people well one person is 30 percent so statistics can be blended in i will always ask that question what's the number in the denominator uh let's see talking about uh addressing resident concerns innuendo uh assertions hey it looks like from our perspective all the money is being spent north of the calls well is that really the case well because when we break it down by capital projects guess what we see a different picture of this stuff so once again objective data to answer resident concerns or assertions okay so now what we're going to do is we're just going to kind of go through some of the basic things that we consider building up the strategic here's one of the things that's built into the into the strategic plan if you were to go back and look at the original 2019 document this is something that had really never been captured or anyone bought it but it's basically the core values for us as uh city officials and employees so one of the things i highlighted here is that be a good student so that's a question what i'm going to throw out right now what is a good steward we we control the purse strains we control the resources of the city we make decisions affecting codes people's property [Music] what's this concept beginning and throwing it out there do your research and make decisions with knowledge make your assumptions accordingly based on information that you have today right now the next five years you know if you're going to buy a house will i have a job whether my interest rates should i take out a fixed or floating mortgage you're considering all of these possible permutations as best you can frankly five years is about the the limit of anybody's disability after that just reiterating what dave said is you know you have to have the facts and and be prepared to make the decision but be open-minded enough to know that don't come in with a with a predisclosed opinion of something or reactive to a resident or one person's comment you know that's i think where i see a lot of the swaying from being from stewardship and you know look i am on several non-profit boards and being a steward of those funds that are donated are such a priority and it's no different than what we're dealing with here at the city and we've got to be i mean when i think of stewardship i think finance is number one and where we stand financially with the city and those things we can see way beyond five years with some good budgeting and forecasting so we really need to focus in on that and i and i think we're falling short there i i would add just one more dimension today and that is at the end of the day we do what's right for the city of residence regardless of what our personal persuasion is what our personal agenda is at the end of the day we make what we think is the best decision for this city and its residents okay and that includes it's always happened that image that we're neglecting the sound is absolutely not true at all it's just unfortunate that they live in lower at least to try to make it as efficient as possible to the elevation okay so i took i didn't take any of that as being a good student like financially yeah but uh i think being a good steward in that sense be proactive and israelite and preparing for the future so we see a safety hazard okay we have a big series financially great okay yeah spend the money be accountable and everything like that but when citizens come up here and have a safety issue okay you've got a good story at all i i will counter that with what we just said at the end of the day we make hard decisions about what we think is best for the entire city and all of its residents not just a laser-focused small group you know what i don't care if it's a safety issue if it's one person or half the city and particularly an aviation background where safety is always at the forefront of not only the material and the maintenance and the parts and the support and the flying aspect of it but we have a responsibility to everyone that's right and there is a real world aspect to this thing okay just give him the opportunity gotcha okay so this is a list of assumptions from the original 2019 document 10 of them very very thin okay but something you will i think you'll kind of get a sense for is that if you go through this and you can do it later on at your leisure you'll kind of see that most of these things hit everything that's still at the forefront of what we need to be thinking about this thing this list has withstood the test of time in a lot of a lot of ways now does that mean it's a comprehensive list for today or do we need to go through that and revisit visited in 2022 well i think if you look at this there are some things we need to start considering because the truth has changed as we see we've had bandanas we've got a high inflation rate right now we've got logistic chain nightmares there are a lot of things taking place the property values are astronomical right now people are starting to decide and work remotely at home so demographics are changing very quickly so at your leisure maybe we go back through this thing demographics are changing here we need to monitor that the economic climate is changing very quickly and it's going to impact not only our capital improvement process and the budget but there are also things going on traffic congestion i think more and more people are moving and staying here so is that going to be seasonal anymore no i think you're going to see upward ticking that's that the trajectory that thing is is climbing major storm impact on baller beach that hasn't changed but we need to go back and take a look at how much money engine has emergency we we are way over there state mandated we are way over our charter management and are there better ways of utilizing that money with some constraints around it so that the payback back into the client has to be within so many years or whatever there's things we can be thinking about along those lines uh what else we got here's some more uh property values we talked about storm water flooding okay due to battery island conditions existing elevations legacy storm water systems there may not be an economical solution fully solving power sea level rise long long term uh red tide that's not going to change we we're seeing that also has an upward trajectory on it and it's got to spin out the problems that maybe we need to start addressing or some of this stuff again we need to perhaps embrace a more frequent [Applause] strengths weaknesses opportunities and threat analysis you can read through this at your thing the thing to take away from this is that some attributes that you will see on the strengths column in the strange column weaknesses and the same thing in the opportunities in france it's a double-edged sword and suitable and the small city we're flexible we can move sheet communicate very quickly but at the same time we don't have any political clout we don't have any economic clout nobody's listening to us so again you can just kind of go through these things and hey our staff is small they're responsive they're flexible but they are very broad very thin depth when it comes to handling problems there so it's a strength for some things but in other things experience or vampire opportunities threats some of these opportunities were silent we had actually done studies on how best to optimize things like this building the marine and parking lot i think there were one or two other things our pocket parks were one of those things we looked at those things the uh planning and zoning actually gave us lists of suggestions and things to look into unfortunately the pandemic came along we were faced with higher priority problems all of that stuff got filed and back burned but at some point i think it's going to be time to open the file drawer pull those plans out and dress them up and look at it one good example was there is a lot of air condition space in this building that we don't utilize if you look at the utilization of this building this room i mean just the for you if you look at the square footages that were air conditioning and lighting it may not be the best use of that thing so playing in zoning it actually gave us optimal uses for some of this stuff but it got back burned space became our friend all of a sudden during the pandemic so what if we had moved ahead on some of that stuff it clicked turned on like we say the truth changes but we need to be flexible and adjust accordingly goals and objectives this was the original 2019 on the left column there you've got the high level goals one or two words just to capture what that goal is if you look at the middle column it adds a little detail and attributes to what those goals are and then on the right hand column what we built were a longer list of objectives what are the actual projects that we can take care of that contribute to to knocking out goal number one or boosting the effectiveness of goal number one we developed a protocol because once again we look at the the size of our staff it's very thin very small so what we did was we adopted a protocol of never having more than two objectives on our plate addressing any one particular goal we maintained a long laundry list of representatives but we only actively dealt with one or two around time maybe on on an occasion there would be a third whereas time allowed us maybe uh then raised as a city manager and tactical garden picking up that hey i got some extra money laying around i've got some slack and a schedule i can address a different item the some of the red highlighted areas what you'll see is some of these issues go back a long time you've been addressing these for a long time hey we look at the storm water well in 2019 we were looking for sustainable ways to mitigate the problem well we got smart we started analyzing the budget we looked at the burr rates guess what we come up with storm water for you so that stuff changes from how we're going to mitigate the problem to actual streets being worked on financial management software we're going through now a second iteration of looking for a new financial management tactic we went through this once before and here we are again so the truth has changed once again consistent code compliance was on there and uh i think as we started measuring stuff and again we're getting smarter on this stuff i think you're going to start seeing that issue start ticking so again that's the 2019 version of goals priorities and objectives okay so the next thing that happened was in 2021 if you look at the left columns there there was a change in the priorities what we started seeing was engagement and communications with the community was becoming a much broader issue than how the neighborhood looked so what we did was we actually consolidated communications and community and we bumped down aesthetics and once again if you look at the the emphasized objectives what do we still see we're still seeing mitigating street flooding issues integrating the capital improvement process with the budget again it goes to that matrix of how do we analyze and prioritize capital projects and blended and aligned with the budget process we hadn't really been doing that before because we had this huge preserved pile of money in our reserves because so many projects had been abandoned and kicked further down the road and guess what we just took that money through the reserves that that was part of the issue here because a lot of these problems we're dealing with today are problems ten years ago and they weren't dealt with then because the current or that the regime at that time didn't know how to manage projects didn't have project management experience didn't know how to finance that stuff for whatever reason but the can was kicked down the road but we're starting to get a better handimark and stuff then along comes january 2022 street flooding issues we've dealt with the section 94 portion of the encodes and objective three under beach and waters blues and organs so a lot of these things have been here for a while we've been dealing with them for a while and some of them are just never going to go away march 22 march 2022 address mitigate street flooding issues gulf boulevard beautification and undergrounding boys decision and dead ordinance so these are things that they go back a while they were under they've been on our radar for a while may 2022 street flooding issues city manager selection hiring responses that was on the radar way back revisiting the economic impacts of the capital improvement versus the reserve funds again we have not generated a five-year forecast or burn rate since 2020 gulf boulevard beautification is totaled throughout so there we needed to make that playground decision which we just did bowie's decision and the ordinance you need to decide where everything so again this is just kind of like the cliff notes version of what is currently on our radar or what we're addressing at the moment if if you recall in your briefing within reads it probably showed you that for every one of these capital projects he has a page that delineates and describes the project in a little more detail names an order and gives a timeline as a milestone that we didn't like somewhere i don't think we we have the specificity i think we really deserve and that kind of stuff i don't think it has the visibility that it deserves because i think and i will get into this a little bit later is i think as a body this council needs to take a bigger role in the capital project for planning sequencing i think that's a lot of stuff going on in the shadows and it's it's kind of glossed over very quickly during the bucket review process without us actually sitting back throwing up that gigantic spreadsheet on the wall and saying well now tell me why is that street ahead of this stream when the flooding issue or the feedback from the residents say it's really a higher priority why is this project so low on the party when hey we've got money for it it's not going to take that long and for whatever reason i think we need to be more proactive as a body in looking at the mechanical improvement priorities what you're going to see in some of these things is the big identification objectives in this thing this is kind of a mismatch of what are some of the attributes for that goal and priority but it's also mixed in with a laundry list of projects that are just waiting for their time to bubble up to the top as we start scratching off projects we're going to start backfilling these in public safety here's some of the other stuff playground is in there obviously a contractor permitting responsibility accounted for it is always in there tax dollar value now this is this is one the focus has been on best value focus and i think everybody realizes that we don't immediately jump to the lowest payrolls sometimes you shoot yourself into so we go for best value procurement or allocation of funds uh obligation points but what does that mean that means that it may cost a little bit more but we think we're getting a greater value whether it's a warranty whether it's the quality of the work it's the the person who's doing the work has a much better record of experience responsibility doing projects like that so these are some dimensions that we we should become very familiar with and start thinking about effective efficient sustainable and resilient so i'll throw that one out right now what's the difference between effective and efficient in fact doing the right thing the right way that's the difference there sustainable can we always afford to do that stormwater it wasn't sustainable at one point we were burning up our reserves doing this but with stormwater fees guess what we believe that's a sustainable issue right resilience what is that well hey when we get to the end of our five-year forecast and hey you know the in the mirror is a bad point well hey maybe year two in our five year forecast something changes the pandemic inflation goes through the move supply chain goes nuts do we have the resilience to deal with it are we flexible enough to deal with it and bounce back as quickly as possible do we have the flexibility [Music] built into our processes so that we can handle that issue and get out of business better more than as quickly as possible so we're always always improving the budget process capital planning our contracts continue to invest in our human resources our city staff part of that is updating the job descriptions the evaluation process compensation training and development grants are in there obviously technology is always going to be in there okay let's see what else do we have here tax dollar value here's some other things the budget process based on such things as fiscal responsibility strategic goals and objectives question what is physical responsibility contracting correct and appropriate times i'm throwing it out there because what i want to know is that at the end of the day when we start thinking about this budget process and we talk about fiscal responsibility i want to be thinking the same thing so i think that's one of the things we need to hash out is this thing going into the budget process a good steward and part of that it's just the responsibility of what does that mean you can save that for a limited time and major consideration but i think everybody needs to be thinking about that comms and community go through this at a later time [Music] that's the aesthetics beach waterfront takeaways from all that what you've just seen for the budget process what we're going to get into we're going to jump into the budget process what to take away from this review of the strategic plan the strategic plan is part of a family right now they're all related and they need to apply they have to shake hands and when you look at one thing you should be able to rationalize it from the other in other words if this is our number one priority in our number one capital project can we rationalize that based on what our priorities are in a strategic plan and if we can are we being physically responsible and then move on to the budget that's one takeaway from this from the capital improvement analysis the 80 20 period [Music] so basically 80 percent of our budget is in 20 of our nonprofits if you look at just and depending on what nomenclature depending on who's writing that budget spreadsheet for us and how they describe deadline because some things are placeholders some things or you know well we've broken out this cause well we need to align them for all those costs within the different departments what you will find is our our expenditures are probably in the top half a dozen line items give me give me the top three what are the top three just off the top of your head storm water personnel streets personnel calls personal costs please that goes and yet once again you know capital improvements are there as well so there's a top three right personnel costs shares contract and cap improvement in my opinion we don't spend enough time once again concentrate on the valuable video how can personnel cost me we have that many employees on okay i'm not going to quote numbers here but i will i will ask you to go back to the budget and look at what are and i i would i would i will bet you a quote that the number one line item is personal price not only salary but you're talking about what's going into retirement exactly it's huge it's huge so when we start glossing over things about hey we're going to change this we're going to change that boy you know we took it at face value we agree hey i want to do this with the personnel i want to bring somebody else on board i want to change this well let's take a little closer let's break out the magnifying glass on some of these personnel calls and make sure we truly understand what we're we just did one cip project that was seven hundred fifty thousand dollars i'm pretty sure the total personnel is not bigger than anything it's another code i will bet you a coke that if you depend once again depending on how you break it out that the number that sticks in my brain was eight hundred thousand per person for personnel not and i don't mean just salary but once again no no look at retirement and benefits and all those things right there medical insurance all that stuff it's huge it's not i don't think it's huge i mean it's we have a minimal staff of employees do you want to cut their benefits do you want us to go flying around health insurance do you want to tell them you know get an entire plane i mean okay you're taking me in the literal sense once again and that's all he was stating i mean it is a fact there's nothing we can do to change that but it's something that we have to acknowledge and accept while we're doing the budget and uh and so i don't want you to what is the wrong idea of what he said what i'm saying mr mayor is there's two items you're not going to touch okay the police the only way you're going to touch personnel is yes but you have to analyze those numbers those are your starting numbers and then you with whatever's left that's the way yeah those numbers is what i'm saying you can you can roll it around massage it all you want at the end of the day if you want to have a workable stair it puts this old saying skilled labor isn't cheap cheap labor's at scale okay so at the end of the day if you want a good stare you gotta pay okay i'm not going to break this down to simplistic logos what i'm going to say is i'm going to go back to fiscal responsibility and being good students and i've said it before and i'll say it again at the end of the day we will probably end up at the same place but we've done our due diligence we've been fiscally responsible and we've been good stewards of the of our resources and we understand why certain things are there once again you're going to look at capital improvement projects you're going to look at disconnects and it's again not to disallow it's to understand why those things no i'm saying let's do this smartly let's do our job why we were elected and not just gloss over stuff because we think that's the way it's always been done and that's the way it's going to get done now no that is not being fiscally responsible and it's easy police is the police personnel is personalized these people are not getting great outstanding wages i think during it uh it has nothing to do with the wages discussing we're trying to look for a city match we don't even want to post the job requirements of the salary okay we're digesting i i promise to get through this in an hour and continue and i've already have subjects i'm almost there we're digressing for our future i i've already pointed out i think the council needs to get engaged in capital projects i think a lot of that stuff goes on in the shadows and at the end of the day when we review the budget it's glossed over here's my list of capital projects i'm going to take this money from the general fund or from reserves and we're going to do that nobody has standardly checked the priorities of why we were doing it that way i think that's one of the things to be fiscally responsible and to understand what's going on in this city and one last thing forecasting the out years this goes to flexibility and resilience it means you're thinking about the future we know that hey the truth can change at any moment but we are at least being responsible enough to look down the road make some assumptions and try to be ahead of the game here's the the family of plans the strategic planning the goals and the priorities trickling down to capital projects and those things combined shape the budget process in the allocation [Applause] at some point will we actually go through the strategic plan to reshape it come up with new goals reprioritize those goals come up with new objectives new attributes new metrics for that thing this is what i think we need to come to they're called stretch goals and at some point we just where do we want to be in five or ten years we throw some some pie in the sky stuff around here and it gives us something to work towards but if you look at some of this stuff these numbers and these dates i didn't just pull them down this guy these are numbers that have been reads okay so hey we're dealing with the budget process we're having a lot of questions a lot of discussion on this stuff maybe we should be looking at a way to reduce our expenditures or something i don't know anybody who's worked in government knows what his life wasn't a protective country it's not it's not just hey we want you to cut money in this area it's like no you give me a budget that's five percent smaller than last year last year and i don't care where you take it you've got to decide where to do that it's it's not a stretch of the imagination but a bunch of smart people to sit around the table throw options out and come up with a plan for reducing expenditures or for those of you who haven't worked for a government or a a budget like budget climate like that how to improve strategies some of you work on that side and so so that's different uh hey you know we've got this backlog of capital improvement projects how long is it going to take us to eliminate that background i said we had been kicking capital projects down the road for a decade and we're addressing some of that stuff how big is that backlog still when could we realistically wipe out that i don't know uh gold boulevard utilities underground and you're wrestling with those options right now street lighting modernized by 2025 develop and implement a marine improvement plan that goes to dusting off the uh planning and zoning recommendations on how best to utilize some of our problems and there's probably a bunch of we can sit down and brainstorm these things all night long you know debate some of the stuff i'm just saying have some stretch goals where do we want to be in five or ten years set set a goal for the next count we think this is possible we're going to put that as a stretch goal in our strategic plan if you guys think he can't do it or perfect move the goal pose that's fine be thinking along those lines okay has the city ever looked into borrowing money to expedite the cip projects you know even bank loans something so that was paid now yeah that was a road that was discussed offline raise a lot lit raise was always averse to a bond initiative we still owe money on this place we have a debt service that goes out two three more years so so once that's done we're going to get an instant payroll sure that email class action actually brought up bonds and they said no they wouldn't recommend that they said how much money i just threw a number out there they said oh anything under some huge number like uh it's like anything under 10 million just go to a bank yeah just get a bank loan rates are better everything's better now that was just again that was lynn reed's opinion he was dead averse and averse to any bond issues i think it had been discussed maybe at the previous council i don't remember but at the council level we were kind of reversed to it um ron saganic on the citizens advisory committee banker background he kind of he's always kind of proposed that you know we could do that so i mean these are options okay right you know what's the best solution for this city i don't know because we always talk about how the prices seem to be escalating you know there may be some time you know where they do come back down who knows right that's why it takes so long well i know at one time that i think at the end of my last term we talked i proposed the hurricane i don't know what the outcome was but reducing that hurricane fund which we had a million dollars in it back down to what was required and make available line of credit if in fact we got in a position where we needed money quick and talked to ron about it and he said yeah those those are possibilities those are things we can do so but i don't think anything came with it and see for us to include those we're so far into the budget now that we actually need to start staring back next to the correct if we want to finish that crap we'll never finish a month we don't have that much money but at least we will get a head start on something like stream we started talking about budgeting in september instead of waiting until the spring you know how much did this building cost the final payoff would be five million okay so we would have had tomorrow or five minutes during the battery now we've borrowed four we bought three months we borrowed three the final payback would be fine okay one of the interesting aspects of that is it was negotiated without the option for currently there right is she in jail now she's going to work in here thanks to a previous council is my view of going through the budget process for the fifth time is as a body i don't think we have the expertise the visibility or the insight to be making some of the things that are drawn out the suggestions [Music] and maybe at a future date maybe a year now maybe two years from now we will have a handle on the process where we can intelligently make a decision like hey we're going to obligate the city for a bond initiative and deal with this problem we've looked ahead five years and it's in our best interest to deal with this problem what were the assumptions we made to make that decision making sound business decisions but right now i don't think we have that accuracy [Music] we're getting it i know okay i'm sorry i know a guy trust me bro does that conclude your presence yes sir that's it thank you very much very nice okay thank you these individual expenditures and i didn't receive any emails where any of you had any great concerns so maybe we just need to go over it some things you saw that you i don't know i just actually was telling pam i was wanting to review it against some of our existing financials that we just got at the last meeting and i haven't got a chance to do that so um i don't know that i'm prepared to discuss this no that's okay my question was uh looking at page 18 this is the interest periods interest on investments and i noticed uh the adopted budget in 2022 anticipated ten thousand dollars in revenue and we're still showing the same um knowing that the last few years were pretty bad in interest about how much money do we have that's working this interesting what do we still anticipate ten thousand dollars this year or more this at the very top uh line number three six one hundred those rates have changed and actually calculated yeah like i said normally we don't have revenue but it might be a case where we can increase revenue there better than that nothing else you just put i know caught everybody i was guarded with these questions um i have a plan for monday night which i'm going to speak shortly but i i just didn't get anything back and i was just wondering if anyone had maybe something should be changed okay all right mr gunn i'd actually have built a list but you know during the process i kept notes and built it list and my dad i was going to support deliveries and see what else needed to be added to i just hit a couple of things here that kind of stuck out to me and i think it these things kind of deserve greater look at okay so uh kyle is already uh tasked with giving us a recommendation on the helpful of our things so that's that was one thing that is out there right now another uh deliverable is some idea of this code enforcement thing right because we we as a matter of fact the last council meeting we tabled that issue the budget contract for the code enforcement part-time time right and part of that was because the city manager has sat down during the budget process and said hey you know i'm thinking about bringing more of that stuff in-house and creating a hybrid and reorganizing that aspect of it and yet the next thing we see is a full budget crank numbers it's 20 hours a week part-time for that guy and so somebody owes us some idea where we think we're going with that that's just my view i mean i don't know if you did the bulk of my melbourne as he walked out the door i think he was budgeting for the exact same with hopes to produce okay so if we want to make a decision up front to reduce we could write that into the budget that way so i don't know maybe you need to get with the staff your staff and reconsider this thing and make sure that you're thinking of it in the exact same terms perhaps i've been raised once or whatever communications he had to make sure that we're going to make an informed decision because what what you just proposed is and it goes to another thing was this concept of placeholders in the budget you know you're basically saying okay well let's just obligate fifteen thousand and maybe it's just to be ten thousand down the road well i'm i guess i'm saying that's a that's a budgetary tool available to us but is it something we can get past right now by making an informed decision and say okay i'm going to make these changes and all i need is 12 000. with the caveat that if i oh damn i made a mistake here or you know move the decimal point one place too far hey all it takes is coming before the council say hey i need a budget increase of three thousand dollars for this i mean you know no harm real foul let's just do the best we can uh i did i'm sorry i did have a discussion with lynn i don't know a few months ago about the same issue and he had told me that and i'm sure some of you guys were here ladies that had been proposed to the council where he was gonna the city was gonna hire a part-time person and this is 100 in lieu of the sheriff's officer and then laura was going to take over and because and then a part-time person was going to come on the bottom line was it was going to save the city money and more than likely actually provide more hours that laura would be doing actually driving around and checking things now i can tell you firsthand that when i was knocking on doors and chatting with people i mean i'm thinking back people brought that on to me unsolicited that they preferred when laura was doing it i know we've heard other people say different things i'm just telling you more people told me to my face i didn't ask them the question i just asked is there anything i could focus on if i'm fortunate enough to be elected people brought that up said i don't like that sheriff guy walking around you know we would prefer a city staff person taking care of those duties so i'm just telling you that information so the basis of that feedback was it because they didn't want a guy in a uniform and a badge and a gun knocking on their door that was one part of it the other part was they felt like one of our city employees knew better knew the city better knew what was going on better could find things better yeah that's what they found i mean there's a lot of dimensions to this issue because on the flip side of the coin the thinking for getting a part-time sharepoint you now have another car moving around within the city of limits and the response to code enforcement is much better when a guy with a badge knocks on the door and we got that practice actually from some of the neighboring municipalities because they contracted out the sheriff part-time to do it and they felt they got much better response with code enforcement mean i heard from other municipalities that usually if the guy knocks on your door that'll be the only time it happens whereas if it's somebody that's you know office personnel everybody knows his personality how you do it all friendly it doesn't wait it's uh it's just not as impactful and generally you'll have repeat offenders and pick and choose who your friends are and you decide that the cyphers want an outside battle and i think in my opinion having a police officer doing that job is less biased or less room device and the only thing that that i don't like and this goes across the board for the sheriff's department is they're all about education they're all about education and giving warnings and giving people second chances it's a hassle to write a ticket i'm sure but at the end of the day some people deserve a table and that's revenue it should be coming back to this community whenever whenever you have a violator there's i mean right now i can count five items that are going on with code towards my debt it seems that we're not getting anywhere with it and it may be for legal reasons but if our code enforcement officer had not been on vacation last week i believe that some of those things would be curtailed we will be having some problems so that's kind of where i stand on it i actually like the fact that we use an outside agency for code enforcement yes there is a learning curve they have to understand our code but we're also good at giving directives we're having a lot of those issues please go find them such as the trees the tree issue that's going on right now so that's i can understand people saying you know it's a little bit i when i went through a door frank is your deal on i can't hear you did you think they're doing i'm sorry what i'm saying the mayor expressed greatly about using the sheriff and uh i think we should stay with you if we want to cut to 15 hours and try to have to save some money well another thing is uh i don't really want to put city staff at risk whenever you knock on the door tell somebody they're doing something wrong because there's always that opportunity that they can get violent well i like the way you put the bias you know i'm your friend and i'm helping you out of the way sure it was on page 24 his computer software and we were increasing from 63.50 to 7 000. i believe we talked earlier was perhaps about an accounting software specifically that was driving the increase that's what we were told yes yeah that's correct the accounting software that they're looking into um is it physically large house it's because we were using a budget price peace treaty uh anyway and now this is something more professional but i don't know what it is i understand i would like to know what the advantages truly are of spending that kind of money because at the end of the day we're very small in team i brought up a team with other communities to use the same uh joining lessons i'd like to circle back the code enforcement thing one more time regardless of which way this thing goes it's incumbent upon us to measure this because we had no clue whether it gets better or worse how do you objectively say well we reduced the budget but did it get better did the number of complaints go down and the number of hours increase i i don't know you're referring to the reporting that we're receiving right now and that's on us for not demanding that but i know we get reports but you're wanting it a little more granular to let's have some details what's the uh whenever you write a citation you should write a report right in there that goes along with it so we fully understand what it is that we're talking about how it testified that we're receiving emails and phone calls about various things that are going on within the city but we don't have all the details and and they'll even tell you the code enforcement officer has been out there whenever you look at the report that's one line and it was it dissolved was it decided you know what what was it and uh you're right we should have more on that and maybe keep long-term history something that goes along with that so that this time next year we can say for the entire year this is really leveling down and here's where our problems are with the code enforcement or the code itself that's all i had for years it's only a couple of years since we've had the sheriff's doing our code unfortunately we had an in-house vote enforcement concert i don't believe we ever got reports of how many paddington do you remember getting reports of how many code enforcement visits there had been or citations that had been issued when we had our own officer but i would be very much in favor of bringing house [Music] i think you know to your point too is i expect more from the sheriff and i don't think we're getting more i would expect to see more presence on the streets i don't think any of us should have to pick up the phone and saying say the street's blocked off there's all this on-street parking on our road there should be someone circulating the neighborhood and that doesn't happen i rarely see a police officer now that would be our law enforcement no i'm talking about construction workers it's code issues really because construction workers not parking on the same side of the road you can't get through the road because they've got a blocked landscape guys there a construction truck comes no one looks at where they're parking and they're blocking the road so things that are not only to get into all the details but things that should you shouldn't have to pick up the phone and talk about it i would think that this would be directly driven i just think that maybe he's not been getting you know i'm not told what to do to what extent yeah maybe that's it maybe there's just not enough direction you know but he but there's there are a lot of code violations when you go around the city if you pay attention simple things that are not being addressed you are right and um i've spoken i've spoken to david a few times since i became mayor and he always asked what can i do how can i make this better for your stick [Music] that's where we probably need to spend a little bit of time to no matter who it is that's doing code enforcement they should have the same set of instructions and uh maybe we could bring it back in-house but i would like to give the sheriff's department time to try to work this out because they are a lifelong partner with our community and it's just a little bit more compared to the grand scheme of what all we're paying right now to the sheriff's department for law enforcement i'll stand behind that but i always know the council's wishes i a doctor a couple times a week i think i see him i see our sheriff out there all the time i don't remember in a mile about at least and i think when i said john i mean where i come from you always had standing orders you know operation guidelines stuff like that you knew what you were supposed to do that day patrol or whatever it seems to me not only in code enforcement but also in the sheriff thing there was always a reluctance and i wasn't sure whether it was at least level or captain lioner's level or whatever to provide that direction to the sheriff when it came on their watcher or shift or whatever they call them to provide a structured format for what they're supposed to accomplish there was there's always seems to be a reluctance or a pushback on that the other thing i will mention is that this whole code enforcement thing i think it's not a big budget issue but i think we don't know what the true costs of that process is because there's so many things i think we do where we just do it we don't capture hey what did it really cost yeah you know hey you know it only took 10 minutes but do we ever account for those those man hours and that sort of thing this is one process code enforcement it runs through every one of these strategic goals it's a safety issue when it comes to permitting it's a tax dollar value when it comes to budget stuff it's a communications community issue it's an aesthetics issue it runs through the entire gamut of priorities in this thing and we don't understand it or give it its due emphasis it's it's it's a high visibility thing uh for this city and the residents and i think we need to probably get our arms we're gonna provide some more structure exactly what you're seeing well we're discussing this we've we have a citizen who has decided to erect a tower in his backyard and if the thing falls it's falling on somebody somebody's home no matter what even with a code enforcement officer we have no teeth to actually do anything about it if the guy says i'm not going to take this tower down which is what he said um our hands are tied and it could be months before someone comes along and says you take this down or you go to jail and so that's that's another something else to consider is how much teeth does our code actually have we have code and we it's the law abiders aren't the problem it's the ones that are just sticking their middle finger up in the air to the rest of the city and how do we address this because we've got a guy that's taken nine years to build a house we've got another guy that's putting up a huge tower in antenna in his backyard we've got a guy that doesn't want to cut down a tree that's a nuisance tree you know just dumb things that reasonable people would resolve real quick but these are these are some major issues for our community it's beautiful as miller means it is still we have some problems here and we need some direction on what to do about this our city attorney uh in fact kyle you know why would you kind of bring them up to speed on the issues that i yeah so with the tower um we just issued a uh notice of violation uh unfortunately it took a little bit of uh with our turn being on vacation these past couple weeks uh to get a definitive okay this is what we're going to do we decided uh last friday to to issue a notice um we sent it the certified mail and i tried that and i found my residence that day and no one answered and tried to basically talk to somebody so in the notice we gave the 15 days we cited them for not having the tower permitted after discussing with attorneys that was the best course we cited the overall requirement for a permit and we also cited the stipulations that if you do tower within the city just to have that included in the notice the goal is within 15 days which is the reasonable time for the due process we want him to submit information about this tower and i know that some of the residents have kind of done their own homework but we want him to come forward and prove that the actual applications that needed to happen he has reached out to our code enforcement officer and left the message from us tomorrow we're going to contact him and walk him through the steps of what he has to do to get this permit once he submits something chances are is not going to be their code going forward with the attorney with what the best reasons are that we would deny this and then move forward based on what the reaction is uh he's done some homework on the case laws that have been upheld in communities and from what he found was that the federal regulations recommend um working with residents that have this hobby of the ham radio to try to you know come to some in between that that allows them to do grounding that doesn't doesn't violate our code or presented danger within the community so it's kind of a step-by-step process if this resident in fact says i don't care um 15 days an album keep doing what i'm doing the next step is we're going to take him to a hearing at that point um he can come to the hearing in front of the magistrate and present his case because in our case the magister fixer completely imposes fines um with deadlines and daily fees and interests that we've seen kind of in the other cases that can go on too if he wants to say you know i don't care about your fines he wants to run what he wants to get communities under his property um it would be the process of getting into that point where at that part the attorney said that we could file for conjunction and get the courts involved to get the courts involved then they can give notice with a penalty of jail time we're talking to the attorney there there's really no point in our processes written in our ordinances and he talked to some of his colleagues in his firm that we get involved or we forcefully remove a tower i know some people kind of suggested enough emails but that brings out a lot of problems uh not something we want to do with some of these property that's very expensive it's a little different than the cutting juice brass so i did i did explore that and he said that we don't want the women to share forcefully because you got to think about it people have rights and it is their property you know you're protected from government that's that's why at least my thing with it that's why it really shouldn't be in the hands of a sheriff not a person because that's a lot of risk there i mean i know you knocked on doors i did it there's a big reason i got ptsd from knocking out doors and bad events happen it should be somebody that's used to dealing with these volatile situations because i mean we looked at it i mean if he claims it's an antenna and now he's playing federal it's difficult and that's what we need a professional that's the face of the city along with that attorney that's what i was going to ask does he have the federal permit for you know he doesn't have a license but ambry as a ham radio operator there's no such thing as a license for an antenna no no but wait well let me interrupt you there is the fcc you do have to register it through the fcc and you get a permit for it i know that because i do it with my radio your own i think it's the receptive device you know so with our shrimp folks we just have to register yeah is the antenna commercially manufactured is this his own design and manufacturing uh up um was at the same one or was it no it was a he used to have a pull is what it means eight years ago he had this humongous 20 foot antenna canvas um ran his house and then he came back here and decided i'm going to put it here and before the pack the setbacks are not even anywhere in the requirements i mean it's right against the the nearest is 1.3 times the length of the antennas so if he has a 40 foot antenna in our hole or i'm sorry tower he has to be 53 feet away from any neighbor well that's physically impossible it's 30 inches from this there's homes on all sides including his own uh so with that is there anything that we can do because what you just explained is a lot of time it is an energy we're talking probably in february of next year before this gets and look i think you're doing a great job you jump right over this when you approach that but you can only do so much the attorney can only do so much meanwhile hurricane season is it going to fly into somebody's house well we don't even know if the uh the concrete it's correct it's three holes with the crisscross anyway there some bolts coming up out of the concrete and that's what holds it in place there's no guy wires or anything like that we don't even know if we ordered large enough concrete underground structure to support the thing i guess that's why i asked whether it's a commercially manufactured because they would probably go through some permitting design approval wind mitigation kind of stuff but if it's a it's a home manufacture home design homing so it gets worse so he has attached motors to it and can he can literally disconnect it from the ground and then put it on a small hole so that it lays down in his yard and then he has another motor raising and lowering the center mass of the whole thing and it's all homemade so there is no instruction set for what he's doing it's uh and this is this goes back to the whole code enforcement um if you have somebody that's that's willing to completely ignore everything no matter how many times it's been contacted and you send someone who is not prepared to defend themselves i just think it's a bad situation that and that's that was my sole reason for for shooting it down last time because i just i believe that i don't want to put anyone at risk by trying to force our code so what is the timeline uh you give it a t before it's like to say jail time or something because the guys i think around 80 years old uh wait about yeah a life sentence doesn't mean much i mean we're looking at months or something follow the process the other thing is have we ever reconciled when the code enforcement guy goes out and defined his attach how much money would we bring in to all sectors wages do you understand where it's coming from have we ever been on a reconciliation of that yeah i don't think we go into i mean probably haven't because we're not looking at enforcing this as a revenue stream we just want to resolve them right no i understand money's money i know i know but i mean sometimes these guys are but we can look because it's in there as our fines it's listed on our budget i mean there was a person that came in here i think it was drummond he says he's flying 29 000 or whatever we've got the magistrates ruling on it so it's like now yeah but what i'm saying is you know does that offset the weight disparity i'm just looking at page 17 um code violation [Music] yeah i don't think we budget anything for it it's just whatever it is it is it's a windfall so yeah we're great we bought in 34 000 two years ago yeah that was one of the things that i flagged was why why was it set in a thousand we know there's going to be more than that but how much is the share of costs for the code enforcement does anybody have 55 000 to us this brings us around to the when this is something kyle and i were talking about today how do you determine what the appropriate negotiation tactic is for paying these long standing and outrageous fines um so such as that one now if a magistrate orders it don't they have to pay it is that right okay so there's no getting out of that one but uh i think we did a half off on that it's building the house just and back to drummond just real quick because i was gonna ask laura do we need more detail on that is that is that even still being talked about has anyone spoken to him just while we're on the subject of him before we move to something else i have not contacted him since the council meeting he did provide us with the uh there's two payments which we have on record uh one of the payments um was for a public records request fee um i'm not sure where i presented that the other payment was the 800 plus the processing fee for families credit card that was the opinion that he settled with lynn which included the two different rental registrations and the late fees to stop the daily fines um so you gotta if you if you look at the timeline this hearing took place with the order in 2021 early and for over a year he was racking up daily fines 75 out 75 a day plus the interest and he eventually started communication with lynn and they came to that agreement sometime i want to say in march on the exact date where lyndon's like if you pay with you you owe the development station late fees i can stop that that daily fine because for that long since the order you wouldn't pay until for an entire year he's getting fined daily and paying interest so i think the the question i had for lynn and i he and i talked on the phone recently about this and he said there was a lot of history and he was going through it and a lot of it was from memory i said could laura just put together a timeline because the reason mr drummond came to council meeting was because lynn advised him to we didn't have none of us had any information that we could even speak to mr drummond about you know maybe we could take half maybe we can settle on a 50 because that's what we've done in the past but we didn't have any information we were all kind of blindsided and didn't know he was coming oh he has to become i so he had his timeline and we didn't have any information so it might be nice if we have it and one of us could talk to him and say hey if we come back to the council we'll put it on the agenda we'll talk about it and we'll try to come up with a settlement for you can we do that since it's the magistrate order now or what i don't i don't know what the rules are her order was a very small amount compared to what he owes yeah i don't know what the amount in the past um i think the example was the pergola um that you guys did a fifty percent forgiveness and that was a right that was from late fees and interest so the council can determine a reduction so here we go is 15 is what we're saying we've done 50 half of what they owed what was the magistrate enough i'm going to tell you one pergola is different than this case the pergola the guy knew that he lived here he was he would put up this thing memory certainly correctly installed it and didn't really want to take it down but but he there was interaction going on and eventually we worked something out with him this this case with the uh the small fine turning into a huge fine a property owner that was not in touch with his home wasn't in touch with the city he wasn't checking up on things he wasn't the address provided to send out notifications or either being ignored or or not being delivered but we had no way of contacting this individual and this went on for a long time and we see these occasionally we get these i call them haunted houses where no one's there the whole reason we have code enforcement right is for people that don't attend their house exactly and and so in that particular case uh i think it started as a it was a rental it was supposed to be a rental home but couldn't find the owner couldn't couldn't figure out how to contact anyone and even whenever a award letter sent to me actually the file was full of certified letters that just got sent back but no one accepted them but there was a runner in the house at the time now he claims he never received any of these bonuses i had to know this taped on my door and i was renting the house i'd get a hold of the other yeah right okay so as much as i hate what happened to this person and i sounded like he had a really good argument until i started understanding exactly what we were dealing with which was negligence it's that's the way that i see it um he did not continue to pursue the problem instead my problem it's their problem and they could just deal with it and i think he had no idea that glenn was just letting the clock run the whole time it's it's a shame but uh and those leading letters were being sent certified to go through the notifications so i guess what is it really the true imagination thing i mean i thought keeping your head in the sand doesn't get you out of jail but i mean um i think he wants to move on pay something 15 000 is going to be alive this council will need to lose what was the magistrate's number that he was told to pay i think the magistrate was just the it was the uh hearing fee with the 500 flat and then it was the at the time of the year i mean it was the rental registration rate which was only 100 um and then i know it was 300 and then the late game's 100. so i think it was it was the 900. that's right so that's the absolute base i mean you know time period did this person even show up for that here he wasn't there plus the pile of mail that they've and the effort that laura's put forth you know i i i believe he owes i mean i think that 50 discounts a nice deal that's all no that's not an option no because right right he's incurred all these fees okay i just want to make sure this is going to be small what's the amount get the loop and go away yeah everybody's been comfortable with that i mean they're not happy magistrates the 15 000 would be fair just because of how long uh this has gone away yeah and the tightest property here in this community and reach the benefits of it yeah i mean you look at the house it's right at the end of that call this after this fine real estate that's much more than mine i mean we're talking about tonight i haven't evolved so it's not cheap and i want to bring up one other thing he had that check where he gave a bank report that showed that he had the bank issue in check as a payment to the state for one of the rental registrations the city has no record of receiving that check and what lynn told him was that he needed to see um a choke payment from his side of the bank that that check was positive so i double checked without her last week and she said that she looked at everything again and said that payment never came in so whatever happened that payment i don't know we showed a report that says the bank issue did it and it's a you know a lame registration or something like that but that was another piece that we followed that up with an overdue notice though i mean i i just recently dealt with a situation where hey you know my bank automatically issues checks well they never received it but i'm still on the hook you know so the question is is did we send out an overdue there were letters constantly going out oh yeah he's got our i think my only question was does everyone want a timeline you want laura to put anything together so we have something we know for certain that we know the other side of the story when we make him a counteroffer if you will or an offer well i think that's what he's looking for he wants to say give me a price yes yeah yeah and i think it makes sense that we need the time so we can speak educated we get all these little tidbits don't know what's our side of the story yeah the background exactly so just bullet point what's just the information but just email together but here's what happened here's the dates i've been talking more about this and she didn't as long as it doesn't as long as we're not the ones that we're creating a problem okay as long as we were doing our due diligence and we were following up and we were sending these letters um and we've got a nice little audit or a report showing when these things were sent i think that that that satisfies my requirements and i will play away 70 percent yeah and all along the way literally keeps these reports so everything is going into these files um he writes on the side of the file of any content he's having these people i've been trying to work with them just to kind of put it all together but yeah that's that's what we're looking at yeah just two quick things based on bringing the code enforcement in-house versus the sheriff company i think an unintended consequence when i was talking with laura about this is that currently the sheriff deputy goes out and does his job i'm sure he does a great job i don't know what type of documentation he writes the information down and then he simply turns that over to laura it doesn't sound like it's a lot of data and or information and that she's responsible for transposing that information to some type of report there's obviously an opportunity for some information and understanding to be lost by doing it that way with two different people the second point i wanted to make was i know you uh not necessarily implying laura but you said just if it was done in-house there may be an opportunity for somebody to say well that's my friend you may know laura a lot better than i do i don't get a good gut feeling that she would give anybody a break out there and that would be her job because she's pretty tough cooking from what i feel so i think she would be out there and if somebody who had a violation they would be written up in the story i almost feel like it might even be more the other way based on some of the discussions we've heard from the sheriff deputies about their approach in educating and things like that i think in-house the person would be hey good afternoon you're in violation here's your ticket good luck pay it i'll move it on does anyone remember why we went to the sheriff's department i think it was i think the big argument at the time was because they wanted they thought sheriff showing up at the door would make people be more responsive and it made the presence of another deputy on the street they you know we've had more visibility of a deputy down the street even though we weren't paying for the deputies so those were the two big arguments i had people actually tell me they would see the sheriff deputy and not answer them well i've also seen in instance two where the sheriff stopped to question a contractor in a driveway okay okay and the contract said i don't need to talk to you and the sheriff said do we really want to go down this road that was the end that was the end of discussion so that that basically underscores my feeling about it's nice having a guy with a badge you know vote something about this thing interesting at one point we had an in-house marshall and that didn't work out through that and that was awful it was yeah we've gone through some iterations that's when we've been through various iterations you know you gotta ask the question is it because the guy doesn't want to do the job right or he doesn't have enough structure to what he's supposed to do and we've never really solved that question and i think we need to start with the structure we need to provide more strength this is your job this is your duty you write the reports yeah and you write the reports this is what you're responsible for this is what you're responsible for at the end of the day this is the product you're producing we can track how many complaints we've got and are we getting better or worse or whatever that's what we're missing that's the missing piece of the puzzle no matter which way we go we can't tell if we're going to get better at accidents okay any more discussion on that particular topic we have the next budget meeting is monday um will lim be attending that meeting not by phone not by anybody plus i would like to request lynn ray's does the rest of the council agree with that for them to attend uh i assume on monday here in my next meeting i agree because there are things in this budget that i'm sure you know a lot about and i'm sure that there's some of them that he has in his head you know doing i'm not challenging you but i'm just saying that there's some things that he probably just move you can answer real quick where you may have to do some catching up is that is that apparent is that a fair statement i would give me a little uh during that meeting and then that way between the two of you any answer any questions we have about budget irons one of you should be able to answer the question does everybody else feel we only have two more of these scheduled we can have more but the more information we get the faster we can move on to other things see what you do and also there are we're planning on giving lynn a service award and so i would also like to know is he going to be in town during any of our council meetings the regular council needs the next thing is we are narrowing down candidates for city management i'm not going to say anything so you can stay around here tentatively we had it on the calendar to begin some interviews on tuesday um does everybody feel good about that and patty do you think that you can line that up where how many minutes do we want to give to each candidate and if it requires too much time are you okay with continuing the conversations on wednesday so we already have a budget on monday we have an interim um a tentative military immediately following that and tuesday i would like to do some interviews that's that's what i had on calendar i think wednesday was kind of reserved if we didn't have enough time to interview the various candidates this this portion of the process is to reduce the number from i think we have six right now maybe five maybe even four what what do we what are we right now we're we're four for sure and there's two that we're waiting we had seven right how many are out three for sure one i haven't heard from that i had sent an application that i was in constant contact with me so there's two that are for sure not there one is not reached back to you at all and the other ones are not interested right okay all right so we're looking at five right now but we haven't heard back from two right out of those five so do we give them more time or do we just uh keep reaching out to them and if they don't contact us back maybe we can start with those three continue reaching out since they're just phone calls yeah just a daily phone call all right so this in this case whoever is available on tuesday will be the first round of zoom interviews and then we will continue on if you can get in touch with more and uh we'll see how it goes hey we're kind of having to play it by here because everybody has lives and it's it's hard to get everybody on the same page but the way i envision this is we assign time slots to each candidate they receive their own zoom number so that the other candidates can't log in and listen and watch and then whenever that time soccer is up actually comes right in and we do i think in 20 minutes each candidate just to kind of have some questions for them so this was just to reduce it down to the short just to reduce the number okay so you got the field type of thing personality ask them some questions and just see how they uh how they i guess the feeling that we have for him because the next step following that would be what's called it down then it goes to the actual interviews eventually i want to have it down to two candidates and that we've selected and uh and and then we call them in for in-person interviews and then vote what time are we are you thinking that this will happen um tuesday's meeting i'm thinking we're trying to start at six just like just like this uh we can do it earlier if you'd like yeah i have a board meeting um i believe it starts at six i have to double check i don't know if it's a five o'clock or six but i mean that's and i'm and then i'm committed i didn't realize we're gonna have all these meetings i have a all week long commitment daytime so it's really cool sorry i had all the uh i haven't lived in a hiring calendar but it's i've we haven't actually called the meeting yet because we were waiting to make sure we actually had candidates i understand yeah yeah i mean i'll do my best to get there but five or so for me what's that five clocks okay yeah i mean i'll try to do five i'm not sure but that which much more comfortable five would be if i can do anything it would be five and it's gonna be in the car in the parking lot at my other meeting so you know kind of thing so i'm not gonna have a real yeah great zoom access but we'll make it work so tuesday the 19th is at five now yes does that work for you i missed your beck and coleman it's tuesday it's tuesday too hectic for everyone just throwing it out there because we can always push it to wednesday what's that what is this all right um tuesday is 5 pm thank you and uh patty as soon as you want you to reach out to the candidates the ones that you've already contacted if you've received three applications back so far correct correct okay i would like all the council members to receive those applications okay okay was not getting information to last but it's really tough too i need it as soon as we have it would be helpful yes uh yes mr roberts i just have one more question for patty so how many of the seven are definitely out i know one person said they already had another job okay so this ones are definitely out right how many only what two are definitely out right one decline and the other one no response i can't get a response okay that's not a definitive i'm i'm not interested that's just a not no response yeah but that's multiple attempts right yeah multiple attempts so we're probably down to five best case scenario all right we started with seven two out we're down to five they're the best case scenario well if we get them all back right yeah right okay as it stands right now we have three applications right okay okay if so what i'm gonna do is uh just everyone go ahead and plan for tuesday i'm gonna wait and see what we get between now and then and patty will let me know if they're even available for scheduling on tuesday or for a zoom call and and then we'll send out the emergency meeting on an emergency special meeting on friday to shore everything up all right the only other thing one of the things that i want to make sure that we can do on the tenant of management is obviously we want to leave ourselves some flexibility just knowing with the way property values have gone up uh how does every what's everyone's thoughts on the possibility of eventually going to a rollback rate with the way that our our property values and taxes are right now i thought that elaine was discussing he said he went back to the rollback rate and we fixed with that one so now i'm not talking about it i'm just talking about what i'm talking about at the end of the insight whenever we go for that i'm just wondering is anyone look deep enough into this to see if there's flexibility to even consider a rollback rate this year vice mayor you know if you look under the assumptions in this strategic plan page 12. i expanded some thoughts on property values were generally increased the problem with the problem with rollbacks are in my mind two-fold one is if you do a roll back it's always going to be out of sync with the economy you are going to be playing catch it you might roll it back now but then guess what you know things change the truth changes again and it's by the time you catch up you're a year out of phase with this stuff and then the second thing is if you're doing it because hey you want to roll back and whatever my thinking is is how are those residents going to feel when the truth changes again and you've got to turn around and increase the millage rate they're going to remember that one more than they're going to remember the roll back the only reason i'm bringing it up is because this is the biggest one this is the biggest tax hit we've taken in a long time and we're not changing the military but also i'm looking at inflation and cost of fuel cost of goods and services costs of healthcare it's everything is going haywire right now but i'm just you know just thinking about it it's something that i want all of you to consider as we move forward we may stumble on things that we can cut back on that might make it possible but uh just just things to consider we're talking about a couple division five percent but why can't because nobody's rolling back our expenditures that's the part that's the issue is yeah we can roll back our revenues one question that was never answered was whether or not we can parse do a partial roll back was that next well that's what i was just saying you know split debate you know yeah well that i don't think that question was ever answered number one number two is again you know we can roll back our revenues but nothing's rolling back on our expenditures i mean and i mean you know well yeah but as the mayor explaining the biggest tax increase that we're going to be getting roll back the rate halfway does that not give us the more than enough revenue it may be possible that at the same time you see what happened with one construction project you know completely way way out there and this is what i'm seeing everywhere it's not just for that project it's everything i can't believe some of the uh some of the services that we paid for it were 40 an increase in one year i i don't even know how you justify that but i guess because everybody else is justifying it and looking at the flood insurance is going on through the group winning shorts home runners again a couple bucks i always think the citizens know how to spend their money but look there are going to be no thank you because we have to increase yeah i mean memories are short okay so dave the in your concern is the percentage change at the 12.8 percent is that what you're concerned about and the depth of the the asses taxable value right and how i mean i'm going to assume that most of our voting residents are homestead exempt they should be if they're not right so a lot of that increase in value is probably coming from home sales and new construction because we have a 10 cap for anything that is even if they're not not homesteading um so so i think you you may over you may be over thinking that that there's that it's affecting our resonance it's really probably not as much a lot there have been a lot of houses that have traded a lot of big sales in bellar beach this past year and i bet you'll find that's new construction and home sales more than it is existing residents okay you know i think that something that we could actually see in black and white and it's not that difficult to do so the maximum increase of the assessed value is three percent right yeah for home street most likely three percent so if we do the math and say okay if we keep the current military you know and you go up three percent that's going to bring it from x to y that's an increase of z versus if we roll it back it's going to increase it from x to y and or a to b and c what's the delta in that my guess right now i'm telling you that's going to be almost minuscule compared to the total amount of your tax that's true so we educate the people and say you know don't go crazy over this rollback thing because it's only going to be another i don't know picking up and 23 cents in the election whenever you showed it what the difference was uh i'm only bringing it up it's going to be such a hot topic but if you multiply that times all the residents here that could really help us as a city we're talking about we need more revenue to do things that the citizens want you know this is an opportunity where we're going to get more revenue because of the multiplier of 1600 houses of what we have here in the city so that's a good thing i think and then uh last night i'll let everybody go um the fire chief came in the e he talked to us and he's i thought it was 0.6 uh yeah so it sounds like a lot what's your idea on the solution i don't want to i don't want the county to come in and hit us with a two and a half milligrams i don't want to say that we never double our taxes for just for bel air beach it didn't seem too extreme to me but i think someone brought an assessment another assessment do you do that every year the problem with it is they've already written a language you know we know what that means to get that on the ballot they've got the language they're not that's all they're going with there's no changing they've already decided that's what they want and that's how they're going to the ballot because they've got to provide that what in august i think it is yeah they have to hurry up and get it out there so i don't think any of that's negotiable that's what they're coming you know and that's i was gonna go sit down and talk to him because i love all things i know what the needs they need i mean he had a good point they need we need the services they need new equipment they need buildings that sort of thing but i want to get a better idea of what they're how is it going to affect our residents as far as costco and that sort of thing across the board i'm i still have a little frustration with this admiral issue i mean i i can't get it out of my head that a servant a flat service fee is is more equitable because the response is the same he's gonna say okay well you big guys we're gonna have three fire trucks there instead of one well when's the last time one of those responses took place here i i'm speaking out ignorance there i don't know to me the best majority response is going to be in ems annuals so to me it's a very very equitable except for maybe a half a percent or whatever that percent of time is where they respond to a fire 99.95 percent of the time there's going to be an ems response and the playing field is the level as far as i'm concerned whether whether you live on sixth street or you live on harbor drive that's that's well i think what he tried to explain what i heard was that he was trying to make a comparison between condos and homes and the condos was a big difference based on the amount of time that they spend there that there's a fire and tearing it down and all that kind of stuff so it sounded like it wasn't the same what i heard versus in my head when i heard i was thinking about storm water that is the same you know that's underground everybody who lives on the street is benefiting from it his example was a mobile home and a six thousand square foot house and i said that wasn't a good comparison yeah because if you have a 6 000 square foot home or a condo where the condo back is on fire it's there's a whole lot more time and a lot more people to deal with in a condo versus a single-family residence so it was still example was bad yeah and i can correct or creatively chosen it was too yeah the way i proposed the way i the example i used he would spend more time at the condo than he would your house you know what single family home so you know the other experience with fees if it's like the assessments is it's a it's a rigorous process you go through it's not just like every address gets gets charged a certain amount there's a there are some hoops you have to jump through because you have to show equitable services and also a justifiable distribution i mean that's how assessments are done it's not just hey you look at this address you live at that address you have to prove those things with how how you determine that that fee and i think we went through yeah we have those who's there olive miller and whoever but does everybody i haven't even looked at does everybody pay the same fee single family residents versus condos pay different fees but all the single families regardless if it's a 18 million dollar house or 300 000 house same fee exactly yeah so you know i could see some people arguing with that saying why am i why am i paying more you know it's just a storm water pipe that's in the ground i can tell you this if they wind up folding and the county swoops in and takes it all over those big homes are getting one hell of a tax increase i agree that's right we have to do a good job i think if that thing is going to be on the ballot we need to help them understand the city citizens understand this so they're going to surprise them they're going to have there's probably people in this room right now that have a problem with it but you look at failure short they're they're asking for a millage rate that belarus shore is currently paying for their own town right so they their local taxes double effectively for living in miller shore now they do live in miller shore but my point is that's where you're gonna have that's where you're gonna have a big selling problem you're not you're not paying any taxes and now you're expected to double it for something that you're already getting now at this set price how many towns did he support uh indian shores indian rocks belair beach bellair yeah it's right just over the bridge over any rocks bridge there's not cool bridges oh cursed areas all right well let's hit it i haven't i want something else to go ahead fun i just had two more budget issues one is a little more description or on car allowances yeah i have a question about that and also uh to get our arms around the concept of placeholders i mean how much are we putting things in the budget where we know realistically we're not going to spend it all on or whatever and i'm just wondering and car allowance is uh it's taxable and uh mileage was not so something to look into just to make sure that we're doing it right i'm sure our accountants are all over if i bring that up well it was like i have no clue because i i didn't study that well how many of these we have car allowances why justification and then the the one i did flag was i think a nine percent increase in the car allowances that's what brought up the least car perhaps hey i don't know at what point do you give use a city car yeah all right everybody look at the show okay then just i know we kind of brushed this over that kyle's working on undergrounding golf pool with the golf ball of our utilities um i i recall that i had asked about do we have a bid for the north of the light the rest of the project because we have some limitations and the reason i'll tell you that i'm asking we have x number of funds and and we can't do the entire golf boulevard at once and so we automatically go to the cheaper option south of the light it might make sense to look at doing north of the light and get the most bang for our buck and get it done while prices before prices continue to increase because it's the bigger project to save money in the end you know what copper is so expensive right now that's your biggest cost in this i think copper is going to drop i think precious metals are going to drop in another year i think he would be forced to put that money out right now at least you want i did prepare the numbers um if you're looking for total cost of two phases you've got two main contractors are a one's utility company one is the ones that do the conduit so phase one total cost this point which has actually been verified against the contracts for them so that is two million one thousand eighty three dollars for all phase one that's including duke and tom phase two of the total is going to be three million and two hundred thousand four hundred and seventy four dollars so you're looking at about another thing emotionally so your your mini changing costs the utility consultants of florida and they're the ones that didn't understand prices they signed a contract with neoron's beach um that is good until august 10th of 2025 with extensions i think it's up to three year extension so that's not changing at all um when you look at the duke energy costs we're locked in with that uh that rate they gave us a two million um from the two million dollars it's a binding process that's only 180 we let it lapse they gave us the next quote and it was astronomical compared to and how much of that money do we currently have based on that special program starting this budget 2023 budget we'll have 2 million 262 000 and then each of the following week for two more years we get to the 950 000. so the total available budget by attempting like all of our so that's the 2.2 is just the penny money and then we have the money we took from the storm that we're not using from storm because we have those funds that came in from the federal government how much is that 700 that was i believe so so back to my point we end up with enough to do the north end of the city today if we add the 800 from the wrestler right now the deficit of what our penny money is um if we just took our penny for money uh we're at a deficit of 177 for both for both prices so is that something we could actually try to borrow that money like from a bank going back or use the hurricane or use it somewhere get it from somewhere oh yeah because that will get the rest of it right right yeah yeah so as it comes in we just we put it right back in and that may be a smarter thing but we should sign the contract it sounds like to me rather we can't let it lapse let's just just certain kind of things that we've got to really try right so that's a something to try to focus on if we're looking at these capital improvements and trying to get the projects done and that includes hiring the gentleman and his firm that's doing the work for anyone's speech as well that's turnkey that's everything yeah the numbers you just gave us so that would be beneficial it's not an emergency but something like a one-pager that would show us the phase one phase two and then the revenue that's coming in from the other sources and what other options we need to consider to make it work and the option to talk about are you gonna um we got the balance of the uh the rescue money coming in that's getting allocated for stonewater and and then using the rest of the unallocated reserves okay yeah so what we could just borrow from you have we heard anything on the grid for the generator i have not um last there was another request for information from the state and i provided that and i think that was about i want to say two weeks ago there so they're still working on it um they just wanted to double check the budgetary numbers and just have a recalculation because i think they they asked for the operation costs and i interpreted it to generator only and they wanted the complete operation cost supporting the eoc out of this building so that recalculated so if we don't get that grant is that competing money for this undergraduate if you if you get the grant you'll save on budgeted money that either way next pleasure here we have the money to buy the generator you get the grant and you're saving that 75 percent okay anyone else all in favor have a good night thank you"
