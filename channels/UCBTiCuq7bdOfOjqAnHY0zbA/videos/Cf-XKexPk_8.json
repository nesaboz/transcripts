    "transcript": "[Music] good evening everyone today is July the 17th 2023 it is now 6 p.m City council's budget workshop for the city of Miller Beach is called to order and now it's in Pledge of Allegiance by the United States of America to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty thank you Eddie would you please call council member Frank Banker brother council member Belinda Livingstone here council member Wesley Notaro council member Lloyd Roberts council member Mike zabel here mayor Dave Gaddis city manager Kyle wiesler and vice mayor Jody Shirley was unable to attend thank you Patty we only have one item one agenda item on this Workshop which is discussion and review of fiscal year 2023-2024 budget going to thank you man so first I want to just run through some of the changes from the last draft of this one that we talked about in the last budget Workshop page nine I say pages um the rental Revenue for the rental registration would be off that back up from is it like 10 um under [Music] license and registration about half of it on the page okay property ratio and then on page nine the following page for our Community Center rental income we up that a little bit more to the accurate with the actual was so I think it was at 24 5. and I got it up between the rental weddings and the rental parties of the 30. and then on page 27 . we start saving stop the savings plan for the computer hardware and software now that I noticed that I'm not going to budget the 2500 for the next budget either and then on page 55 Korean Insurance the sauce increased this year to the insurance and uh 3 000 and bump you know for four thousand last year was a little over it shows two years ago but for the last year's actual was about 3 313. so it came up a little bit this year so I raised that up and um what is that covers for um that covers the general liability catalogs and dogs page 58. that still needs to be changed I said that we're on the United Savings from the 7500 each year is 10 000 to save a little bit more or whatever we need to repair so that did not get changed and then I have some items for your consideration um based on our last discussion the first item I sent us to via email it's a it's on page 12 so at the end of the city council and this would be a 5 11 of 490. oh sorry 511 yeah 490 but it's uh although miscellaneous recording the console budget on page 12. 12 and then under recording meetings we currently have a budget of ten thousand dollars the last two Council meetings you've seen Victor come in and set up something different we've been just testing trying on to improve the live video function um for people who want to watch something from home and at the same time tackle the recording services that we already have provided they could put together his proposal with a explanation and it would require us to increase the budget from the 10 000 to the 14 000 in the cover our current meetings um to be honest I looked at the uh at the statistics from the live YouTube right now we average about four viewers with a typically watch every meeting ideally it would be you know something that we want to attract more people to get involved and watch the means try to make it easier for them to do it from older brother to know them to come in and make any dinner do something else at the same time yes yeah um right now what you see on Zoom if they log in through Zoom you can see them if since the offer the live feed on YouTube that doesn't require them to sign in or anything they just click on it streams it I think most people prefer that but statistically um they put together numbers so let me ask you um really what we saw on YouTube we didn't get to see it live I saw some things changed back there on that screen but I don't think that's what we were broadcasting to YouTube live we weren't actually sending out what was on that screen um if you saw I'd have to ask if there's enough clarification but if you saw the names popping up in the cameras where it's edited that but he's doing it all [Music] what is becoming the recorded file is that actually an actual live stream so he's using different equipment he's got that microphone is picking up things on the floor um and I've heard that there was some background noise like I mean I would ask him to see if we can dial that in better um but when it comes to it I mean I just want to be upfront with you know right now or whatever viewership is ideally we want more but this just makes it a little bit more watchable you aren't going to use the uh the option of staying home it also from my standpoint has somebody actually admits during the meeting so he's sitting over there um you know troubleshooting if there's any issues if we have someone presenting on the screen and things need to be switched around he can do it as opposed to me I'm going over I have no problem with doing it but it does it does tackle that issue um and that's something we were looking for and I definitely didn't like the fact that you were having to do it so I guess the question is is it worth the extra four thousand dollars to have better quality recordings and live feeds as well as the labeling and then somebody actually moderating the I think that's that's the question that's it that's the question um it definitely if you watch it if you compare it to it I don't know if you watch a couple other ones where it's just that it still cam [Music] [Music] so that is one of the big differences that previously you may or may not see who's actually speaking whereas with this new approach he's going to be able to move the camera and like so he operates two at once um and yeah she Zooms in he kind of has one who's talking and he's got to back off that shot but you know to get to the next person talking so he's kind of editing while he's while he's recording um if you notice too it sometimes at the podium he's got like an angle on them so we were not doing that previously for the ten thousand remember so he was doing that was it other with a two separate trifology cameras okay um and then he had to edit it afterwards and then it was like getting uploaded to YouTube but just as a video another live for you the person that was there that stand but was he actually assisting or was he just there um he comes and he helps set up but I don't think there's much involvement with that I think he built this based on the labor intensity of what he's doing doing versus you know just operating the camera because when I first saw this up I thought it was the additional cost was really just focused on that you know what's called Chiron that the naming at the bottom but if the key was my guest was left on the sin was it enables you to sit there and do your job in that case I'd be in favor because it takes you out of the tech shooting world and concentrate on the city's business at that point right and I see Victor is you know he's very tech savvy so some issue does come up that's unexpected or wearing out he can address it but I'm out of the camera interrupt all right uh council member living so I think from a professional perspective it looks it's a higher quality and also from historical data type that I think it would be easier for folks to go back and attract things and then of course there's the issue with how I'm having to get up so good [Music] you know Mr Baker so you're saying we're only getting about four average viewers yes I feel like we've lost some I think we started a little bit better we started doing this all but I think part of it is because the difficulty of watching not only that but I think the subject matter is very important so we have potential city council you got viewers if you're doing your job viewership drops it's like a thousand dollars if you were uh well the key is it enables before we have child running around checking bikes hold on guys I gotta go turn off I would have a problem trying to see that you know escalates into something I mean are we signing a contract or are we just agreeing that okay this is the new Ray and well I mean I can work that out with Victor if we wanna this is me over here yeah I am too uh [Music] um Cindy went through changes there's one that we mentioned not your last working group about a boat budget of some type yeah thank you okay the next discussion item is Page 16. that's in the non-departmental budget and this would be Professional Services author which is 5 19 and 310. top of the uh operating and this is going to be um a budget increase for the land and development code update the last he was one of the work sessions of the code that have not been updated in a while mainly considering the chapter 10 construction code um [Music] 74 flood plain chapter 94 and zoning these are all Land Development codes this wouldn't be solely based on those chapters only that we also cover any other sections that we thought need to be reviewed but it was brought up I think by the Bison area if we were to do a code review to be fast that we have a consultant a planner who has experience in the codes today so with uh over review it and represent it in a way that authorities that's maybe not not really knowing what recovery so I found two Consulting groups that are professional planning and both of them had contracts or the municipalities the better of the two prices I found in a proposal was an increase of thirty thousand dollars so it is a price but this which this would include meetings with the Planning and Zoning Board which is important the topic of course for like a public Workshop of public season you need to revise so working at least two meetings with them making recommendations explaining those recommendations and having them approve something to go to the council and it would be two two readings importance drafted by a planner reviewed by our attorney I did talk to them and they thought in their experience the attorney would just need to review the audiences that they write and they never really had their major changes over the attorney so our legal secretences we wouldn't expect any major increases with that but that the other range I got was close to forty thousand dollars so if we were going to do this with a consultant we didn't we needed to increase our Professional Services budget in at least 30 000. where does this stand with um with the impact study that's going to be required of us whenever we do or those changes the planner is fully aware of the requirements for the impact studies so it's built into the cause I forgot to mention they're also going to do the updates to the code for the cop cowboy It's a planner saying that Not only would they draft it but they would also do the impact study while they're doing the drafting so that we don't have to pay someone else for their weed uh recruiting a new ordinance I'll verify a letter from what I understood because they know what their requirements are yes if that's the case study every time we change something excuse me in our in our code can be very pricey and I don't think any of us have the expertise to do that so it would require Outsourcing um I'm I remember we were looking at there's only is this only Zoning for right now or is this the entire term this is the entire code but the sections we're going to focusing on are the building code chapter 10. chapter 74 flight plane management and chapter 94 zoning and they're pretty much the most expensive right this also fix our problem with swimming pools yes chapter chapter 10. um I had a quick list that I kind of but I gave them you know first some list was the height of the swimming pool then I also from recommendations of residents and council members um to to look at the setback requirements for docs especially when we have exception to pie shake Lots for you know you know building setback but also the considerations for docs because that's something that does come up in a variance um uh chapter 94 255 we have a threshold which is twenty thousand dollars anything over um you know we're required to to either get the uh certified appraisal of the structure um to compare it to the flood code twenty thousand dollars was in the early 90s it was that that was the number of set and now you can there's a lot of things you can do to your home and get over the twenty thousand dollars of anyone that prizes that come up um we have nothing on the non-structural field um and that's kind of presented issues or from my experience in the building where property levels are ending up as opposed we have the gradings that they're doing them properly but you're also you're ending up where people's walls are turning into retaining walls so that's something to look into um I put some regulations for generators um it's kind of been lumped under equipment but there's maybe some considerations that we actually have some regulations on generation generators um another thing I noticed we don't have any we have no not even our assigned code this is the same where a flagpole would be something um one another thing I want to tackle is the whole front set package from like a couple of something realistic that we can get everybody in Conformity from the city um you don't have anything to specifies to get actual clearance over a roadway we have eight feet uh height over a sunny block but we have nothing that actually talks about overheating this one's I'm sorry just a quick question on page 16 I really just caught my eye so the non-departmental department so is that for the salaries is that for Lara and the new admin person have been considered yes so that goes into full time right so that's the full time in the invarian showers of Laura it's the salary of Laura the executive assistant and the salary of the admin assistant at all time perfect and then one more thing I'll just bring up on this on my list was um what we're seeing now is uh instead of just having rentals for the houses that people are running out the entities on their property the pools and such so we're going to try and get ahead of that Randy's yellow background um yeah pursue later on but uh it's no mystery that you can almost expect maybe six to seven council members now between elections next year and prior to January 1st I just want to make sure we have enough questions for professional development for the hotels everything needed for the foundational education we kept our Council budget the same for our travel to that handles seven members total for the year we have Sciences until in 2022 budget um I think that was a four members or maybe a three-minute turnover the auction was 3 400 and we budgeted in that account you know nine thousand okay so here we go we've always had a lot in that account um but we haven't really spend it but it could be patient okay okay back to the proving uh we're into asking for the thirty thousand one Professional Services yes yes if it includes the impact studies foreign okay so on the same page Professional Services legal we talked about review I got some numbers back from Miami and his in his assessment long story short um we need at least ten thousand dollars he predicts for illegal for doing the charter review he presents a lot of elements that you know if there's you know residents that you know bring a challenge and it involves more legal research and explanation and it could be a little bit more I think a safe budget number would be fifteen thousand expectations 15 15 but I think just to be safe because you never know I mean I can hear some changes [Music] through the wall I can have to check that I think we were pursuing a charter reviews such as extending the number of terms yeah my question was how often do you have to honestly but just what I thought we had said was five which is two years three years ago three so we have to do another one too I mean there's also a potential race for salaries for City Council Members removing term limits already succeeded from two to three and extend the insurance I think the salaries doesn't fall under the charter yes that's already in the charter now foreign and calculations hours all right did you have any other ones so we're we're gonna put this in the letter everybody over here okay and I'll find out videos okay page 20. 848 is the handout the maintenance worker two that would be our love this position in public works which are you ask that if we were to consider having an additional worker to the public works department what that cost would look like what I did is I just broke it out each personal service line item for that one worker which would be the main disorder two and then I also showed as you know with the stormwater fund that's 50 percent is laid out like this because you don't see that in our terrible now that that amount is already included on page 20 then that is that was put in the budget right I thought it was best of sticking in there and break it out so see how it looks just a general request on one of everybody's thinking about that trial so in the previous world I lived in you know we've have a line item flexibility so you could overspin and understand within line ions then he got to a different level like in our world here it might be like when the public works department yes you know you could move light Islands again to overspin understand but at the end of the day when the year ended you could not exceed I'm just taking this as an example the total budget for Public Works for that particular Year yes so how do we do it here that's exactly how we do it okay um we you can as long as you stay within the departmental budget or if it's um you're good with Amazon you need that bottom line okay thanks I have no questions about that what else I brought this up at the audit committee meeting um we are it is getting tougher for all cities in this area to obtain and retain employees especially Wisconsin living so my if this doesn't work we'll be struggle actually finding a good quality third person the next thing I'm looking to would be providing Relief by Contracting hours and services but I just want to think yeah obviously I think this is doing the best the best route app it's just basically in response to losing you is that correct you moving up to the city manager position and we basically lost you know but that is not um the reason behind this is that um that we constantly feel that we have we're getting by with our Mains um we could provide better service the idea is that right now we're employees when we have to struggle to take time off right now if they do it's it's kind of like a Scrabble things get behind whenever we take on a special project things get behind this is in my mind if we had another person there would be no problem um busy provide better service but I also think that you were able to assist often where now you're really too basically sense to me I don't really have a problem with comments as you can set up a question on the timeline so this is improved and as the budget is being improved and going along when can you actually start advertising is it October 1st so we didn't advertise before that so when the budget is available October 1st we could be ready yeah I mean as long as yeah there's no issues from the you know the first regular meeting first again are you yeah that'd be a recommendation that maybe we could you know whosoever hopefully we'll find a great candidate and at that point you can tell them what a starting date is because that's where the money is available 37 000 all for World Trade here what's what's the same school laborers that cheat labor isn't skilled um a week it's every moment we've got somebody now like I said it's a struggle to find a lot of people it's very hard for someone to live on that wage yeah I can imagine I think it should grow up I'm from I think we need another maintenance right do we know of um just an estimate about what some of the other towns of anyone's Beach for example where they pay for their yeah rocks is lower yeah we're at work yeah okay um my recommendation would be to follow the state manager's recommendation if it doesn't work out he can come back for a I know from uh city manager meetings that all the disabilities are struggling to understand what they can for these positions okay sounds good thanks for doing here all right I think the last I have is the um I was going to be page 33. so I found a small Patrol boat it's a 21 foot it's one of the inflatable Halls it's uh it was found on a GSA government contracts a lot of police departments um it I found it on the contract that is good until 2028 I put in the budget for a hundred thousand um the actual quoted price I got this month was uh 81 000 that's for the public Traveler [Music] so if we approve this what do we get for our money what how often with the uh all of the city walls and Docs we're probably more than maintenance here probably wanting to know the condition of help with putting into certain items especially whenever it comes to the draining and doing inspections there but I still want to buy it and then it just sits there I would expect at least minimum every two weeks it gets used but on a weekly basis did we ever look at I think there's a place in Dunedin you can rent it's like 500 a month your character food they want to clear away and um you get the keys you turn the keys back in and throw it up goodbye there's no maintenance it wasn't too much because I've been out on those yeah yes you become a member and you're guaranteed vote if you take specific third class they're talking to the Freedom Boat Club yeah something like that yes I have a feeling that they would shut Kyle down immediately but it doesn't hurt is that the one you're talking about three years I don't know what it's called that's in Clearwater across the bridge [Music] I think that the disadvantage to having a service like that and I'm not not opposed to saving money at all or pleasing or not Leasing operating boats it's the certain services to get a deal you join the club and then you kind of have to do a reservation in advance well what good does that do you if you have an emergency so can we use a sheriff if you have an emergency fire department I I didn't have one with a turkey it's like it'd be nice to have a boat out there to pull off that timing that's floating as well so explain to me how this uh how this works I see twenty thousand dollars for the next five years when would you get your advertised well that's um so I budgeted out because with the last Workshop we said Savings Plan um when I was talking to the vice mayor today she's after meeting with the audit committee who's a supportive vote she is in support of the closest Quonset to be considered purchasing this budget here basically you're taking an internal loan right now and then every month Ever every year for the next five years she even put twenty thousand dollars in the budget the only concern would be is what happens if you cut the budget well it really would just we budgeted all this coming up okay to be available we had money budgeted for the year greatness both the chair of the Opera Dynamic heat sometimes of this business he has experience with those books so he's looking into it in the person they can repair on those not getting out the GSA you just have to you know ask Katie where's this coming from you know Department of Homeland Security going you know I don't know why yeah it's it's new purchasing sometimes they sell them off they used GSA session this is quoted from somewhere before I think down south new offer that contract okay I don't want to put you on the spot because I want to make you pull level three on the dock we're not getting that one right I'm not asking you to sell it I'm just saying can I get a price on that or wouldn't that be something that would last one is only yeah right and uh powered by 20 horsepower engine see I like the other idea the mobile human approach if you borrow his RV for them uh anyway I think it's a total price Angle now it's around awesome [Music] I don't know is it a one-man or two-man operation and are you going to be carrying tools with you definitely want something we can carry the tools with us and be able to move peace away I forgot what the said he was eight yeah I would recommend what I have for anything except for but yeah for what you're doing is good it's not a prank underpowered so you put something heavy in another person on there it's it'll get you there but I I wouldn't recommend it for professional let's take care of the community Rose I can also tell you if you're getting a 21-footer with what what kind of engine is on it here the Inflatables are probably the most expensive of all of them but they're also vice versa plus you bump up against something you're not damaging it you get built-in filters um I don't know let's uh let's just go around the room uh Frank what do you think I think we should explore the rental option a hundred thousand dollars that kind of might be spread more wisely another thing bless them Belinda that would be in favor with a timeline included for the responsible individual just like you have on your HVAC checks Etc I think you're gonna go out and issue your emergencies of course but you're going to go out twice a week and then check off and sign up whenever they've gone off I think that having an understood timeline for rounds is very important curious his friends but I agree with the boat I would just ask if we do do that we really do the same a lot of people may think this is a fun thing to actually have but it just really need a strong justification for it based on what is it yes we will be doing every two weeks this is exactly what we are doing when we go out [Music] so the funding is approved Kyle so how does how does the timeline work so we approved this at 20 000 a year for five years when you actually get the vote so be approve it this way we're not getting the vote we're really sold well at any point you can have a serious fight for something at any point you can say let's just purchase it now um what the vice mayor want to consider is that we do it sooner or later I mean I can put it in the budget for fifty thousand in the next two years that's what I would be in favor of I don't even want to wait wait in my ears it's just too far down the road so um that we think it's a good idea is justify then um you know I'm in favor of that in favor of getting it right away whatever funding sources we would need to have all right out of the generator money how much did we have saved how much of that have we spent period but we did not buy a generator so that we didn't know so we still have that money that just got put right back into the general fund yeah right I I don't want to spending that kind of money I've been on the other hand I've been complaining about not having this service as far as uh Mrs Abel's concerns expose concerns about usage and being careful and things like that I believe that if we did this I want it striked up it says Miller Beach all over it City Hall whatever even if it's your name all over it so that whatever that boat is seen everyone knows that we're actually doing our job and examining the city and making sure that we're healthy as a city and that we're keeping a close eye on things because for years too much is been allowed to happen on our on our water and also I think it would give us the opportunity to go right over circle around these folks that are always in the water and if we think that there's a problem and they only know what to do we can call the higher authority and have them come check it out also maybe that will and that will stop some of them I I would agree ment before I brought this up in the audit community that island that party island out there that is actually ours yes you could actually feel their Force the rules on there finally um it was a lot of things there's tables there's five holes weird things out there but other ones trying to it was a political science so we didn't like but I had to take down both Flags um but the attorney recommended that um there's a party going on on that island I'm gonna go check it out yeah Bridge cleanup this past Saturday the resident has a boat says that boat right there has been there for two years two years and I said there's a movie system I think it moves every once in a while but it could be a banker movement but he has never seen anybody how long and it's didn't maybe you can just see it's a theory Bridge how long do you have to somehow they get marked yeah if you feel that it can't function like it's not navigable they get the county will come and check it out make them passages so we really think that it can't operate well she doesn't have a bilge pump or something in there it's just all depends however inhabitants are on and there's always uh why you can report them but there's also more reasons why you can't I remember what they were saying that you know you know to remove it another bigger time all right so uh let's go back you're okay you're okay you're wanting to check out the rental services would you please do that anyway and if we could if that Services out there and it's really available then something to consider but going back to inconvenience if there's an emergency you're going to have to go get it up the street if there's any if there's a real like you know let's see if University you know we got the sheriff but if there's definitely an urgent issue I worded us um operating the water or somebody needs to be checked out then yeah that would be and then he got the timer off that's alligator okay any other comments or questions for the most part where we're leaning towards yes all right I'll get that answered that is all I have all right Council uh did anyone have any other District of questions comments recommended changes of this budget insurance I think it's Friday afternoon the insurance representative from the brown or brown that I was getting the quotes from he came by in person to tell me that he could not offer a little anywhere near what we're currently getting from before I leave the city's FM 19 is um reasons being our lawsuits we've had in the last five years they just they've seen the activity and the cases we got going on in this toward anything near it they did say you know if we can tell a different story um you know in the next couple of years come back around you know things kind of clean up in the middle office you know also aren't we don't we get the luxury of a group rate because of all the cities are combined it's it's self-funded insurance by the Florida leans yeah that's a must go um I think other cities do get a piece of influence with with brown and brown but given our situation they looked into us and I kind of give a mystery of all our claims that's what I got to answer your question any other comments or uh all right well um everybody okay with this budget yes sir it sounds like the council agrees foreign for 10 minutes and then in 10 minutes after we do adjourn we have the military meetings so now Mrs Abel would you like to make permission to I like the adventure congratulations all in favor"
