    "transcript": "good evening everyone welcome uh this is the august 22nd 2022 special council meeting and we're now calling to order uh let's do the pledge into the republic which stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all council member frank banker president council member leslie notaro here council member lloyd roberts here council member jody shirley here council member mike zabel here vice mayor glenn gunn your mayor dave gaddis interim city manager kyle wiefler and city attorney randy mora president thank you patty before we get started i would like to take just a second to wish city attorney laura happy birthday should we say all right we only have uh one item on this particular agenda and that is to discuss the city manager contract so that being said i'm assuming everyone has read the changes and uh has something to say about it so let's go ahead and start off with mike well actually i'm good with all the changes recommended except for the first one the health and medical insurance um about we request we consider contributing 72 percent towards spousal coverage costs right now uh you know i'm going to say that we really did push the budget uh to get the base included and just leave we're at the point right now we really have the leeway over the money to contribute toward that so right now i'm recommending no on that section but to approve the rest of it thank you floyd roberts thank you um i think with any negotiation there's hopefully an ability to create a win-win scenario for both parties typically that involves give and take in both parties so i think there's some options to potentially consider here i understand why mr griffith is concerned about health insurance for his wife his spouse makes sense uh being that there was probably some type of coverage potentially with his current job so i think there's a couple of variables out there that that we can ask him to consider because i agree with my coming coming forward with this amount of money based on the discussions we've had about trying to make this all fit is challenging at best so i think there's some scenarios where um medicare is a is a tremendous option i can tell you from personal experience i don't know how many people here are elderly enough to participate in that i am and my wife is i spent a lot of time investigating medicare what the costs are and the benefits are so without getting into all the detail i currently have a medicare amd and a supplemental account supplemental with united healthcare which basically allows me to go anywhere in the united states to go see any surgeon and i've come out of pocket zero and i pay approximately 150 a month for that service to me that seems very very hard to beat now i don't know mr britney could be 45 years old i don't know but he and his wife may in fact qualify for that so i think that's an option potentially for them to take a look at which i think at the end of the day would save money for the city and that's really what we're after we're trying to get a scenario that's going to make the potential city manager happy as well as the city so i think that's definitely a thing for um him to consider i think there's also you know i've looked at you know the three hundred dollars we were giving um the potential city manager that amount of money for his automobile allowance so that's thirty six hundred dollars a year here's the way i think about it in my head about the city manager in fort lauderdale we're never paying anybody for them to drive from home to work that's not part of the equation we all drive from home to work in any jobs we've ever had once he's here he may have scenarios where it may require him to drive somewhere in the city we're not fort lauderdale it doesn't take an hour and 45 minutes to get from the south part of fort lauderdale to the north part which would require him to put a lot of wear and tear potentially on his vehicle and expenses for gas we're a very small town probably 15 20 minutes either way from here to get to a residence to talk to somebody that may have an issue so my take is that 300 a month may be an option to negotiate with mr griffin to see if that's something he may be willing to give up to try to move closer to an agreement with the money my understanding is as an example um i talked with mr moore that if and when he was to travel let's say to jacksonville to go to some type of a meeting there where he gets per diem you know he gets paid mileage for that so the 300 is basically just for this area here in the city which i think is something he may be willing to give up if it helps us get closer to a number that's going to work for all of us good points thank you very much frank thank you um maybe our council can clarify this when i was working to deal with the health and welfare i was told under obamacare that if you're a full-time employee you did not go on medicare because there was a lot of employees i wanted to put on the merit medicare that were over 65 some of them weren't white and the boys just died at 90 in the city obamacare there was probation that you could not do that i'm not familiar with the intricate parts of the american health care act i can tell you that mr griffin would be covered regardless his wife is not a full-time employee here or elsewhere so that's not necessarily all into this employee here okay but i i can't pretend to tell you on my on the occasion of my 37th birthday how medicare and medicaid work um or more more particularly the american healthcare act but i was just under that assumption that you couldn't do that that may be case i don't have a problem picking up his wife's benefits as long as we pick up every employee that works with this city so i don't think an employee should be uh taxed to have benefits put it in your uh job review i put it in lynn's job i think uh we owe the employees everything we can give them they're great employees here and we're so fortunate to have one but if we don't do it for all i don't know thank you tara i agree with what mr banker just said about the spousal insurance we either do it for everybody or we don't but that is a serious knock on our budget i also agree with the thing about the monthly vehicle allowance for business related travel if if you have to travel to tallahassee for something you get accents per mile on your trip up there but you don't just get money to come to from your house to work to clarify as far as how the agreement presently operates within the clause on professional development the final sentence provides uh reimbursement for reasonable costs associated with travel um for professional development within your discretion uh so that that is there the 300 is not just necessarily travel um for professional development could be considered while the town itself is sort of the city itself is a smaller jurisdiction managers often go to county-wide meetings the big c meetings all of these sorts of things and pinellas county can be large even if you're not traveling all that so it's intended to capture both those things but ultimately that's your policy decision i just want to make sure you understood how the document structure the way i'm reading this it's 300 bucks a month whether you travel to anywhere in pinellas county or whatever it's just in a blanket three hundred dollars a month exactly correct correct it provides for hundred dollars a month the actual language is a greasy acknowledge the city shall not provide an automobile um city agrees that it shall come state manager with a monthly vehicle allowance of 300 for business related travel without limitation is that what we're saying you do you have to put in an expense report to get up to 300 or you just get 300 on your check for here's your here's the line that says car it is a vehicle allowance of 300 it is not uh it does not it's not structured as a reimbursement base like the phone one is specifically says um one of them specifically says oh on phone it says upon presentation back with documentation of such expenses that does not appear in the automobile um it does provide however that the manager shall be responsible for the payment of insurance fuel maintenance and other costs from the video's personal vehicle the city's not assuming those costs allowance correct thank you jody yeah the only thing i had issues with too is the very first item that helped the medical insurance is not something we discussed at all spouse and i'm not in support of starting that we've been kind of hard-nosed on the employment manual and following the procedures that are in there and this is in this this one area we're not you know to deviate from it doesn't make sense so i would not be in support of that only combination thank you i think uh after the last meeting the consensus was losing stuff in there i think he was personally overly generous with respect to the sound okay i'm in agreement with everyone here about the spousal coverage you have to do it for everyone it's already hard enough to justify what we're trying to work out with this guy i think he can do great things for this city but if the sixteen thousand dollars is a deal killer and so be it and we just raise the bar uh to start the process over here and for the sake of clarity um the sixteen thousand represents the full cost is seeking 72 of that 16 000 as the contribution and for the benefit of the council mr griffin is president and available this evening if you do have directed questions for him but the the sum is 72 of that 16 000. right roughly 11. don't quote the lawyer on the laugh i'm just giving you a chance do we have the figures of what it would be without having his wife for total compensation or for medical his insurance is the same amount of the 16 042 i believe it was sorry 16 092 um that's the cost of his his wife is at the same exact cost so yes we have it and that is a cost we are paying for him regardless right um it's just his way for you so on top of the salary and all the other benefits this would be an additional five hundred dollars just right clarification all right let's go back around this way playing gun you use that term total compensation so you must have the number what is the one on the word i don't have the number precisely i was using that term as in part based on your last discourse as you folks talked about the salary the retirement contribution the phone budget the car budget somebody at the table done that i'm not going to quote the exact number off the top of my head but with all of that it was my understanding we were somewhere between 180 and 190 um around 180 i believe was the figure for his compensation uh before we talk about the addition of his wife um if it wasn't 180 it was within you know two thousand dollars for that so we're about to make decisions and we don't even know what the exact moment i don't believe that's entirely accurate your attorney has not done the mathematical calculation i believe i did speak with uh staff kyle and patty on this and they did have an approximation of that figure i just don't have that figure finally i don't i wouldn't say it's about 185 thank you any other questions i'm totally sure um i'm just not in favor of um and i would never fool your mathematical equations but i think he came up with a figure of around 39 000 which would bring us up to about 185 or whatever like that so so we're far exceeding and i'm out on a positive because i'm going to do the old one i think we're just far exceedingly so this is clarified so every every employee medical plan is basically sixteen thousand ninety two dollars no it's variable based on health uh i mean not health sorry age age gender and brackets okay um and and just at that age bracket that's the number okay if this employee was 33 that number would likely be very different okay so some could be more than that so it could be less than that but then that's my understanding okay all right that's fair so again so the point seven two percent i mean the seventy-two percent of that was eleven thousand five hundred and if mr griffin agreed to the three hundred dollars a month going away so that's 3 600 just to put some numbers in there so now we're down to eight months it's eight thousand additional for his spouse the city when we pay thank you mike now definitely agree with the council members um specifically about you know his package understand spousal coverage is an option if you pay 100 out of pocket is that correct okay all right i don't really have any other questions at this time where do we go from here we just need to decide if we're sticking with this and uh striking the spousal coverage or uh or we look elsewhere i'd like to recommend and give the candidate an opportunity to speak mr griffin would you like to come speak thank you and thank you for coming tonight thank you very much thank you for uh all the hard work you've done for about this issue before i raised it and what my initial request to you through randy was that uh the out-of-pocket cost that i have now my insurance my my spouse's my west insurance would be comfortable right now with my engineering firm and i asked for that uh you know out of my well-being my webs my wife's will be and my will here which is also my little being um the um right now i pay 4 200 a year about 350 a month for my coverage and my west coast and that was my request to randy that you consider that um councilman roberts mentions an excellent idea which is that uh perhaps there's room with given the automobile allowance perhaps that's not as critical as it might be in other circumstances and i indicated that i'd be willing to uh i'd be willing to forgo that that would produce the figure just about eight thousand dollars and so um my request to you would be compromise to you is that the spousal coverage will be paid 50 50. say you would pay 15 i would pay six percent of them council frank baker uh mr griffin yes sir are you saying you don't need a car coverage what i'm saying is i think the council of robbers argument that there should not be great in-city local mileage car expenses which i think is a valid point and uh to put us closer together i'd be willing to forgo that and apply those dollars instead to the spousal coverage so i guess my big question is to save this city three thousand dollars or you're willing to forget the card allowance yes if you don't need it i don't think we should be petted it's what i'm saying well that's that's what that's what i was saying yeah i'm take i would like to just take it off the table that's what i'm saying yeah yeah no i just want to take it over if you're not going to use it or if it's not needed it's as far as cities go city manager compensation goes a very modest car loans i've had car allowances doubled and uh almost triple that yep i understand that but what i'm understanding now is we're studying something that you're not really gonna we don't really need so you're saying that you don't need it um what i was what i was indicating was that the expense was for this city was not that was not that great and that perhaps in spirit and compromise i was suggesting a resolution that i thought was uh was fair instead of asking for 16 000 i was asking that see what that caused i'm i'm gonna chime in one second well i'm gonna write to you i don't look at it as i don't need it i look at it as i'm willing to give this up it's part of negotiating floyd roberts yes sir so you i just want to clarify the numbers so you were saying the city would pay half and you would they have is that half of the 16 yes sir and i presently paid 4 200 a year right for for my coverage my wife's coverage okay so um if you have the thirty six hundred dollars a year car allowance it brings you close to eight thousand like seventy eight hundred so that's what i was suggesting and then let me make sure i've got this correct out of that 8 000 we would pay half and you would pay half exactly so the spousal coverage would be 16 000 and i would pay 8 000 the city to pay absolutely as a suggested compromise and then on top of that i'm sorry on top of that then the 3600 if we remove the 300 for the car allowance would effectively bring that eight down to a four number sort of fish that the city would actually is it am i seeing those numbers correctly so you would pay eight let's just round though so you would pay eight thousand and not get a card is that what you were asking for mr well then that would be that would be uh in effect uh i'd be paying in terms of relative contract just now i'm paying 11.5 000. so no that would not be the case well this is why i understand the numbers so if you were paying 8 000 for your your spouse's insurance then the insurance company would say okay the city of brooksville i'm sorry city of color beach boys let's see the other beach uh you're paying eight 000 to make the insurance company that's right that's right but we effectively would be reducing your compensation or our expense by taking away 3 600 from the automobile [Music] to pay for health insurance forty two hundred dollars at payment plus thirty six hundred dollars i would add to that so in effect i'd be seeing eight thousand dollars less compensation if we added the car allowance two it would be 11 600. so it'd be quite a drop back it's lincoln i just have a question how this medical insurance works is so if we were to pay something towards the pen is that a total cap or once you hit that cap does the city still have a liability position or procedures or expenses over and over that's all between myself and the insurance company short answer no the way it would be structured would be the contract the way the contract would be right would be clear that the city is not paying for any deductibles or continuing costs beyond the cost of the plan itself so if he goes to his doctor and they say well there's a you know 42 charge today that's out of pocket for him we're just paying for cost and plan is what we're speaking about at present i'm sorry my position [Music] i think we've compromised considerably and it's a compromise on both sides and i'm not seeing it on the other side so i just say that we can't do it basically material i agree with what um jody just said it's a little hot right i think we need to revisit this car allowance i mean the former city manager had a truck um i saw him all over the city i mean i think kyle can as to that he used this truck for many penny johnson here removing trash then you moved so we're not going if he doesn't need the car allowance i think we should save ourselves about three thousand thirty six hundred dollars just for purposes of the trying to determine the consensus and sort of eating the elephant one bite at a time on the health insurance portion what is your position one if we're going to do it for one we do it for all thank you billy roberts and i believe the previous city manager did get apartments right yes okay is there any chance that you were able to look into further depths of options for medicare and supplementals for your wife and if that looked like a very good medical plan option for her that if you found that and by some chance we were able to approve something here a smaller portion that you would then move to that and remove it in the entirety anything that the city was paying towards your spouse i would move aggressively in that direction again that would touch on the unaffordable health care act the parameters of that well i think that i mean i don't fall underneath that because you're retired well she's part-time so she doesn't really qualify for any type of a medical plan it depends what her employer's plan the summary plan description of her employer will define what it covers [Music] um yeah not 100 on that but i don't think medicare can tell you that if you're working part-time that you're obligated to use that other name names i didn't think that either and i was pre-schooled because i wanted a lot of guys i agree with the councilman i'm i'm uh in the same mindset i just don't think that our city can swallow this i know it doesn't seem like a whole lot of money in the grand scheme of things just added spouse but there are other ways and i know for a fact that our company just encouraged the more seasoned employees to reduce their costs by going to medicare or medicare and it was a substantial cost savings and they did exactly what you were talking about where you subsidize it and you come out with great insurance in fact as you know wendy's parents they started dietetic and her parents are on the same plan they're using medicaid or medicare i'm not sure because i don't follow it but but they switch and they still go to mayo clinic so that's something to consider but as far as just outright let's just go ahead and put her on mayor if i may suggest just from a procedural standpoint it seems that the majority of the council is is opposed to this element as this is a negotiation there may be some value given to the candidates here and asking you may not need to make a decision the candidate may be inclined to make a decision themselves you may be you may wish to ask them what their position is at this point as the council has sort of indicated it's on that issue with the advice mr griffin listen what are your thoughts on investigating the medicare plan and consider going that route i i just don't think that uh as a municipality we're willing to accept taking your wife on our insurance i would be willing to aggressively pursue them but um i would hate to be in the at the present point and and drop my insurance that i have for my wife my present company and then hope that worked out that would be hard for me to handle and uh be hard for me to celebrate i understand my advice at this point would be to question the question posed and if you don't mind my asking mr mayfield regardless of whether medicare a third-party independent american healthcare act if the council the council is made clear at this point at least presently that it is not inclined to contribute to your spouse's health insurance with that in mind are you still interested in entering into this agreement with that knowing that term regardless of whether or not you can find a supplement and i don't mean to put you on the spot but being how we have to do our business in the open um at this stage we're sort of at a critical cross point where the parties are having to evaluate where their respective red lines are to speak proverbially and i just want to make i know you and i've had some preliminary conversations in that car yes and not the discussions we've had you know that i asked for a package similar to the package i have now correct 4200 and then i also mentioned to you the possibility that in light of the fact that i did get to get a car allowance with this position that i've been willing to allocate them the value of that was what i would pay and that would push the amount to close to 8 000 but it sounds like that even with that backing up twice that's not going to be good enough i would i wouldn't say that you're negotiating against yourself you've offered an offer you've made the offer of those things understood understood you gave two alternatives um the council didn't understand sir uh the council has considered both but but is not inclined to entertain them um and so knowing that at this point it really comes down to how critical that element is for you and and we can continue this conversation i just want to make sure that we are all speaking from a place of shared information at this point the council i communicated both those positions they've considered both of them explicitly in this open meeting unfortunately from the party's positions we weren't able to reach a middle point on that at least at this stage and so the question is do you have anything you wish to not i'm not even asking for an additional counteroffer i'm just asking is that a red line for you is it the absence of does the absence of spousal insurance coverage or a quantum towards special insurance coverage mean that's a deal breaker for you it's a serious matter i'm going to have to talk about it with my wife tonight that's and that's a perfectly respectable answer i just i'm trying to make sure my my client the council understands where you're where your position is at this stage it's fair enough do you have any other questions at this point just one i think your wife is allowed to say because if in fact you were to move on from your current employer she's covered by that insurance she by law i believe has the opportunity to say i want to continue that coverage with your current employer and so they they can say this is how much that would be because they can't throw her out on the street that's right that's right but that would have been that would be the cobra right and that would be a very large number back to the sixteen thousand dollar number plus five percent it's one five percent five percent and ultimately while we can suggest opportunities or options for mr griffin to investigate we can't provide him advice um ultimately you know he's not obviously positioned to rely on none of us are his insurance agent or his fiduciary in that regard so we can certainly give him options to explore but ultimately that's for he and his wife to determine not for you know the council to provide him and he to rely on those statements unfortunately cobra i understand coke is very expensive he's something like a board with 16 000. for you to continue to go running too yeah i think there's a time limitation thank you mr burton thank you very much at this uh at this time uh is the council an agreement we've given a little time to speak with his wife and get back with senior talk attorney birthday boyfriend yeah and then uh absolutely i will keep you updated on that and if we if we have a proposal to bring back for you whether that's a changed agreement or the agreement in its current form just without that term um i will make that clear to you as i have in each in each draft highlighting what's different thank you very much and i appreciate all your hard work on this matter i think i think it's just contracts since this is an open discussion on this contract i mean things that were pointed out here we should review section 5 at automobile i'm not so sure that i'm in favor of making any changes to the terms we all agreed on to this point it's just the new you know in all fairness to everyone i think if we start rehashing this contract that just changes the whole perspective well it does but i mean once you start picking up the contract like he was right his spouse will benefit i think we need to explore what has been revealed to us tonight that this car allowance may not really need it well i think he's i think it was part of the package that we all agreed on and his he was negotiating not necessarily saying it wasn't needed but saying he's willing to trade one for the other so i just want to be careful did we be in motion to adjourn this need i'm about to ask for that do i have a motion coach frank banker do i have a second second all in favor all right let's take five minutes"
