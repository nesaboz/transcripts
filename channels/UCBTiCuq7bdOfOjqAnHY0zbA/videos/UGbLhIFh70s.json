    "transcript": "okay so we're calling to order the um meeting of the park and rec board wednesday june 16 2021 um secretary sussman could you please call the roll sure um kaylee devlin kelly kelly sorry tammy lavender here nora kodak here george ortel nicole sessman here all right perfect so um the first order um is the approval of the agenda do i have a motion to approve today's agenda yes okay yes so nora made the motion and kelly seconded it okay okay and then item number two approval of the minutes from may 12 2021 everybody good with those minutes from last month okay so then nicole and i will sign them and turn those into patty okay we have no citizens for item number three so we have no citizen comments today so number four um thank you guys for getting back on the invite so this is i just kind of put together something for the um you know like the mailer like this that we're gonna send out to everyone so it'll make it easier for them to put it together so i mean i don't know she said everyone got back or everybody that got back to me said everything was okay the only two things that she added or changed was i guess officially we're not the parks and rec board it's the park and recreation board so we'll change that um on the next one and the other thing was okay so i think on the original it said behind beller beach city hall so she wanted to put bayside park behind city hall and then hyphen it and put some parking available because we're going to have the ice truck like i know we have 75 according to the parking agenda that covered not the agenda but the parking schematic that kyle has so we have 75 spots so i think that's going to be plenty but we're going to have the the italian ice truck out there and so just we put some parking available i'm hoping it'll promote people that live close to walk or like bring their wagons or ride their bikes or whatever is everybody okay with that or makes sense um i don't want to put like 75 spots available or i mean i didn't really want to put a number on it just because i think that's weird so like you know people who live here know what the parking is like here and we do have the italian ice truck on the thing so i think that's fine and then on the back side of it like we can't mail out anything else so like this was the one where i wasn't really sure if we needed to add more things like on the halloween costume parade i think i got everything on here that we talked about except for um yeah i mean everything the dogs must be on a leash every everybody good with the time frame from 10 to 12. most parades are in the morning in and out the parade will literally last 20 minutes and then um we're you know we'll do the little prizes and then refreshments and then people can leave when they want to saturday yeah i know you said you weren't available on saturdays i just it's like most parades are on saturday morning though and if we put it on sunday it'll be like church or this is family day or whatever and we can't really have it on a weekday so [Music] okay yeah well okay so this is the other thing because kelly just mentioned right before the meeting she got her her notice and you know we kind of knew it might be coming and she's if she's not going to be living in bellar beach she's going to have to resign her position on the park and rec board so we need at least three people to do the dog parade as far as like someone to lead it someone in the middle and someone at the end at the tail so we don't have any like straying people so we can keep everybody in line so nicole and i george are you up for doing the dog parade yeah okay it'll be 10 minutes walking it's we're going to do exactly what we talked about last time we're going to meet in the parking lot and we're going to walk down or like on the sidewalk down like towards gulf boulevard we're going to take a left we're never crossing the street we're going to take another left right on i think that's ninth street on ninth and then we're going to come up right in behind so we'll be on gulf boulevard very little time we'll be on the main drag a very little time and then we're going to be back in the parking lot doing the thing so the prey that we're walking around it's like short and safe and then we'll be right back doing the um the judging like i'm gonna have people who don't have dogs or kids be the judges if you guys are all okay with me asking like they'll be i'm thinking of three couples that are beller beach residents that won't be involved in you know like the kid or dog thing but like you know would love to just sit there and be like hey you know and then vote on it because it'll be fair um you could offer it up to any of the council members too yeah and i don't care who judges exactly so that's a good idea like it doesn't matter to me who judges you guys can throw out anybody and will ask because the three people i thought of could all say no or i'm out of town or whatever but i just thought as long as they don't really have any um involvement and then so i couldn't really think of anything else i would add like if i was going to send out a second invite for that you know you have to register by the 27th so this was the one i was kind of looking for some input because these are going to be the most expensive thing on our on our budget for this event so we will only we can only have one shot to mail out for the rest of the year so and my obviously my christmas tree lighting and holiday social is very quick to point so i didn't know if like he wanted me to add another bullet point because this writing is very large i can make it a lot smaller why do you want people to register so i know how many people are coming and um i mean if we don't have people register and we just come down here and set up we may have no one show up or three three dogs and two kids like i just kind of it's more of like a rsvp like a head count and all it will be is hi this is my name and i'll have my dog or i'll have my dog and two of my kids or it's gonna be real simple registration they don't have to fill out a form or a waiver or anything like that but that's why like i don't want to just come in blind on that morning and plus we need to know like refreshment wise like really what to have um so i mean and if people show up that morning we're going to give them a number and let them join it's not a big deal if they don't i was just you know it's so like yeah it's like having a party at your house and getting a caterer yeah you just kind of want to know the number would they be allowed to call in the city hall so you know they can call in or call me so that that's a good point um should i say call city hall to register or should i say call me i mean will they care will laura care if people are coming you can i don't think so i mean you can just put my number two okay actually like people won't want to come down here to register actually call call city hall to register what about email horrible care um what's the email for city um maybe info at cityofbellarbeach.com that's fine too okay i mean we're just trying to get a feel yeah it's not like a definite list exactly okay so i will add that anything else for the parade one thing i thought about these events everything on this invite is rain dependent and um no it's kind of like we had a hard enough time finding these dates and um what are we going to do we're going to cancel and that brings up a really good point because the the obviously the 800 jazz band like they're not making a sign of contract but if it's like you know even if they're under there on the concrete it's not covered so the question that they ask of me is we don't do rain dates we don't do contracts like but they would expect to be paid so can they just move inside the doors for like you think if you were to go as far that wouldn't be the best turnout but at least you'd have them bring people indoors but that's a so that's a saturday at five o'clock like will there be someone here from the city like we'd have to because they have to plug in inside and all that yeah i mean we're going to have to be here yeah well you're going to have access so i guess if the situation was that bad just trying to make the best of it pull people out into this room i guess so that's kind of our rain date for them and they'll be happy to hear that because i wasn't really sure like i knew we were gonna have access because of the we need the electricity and stuff like that but like to basically just like maybe set them up in the corner and people can come in here and listen yeah i think that would be best yeah let's just hope it doesn't get to that point because right it'll be a cluster but um plus you didn't need bathrooms you can have access to the bathrooms as well yes absolutely yeah that's essential if we're gonna have people here for three hours yeah we definitely need the bathroom access so so that's our rain like but for the parade and for the christmas so like lynn wanted that monday i guess you know that would be right before the december city council meeting so his thought was you know you have a group of people here anyway we can do the christmas tree lighting and a little social and then it's literally from five to six like that one is not a big deal but i didn't know if i should put before the city council meeting or if we need i mean people know that it's the first monday of the month typically but do you think there needs to be anything else under that one no so that's good they can just be surprised when they get here christmas cookies it's not a surprise it's like cookies and hot chocolate do you want to i should put that no i was just curious that's what you're thinking um yeah sure cookies and hot chocolate or spice cider something holiday-ish is it no alcohol you can't advertise i know i wasn't asking if we could advertise but is i the parade is absolutely alcohol free we can't be given alcohol then i'll just put it we won't even address it yeah like if if people want to spike their hot chocolate with peppermint schnapps then they can have at it [Music] okay well just yeah okay we'll just leave it as is i'm gonna wear a shirt this is booze girl and i'll just carry a class good boy shot girl twinkly lights okay so we'll just leave that one um we could put holiday refreshments how about that or something like that yeah and that one that one i mean you're not going to really get rain at that time but it would really be that weather dependent because and plus i mean it'll be a five minute christmas tree lighting and then we could come in as you can see from underneath okay so yeah so two two out of three of them are covered for rain or weather the only one that would be just canceled is the costume parade and if anybody showed up we would have the like treat bags for the dogs and the treat bags for the kids pre-made so we'll just give them their treat bag and send them on their way and then the stuff from amazon we could return oh yeah um because we're gonna what we're getting numbers so you just order a pack of 1 to 100 and then i thought like the you know it doesn't matter one will start from 1 to 50 and the other the kids or the dogs will just section them off 50 because we're not going to have 100 people enter this and then for the um the parade anyone i've ever been to like if you're the parade leader or you're monitoring it from the sides you have on like an orange vest yeah and then i literally got stanley like a printed black t-shirt that says security embroidered since she can't enter and she has a fluorescent orange harness and leash so she'll take up the rear because she'll just smile because like you know like our dogs can't be in it our kids can't be in it so yeah we use the best than that that works with let's get new ones your kids are yeah well i don't know we can talk about it because like now we've got two people that are upset their kids can't be in it nicole's like i can't bring my dog well one you can bring yeah just for show for sure but we can talk about that i'm indifferent like if i don't think anyone's gonna be upset if your child wins but you never know okay so um i will send this to the printer and start getting pricing because obviously we can edit it again once we get the proof this is just my proof because i wanted to literally have something pretty solid to send to them front and back they're speedy yeah okay and then i was thinking this size approximately right is that good not too big not too small i get 20 of these a day so i want it to be something where like can we put the bellar beach logo on this so it doesn't get tossed yeah yeah we need to put the beller beach logo for sure it is it's beautiful okay okay perfect and then um all right so we had our first we had our first beach cleanup on the first saturday of june we have four people and went pretty well we we did exactly what it said we picked up garbage for an hour we had donuts and water and everybody went on their way so early huh you did it too early eight too early in the oh because of the dead fish yeah other fish well you have those all cleaned up before july 5th i've gotten some positive feedback on the beach clean up yeah okay good yeah and so i and i did have someone call me like who saw my number on the website or wherever to say i'm interested in next month so hopefully get more calls just kind of keep talking about it and we'll post it again you know it's going to be like a slow process but it's so fast honestly like it's it was quick and easy like we we collected decent amount of garbage and then you know we left so it was good is it hmm july i think july 5th is the first whatever the first saturday of the month is do you want to put that on you kind of do i can tell okay sorry i went out of order so every we already did the proof the mailer it's on yeah now it's on july 3rd july 3rd okay so the next one's july 3rd sorry um so italian ice vendor nicole did you find out if they're charging us to just come or if we have to hit a minimum no it's just it is what it is people pay as perfect they order okay that's great and then um what i did was i emailed this to kyle this is kind of like the makeshift budget for the jazz in the park so um because we moved it to the evening it went from 650 to 800 for the jazz band the invites i put 1200 but that's a guess so i'll get the estimate from him if we're only doing water and ice and coolers it's probably going to be about a hundred dollars so we need to talk about booking and getting the exact pricing for one security guard can you help with that this is padal sky show yeah yeah and do you i just put 300 do you know sounds about right for some reason i'm thinking 75 an hour so to be a little less than that for one year all right i will i'll find out for sure and how far in advance do we have to like is there like a form or how do we book them okay great and then for like decor linens we don't need a lot of tables like we need like um the hydration station and we need a table to sell like the t-shirts and the um beach towels and stuff like that so we really only need like two tablecloths and then i thought maybe since it's just a jazz thing i would you know maybe some like purple and yellow and gold balloons or something in new orleans just a little bit just to show that oh sorry jk heart that this is where um you know the band is or just so you know you can tell something's going on so i'm thinking we should be able to do all of that for under 100 bucks um and then so i know there's no signage ordinance at this time and there's no there's no issues with um size so i didn't know if we could put like you know how when bel air has like their chili cook-off or their car show or whatever they get those little signs with the stakes in them they're not very expensive you can get them like can we do a couple of those like in front of city hall or like down gulf boulevard like maybe a week prior to because like yeah there was like an hour argument about the signs oh yeah it ended 11 we stayed till 10 and it lasted till 11 15. wow it was the most let me just double check double check on the sinuses yeah it sounds fine sponsored yeah sometimes special events like that what's okay so i didn't know like and we can look at it once he checks like we can do the little ones like they do where you know they stick them in the ground or i didn't know if we could put like one big bigger banner up in the front of city hall like maybe a week prior or two weeks prior yeah if we have it made we'll figure the staff and figure out a way to to hang it yeah okay have you guys ever hung up a banner out there for anything we've never they discussed um the old parks and record doing banner because there is there's poles that go over bell boulevard like a wire too that was meant for a banner oh um like a cross like so that was something they were going to do they never asked how much it cost i think that's what started really what i'm doing because it's so expensive it was it was pricey right but you know to make it do you remember approximately and then you gotta get it out there too right so maybe that's like one that we would have to put like the remaining events like you know how irb does like this is going on it's going on it's gone they do like one with all of it if it's that pricey it would have to be up for three months though september no september october november is four months it would have to last four months to cover all the events that we're talking about well she's saying they only put up one to cover all the events in our events once they're all over once they're all over they always put up and take it down yeah we're just saying you would have to stay up for four months since like the last event is december like we can't do four banners or three banners for three different events if they're 1200 a piece so we're we'll do some pricing it was a matter of multiple okay i'll do some pricing and um and he can find out what we can and can't do like even if we can i mean cause i will win the small signs the small signs like right in front of um so people coming over the bridge and then maybe just going in each direction oops on gulf boulevard in case you miss them or we could just put them in front of city hall i mean i don't think we have to plaster the hole yeah just like in this i mean anybody that lives here has to come over that ridge pretty much so especially when you hit that light i know that's private right across the street from that light would be a perfect spot for a sign i know that's someone's yard but technically the city owns from the street to the sidewalk right so it's not the reason where it is yeah so we can do that so i just look like city hall at crossman yeah so i'll just look at the small signs we won't worry about the big ones and they're costly and they're hard to hang and like so we'll just do small maybe next year when we have a whole year of events next year when we have a holy grail i know okay and then so garbage and recycle i'm thinking we just have that you said we have all the stuff though so that shouldn't cost us i just ordered more cans so i got five brand new garbage cans and recycle awesome thank you that's enough recycle okay and then the last thing is so like we we talked about like we're giving away you know bottles of water and we talked about having the koozies made like just the little sleeves that were white with the bellar beach logo like that's on his shirt or whatever and so once you do all of that um so currently for the generic ones we're paying two dollars and fifty cents a piece for those it's around three dollars a piece so like if we order a hundred obviously it's three hundred dollars i'm okay with that but i don't know i mean i wanted to talk about it and then i i know well ladies and gentlemen are we still doing the water bottles no no those are gone okay so we we because i mean nora is the one that brought up the point is like why are we making water bottles and then giving them a bottle of water because then they have two things in their hands we put the sleeve on the bottle of water that we're giving them and then just that's how we're handing it out so yeah no water bottles just the and then if we have some extra if we don't have 100 people that show up then we sell the the extra so i just i don't i mean you know lynn could kill it i guess because it's too expensive but i don't really know the water bottles and we are doing both i think if you guys really want it he's good yeah it's like it's a little it seems a little high for a giveaway but i mean i just think it would be nice like i don't know if you even give away a hundred like i said if you said then you just sell them yeah i think it's really nice like i love when i go to the things in indian rocks beach and they give you like you know they're usually sponsored by you know a real estate company or something like that but then they just give you the little koozies and um we don't have to put jazz fest or anything like that it would just be like bellaire beach so they could use it and we can maybe put 20 21 or something much are those towels the towels are 15. under 15 14.95 or something like that for the towel and the embroidery which is excellent and i think they're going to go super fast i think if we post them for sale before the event they will be gone 15 i'm hoping like why are two clocks right um well then maybe you know they should just do for an even 20. i mean if you're going to sell them for 18 you're going to be constantly giving cat and big change back i know it's i would want to mark it up that high so 18 yeah i'd rather just buy the even dollar maybe but you know like we do with the other stuff just a couple of dollars like 16 bucks 16 yeah okay yeah 20 seems like that's that's too much because we're not okay so yeah so they come in under 15 so if you're everyone's good with 16 that's great but we just have to make sure we have lots of singles because it's a cash only thing so we're going to be handing out tons of single dollars is and that's fine but if lynn's okay with it and you have all the information to order those oh you got the towels done already no they're in they're submitted he's working on it oh okay i thought you meant you timetable so it's going to be getting close okay and then with the koozies i'll just get the final which i think can go for if you guys are on board with it um and then i'll order those okay is everybody good with that i don't have anything i don't think with the bellar beach logo on it so it would be kind of nice to have some stuff from what it looks like on the website they'll look nicer than what he does yeah can you let me know when the towels get here so i can like take a more professional photo for like everything like for the merchandise and everything because i feel like the towels were because we're going to sell them prior right well i think if we sell them prior they'll be gone before the event i mean that's what i think i think as soon as people know that we have them then you know they debut at them well i know i don't know like we can sell them beforehand and order more i'm asking the question i say we debut at jazz because then they'll be oh where do i sit oh i have nothing to sing but they're white so they got to be really clean you can bleach them that's a good thing about white color safe bleach i don't know i don't care like um like we should post them beforehand so people know what they look like so like maybe they would come here just to buy them yeah yeah i'll do a snake and then go because i want to like lay the towel out and put like the tank and the t-shirt and the koozies like this is all the stuff that's going to be for sale so that like we're posting in advance so even if they just don't know about the event like at least the merchandise is here there's a reason if they don't want to stay at least there's a reason for them to show up i like that okay then we'll do that and then um stay for the music heck yeah stay for a good time okay i mean the band is really really good so hopefully like we have good weather and um you know that's out of our control so yeah i think it's gonna be good okay so i mean like with just i think that it's right at 1700 and i know our goal is to be under two well at first the towels were out of stock and i didn't know how long they would take to get done we can sell them beforehand but then we have nothing new to sell i mean we'd have to come up with something new to sell and because every single thing we sell comes out of our budget and we don't get it back even like without the markup like we're emptying our budget buying this stuff and as long as we have money in there i say use it but like if we just keep like you know if we buy a thousand dollars worth of towels and then we don't have money to pay for the parade that's why i'm concerned about buying all this stuff and not having the budget for the other things that we're doing so that's why we were also holding it because i think they'll go fast and we can literally spend you know what i mean yeah but i mean i'm open to discussion on it like whatever you guys think like well i've talked to kyle a little bit about it and he kind of talked about doing a separate line item or like we could maybe look at it a different way if like we literally are depleting our entire budget on things that are being sold the money's coming back but it's not coming back to our budget and then we don't have money for these other things that we're going to do but can we just get approval from the city well if we stick it i can ask let him stick a like a merchandise budget item i would remember how much we spent the t-shirt orders were like what and then the so we that's 700 and then how much of the towels like 15 times we got 27 towels times 15. if anybody could do math and they're me either so that's 400 so maybe just maybe i can ask them for like an even thousand just to dedicate towards merchandise yeah that sells back and then that that way you're not eating into the other event yeah because other than the 300 for the koozies that we want to give away as thank you for coming kind of thing like you know all of this yeah well that's your event that's our event exactly that should come out of our budget and whatever but the stuff where the money comes back um especially if the towels go or whatever it kind of like it would be like the hats we're just kind of helping with it right and the hats came from a different place is that mauston's what do you mean a difference no that the hat the city merchandise that before you came along and started merchandising it came it wasn't like the same it was a different budget okay it was i think it was probably under the same general but i don't know i'll just see i'm just asking but i mean yeah if you're just gonna continue selling stuff you might as well what'd you do it's there to keep replenishing yeah especially if people are buying them so it doesn't sell anymore i guess you know yeah and hopefully like we'll get people here that haven't seen what we have and like they fit into the sizes that we have in stock and then the requests that we're getting for like i think because the women's t-shirts are very like cut like i don't know what they i mean they're yes they're very fitted and so even like a large you know is like doesn't look large they need to be like a normal t-shirt or like something that you can kind of wear free flowy over your bathing suit or something so we'll adjust the um the sizes and i think we're going to look for a new vendor because honestly when i said women's t-shirts i didn't like they make women's t-shirts that are cut not that's more of a fitted t-shirt but they do make t-shirts that are cut for women but are more like boxy like like the men's t-shirts so um we'll have to see what the new vendor has i mean there's a million t-shirt vendors around here we just need to find somebody that will work with us that's a decent price maybe we can find even better pricing than they're giving us yeah so we'll do the relaxed yeah there's two ways to go like with that just have someone do the whole job or we select we buy the shirts offline that are like a buck a piece and then bring them to someone to print them that seems like it would be more fiscally sound if the t-shirts are decent quality yeah oh yeah you can just order like the gildan like what is in there they're like a buck a piece online yeah i'm just saying and then whoever is going to screen print them which i can't see them charging us any more than like seven that's like high we'll see and that's what they charge they like whatever the t-shirt is so we pay eight dollars for the t-shirts or whatever and nine dollars for the tank tops because they probably pay a little bit more for the tank tops so if if that's the if someone's gonna charge us eight or nine dollars a t-shirt to like it's not embroidery yeah it's silk screen yeah so i think it'll be less because the embroidery for the towels is six or seven dollars so they you know but the whole thing is they have to set up the expensive part of that is setting up the pattern or the yeah the file the file yeah so that's what they charge you for i can't see if they don't have much which is why we went to them because they had all the files set up already we could pick and choose like whatever we wanted because they already had all the logos done the um the tank tops don't sell the t-shirts are much more popular yeah right absolutely i don't know i mean the tape that's more expensive as well yeah well i've already bought three tank tops because i hate t-shirts but it's just that's me so like you know we can get rid of the tank tops if no one else likes them or it's just the way they're made i don't know just that's what i heard they're more popular the shirts yeah okay yeah we can just we can um hopefully sell the tank tops that we have left that day when we're out and more people see them and then i'll just we can order just t-shirts from now on and we can do more relaxed fit because they're saying even the extra largest don't fit they need to be bigger and then the mint for some reason the men menswear any color is not the popular one it's more gray gray and the green the lighter colors yeah how do you know okay so do you want me to like help with the pricing or is that a good thing okay sure to do like both ways i guess order the shirts and get them printed by someone or call places to ask what all-inclusive like printing would be okay that's great does anybody have anything else to add to the budget for this this is really the only one we need to talk about right now and honestly like we've spent eleven hundred dollars the jazz is going to be around two so like we're and then he's gonna order okay this is the other thing so he's gonna order before our budget ends in september like the vests and the numbers for october and then for the prizes i was thinking like we could get all the treat bags the candy the dog treats we can get all that out of this year's budget and then i was thinking and i would love some input on i was just in the amazon gift cards for the prizes like and so when he's ordering that we could order like it's like maybe i don't know whatever the prizes are 100 75 and 50 dogs kids we would have that each but i don't know like what do you guys think i think that's too much you do i think i think 15 uh no it's the exact same thing for the dogs and the kids and kids there's two separate yeah there's two separate kits yeah i mean we could do that and amazon for the kids or something yeah but you guys are okay with gift cards oh yeah okay so well then let's talk about amounts um but this is the other thing you may think that's too much i don't but like we can talk about it our budget if we don't spend it and i'm not trying to give it away i do too i mean you're going to spend you know how much people spend on costumes something you want to be careful with is like if you make it too much then you don't want to turn into like too much being too competitive well they were not going to know what it is before they get here it's just a first and a second too yeah and i want to keep it fun so they'll be surprised when they open it we're not going to advertise that it's that amount but i don't i mean i know what people spend on costumes and how much time they put into it i personally don't think that's too much but if we can maybe do i don't know i like the even amounts we could do maybe 75 50 and 25. are you better with that in the middle yeah i mean that's i still consider that fair because he can order those gift cards when he orders the vests and the numbers from amazon and then chewy i don't think is this popular and you can get anything on amazon that you can get on chewy so like you know and if you give them amazon and it's for their dog and they don't need anything for their dog they can use it for whatever they want so i would just think amazon would be better across the board and a lot of people have amazon accounts and not a lot of people have chewy accounts i just canceled my chewy account i don't know it just seems it was like i felt like i was double like i would price between amazon and chewy and yeah but else if you do a chewy account that makes the winner have to sign up for an account or you're gonna have to use your microphone because i can't i really can't hear you i don't know why she's very excited about it she is moving her mouth can't hear me yeah i did hear that so it's like the the i don't know like i don't consider like the penny no well no i was talking about the pet store that just opened a pet supermarket but i don't know if that's a chain if it's considered it's a chain if we're really supporting a local business like there is that little like in the strip mall by panera there's a little like dog place i don't know i would just amazon but that's just my vote if i don't care i mean i'm not going to lose sleep if they are almost on gift cards i think that's good and it's the easiest because you just re-gift it yeah and you order them and they get sent to kyle and kyle doesn't have to go get them and it's easy so 75 50 and 25 times two yeah so two 25 gift cards two fifty dollar gift cards and two seventy five dollar gift cards yeah and i already have doggie treat bags and i i bought like a pack of 50 so i'm just gonna donate those to the cause because i don't know what the hell i'll use them for otherwise and then for the kid treat bags you can get those on amazon i'll send you some pictures and then um you can also order candy like a big bulk bag of candy like and then we could just put the treat bags together so you can literally do the whole thing on amazon we could probably do the decorations on amazon too i'll just give you my shopping list that's the candy price on amazon pretty good yeah yeah and they sell kits party kits yes so we'll look into that and um we'll just give you like a shopping list of things to order and we'll make it nice and easy for you yeah email email yes all right anybody have anything else on this budget on this list okay so um item number five um other business i was just going to ask about the t-shirt table but it's been knocked off so i'm i'm done yes um the blood dries the next blood drive date was um emailed to patty i haven't gotten a confirmation yet but it's july 30th okay cool and it's same thing like nine to one or nine to three and it's been going really well i think i said that already yeah no it has and so i did send pictures so i sent pictures to patty from the beach clean up from the blood drive from the painting thing from her tara's yoga class she had like 10 or 12 people when i went not this past saturday but the saturday before so she's she had a sign made um that said you know tara's beach yoga with the times you know affiliated with bellar beach the city of bellar beach or something like that and she said that sign is like doubled the people that are coming because people would walk by and would just think it was her and some friends so once she put the sign in the sand um like then people like she had vacationers she has locals she has the beller beach residents that kind of live even across the street that are coming so um with red tide like i went on i i went like four classes in a row and then this past saturday i i literally got out of my car and got back in and shut the door and drove home because the smell and there is candle ditching yeah and she ended up canceling it too but so my point is she um it doesn't smell as bad back here by the bay side so she might have it behind the building here until because remember last time red tide lasted for a couple months so hopefully it doesn't last as long but she may move it back here well it's not it does feel like it's not like you just start coughing yeah it's like furry and then it for me it makes my nose run i sneeze like it's almost like like it doesn't mild cold yeah yeah no it smells like dead fish and then yeah [Music] does the algae smell like dead fish or is it because the sand is full of fish the algae gives you the aerosols the second i walk out i start to show for sure he just says days before yeah it's bad yeah we get when you walk out in the building sometimes just depending on how glowing do you wear your mask does it help i have cheers people are running right over the dead fish on the beach it will come to the intercultural too last time it did yeah it did it'll take a little bit but it will get there let's just keep those hurricanes coming small little hurricanes shortly 20th street i guess yep the marina oh the rain or two years ago oh it's coming that would be good um does anybody else have any other business i did just get a price for what we talked about adding the launch steps on existing fishing docks oh yeah so a guy really pretty much gives good pricing on anything that's dock related he says about uh 3400 that's not bad um and that's like a two by five foot by twelve all right sorry a two a two four two point five two and a half feet by twelve step that includes putting in two support poles which is the way to go because that one that one that was on 16th that broke free it was only hooked from underneath the main dock and eventually it just worked off because it didn't have its own support pole so what's the next episode um well i guess i was just trying to get a budgetary number for you it really depends on what you guys think does that fill me in a little bit is that appropriate for just that one side well it would um the two i mainly was looking at is the second street that you brought up and then the one that lost the one it had which was sixteen yeah sixteen residents i don't think maybe if you remember but i wasn't here long enough never had one i don't know the 20th ever have one of those a large like a step down for a coyote okay so that one still has and it's on the very front so the very front okay so it's like a shorter one yes because it's longer rather than yeah do you know 25th still has one i don't know down there but i'm just trying to think of you know if it works for them it'd be nice to have places where people could do their kayaks put in high school don't know how to put the kayak in at the 20th street history um you'll be able to come up to that step down like as far as putting the kayak true it has a step down that you can paddle up to actually drink it tie it up for a while but not overnight but it's really not the best thing because you could bring a kayak up there and step onto the kayak and all that but as far as putting the kayak in the water from the land side you have to lift it over the rail i mean that one's funny because you're saying it's on the front into the doctor yeah it's kind of if if i was like at second street and there was one built off the side of it kind of like there was at 7th street um at least you could push the kayak off of the seawall maybe you have like a rope tied to it yeah i'm gonna pull it up alongside your input in the city i mean people just acknowledge this with the sea wall i mean it's just difficult people launched their kayak with the seawall but it's not ideal because you're it's dangerous yeah yeah but getting in the water i guess you're just going to get it off the sea wall into the water and then you're going to have to maybe without changing the whole design of the dock you know yeah there was nothing that could lift off you know something like that could be being operated like the 16th street one it had the flip but it was on the it was on the long side which would be the north side of the dock about 12 feet long and it ran that that side of the dock the north side of it and in the middle it had on the rail it flipped up so that you get access to the step so people who've launched 16 20th street right it's just on the end of it which makes it difficult to get your boat around to it i guess you could just wheel it down the dock and put that open just put it in i don't know so yeah so that's basically the number um so when you say um okay so she said next steps like we've had yeah you walk straight down the dock yes so anyone know you say next steps like where do we find the money to pay for this well i guess if you guys want to make a recommendation that please try to put at least i mean you want to start with i think it's 16th street where there was one because once they lost it we started hearing about it and i think it's probably fair to start where they had an existing existing launch step you know rather than anyone that never was there got it that's just how i feel good that's a little harder so then you're asking to actually i mean we're seeing like ten thousand dollars yeah it's just if you're gonna try and do it all at once then you're probably gonna have to have a project a kind of a project that needs to get approved now if you're recommending that we replace and possibly look into adding them as we go that's just a little easier i'm thinking but you've been we just started this year we put in uh budgeting for doc replacement because 7th street failed so that one is going to be the first to get demolished and rebuilt but 7th street it was in a lot worse condition than the rest of the docks are currently in um yeah so yeah but that's budgeted it's getting improved this next budget here and that's it started um start to budget out replacement costs for all the docks as they fail or as they start to deteriorate um so yeah after so seven streets can have one built into the design because it's going to be the same footprint of what it was um and that one again had the had the extra tide holes that the stuff was built on that one just ended up completely getting eaten away underneath and then the step itself so it broke um we're working on getting it demolished but it won't it won't get funded to get rebuilt until the next budget so that's going to be out of condition for a while yes it's more of it's more of keeping people off and not hurting themselves but the replacement of that facility is not did come through this committee no so there should be well so the replacement is going to get if if the budget's approved there's going to be a capital plan project plan to replace the docks on a scheduled out time period um but to add now as they get replaced we obviously can and add in these launches as they go but to get them at it before the doc is ready for a replacement that's that's different it could be used depending on how business the doc fails yeah unless we if you want me to talk about i could talk to lynn about options i think if you if you get to the end of the budget and there's money available like say 16th street that would technically is a repair if it can be done because of money they weren't budgeted so yeah the doc did not fail so it wasn't in the budget yeah so you're looking at i don't get that it's something that's not like i understand it's not in the budget you know one of these if you were going to get it replaced immediately it would have to be voted on by council to amend the budget to replace it immediately immediately so otherwise saving that's um you could come to the next meeting and bring it up to the council if not it's just i don't know if they'll consider it sometimes it needs to be an emergency replacement who oversees them right it's not us where is it what are you about overseas like if somebody calls into city hall and says hey this dot is you know buckled underneath me who's the tip who's who does that funny call get journey to where does that land oh yeah ultimately ultimately yeah but lynn only allocates the budget that's approved right okay so if it's not budgeted yeah it doesn't get done yeah he can't just go it's kind of like checks and balances he can't just spend money yeah unless it's already done you're trying to find out the process by which you get that fixed is it just a property owner that calls up say listen there's a problem with this talk it's dangerous it's a liability can we get it fixed on an emergency basis or do we have to go through the boxing record no you couldn't just have a person call and say it needs to be fixed it would have to be in this situation for that money you know the person could recognize could ask counsel or to bring it up to council you need council vote to do it okay but we don't have it as a committee i don't have any say it seems like it seems like it's what one of our parks what is next budget september so they're meeting on it the first workshop is monday so when does the next budget start yeah october 1st can you make sure we get the same budget next year as we got this year please that's it for the same amount yes okay so okay my fear is they're gonna say well we haven't because you know we haven't had any events um i i've literally seen posted on you know next door something we have a park and record well i mean because it's even though we're starting to do things like it may be trickling out slowly but because we don't have any way to like big picture advertise i just don't want them to be like oh well they don't need a budget because they're not doing anything so i kind of feel like we need um i don't okay which leads me to number six because like we have to give our i have to give our quarterly board report at the july city council meeting so we can say you know we're working with staff for you know we can give the dates for the three events you know now that covid you know everything's kind of opened up and you know we are you know putting things together for the residents and just kind of go from there so like they'll have it in their ear that we are doing things because even leslie matero an hour ago said well we don't have any or we don't have any events because people don't know so i don't want them to think that we don't need a budget because we're not doing anything does that make sense right so that's kind of why i said like what was teasing you about putting in like a good word for us but like i guess like um they're meeting monday but it won't be the only meeting it won't be it's the first one it'll be the first one so it's like so i guess if it if it's brought up in that monday workshop that someone has the opinion of what you're talking about then i guess at the next workshop you guys could show up and defend your position okay or we could say something at the meeting if you're saying your quarterly thing and then be like we already have these events scheduled and for next year's budget we would like money allocated for clothing we would still like our existing budget because we will expand i mean well obviously i'll be there to support and back you up looking at the recreation side of them because the parks are physically things and docks are part of that i would think we should put that in the budget also so we've been discussing modifications to the docks so our people that live in the beach can then utilize the bus and we have this that is fishing kayaks or whatever we'd like to review what our needs are so we can make recommendations to the city council and even with this year's budget i mean all said and done even with the three events like i know we will lose it because we're not using it but we would have two thousand dollars left to put towards the one of the thirty four hundred dollar docs like can we can we donate that money and move it over we can donate it we can make it complete to the city council that would like to use that for a property recreation park that needs to rehab well it's already an approved budget if we didn't spend 1100 on t-shirts that you're getting the money back for we would have money to buy one of those stocks like one of the launches because we spent eleven hundred dollars on stuff that money is coming back into the city so technically like we would have enough to pay one for one launch out of this year's budget the council won't approve a step down until the dots have been looked at right well it's like what it sounded like if second street is in good shape like the and the guy who's building the step down would say this stock is fine for it or you'd be like no no this is daca's dangerous i mean he wouldn't the dogs are in good condition it was just the water that one that broke okay that was not a good thing i just know that it was like a first this than this so if we wait for them to fail to add these launches it could be years ago yeah so but i can ask i could ask lynn what he thinks the best way to move forward because yeah um because again with the whole money left over type thing sometimes you know like it was 16th street i'm saying if we start if we start there and the money is available like there's enough money in the budget we might be able to get that one done because that technically is repair you know and then and then i can i'll find out what's the best way to go about i can do adding something a lot to this thing okay that sounds good just let us know when it's 23 or 25th street you already have step downs and some minor investments might be needed for canoe launch associated with it so you're i mean maybe as a group you guys officially recommend that we start seeing looking into the option of of adding these steps to develop and then i can talk to him about how we can do that okay so um we can add that to the july presentation along with the events that we have coming up towards the end of the year yes or no well let me talk about the first okay at this meeting and you guys can take you can make that recommendation no i think it's oh because of the holiday i think it is because you're officially you're close together we're officially closed on yeah monday the 5th so it would be the 12th yeah i mean that's a good point like for allocation of budget because like it seems like our budget is really like used for like recreational things like events and stuff but then like if we're considered park and rec like where does our recommendations or opinions like or anything that we want to like get fixed like how do we work into that because i know that's like a bigger thing like we're talking thousands of dollars where we can do like six events for next year and it'd only be like you know a few grand it is probably a thing because like everyone is making like observations of like this is what should be added to a park and this is what should be added to this but and i know you and lynn like all handle that because it's big money and like the council has to vote but if we're also considered park and rec then just figuring out like the lines here because we talk about these things but then we also talk about like events which we have more control over because that's our budget it's like you know a couple thousand but then when you get to these bigger scale projects like if we're considered park and rack how does that yeah like repeating the tennis court is that parks department exactly but we would use that for an event right no but it's yeah that's what it is but if we wanted to use the tennis you know if there's a problem the tennis court is getting fixed but we want to use it for an event like lessons or i don't know something we had some kind of thing you know i'm saying that's all tying it together because we're using the the city's property and like what we're given to use so i don't know i'm just saying it's a bigger thing the way the events budget item got created was that there was no there was no money allocated towards special events and then the parks were important at the time asked um if moving forward they could be put in the budget and the council approved it specifically it's not like under the parks and recreation boards budget it's under the general budget um but that's what the point was for so repairs in parks we we have in public works uh a line item for park repairs how that gets spent is mainly up to lynn but since you guys are at an advisory board you can advise that that this gets repaired i think that's where this this upgrade gets done you know because it repairs and upgrades yeah we don't want a budget for it we just want to recognize okay that makes sense oh yeah i do want to be able to recommend it so so yeah you need to vote and recommend and then we'll try and find out the best way to go about getting what you guys want okay and like these launch steps for the kayaks are like pretty much what we've been talking about since and then the last couple months and so it would be our recommendation like so do we have to recommend to the council or do we have to recommend to lynn so you're basically in this meeting to recommend that those and i'll take it to live because in this meeting okay yeah i mean because at 3 400 it's not like a catholic project it's great for the parks yeah okay perfect i don't imagine some of those upgrades are going to be 3 400 no some could be 100 000. yeah much less yeah much less but i think we just want to recommend some of our doc facilities have yeah i know i think i should go and find out kind of how we can see how it could be done and we have been recommending it for the last two months which is why he's getting pricing on it so he knows that we just that's why when she said next steps it's like you know we've talked we've had you've had people talk to you i've had people i mean pretty much everybody if they live on one of the streets that have a dock and they have a kayak and they have nowhere to put their kayak in the water you know they're asking for it so i guess you're we're just officially yeah recommending yeah yes if we could um kind of put these in order of priority and maybe start making some progress on them that would be great yeah i think this community now knows better what their charge is not just for recreation but it's record it's a park right because if we have kayak launches at three or four or five different times that people can recreate by going out of the planet yeah and like when we first started and we did the surveys of all the parks we kind of divvied them up and like you know this originally came up at that time and you know like and they started working on like some of the repairs and some of the you know like where if the paint was chipped i mean it's not like anything that's like small repairs or small upgrades you know we're gonna try and get it done yeah so like we we kind of started that way and then um we're just gonna just kind of come back around and like now start making some more um upscale suggestions i think it's great to be able to advertise that you have x number of talks at bellaire beach for all our neighbors to use and then we have now a way of using these stocks for kayaking to go talk to dot and visit neighbors it has a new level of recreation right for sure so okay perfect does anybody have anything else for um other business no okay and then number six um we kind of touched on it but like the um the next quarterly um board report is july 12th so if you can attend that would be great like you can um help contribute to the presentation if you'd like we can divvy it out or if you you know just if um like say i have like the six bullet points i want to make and there's feedback from the council or from you know citizens like and you guys want to chime in it doesn't have to be just me if you don't want to you don't have to but i i more than welcome that and then this was the other thing i wanted to ask so because of the holiday the meeting's july 12th and we normally have our meetings the third week which would be july 14th do you want me to push it back a week so we don't have two meetings in the same week that was my only thing about that because like i think when because she wanted to know ahead of time and so when i put um the 16th i didn't realize that the council meeting was going to be the 12th so our meeting would be the 21st not the 14th no no i'm asking i can keep it the 14th or it could be the 21st does anybody have any feedback comfortable with either one so just keep it the 14th okay then we'll just keep at the 14th then and then should we chat about everything yeah yeah are we going to request to go early in the meeting for monday she usually um puts us early okay just checking so nicole and i came with our neighbor because she was asking for an easement and you know she because of the nature of the meeting she didn't want to ask to be put on earlier and she was number 14 and we sat there for four hours and the mayor was like no i'm not doing this right now and then we left and so we sat there for four hours for nothing for no decision sorry it's all good okay um so we can ask if we could be early in the meeting but i don't so i don't know can we make just for the um for the minutes to like enough do you guys want to do like an official motion second okay so the motion being made is to have our next park and rec meeting on wednesday july 14th at 3 p.m no oh no she's talking about the sorry the launch oh jesus [Music] that we officially recommend um that we start looking at 2nd street um 16th street and 20th street for kayak boat launches 25th oh sorry 25th 2nd 16th well 20th has something we just need to look at it needs to be repaired or adjusted yes modified that's okay modified there you go yeah man 16 25th recommendation for set down kayak launch and the 20th to be repaired or modified for kayak punches all right all in favor second second yes all of us i'd like to officially table them we're not tabling anything we're we are officially a journey this meeting oh my gosh you're here i i second the kelly's gotta adjournment okay"
