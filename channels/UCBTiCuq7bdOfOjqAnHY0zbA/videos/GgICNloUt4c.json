everyone it's 6 pm on June 17th this is a special city council meeting uh let's bring it to order and now let's say the Pledge of Allegiance Al to FL FL United States of America indivisible Renee would you please call the role council member Frank Banker pres council member Lloyd Roberts here council member Kim Shaw Elliot pres mayor Dave gtis here city manager Kyle reefer here all right thank you Renee we have one item or actually two the first is for approval of the agenda do I have a motion to approve moved made by Kim Shaw Elliot do I have a second second by Frank Banker to all in favor I any opposed all right the agenda is approved now we're on item two this is for consideration of increasing quantities of b2301 Street and drainage improvements from Ninth Street to Morgan drive to maintain a consistent flow line in Valley curb on certain nearly level streets and replace curb on 22nd Street um Kyle you have the floor thank you mayor um so I this item agend this item on the agenda is to cover the current stor water project that um we are we started at Morgan drive and we moved from 25th uh 23rd um and then now we're down here working on Cedar Spruce and palm but this this item will discuss um specifically Street 23rd Street where well we're seeing uh you know the curb is not it's atypical it's not your your standard Valley curb and um there's some factors involved on that street that uh our engineer Larry fluty is going to explain um and you know what his recommendation is for that street um so the reason that it says uh to discuss increasing qualities a lot of these items are already on the bid um it's a matter of um increasing the quantity to achieve uh the level of um the flow line that we want to see in the curve as well as um the like the typical V shape and the fall for the for the water to drain um it also discusses 22nd Street 22nd Street was the curb on that street was left out of the original bid um but the curb is in in rough shape and after going out there and looking at it I asked uh Larry fluty to give us a cost estimate of what what cost will we would incur to replace that curb it's a little different because the street was already resurfaced in 2022 so it's it's going to um involve somewhat of a change order because the the valley Curve will need to be carefully cut and removed and reported back in the place so I'm going to pass it to uh City contract engineer fluty and he's going to give us a presentation of where we're at thus far in the project hello Mr fluty good evening good Eventing Larry Gemini engineering uh I'll begin of where we are at we're U contractors made it uh from uh 23rd 24th up in the north and of the project and he's working working South there and then of course jumping down to uh Cedar and the streets along here Mr flee can I uh talk to you into pulling the microphone a little closer to your okay there we go how's that sorry now I can hear me the anyway the the work uh for the project is uh taking out the existing curb and Milling the existing pavement uh one inch the existing one inch and then replacing it with an inch and a half of asphalt and replacing the curb and the curb that the direction that that we have given the contractor is the curb is to be constructed with continuous fall so that when the uh when it's laid and and and done it'll have a continuous flow no cing or any any low spots and things like that the uh transitions into the driveways you know will be smooth and uh and then at the ends uh at golf and Bayshore they have to you know make sure that we meet and match the existing pavement the difficulties that sometimes we have with that need of meeting the existing Road at Gulf and down at Bayshore and the road being so flat the difficulty is getting enough drop to uh lay in the curve and lay in the asphalt I think up on the screen let me get to the next as you can see here uh some of the uh issues that we have stly on the photo on the on the right hand side that's uh 23rd down at the at 23rd and Gulf where the existing uh walk rant meets meets the road so it's it's an area that's ponding in itself uh and that's what we're having to tie into uh another issue coming up is on 19th that's the photo on the left and replacing the existing ridden curb and trying to get in a curbing gutter in on that so that's that's going to take something you can also see that the existing uh driveways are at the gutter Gutter elevation so we're going to have to uh really uh consider what we can do then to to make this project work I'll go ahead and move on to 22nd 22nd Street uh with saw cutting uh the uh the curb and leaving leaving the line the pavement was just put on there and uh we'll do that and this this represents the limits of the work and uh and so with that uh we we created our quantities for that and uh based upon our estimate for for the work on 22nd uh we estimated that that you know with the the cutting the saw cutting the valley curb replacement of restoration of some of the concrete areas restoration of driveways and and then any work as far as any sprinkler or or utilities we estimate that project to be 2505 93 any questions so far on that any questions Council yeah on the um I do sure on the um 19th Street where you said there's currently the ribbon guts in there um I really feel like and I'm sure everybody would agree our real objective there is just to make sure whatever we have there is in fact moving the water to where we want it to be moved yeah to get into a drainage system so I live in 20 so I drive by there all the time I know we had a pretty decent rain last night so I went by there this morning and there's there's zero standing water on those quote Riven gutters okay so to me from my perspective I don't care if they're a valley gutter or vertical gutter or a ribbon gutter the water is moving to a drain somewhere which is really our ultimate goal right so I don't know if we necessarily and you're I defer to you have to force um you know Miami gutter Valley gutter on that street if in fact what would be the benefit of trying to transition from that ribbon gutter to a valley gutter as long as the water currently is moving the way it's supposed well that's the big plus right there the water is moving and then it's it's getting off there so that's that great so makes it a little bit easier you know if we had puddling right or lower areas it' be a little bit more difficult uh my initial thoughts of of that area is you know where we have that flat ribbon curve if we put in a uh a v like a one inch deep V it look like the ribbon curve the the Edge edges would match the existing elevation correct so the the say it's a 1 inch deep V with water already flowing that should get it who should get it to the inlet so that's that's kind of what I'm looking at okay so you're increasing the volume yes now helps direct the flow down there yeah and it increase the volume more volume the faster it come come off the curb and just a point of information again I mentioned that I'm on 20th Street and for whatever reason the water flows two directions and it flows well so from the most um if you look at the midpoint of the road um with respect to east to west the right at the midpoint for the most part the water flows the um eastern part of the road the water flows towards the inter Coastal from the middle of the road towards G Boulevard it flows to G Boulevard it's going in the County's drain which is fine yeah but it moves it goes I just want to make sure that the contractor understands that because I'd hate for them to attempt to make it all flow One Direction which could be more of a challenge as long as right now the water's flowing basically from the center position of that road in two different directions and it works fine that's on 20th and it's about halfway right I can always tell by the U irrigation systems in the morning so like my neighbor who lives pretty much in the middle when his irrigation system runs all the water runs towards go Boulevard okay the next house over when their irrigation system runs it runs towards Fay the intercal okay and again it flows good so it's working okay Marcus start with the contractor and and make sure that we thanks we put in something that continues that yeah so in this case in the uh about halfway down the street yeah it would flow downhill both okay now I can't remember the survey picked that up it may have and uh so yeah certainly those you know we'll make sure it flows the way the gravity wants it to go right okay so on the one more on the 22nd Street um I had a little bit of a conversation with Kyle today so the median area in the middle so what was what was the cost to put in new curving just around that area let's see 38 38,000 somewhere that that's the vertical curve okay that's going to be vertical there correct in the median right so what um it was your money what what do you think what's the value in changing that out what we have there is certainly not going to affect anything with regards to drainage it's just more Aesthetics than anything depends on the condition of the vertical curve you know once you start you know milling and Ming looking if it's really got a lot of fractures and cracks in it then I'll replace it if it looks good and solid then that's we may need to make a decision whether or not to place it or just leave it there okay any other questions yes just so I understand what the options are am I correct in understanding that we have about a $250,000 increase to move the just laid curbs and replace them with v curvs and are you saying that an alternative is toally cut out a portion of that curve to make it more like a V is that understanding correct for 22nd Street it's uh since the Pavements there and it's fairly new and recent the goal is to uh how do you separate the the older curb the the curbing GL and the vertical curve which is in the median and a clean way of separating that and getting that out is the saw cut between the curb and the pavement and then that allows that curve to be removed and then new curve placed and formed and placed so that's that's what we're proposing on on 22nd and 22nd Street is not new no none of the curving is new in on this area this is this was overlooked um it wasn't budgeted for whenever that street was paved but 23rd Street is there cor right and and that and that wasn't done by machine that was done by uh form forms right yeah so question at hand is when they laid those forms and graded it out leveled it out who's at fault us or the contractor because if it was done by if it I mean the machines they have today delay Valley curve they're going to they're going to correct themselves because it's all GPS but when you're doing it by stick stick in uh mortar um you're using a crude three foot six foot level um which ends up with results that we're having so my only look I want this done right and and I have neighbors that had this done years ago and they had problems and they still have water laying in the street as of yesterday last night um so I just want it done right but I think there's other people should get some reconsideration to in this when you I'm sorry when you said there's water in the street in the street or Valley Cur in the valley curb they get it they get it just during regular sprinkers you know and it lays in a particular house and and Lynn said he was going to correct it but after they got brought this up at the last council meeting I was looking at this and he's always complaining because you get mosquitoes and everything right yeah a comment about that if I may um I had the same question in terms of the fact that we know it's flat here and so what about the new curbs that have been done and if they did not properly account for uh the need for the slope whose accountability is that and I asked I asked our City attorney to take a look at that question well I would say it goes back onto the contractor if he's not it goes back to the engineer no folding yours but they're not following the plan I mean you have to lift it and get the drainage like we're talking about now with extra asphalt that but why would you my my whole question is why would you lay something out it's not G right yeah read Kyle uh whenever some of these streets were done was it pretty much a rip out the damaged ra uh problem areas that were aesthetically ugly and uh they they were having problems with water flowing because there were cracks all in them but whenever they put them back did they put them back to the same way that they were originally designed is that how some of these these uh these areas continue to have problems well um with the existing um just an every storm rer project we've done um yeah it's got sunken curb it's got broken curb um but when they remove that curb the idea is to you got your high point you get your low point and to make it uh as consistent as possible throughout now a lot of our streets the streets themselves um vary where they go um down flatten out sometimes even go up each side of the crown is different um but as you can see with every Valley curve we've installed with different contractors and resurface streets there's no perfect situation where where every curb just flowed perfectly um there's a lot of elements that open Larry could cover these and kind of show and the contractor too can speak to it that when they're out there there's a lot of adjustments that need to be made um and and they're forming up these entire streets um measuring it out with string line I know they have the curve machines now I but I don't know with all the variables if this curb curb machine could do a better job you know when they did roll that in Bell is and everything like that and they were doing it all by hand and I'm thinking like my God and it takes so damn long I mean you can wa lot of footage in one day with Val curb machine I call Miami curb machine I don't know why they didn't do it they probably just didn't have an access to it but yeah to date no contractor has used curb machine that's bit on our projects other questions this particular um sheet that shows the profile view of 23rd Street is that the finished profile view or was this the profile view that was given to the contractor as to how you wanted it laid this is this is the existing profile view and and we're Project's not changing the cerine profile of that and and I bring what I wanted to show you I mean some of the challenges that the contractors and us have had on the project is that it's so flat and particularly on 23rd the uh some of the numbers here on that on that on that profile you'll see on the up end of Gulf Boulevard the elevation around ground elevations around 5.8 one at bore it's 4.58 right that gives us a 0.22 foot per foot slope that's about 268 in a foot is two 2.6 in every 100 feet it's very flat right so that's it's a difficult project just because of that and where was this taken like at the crown of the road the middle of the road that is along the crown of the road okay so the these are our challenges the when we say I we've lift up one end to make sure we have a a bigger slope we can only uh left that so far because we're constrained by Gul Boulevard and bore and so with with those as our beginning beginning and ending point really puts us at a constraint of how much slope we can put in to that how was it draining before Kyle you recall were there ever any issues on that particular Road rain events we have um video footage before um shot of those curbs um you can see stains on on the concrete where water is sat um it was a dry day when they videoed it I don't recall specifically that street okay where I could speak waren also some uh draining drainage issues where the check valve and you know and the pipe itself didn't we have some issues back then we've had some backup on Bayshore um that this eventually flows too um but as far as you know what I don't have the actual profile except for the existing survey and the video um to really be able to look at what it was Prior so the the 23rd Street issue that we have today so the estimate is approximately $63,000 to do what needs to be done and if that's done you're fairly confident that the water's going to go where we want it to go yes okay how thick is the valley curb bottom again roughly six inches any way you can reduce that to like dig it down to about so it runs so instead of having six inches at the end you're only around four which is going to give you a better better runoff but you're digging down the things to be careful about you know say we can get a deeper V with using this thing yeah we're still limited to that goes into an like that elevation that's what I'm saying and and that so we still got that constraint so item number three there is really the biggest cost $35,000 and that's for the the driveway payer restoration how many how many driveways is that for I that just seems like a lot a whole lot I well I didn't bring my account on the number driveways let me see so there m it's half papers half concrete when I was doing the numbers okay I'm looking at an aerial and we do that we're we're just I'm assuming we're we're removing the existing pavers and then putting them back yeah let's see might count here I got one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 about 10 b Paper driveways on that stream some of them are around but it looks like as far as um about half about five of of 10 so about half the other five are concrete yeah it's it's almost half and half on 23rd but that's effectively all labor right we're not we're not buying any additional materials to do that unless the works are broken paper reset okay so if if we break it or if they were already break broken we're talking about the the papers that are in the driveway of the homeowners but they're already broken and they crumble when they take them out then they'll have to give a new Buy yeah okay they break a lot and and matching them I think would be a challenge right now the the cost that we have in for the pavers it's for new pavers so if we use the existing we end up using a lot of the existing uhuh then we save some money on that okay so would you be comfortable saying that that $63,000 is a conservative estimate yeah any other questions right now no thank you Mr fluty I'm going to uh take comments from the citizens and uh and then whenever we uh if if a motion is made and we get into to debate we'll call you back up all right okay so you like me yeah just have a seat it'll be fine would any citizens like to comment yes sir uh anyone except for unless you live on 22nd you're not allowed to come up no I'm just kidding okay come on up sir and please step to the podium and give us your name and address okay this one that's fine as long as I can as long as he has a mic Mr Mayor ladies and gentlemen of the council my name is nikolelis I'm the corner property Southeast Corner G in 23rd Street right now on the screen uh you see what what uh we had before the v-shaped curve and the water was flowing uh Kyle roll the mouse you might as well just stay stay over this is the existing one no V shaped curve uh the from the beginning of the driveway towards go it's a negative pitch one and a half inch water stays there by by uh the walkway this is the last night rain some people are trying to jump and they land in the water that's the uh Southeast corner of G and 23 that's what we had we water flowing down all the way the C was broken in many places and it was uh um um um was the dirt so it it's an old curve uh this is the difference uh right there where the Cur the new work starts on Golf and 23 going down towards B so this is the beginning the negative pitch that's what you see the difference here it is the new curve and the existing one G 23 this is the the end um B Shore and 23 the first 12 ft of the curb has approximately 2 and a half inch of pitch 12 feet this is not a Q&A Mr bank it's not a Q&A know here shim there you go from here so the engineer said approximately on every 100 fet we have 2 and a half inch of pitch to use but here on 12 ft only they use 2 and A2 inch as the beginning B sure and 23 uh this is how much higher uh the the outside edge of the curve is towards the the the um the asphalt it's about 2 and a half inch from what it was and it's consistent the bottom of the street to the top of the street that's the bottom 2 and a half inch that's the top of the street by me so obviously it was by Design so this is in red you see the existing the um C that was taken out and in black on top you see the existing one so you see that the v-shaped curve is gone it's replaced with a flat one which is 2 and a half inch Higher by the street level the asphal and technically five and a half inch uh we lost of the the the curve the v-shaped curve right by the Middle where the water flows here is the the diagram that I brought you the last time the negative pitch uh no pitch in front of the driveway and after that the pitch starts so with all this work proposed it's going to do nothing unless the negative pitches is removed which means that we do the whole curve all all these thousands of dollars will do what nothing new that's what we hit last night thank you I appreciate it thank you Renee did you get the this uh gentleman's name and address okay thank you I'm sure that we'll be discussing this more later in the meeting yes sir are you presenting also yes I am okay but I'm gonna start with everything that Nick said okay and what is your name and address sir Pat Murphy uh I'm at 102 23rd Street can you guys hear me well my wife tells me I generally don't need one of these but um so I I wanted to question Mr fluty was that survey that you used was there a survey done sorry sir and did insist in comments you you don't inquire Our Guest you have to address the council my first question I guess is was there a survey done and if so when the reason I asked that question is because today there was a representative from pelis not sure how he got there but that was looking at the street as well um his conclusion was that there's plenty of pitch from the street he said it was six feet at G Boulevard and then four feet down at Bay and then three at the exit to the uh to the intercal now those round numbers do beg the question of a little bit of rounding there right but I it would be good to compare when the respective surveys were done the gentleman from pelis did not know the date of his uh but he felt pretty strongly that absolutely that the way this was put in is not going to work and it's probably never going to work and you need to redo it and build a pitch into it because you do have the El elevation differential to make it work the other conclusion he had was that apparently there was some work that took place toward go Bard actually uh that was that should be under the cognizance of pelis and they were concerned uh because he agreed with Nick's point on the pitch there that it's actually pushing water back out to go Boulevard which is a problem for them that they prefer not to have so uh again I think this goes back to survey a little bit to understand what we're looking at in reality there and then of course addressing the issue of having that flat Valley curve because it's it's completely negating the benefit of the the previous uh the previous curve that we had I've been there for four years and honestly I never saw any issues with any significant pooling of water I know it was a little bit stained to to to Kyle's Point um but in know it was very workable that we didn't have any large areas of standing water thank you Mr Murphy yes sir please come up give us your name and address John H 3 22nd um 22nd Street since we purchased that house back in 2015 those curvs in front of our property have been damaged forever and ever and ever okay and I know watching water flow it flows from Gul to Bas there's no Crown going both ways um the other issue is Will residents get notice prior to if this is approved the contractor beginning in work I have irrigation Lines within that 6 in behind the code and probably within six inches I have a fiber optic C and that gets cut I have no television I have no internet no computer I need to know where end so they cut it they're going to have to to fix it I just all I'm asking is the courtesy of heads up say that I can located F them before they start poing around with their equipment thank you Mr HK I appreciate your comments thank you would any other citizens like to comment okay before we go to the council uh for discussion I'm going to need a motion to move forward with this uh this proposal motion motion made by Frank Banker do I have a second second second by Mr Roberts all in favor I well that's not actually the way that goes sorry about that we did congratulations no no um let's go to debate um Mr Banker do you have the floor um hopefully I appreciate all the citizens comments hopefully before anybody does any digging they they call they have the lines located okay and they they come out with the snippers or loers in the market with the flags but my street yes they they didn't rip up anybody's fiber optic uh they did rip up a lot of water or sprinkler okay but they repaired them as they ripped them up so that's not an issue my biggest issue is you have pictures of the old curk which shows a great pitch in it so the design build plan did the design build plan have a valley curve in it or did it have a flat curve because if we screwed up then we should pay get it repaired but if the contractor put in the wrong curve he should dig it out well you know what I'm saying I will say it definitely looks different it looks higher well the whole radius isn't there I mean and that what I'm saying is I understand that you have minimal to work with but was a design build with the valley in there or was it not if it was flat we screwed up we we need to pay but well um before I go to other council members what's your uh what's your opinion on that particular Street on 23rd uh I've let Larry speak on that I mean the idea was that we have a valley in the curb um we knew going forward that it was going to be to spec um but I'd let him comment on surveys what time they're being done and okay what he designed Mr fluty would you like to come back up to the podium please sir would you like to address the uh concerns on 23rd yes the um the constraints that we had on trying to make sure that the flow line from Gulf makes it down to to Bayshore and so that brought up the flow line to get enough fall to do that it brought it up a little higher and and in that case uh see I think I got a photo no I can't I can't get to it but it it's the the inverted or the the flow way is is not there as it as it should be but I believe that and talking with the construction folks that it's because of bringing that up to get enough flow we kind of got got that wedge and to get flow in the curb that's when the idea thought up maybe bringing in a little extra uh asphalt to keep it within that curb then that will get it down because if it gets down I believe it's around maybe 50 feet down you get you got the curbing gutter which is that that inverted yeah am I looking at the corner of Bay Shore and 23rd in this in this photo yes go I think okay it's gold I me get to my I've got that I just got to learn how to get that on this computer oh you may need to assist oh I uh actually I want to look at the foot I put screen so okay ah there we go let's um let me get down to okay I want to find some photos of that right this is another view of that photo of 23rd in Gulf okay and so the curb was raised up to get better flow yes towards Bayshore correct and now you're you're thinking that because the asphalt is lower than the Curve it's trapping it pro I can if I can ask the contractor come up he can kind of explain the the details that the with the floow line coming around and the edge of the driveway and the and the asphalt kind of created instead of having a deeper V to keep that going that V got a little bit more shallow that right yeah okay all I could speak a little bit to this whole situation if you don't mind your name Sir Anthony har Contracting I'm the president and I have my uh Foreman Levi who's on site every day who's been working through this just a couple uh issues uh or just want to bring some concerns or things up to date for you guys um when we were given the project and bid the project the only constraint on the project is a note here that says curbing to be laid out to where no water does not puddle and to prevent ponding there's no great Stakes are not given to us no great elevations are given to us the only thing that's given to us is if the road has a high point in the middle or if the road goes at a consistent flow from one end to the other so in this situation on 23rd Street it flows from Golf Boulevard to Bayshore now you have two constraints you have the flowline constraint that has to stay completely the same because you're tying into two points on Golf Boulevard and sure and you have the front board which has to say pretty much the same because you're tying into the asphalt because the front board is what gives you the asphalt which has to tie to that the existing the curb that we took out was not that's not a valley that curb went flat and then up like that kind of like like a slight like this right what you're trying for us to do is to put in a valy that's it's not it's not possible what really is what you're kind of looking for is more like a road reconstruction project where you go back on all the aprons you take them all out you rechange the road profile and everything so what we're doing here is we're trying to match existing grades trying to get the flow lines to work so when we put the front board in and we put the flow line in and they're shaping it with the with the level to get the flow line to go as you get from Bayshore you'll have a deeper V and then as you get to golf the V will slowly disappear as you pointed out on the one Street that had like the header curve right the reason it's doing there's no water ping there is because they took the one point and the other point and they drew a straight line and it flows down the straight line and there's no valley in there so what we're proposing to do in these situations is to put the asfalt an inch and a like a half an inch lip in front of the curb to kind of give it like a like a pseudo V almost you know where it'll keep it in the curve sort of enhancing the exactly we're trying not to go back into the aprons because then you'll if you have to raise the backboard and raise the front board then you on some of the houses you'll have back flow because the houses sit don't sit at a higher elevation so you don't want us going back into the aprons and reconstructing everybody's aprons and everything so um I mean we're doing the best we can as to your note on a curb machine curb machines are only really used on new construction projects long parking lots because the curb machine has to sit at the same elevation as the new curb well the roads up here here and the new cing is down here so you can't use a curb machine it it's only used on like a we only use it on New Roads your picture there the first cone yes is where the the the um New where the Milling started to take off right yeah so from that cone right there the water we see right first cone we see is closest to us right it goes towards Bayshore okay so that water there's a straight line that goes from there to bore okay so that's where the Milling started to put the black top down right the first count yes that's where the well why is the curb reconstructed all way back to the first C the first C well the plans that we were given to bid actually shows if you go to the limits of the curb actually shows it to go into the penel county areas which we're not we we're not doing my here's my problem sir when you're doing it by hand yeah if you if you all set because you have such a low pitch to play if you offset that first cone just a little bit half an inch and I don't know why you would start there okay and then you came down you lost a lot of your drainage already yeah so what we did on this one we started at we always start at the low point so we start at the low point and we give it almost almost level barely the bubble on the on the level on a four foot level is almost not even touching the line on this side to get the water to go it's it's 0.23% from one and that's percent so it's like 0 Z Like Larry Larry said all the numbers yeah it's pointless to repeat them but so what so from that from the the cone that's closest to us coming towards us the water goes that way we had to tie into to penel County's existing ramp that was right there that's why there was a huge fault difference in that 12 feet is because we started at the low end and we came up with the level pretty much flat flat flat flat as you go as we're going up on the road the curve the V starts to this it's going bye by it's turning into a header curve like what he saw on that other road and it just it's goes bye-bye and we're two we're already two and a half inches above the road your asphalt quantity on that road is going to be three times what it should be okay so the next question on my thing is after you stick build it okay okay yep you had to do a level again where you poured the concrete didn't you we we used the level as we're pouring the concrete yes as we're pouring it yes what I'm saying is once you stick build it okay you had to have some kind of an idea this isn't going to drain I mean it's gonna it no one's going to pour concrete and say hopefully this works I mean no I in the construction all my life sir I understand and we don't do things that way yeah well it is going to drain it's not going to look like a profile of a valley curb with a valley gutter his header curb drains it drains it follow about his header curve I'm talking about 203 the the problem is the problem is the home owner is saying that it looks too much like the header curb so we are talking about the profile of the curb that that's the main issue here's no one likes the look of the curb seeing that there's no V in it no I don't think the the main issue is they're getting wood in their driveway and it's not draining right and you're getting every a bug and what St yeah that that whole Corner yeah that whole corner right there holds water will always hold water this project won't stop that from happening it's always going to hold water there's nowhere if you look at the grade shots here there's nowhere for that water to go on that intersection shouldn't be doing anything going but the pictures you showed us before and we we're not allowed to cross talk to you guys but I didn't see any water in the old pictures and I'm not there I I don't go down to the North End a lot but I I never saw after a heavy rainstorm 203 I never heard of any flooding down there we had the flooding problems okay yeah but I don't want in either but um the problem his existing curb was not it's not a valley curb nor it's not any curb there's no word there it's it's it's the existing Cur it doesn't follow any profile what we're trying to do is actually put a correct profile in a V try to mimic a valley gutter what we're trying to when you're marking out your plywood okay you're gonna say this is the level okay that we have to keep at to make it flow yes and but the issue is you didn't do that but the issue is is if we if we did that and we we which we do we plot it we know where the flow line is it's consistent to one and the other then our front board would be four or five inches above the existing asphalt okay so that's what I'm saying so then we should have said stop we can't do this job rather than do the job and say look what we did we did it wrong and that's that's what I'm not grasping in my head I I think I think what you're what you're saying is Well if it's not going to fix stopping the water then why do it at all thank you that's what you're saying yeah but I don't think everybody 100% agrees with that I think that um that there there is a sense of athetics that are involved also and uh you're you're going around you're you're coming right up there and then you just you you stop just H into whatever's there and that's it entrance of the street and call it a day do I think that there's more problems now well right now probably so uh but um possibly what what's your level of confidence on raising the asphalt level and how long realistically do you expect that to last rais the as like adding more thickness to the asphalt that that's that's done all the time I mean Indian Rocks is kneeling eight inches thick and putting eight inches thick of asphalt that that's not an it that's not an issue at all and so is that going it's a cost thing too you know we're trying to match the existing asphalt because we're only we're only one inch and putting back an inch and a half on 23rd we're going to use uh it's going to be 4 in thick in some in in some spots which is going to go overage on your asphalt numbers and and so what's your level of confidence that it's going to help the water is consistently running from one end to the other that's that's what we were that's what the notes and the pl say that's what the spec says that's what we're doing it's consistently running from what point to the other I shot we shot shots of our on 23rd I shot every 210 feet and we had almost exactly the same fall every 210 feet and then we get in front of at Golf Boulevard and we have to dive down and tie into the existing that's why there's such a in that 12 feet that's why there's two inches of fall because we have to match the existing at golf there's nothing we can do about it that's not it's it's a mute point I mean so you can't use that two and a half inches to tell you that can get fall from there to Bayshore that's not how it works so four and I can see on every other like this is just driving around look at it seems like other contractors might have had the same issue that I that we were having go you know it just there's literally no fall here nothing all Indian Rocks we're in North Readington it's all it's the same it's all it's all the same you know so and we're just trying to we're trying to get the profile to to match a valley gutter with the constraints that were given matching the existing asphall matching the driveway aprons and keeping a consistent flow line so okay all right does anyone else have questions yeah yeah I understand completely what you're saying I also just wanted to clarify something when um Mr Banker mentioned that a design build we did not use a design build right a design build is one firm yeah we use a design yeah bid build delivery method two different firms design build you have one firm they're responsible for the design not necessarily no not no not necessarily I have my general contractor's license Class A and I'm pretty sure I'm confident of that well I'm telling you right now not because they bring in they bring in Subs all the time and you know that subs subs are brought in by the general contract this is this is point we did not use a design build as the G did we use a design problem the problem is no this this is not designed B the problem is you had plans okay and before you do a construction project you should say this is going to work or it's not going to work he's showing me the old plan right there and it looks like they tried to do something and it didn't work I'm just trying to tell you we didn't use it as sign bail it doesn't matter $65,000 matters had we used this D Bill we wouldn't be having this hey one at a time go ahead all right Mr Banker do you have the floor what does it matter what it's called because it's costing this city $65,000 for something that didn't work that the contractors thought it would work it matters because had we used a design build there would be one firm and we wouldn't be sitting here having an engineer talking about whose fault is it the engineers or the contractors that's what matters whose fault is it I'm not say whose fault it is I'm just I just answered your question the Bott line is the taxpayers of the city are going to pick up the you know based upon everything that I've heard I think that it's somebody else's fault from years ago whoever designed the city the intersections the way that our streets entered into Gulf Boulevard I I mean it's it's not it's not relevant I mean go Bard could have raised their I'm sure they did over time when were put in different layers so Gul Boulevard got higher so now everything there's going to be a point there where we can't make it go that direction anymore we don't know that anyway we are where we where we are with this so what do we want to do the problem the bottom line is did they have water in the street before they did this job no thank you okay do you have water in the street now thank you okay so our plan for that contractor did not perform the job the way it was supposed to be done call it whatever you want I call it a job I don't know if that's in your engineering school or not but that's what happened I do in fact have an engineering Dee though I don't care what you have all right I don't care pastry sh it didn't work they're not finished point of order both of you we've got a problem we need to get it resolved that's what we're here for and getting in a pissing match over who's right and who's wrong is not the way to handle this so I agree that yep we have water now where we didn't before Mr reefer can you confirm that I can say that there was always water being held at the sidewalk in that part of the road we might have made it worse slightly um I try to come back and fix it there was this has only been poured once they did realize that there was a the flow was going in the wrong way from Mr Nicks driveway to the to the Gulf Boulevard plan is the plan to pave that street So the plan right now what we're discussing is that you know if we're going to add material to achieve more of of a flow line in the center are we going to do as is and accomplish water flowing towards Bayshore um by means of the contractor is recommending but either way there is a negative flow at the West End of 23rd that needs to be corrected and we've known about that since the first time we met out there um and that's something we can correct so it's not making that County depression any worse but until the county does something with their Road there's always going to be water at the very top G Boulevard and 23rd comments questions I think this someone could restate what the motion is that's on the table the motion is to approve this project plan and that but there's several pieces uh what what if someone could restate what the project plan actually is So currently we're discussing 23rd Street so we need to come up with what what we're going to do if we're going to keep the unorthodox curb as is correct the area that we have a negative flow towards Gulf Boulevard um but use the the uh half inch reveal as the contractor is discussing where we know that the water even though the curve looks not like a typical v-shaped curve the water is still flowing to the west to Bayshore um I mean to the east or uh What uh Mr Floy was recommending is that we could add material try to achieve more of a center flow line as opposed to it being up against the asphalt either way you know I don't see it improving very much I think that's the argument but what we do want is a consistent flow to go to Bay Shore and I believe yes you're correct there's the curb may have drained better in some areas but overall that curb was not in great shape there was a lot of cracking there was depression um and this is part of the project is the restoration of the curb and the resurfacing so to do so um we're going to have to have some kind of curve when the water flows and then we restore the payment right well we can't have a motion in the alternative so so saying to go with the contractor's proposal and not with the engineers's alternative I'd like to hear um Mr floody's recommendation for 23rd um and what it'll take okay as we're looking here I I just got a thought U at the corner there was three and the contractor mentioned that the at the intersection 20 food and uh Eng Gulf there's a storm waterer pipe underneath there there's two El on golf uh that connects and that pipe would go go underneath there there is a possibility I don't you just have to approach pelis County but maybe an inlet can be put in that area to capture water and that would really solve any water back flowing off on the gulf and help with the situation going down the Bayshore and that's the best thing that I've heard all night so what I would like to do is entertain a motion to amend uh this proposal where we either we either table it or we amend it and we we negotiate 23rd at a later date I make a motion to table this so we can see if we could put spot drains or another type of drain in there without ripping this all up I have a second could you explain that one more time yeah yeah let so what you could so if you look at that the picture there you can kind of see it uh around that corner there's an inlet um where that second uh com yeah around that corner there's an inlet on that side yeah right and then there's an inlet on the other side of of 23d what we could do is put a drainage Inlet on that corner slope um from at the Corner House and at the corner of Golf Boulevard slope both sides to the drainage Inlet and tie it in to the the uh City storm water system with like a doghouse manhole and just have a manhole lid in the middle of the you'd have a manhole lid and instead of it being an inlet but because you're in you're tying in a storm water system to an existing you need to have some sort of structure there so you'd have to set two structures you'd have to set the inlet structure right here at the corner and then you'd have to set another struct a dogghouse structure at the connection point between the between your system and the county system real quick what would that cost the dog house I I can't put a number on that I mean you got a you got a Well Point you got a Tren it it just just depends on how deep the pipe is how big the there's too many factors for me to put a number on anything really it's you think it be cheaper my opinion was the water was always there no matter what's being said right now no matter everyone it was always sitting there there was always water sitting there there will always be water sitting there it is not it's a County away it's it's an unfortunate situation that the homeowner's in it it got you know I wouldn't want my house I it would want the same thing so it's unfortunate but it's just it's the situation we're deing with at that corner and the only way to 100% remedy it was to put a drainage Inlet in there that'd be the only way but then you have to get with the county they have to go over the plans they have to design it too they right I mean you're talking maybe a year before we can actually get out there and put the drainage in l in and and do that work um but as far as the C the drainage project we're currently on it it was constructed to have positive flow from his right in front of the his house all the way to bashore which it which I confirmed at on our on-site meeting it does and unfort it's just an unfortunate situation at that at that it's always held right there's a dip right there you can see I mean it's that's just my opinion on it so yes sir so are we implying are we saying that some of our water on 23rd Street would be going into the county system is that why you mentioned we'd have to get with the county yeah because you're you're tying into the county system the storm waterer system there and they um we just did a storm water project in Indian Rocks Beach they no matter what you do with if even if you touch their system you have to get a RightWay permit their engineer has to look at it they have to look at layers design they have to off on it it it turns into this whole right yeah this whole thing you know which it' be nice if we could fix the issue by just curb and moving curb and stuff like that but it it just it's not possible at that corner it's just not g to happen so I'd recommend obviously if we if we have another solution I mean the water is going to move from what you referenced earlier it may not move at the rate exactly that that we would love it to do but as long as there's some gr I mean it's always going to go to the path of lease resistance exactly if the water's ponding for 48 hours 72 hours then yeah it could be more of a finishing issue right but if the water's is disappearing within 24 20 you know then it's it's it's moving it's going go any all Valley curbs hold water for a certain period of time what's the distance how many feet is it from his house 550 550 and it has a 023 fall that's that's in tenths or whatever thousands so it's there's nothing there's no fall so the again what the issue was is trying to get the valley to consistently go and then when you get to the end the Valley's almost gone inside the curb with us being two and a half inches above the asphalt already so yeah you I was just thinking if you put spot drains in there with a false pip yeah ideally you in the middle of the road you would put a in the valley curve if you put spot drains oh like a like a channel drain yeah but then yeah I mean you could do that but not too crazy about that I I don't yeah but no well I guess my motion to table would silence any more discussion under Roberts so it doesn't sound like it did I'll make a motion again to table 23rd yeah 23rd Street for now and move ahead with 22 I'll second that all in favor to table I I I okay it's tabled please come back to us with more information thank you I I appreciate the time that you've been here tonight and I I hope we can get this resolved quickly so we table the 23rd Street or the whole just a 23rd okay y okay uh now um this is the most convoluted uh motion a table because it's not really the wasn't really the right way to handle it but um would someone like to make a motion to approve 22nd Street approve make a motion to approve 22nd Street I have a second second Mr Banker do you have the floor uh plans are in front of us I believe you should go ahead all in favor I I'm sorry I just wanted to bring up one point if um just that vertical curve in the median um cutting it out and replacing it uh look back at the numbers here it's pretty significant and it's more of an aesthetic uh element of the of the project and we have a lot of trucks that are constantly driving over it so how cracked how cracked and broken is it um it's I've never looked at it where it was it was just an eyesore or danger or Hazard um there might be some chips we have chips in most culde saacs on the D curb um it just did not stand out to me as something that was necessary and you know it's a significant cost um as far as vertical got the vertical curb is $38,000 and then the saw cut removal the vertical quote curb is another 17 so you're 55,000 that's a big chunk of it um it's not really a functional aspect 17 the saw cut vertical curb where is that at that is a item five see the item tell me exactly what that is that's where you're taking out the cutting um would someone like to uh make a motion to amend this proposal to where we dro the median completely you mean the median curving yes okay because we don't need it uh it doesn't sound like we do I'll I'll make that motion a second right would you like to discuss as I understand it um the proposal for 22nd Street is presented because it was omitted from the initial bid and so we haven't provided for this at all right so the plan is to move forward with 22nd Street to incorporate that as part of our contract but deleting the median because we feel that that's no longer necessary and for that I I would favor that all in favor to amend the proposal where we remove the median curbing removal and replacement I make one more point that this is the um engineers estimates so we still would come to an agreement with the contractor a lot of these um quantities are they're in the bid the original bid um the careful saw cutting and forming of you know the valley curb inside of repaved surface might be something that he wants to discuss but um as long as we're on all on board with within the realm of the estimate we move forward I just want to point that out okay so the motion is to amend this proposal by once again removing the median curbing uh and replacement taking that part out all in favor I okay now we're back to approving the original motion with the amendment so that was approving the amendment now we have to approve the motion the original motion all in favor I I I any opposed i n you oppose okay be it make a record of it that Mr Roberts supposes replacing the uh or not replacing the medium okay is that it any other uh any other thing else that you would like to discuss because we've voted on these uh no sir these proposals 23rd will be Revisited uh and I'm hoping we can get this resolved quickly that being said uh I will entertain a motion to adjourn this meeting and we'll take a five minute break motion your second second all in favor I all right e e e e e e e e e e byebye thanks for coming in treas something are we live yes all right this is the budget work set session for fiscal year 24 and 25 let's do the pledge of allegiance to the flag of the United States of America to The Republic which it stands one nation under God indivisible Justice for All Renee would you please call the rooll council member Frank bankard pres council member Lloyd Roberts council member Kim Shaw Elliot present mayor Dave Gattis here city manager Kyle reefer here okay uh this is a work session so uh we only really have one item and that is to discuss and review fiscal year 2024 2025 budget I'm assuming that everyone has had a u one on one conversation with a city manager to discuss the budget um and uh you already have your concerns or uh or don't so I'm gonna in the floor over to Mr reefer and take it away thank you mayor so I'm gonna just run through some of the things yes we did everyone of the council members I've met with oneon-one went through um carefully the budget and I just just want to bring up some of the main things that we talked about um first covering our what we got for our estimated uh increas in property value for this year it came back um close to June 1st when it was released it was at 10.41% so in comparison to the previous year um the actual was 10.43% and then the year before that was our Peak that we've seen recently which is the 14.10% % um so this is the estimated um July 1st we will get the actual and um again we don't expect it to be more than a percent off it's very fairly close so right now our current knowledge rate um this is a consistent M rate we've had since 2012 is the uh 2.08 N4 and uh with that percent of property value increase we're looking to an an additional Revenue to the to the city of [Music] $165,300 department is we have had the uh $335,000 budgeted for the auditing services for this coming year um the audit committee has need has has made a recommendation which will be at the next council meeting but that does fall within our uh our plan budget so if we do end up approving um at the council meeting this firm the first year will cost us $32,400 so we're within Budget on that um the only thing I could change which we do not expect is if for some reason we had to do a single audit um that would be an additional cost of $2,300 uh I don't think we will qualify for a single audit because they recently raised the amount of government funding you have to receive to over a million dollar which is a lot of money for our size budget so we don't anticipate that um another thing coming up is our legal contract for City attorney um this past budget year we had $76,000 budgeted for Legal Services a lot of that um was for the charter revision that we anticipated um our current retainer is $3,000 per month which equates to $36,000 per year the rest of that is budgeted for outside of retainer um the retainer basically covers our our regular meetings uh and regular City business I have the contract and I can send you guys all copies to to review um just to familiarize yourself with the how we're build and um when we go through you know re uh negotiating this contract for in the future but I believe with our current budget which I dropped out the uh the charter revision piece of it so I put in 61,000 I believe that's a safe number to keep in there for whatever we end up with uh as far as contract negotiations and that should be coming up in April 2025 I have a question about that um all of these ordinance changes that we are doing uh we can't they're going to be sometime after October so that's going to put us into this budget year how much how much do you think that uh we're going to be charged n EXs I run those through because that's that's quite a bit it is quite a bit um most of the work I'm trying to get completed by our planner uh which is Mr CNA um and that is a different line item uh which was the other Professional Services that we increased in our budget this year um Randy will have some part in in drafting those ordinances hopefully they're pretty near completion I'd like to get them all written and considered before the end of this budget year because I did budget that last year okay so that's my plan um we saw that the law enforcement Services were looking at a 7% change increase um one idea that came in and I'm going to contact the chief of police over at uh the Largo Police Department and see if they'd be interested in at least giving us a proposal for placing services to see how that number comes in uh while you're on that I brought up about getting so much money back from Bell Shores but we don't have some we never got we've never been given a time allotment that the sheriff spends over there and I've been going to a lot of their Council meetings I hear they issue 30 some 30 is like the minimum tickets they issue just in the parking lots during the month each ticket takes a while to write um I don't know how much we are subsidizing in their police that if it's I'm saying I did ask the C Captain liner to to to work with the finance department over there and see if they could give me some kind of calculations to understand how they do it um I don't know if it's slly based on time but if you did break down the time it's an hour and 20 minutes a day is equivalent um but uh there may be other factors I'm waiting to hear back and I don't believe that's anywhere in the ballpark I believe it's almost double bit okay so I guess when I when I get those MERS back I'll sh them with the counsil okay um um let me U chime in on the uh the increase I wrote a nice letter to uh the gentleman that that sent us the bad news about the increases and and I told him that we had a huge increase last year we had a Hu we're getting a huge increase this year and it comes to the tune of about 15% over two years um C got a call from Captain liner uh and the same evening I got a call from the sheriff W Terry called me and um he uh informed me that this is not just a valair beach increase it's the same increase over the entire County and it's it's basically the reason why we got hit last year was because they had to uh raise pay uh to stay competitive to keep losing uh to keep from losing uh officers to Pasco and Hillsboro um but uh this year it's insurance and then more pay increases and that's why he's having to uhh to do what they're doing so I I thought we were getting picked on and uh and I and I was I was pretty mad about it whenever I wrote the letter but uh I I was actually kind of impressed Bob called me and uh um but I did at the same time uh I spoke with Woody Brown in Laro and I asked him if he would uh consider doing services for us and I said I can't guarantee that we would actually go through with that but it would be nice to have a quote so we could actually see uh if if if there's even you know if they're even in the ballpark as far as the Sheriff's Department goes and what they're charging us or are they undercharging us or you know I I would just like to see what you know so maybe so how did he respond if they did that would they have to hire additional I'm sure they would I'm sure they would but you know I told him I said I see your cars right here all the time that's right you know so it's not really that much farther the only difference is is that you wouldn't have you wouldn't be com from three directions Largo would only be AC cross the bridge and they would be coming in and out so um but aren't their officers paid more I don't know if they are or not I I just uh I thought it would be a good exercise to see if we could get a quote if they're if they would even entertain deal they may have already heard you know about us and don't want to deal with b beach how about Clear Water since San they going to to San k i I have not spoken with clear water I just thought Largo to begin with and uh I know that also that there's been some apprehension about us having uh any business interactions with the city of clear water in the past so I chose Largo to to see if they would be interested well I'm not complaining when when I'm not complaining about the increase I mean it is what it is I mean I think we have the best deputies Florida I've never heard any of our citizens complain about any of them they're always there for you they're always you can always see them um I'm just complaining about I I don't think we're getting the fair share when we're we're sharing the budget for you know what that the stien we get back for B shorts and I think that should be looked at okay please continue okay so on oh sorry I'm just flipping through the it' be on page 16 this actually is not in this draft this came up during uh my meeting with member uh Roberts um and we uh you know he's interested in uh looking at some of the the work order software Public Works software that you can use um that has a lot of options and a lot of um benefits and we uh he did some research and he came up with a one called ior and we demoed it um which was free um but we sat through about an hour um went through the basic package and saw all the options that that were available um we included our Public Works administrator um Aaron in as well um where we asked a lot of questions and uh we were very impressed where the software is today um it all runs off of the web browser um it's a lot different than it used to be when I was over at city of Oldsmar and you had to run on your own server so also was very impressive because you can tailor it to your city size and everything that you do so that there's a lot of uh variables um when you create work order forms that you can create the fields specifically for what you use not anything more that was never a thing in the past it was kind of like you just had certain options and they were all on your forms um the same thing with reports which was impressive um the ability to just create a mass amount of reports depending on what the what the data in question is um and you know after doing the demo definitely saw a lot of benefits um but we didn't have the price yet and then U later that day the proposal was sent over and it came back very very reasonable price um for it's it's set up where you have a startup fee to to build the program um they do it in 60 days um their programmers Work Direct directly with you they they would use our our maintenance plan adds in and start building like our database in our in our Fields with that and then we tweak it as we winch but um again you know I was very impressed that the uh has the annual cost um for the basic package is $2,200 um that's just a yearly cost and then um an add on that for user no that is for the entire program no limited users and I I my intention would be that every staff member all eight of us use this program is kind of like our Central work order program because we're all kind of directly involved whether it's um you know intaking the calls or you know assigning the work and approval of the work so we would all have access um and then there's a there's an add-on package which is a storm water package that applies to us because that's our main utility um that's a that's a $1,400 a year cost so the yearly cost looking at um $3,600 a year um but again with the storm water you know we do uh our our required permitting through the state and we have to track through forms and spreadsheets all this data anyways and it is part of our regular maintenance um but what what we would do is we'd build our our existing GIS that we have of our storm water system into the database but we we do we run our inspections our work orders valve checks um through this program obviously keeping track of Staff time keeping track of costs of the materials um and also the uh the uh parts and the uh just the inventory in general of things that we keep on hand and um just tracking uh the maintenance of our equipment so kind of everything ties into this is my main point and that as we so um when we're assigning you know what the uh the cost per employee is cost of time cost of materials all this will be tracked um which will be very useful especially when it comes to um kind of keeping keeping track of and and showing where our uh our time our um you know productive time is going so that we can pull this up and and kind of see you know what these costs are and and and further more down the road when we're looking at our stor water system because we know we're constantly doing repairs out we're dedicating so much time to it we'll be able to generate reports that show you know where that money is going so I just I just think this is the this is the future um a lot of cities have already kind of implemented these type of programs I think they're getting to the point where you know they're very affordable now you're currently tracking all of this in spreadsheets more or less an email I mean a lot of their communication is just it's coming in through phone calls it's going to me and then I'm funneling it to where it needs to go um a lot of times unless it's a it's a routine thing that it would go to to Aaron directly but but I'm talking about the uh like Asset Management initiation so our asset so if you're talking about our equipment that's just a separate spreadsheet we're keeping track of the miles the hours um the time the last maintenance a lot of times you got to go pull up the last invoice to get more information it's not exactly a smooth system but we are TR backing it more or less and this software does all that for you it builds it all into one okay um would you say the amount of Labor that you're I won't say wasted but using to to do all of these functions now is it easily $6,000 or more a year oh oh the labor to to track all this you're saving I would say when yes because you're going to benefit from once we all get used to using the system they're no longer filling out paper reports I think the real benefit is when there's a question about specifically how much money we're spending on this or that and it's going to be there and we're going to be able to pull information on it so in time it's going to become more and more valuable now you said you got this soft or they you were able to talk them down to 6,000 uh that's probably a first year right so the startup right now is six and what I mentioned was um you know our purchasing procedures if anything over $5,000 is spent at one time that we have to get a second uh quote and he said well what's the threshold for that because I may be able to work with you and I said it's you know $55,000 so he said well then you know if you guys seriously are considering us then we'll get it below that number for startup now will we be required to get a quote if he ra is the rate next year um for the for the annual rate we're looking at this is a three-year contract so it'll be locked in three years yes that was my question after that we'll see where we're at having the employees W well we talk to him okay she's very good with programs and computers I think pick it up quickly but U no Aaron uh brought the idea to the staff afterwards and they excited about it because we did we did present it as a way we know that they're working hard and we know that they're doing a lot of different things and and we saw it as is the validation to what they're doing no I'm just saying change sometimes is hard to accept you know in the world yeah but if this is something that the employees want you know and uh council member Roberts you uh you reviewed it also yes okay and how do you feel about it I I think it's great uh you know was when Kyle asked me initially what did he think the ballpark was for the cost I said well i' put down like 10,000 and it came in at the number Kyle just referenced which I thought was was pretty attractive and the fact that the guy's willing to get it under five so that we can and I think even mentioned to you Kyle that um they would actually start it now if we wanted to and so get it in in 60 days it'll be fully operational even though our budget wouldn't be until October 1 and he would delay payment on us later so we to just budget that's cool just buy my software man I told that I said a lot of uh when you see like how many users do they had and I think they have like 2500 a lot across the country so they have a an annual users meeting which from my experience that's invaluable because you you go to that annual event have an opportunity to ask people questions that have been through some of the learning curve and share information with them you know we're thinking about doing this and they go oh don't do that we tried that it didn't work well or whatever the case may be and there's some local I think it was Port Richie has it so it's I think it's a good fit I I don't want to go down a huge rabbit hole about the software everything but I did uh where's the data being backed up in the cloud in it's on Amazon servers which is still what the federal government okay and is there opportunity for you to actually download that that software or the uh back at any time we decide to leave they will get you know I think you have to give them 60 days but they will provide all that information back to you it's our information and what if they just close their doors one day what would be saying would yeah I'm waiting for the cloud to rain yeah well you know Cloud I don't have a problem with Cloud software what I have a problem with is all the data being only in the cloud because things can happen we saw it with Amazon web services specifically so uh it's it's a good question to ask but I can ask for uh if they could provide data on it so often that we at least can keep it before any kind of crash or right you know just something like that on his question about what happens if they go away how long they been in business let me pull that up I have to look back because the way this works anymore is they they they develop it they get it going and then they sell it does that hurt us help us I guess it's been a while the fact that they have 2 200 customers that doesn't happen overnight it's true yeah I mean I feel like everything that they're going to import in that we already have existing is going to come in in the form of um you know like a spreadsheet or uh comma delim delineated values so yeah there's always a chance that they could get bought out or change um but I feel like with today's technology you know that we'd be able to convert over one way or another to new software but they pull up forther okay and uh um the only other question is uh or what I'd like to know is what's their uptime policy when 2001 they started it's just something to find out they're uptime policy most most people have an uptime policy whenever their software is a service okay and that's that's important because the last thing you want to know is that well they're in India and they do all their maintenance while you're open for business okay that kind of thing okay just time okay I'll get that information there's usually a plan so that if there's a problem they're going to if it's this type of problem they're going to be respond in next time if it's a different level of problem might be in another period okay Monday through Friday 6:00 a to 5:00 pm mountain standard time is support okay okay what was the other thing they usually have performance standards so if there are outages it defines how quickly they'll respond okay that might have okay performance stands you said they're open to five now two hours ahead yeah okay right that what else um so getting to the uh Capital part of the operating budget I added a $30,000 budget for golf bowlevard holiday lighting um this would be to I I understand at some point we did have light up holiday utility pole lighting I don't know how long ago that was but we did have it and that's why we have the uh plug on some of the polls um primarily on main streets um so we currently it you have existing 19 and they were pretty consistent all the way to get up to 25th and then there's a big gap so part of this expense would be to have enough holiday decorations that we have you know every Major Street up and then when we get up to here where get the Gap so we just keep that same distancing I'm assuming we'll be presented with those decorations and vot on them oh no yeah so this is just to have it in the budget but yeah it would definitely have you guys involved you don't have anything going forward like maintenance or anything where they pretty you know what I'm saying I can talk to nor City likego they got Indian Rocks and see how much replacing they're doing I can tell you right now with the uh Christmas tree that's actually and star we haven't had to do any major replacement and that's been what four five years now that's acept for whenever I don't hit the button um real quick um on this portion of the budget I'm I'm taking out the uh the patrol Bool that we had in there so I'm going to delete that out it's in this draft but I don't think we need it at this point in time um as far as capital uh projects we we're saving on the same same amounts and plan most of the stuff is the you know HVAC roof replacement um you know the bridge repairs Bridge replacement we're saving for that in the long run uh one thing to note is uh we're still saving for Street resurfacing because we um used everything up to this year in our current project so we're starting to save for whatever we're going to be reserving next um we have money in the uh bridge lighting replacement I actually for the first time expense that account for a repair um but that that's really kind of a piece of money if we have a storm we got to get those lights if they fell down and get them back up before we collect any kind of reimbursement um but yeah again same same Savings Program um and then as we need a replacement whether it's a seaw wall or fishing doc um that will come up in a meeting as a proposal the uh Marina budget we right now we saw a last increase uh per foot in 2023 and our final increase per the resolution be in 2025 April 1 um right now uh you know kind of keeping everything working making repairs as we have to uh but you know kind of status quo in and then uh storm water budget uh we again we're collecting the same uh storm water uh assessment fees and um you know again repairing pipes as they they become compromis we're we're taking care of a lot of our pipe maintenance in this project um of existing pipes just because we knew if we bided it out um as one big big we were going to get a better price um but you know there's always things coming up there's always cleanings to be done and as we have money I'd like to continue to purchase um you know the back flow prevent check valves um because there are some areas where we see these real high 3.6 Tides where you do see them pop out of different trains not as bad as the ones we've already done but it's still a thing so um I also like the fact that when we put them in it prevents the barnicles and oysters getting up into the pipe so that helps us in the long run of of doing the maintenance we we collect a flat fee or we have we ever looked at like a mill Fe U would that generate more money um this you know we talk about pumps and everything like that could be considered I think when they modeled the original assessment they just what the the consultant recommended started something and where do the Ninth Street improvements come in this budget or the current budget so the Ninth Street pump project um right now is would come out of reserves um you know we don't have right now the design and the plan I mean we could we kind of have an idea of what the number would be if we want to stick it in our next year's budget we can do that I think it'd be good to have an item for it okay I think we'll be closer to that number especially as we get you know August you know but yeah I'll add something for now good [Music] placeholder that's all that's it did anyone have any uh changes or recommendations that are not uh in this uh draft budget I think the the only thing I saw really was that uh the you were looking into the attorney contract yes uh we were going to possibly look into Price shopping for police services and um you remov the boat no he was going to try to sneak that in there again the was still in there wasn't it yeah it was I'm gonna pull it out yeah we talk that there's one tiny item that I just like to comment on and I commend Kyle for this uh for the library charges oh yes I skipped over that I'm sorry because I I I'll just State for the record that I was offended as incensed irritated when I learned learned that um Beller Beach had increased the cost for library cards and I thought if there's this is a pretty fundamental surface that a that a a modern day civilization offers their people and so I'm glad that we're taking care of that and I will say too when I first moved here and I found out about how they were doing the library I thought how smart is that we're too small a town to support your own Library um so go next door get a card come back and we'll reimburse you and I thought great well you pay for only the people that ask for it you don't have a special assessment for it and and you allow people to educate themselves and um when I I just thought it was so petty when people started playing around with that reimbursement so thank you for that yeah have you been talking to my wife what if be change what if be changed on uh non-departmental 519 it's on page 12 um 59810 Library Services um we had budgeted $2,500 we bumped it up to 5,000 um the actual for 2023 budget was uh 2,150 um it's really just from at one point we dropped it from the full reimbursement of $100 on the half the reimbursement with the thought that people were getting cards that weren't using them but I can tell you right now now we never really saw a major fall off we just got a lot of angry people that were like not having to pay $50 didn't like the fact that we weren't reimbursing the full right thing so um I I added in here just from getting resident comments um to go back to full reimbursement it's not a huge chunk of money but I don't see it's skyrocketing just because people can get a library C because it it still takes a lot you got to go down there and you got to get registered and you got to come here and right you're not really do that going to use it it's it's a beautiful library but they charge $100 a year I think it's a little excessive I mean now they said you can join what it would cost us to join the Cooperative is way higher I have a number somewhere from last year but it doesn't even make sense I'm just saying my little bitty town in in in Illinois um it was a $400 a year assessment for the library you 15 years ago M was great was too yeah you know you went in there show residency and they gave you a card you know was it coming out your taxes yeah but I mean there was a line on the tax form that's what paid $400 a year taxes I'm just saying we pay a hundred I mean my wife you know and my daughter they each pay a 100 you know before but um I just think that's a little steep you know yeah of course we're not using someone else's laberry too yeah it's a nice Library oh it's look it's a beautiful Li I mean the whole thing is gorgeous I mean four books yeah yeah Kyle what's next on the uh what's the next date oh next so we got a regular meeting coming up um and then the next budget workshop's going to be uh July 15th you have what 15 okay right uh now we're on to uh General business we have any general business unfinished business would anyone like to go home just in a comment so I'm just checking my calendar I will not be here I for the beginning of the July through the 10th what it was that wor so I'll miss the next council meeting but we're still three strong so that works right yes it do new Charter sweet any other comments no uh would someone like to make a motion toour second in favor let's go home everyone the sun is shining so yay we still"
