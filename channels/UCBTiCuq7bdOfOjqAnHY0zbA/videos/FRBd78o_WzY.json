    "transcript": "good evening everyone please come to order city council meeting for the city of bel air beach monday november 2nd is now in session um we're going to do the pledge of allegiance but don't rise just yet i have two things that i want to sadly have to recognize and ask for a moment of silence here lynn reeves informed us that a long time residents mr jim corrigan passed away a little while ago he was um he was a long-time resident of our city and he was in helping get the underground going and uh so we give our prayers to his family and i would ask that you also remember mayor of madeira beach who passed away suddenly maggie black i sat next to maggie plaque at the last meeting that we had of the big city and um she died of a heart attack and she was a dedicated public servant so our hearts go out to madeira beach and all their residents so we just want them to know that our prayers are victims so before we do the pledge of allegiance would we please observe the moment of silence for these two blind people thank you um i asked two fine individuals here to do the pledge of allegiance first tonight we don't have a public ceremony for veterans day our city but november 11th is veterans day and that's to honor all the individuals men and women who served in our military there's sayings out there that freedom isn't free these are the people who paid the price we're surrounded by a lot of veterans i see several people i recognize here i asked retired commander master chief of the navy john hanzig and retired commander rick shock if they would do the honors of leading us in the pledge of allegiance tonight so gentlemen please join us as we sign the pledge of allegiance i pledge allegiance to the united states thank you to all the veterans who are here today and have gone before us for all your sacrifice you're what makes this possible for us in this country of democracy so thank you for bella beach and for our citizens first um we have the roll call madam clerk will you please call the world council member robin ockey here council member dave gattis councilmember jody shirley councilmember rita swope here vice mayor glenn gunn mayor joseph manzo city manager lynn reeves city attorney fred reilly and council member mark beam was unable to attend let the record reflect that rita uh council member raider slope is uh appearing by telephone we have enough people present for a forum first item of business is to approve the agenda is there a motion by jody shirley section my dave gad is open for discussion um i would like to uh if this meeting goes beyond two hours i would like to take a uh a mass break just to walk around for a couple of minutes um just bring it up at the time and i'm sure there will be an approach and that's fine just so everyone knows the voting machinery behind us they have to try and set up tonight not going to stop anyone from speaking but you want to move it along they have to set up for a little election that will happen tomorrow um i had two points um the consent agenda has item number five i did have a couple comments on that so i'd like to bring that into the regular agenda i promise it's going to be short and uh i'm going to ask that item 10 um not be considered at all tonight only for the fact well two things number one there's no resolution that accompanies it so i'm not quite sure what the action item is and i don't want to put the city attorney on the spot of attracting a resolution tonight but more importantly tomorrow on our ballot item number two actually allows us to depart from using robert's rules of water in a strict manner and our charter right now requires and our ordinance requires that we follow robert's rules order now we don't do everything in robert's rules of order like standing for attention to get the chairs attention that would be crazy but the underlying cornerstone of robert school's border is that there has to be a motion in order for there to be some type of an action by a board such as ourself so i think if we were to start adjusting the charter before the folks vote on it tomorrow i think we would be premature um fred reilly i'm going to ask you your legal opinion on that but i i do think that at this point we're not authorized to start departing from the charter and particularly on something that is so critical as is emotion emotion is the cornerstone properties so i'm going to ask your opinion on that and then the council can consider what i'm asking for in terms of 10. we'll need a motion on that then you're asking for a mail yes i am okay my my opinion is it's you the way your rules are set up it has to be an item you you vote on i would agree with you that it makes sense to have the charter amendments uh have the decision on that in order to go forward i i will make an overall comment about the the city's rules of decorum and of the the way that the meetings are run the rules are rigid and at times the rules are applied in a rigid manner and the the thing that uh is i think frustrating for probably citizens and also council members is that at times there's things that you all want to talk about that you unfortunately due to the existing rules you have some restrictions that are applicable that make it frustrating for things to be discussed so i i personally this is personal opinion not legal opinion but personal opinion think at times the rules are applied too strictly and especially among the city council members to me it makes sense that you have some opportunity to discuss things among yourselves although at the end of your meetings you have commissioner comments and that that's largely what that period of time is for i'm not i won't consider it but somebody has to make i can't make a motion that's another thing that's on the agenda so i'm going to ask is if there's no interest i'll need a motion to adopt those two suggestions that i have then we will vote on that motion have more discussion and if not then we'll go forward with the agenda as it is do we have a motion for the two items that i made which is to remove item six from the regular i'm sorry r5 from the consent agenda moving into the regular agenda and to remove item 10 in its entirety so let's move my date of goddess second i think they're wrong okay discussion they got us first and then anyone knows um as far as number ten goes uh there was a time and place for that that it was put into place and that's a partially because of me i really at this time have no consideration of moving it so i would i would prefer to kind of postpone this i personally would like to um understand what glenn's position is on this because uh i think yeah we have some pretty strict rules that are applied selectively and i would like to understand why len's proposing we discuss this now because i think there are times that that it is it does require further discussion and there are things that we should be discussing that maybe don't hit the agenda a good question uh i think it's in the interest of best practice i mean even if you refer to robert's rules of order you go to the back of there and there it makes allowances for smaller committees robert school's orders were was developed basically to facilitate large bodies and meetings to maintain order and discussion and debate this is a small body and i don't think we need to uh basically govern it with the iron fist robert's rules i think so far as best practices go i think along with fred there i think we need to loosen the reins a little bit and take advantage of the times that this body comes together to meet not only collectively as this body the city council but when the residents are here because often things are deferred to a work session where some people aren't aware that it's been moved or that it's on a new agenda they they have made time in their schedules to come and attend the regular city council sessions and participate in some of those discussions and debate it's just a best practice i think we don't need enough and i think any opportunity we have to discuss issues before this city is best served by us and i'm not saying that it's not a good motion um i think this is something that we do need to flesh out well first let's see what the voters say tomorrow and then flesh this out because we're going to have the opportunity to loosen the rules however we want but the one thing i'm going to ask as long as i'm the presiding officer and i think any presiding officer is going to want it is that we codify exactly what we're looking for i don't want to have you know one person doing one way one person do it another way so i think this is something that we might want to consider you know the flip side of this coin as i remember hour and a half long discussions about like i think it was traffic and other things and they you couldn't vote on them at the end of it because it was just a discussion and that takes up a lot of the citizens time too i think it's better suited for a work session so i'm not trying to kill it forever i just think that i'm required i mean the charter says i shall follow robert's little blue and our ordinance says the same dave gaddis is right he moved this thing and i think he moved it right after we had that long discussion at one time um so i just think that let's see what the voters say tomorrow we're going to have the opportunity i intend to hold a special counsel's uh work session so that we all can get our input into how we want to run these things in the future but i just think we might be jumping the gun a little bit tonight unintended but um you know if we go tonight i think maybe just let's see what happens tomorrow so then the governing guidance on this is robert's rules of order is that what you're saying because as far as i know i asked the city manager if there was any enactment resolution or whatever that restricted us to now so yes yes too we actually have charter 2.405 a which says we shall use robert's public order and then um the uh 2.62 of our ordinance which also repeats that that we shall use it now we have collectively agreed that we weren't going to do some of the formalities like we're not going to stand up and address each other that's crazy um but the motion is the cornerstone of robert's home's water it's a deliberative body and you have to be meeting on something and there has to be a question so like if we're just discussing something i'm not saying this isn't a bad thing but we're just discussing something like how do you shut it off how do you call a question there's no question and i remember when we were having that long discussion at one time i'll never forget jody shirley asks what do we do now and i looked at her and i said i can't do anything there was no question so i just don't want to have and maybe the solution will be have discussion but have some time limits on them too and refer to committee to our work sessions in the future i just think we're a day early maybe on this thing i think tomorrow night at this time we'll know if we have this authority i i just don't want to overstep my charter grounds or if you will or violate the charter by calling against it right now on a key item like this this is a little thing so and so what is the the fix for this or the workaround should the charter amendment be defeated um well at least change the ordinance that we have i mean we have a charter that says we shall follow it we have allowed ourselves the liberty of certain declaration not to care formalities again the standing up i mean you know what glenn gunn said is correct you're supposed to stand up and mr chairman may i be recognized i mean that's insane for a group of six people or seven people um but to take away the motion you just got robert's rules order so my proposal watching what he had over here is maybe we have like at the end of the night when we have our time to speak but maybe there's a discussion period but with some finite amount of time on it not where we talk an hour and a half on something and the poor citizens are just watching us debate here because we can't we can't if we just have a discussion item we can't do anything here that's the only point i'm making is we can discuss it but ultimately it's gonna have to go to a committee anyway for a resolution or for an ordinance or something else we can't i can't rule on a discussion i don't disagree with you there are times i would like to talk about certain things but i think we as a group have to kind of put some time limits on them too i don't want to talk for an hour and a half on something and meanwhile we have 10 other items that we have to do that's just my feeling if you want to do that no i i think you're you're spot on about building their framework around it in some boundaries but i think issues will arise when the opportunity presents itself you need to have a discussion while issues are fresh in your mind and i also think we do that i know we do with the city manager we often have you know we're not supposed to just so for the folks who are in the audience we're not supposed to have back and forth questions with each other but when the city manager speaks there's often questions to him and then he answers back and i i'm never going to call something on that because i think it's very productive it's always been good but we're not supposed to have cross talking and everything else if you want to follow it technically that's what it says but it's very productive during that time of day when somebody says you know lynn what are you doing about such and such a project and he answers it back i mean i don't want every question coming through me like that that's just talk that way but if any of you have attended a work session though it's a much more informal thing we're kind of on a first name basis we have an opportunity to discuss things a little bit more usually a much lesser agenda so i'm not against it i'm just saying maybe we have something where we don't get somebody's filibustering for an hour or something like that i think we could do this with having a limit but i'd really feel a lot better if the citizens um depending how they said this let's just leave it as like how the citizens go tomorrow and make this a lot easier for us that's my point but i i guess i i still have a question of what if the amenity gets defeated and then we also need to research robert's rules and see what the background is for relaxed rules did you just look that up well if the charter amendment does not uh pass then you're really in a the same situation you are today and you will continue doing what you're doing now which is uh having discussion items be brought up in a workshop so that that to me is where where you're left you always have the ability to uh modify that the code and the the manner at which the meetings are run is a lot of it is stated in the code so you can always change that to the mayor's point you have more flexibility if the amendment passes with going forward and you have a clear mandate from the citizens if the amendment passes i mean not to be the kill but you know this is roberts i've reproduced it and it's the main motion and i'm not gonna read the whole thing i just need to read one sentence it says an original main motion is a main motion that introduces a substantive question as a new subject so that is the if you take that out of robert's holes of order and you don't have pretty much many rules left so the main motion is the key i mean i i i think we can have a discussion period of time but i just don't think this is the way to do it tonight until the citizens speak and we might be able to work around on that i'm not going to work the will if they vote no but i think we have some flexibility on that like riley said we already have a period where we're allowed to talk at the end so it may just mean opening that up a little bit you know maybe having a little bit of discourse during that i think it would be useful i really do i'm not against it but i think there has to be some constraints during this session decision is to pass legislation take action work sessions to introduce it and see if it gets out of committee i look at it like congress you know that's your committee you float your idea see what everybody thinks we throw things out sometimes and people go nah it's not going to go forward and it never sees tonight so when stuff comes here tonight at least it's something that we're usually going to act upon well with your statement and your acknowledgement that perhaps things do need to loosen up a little bit then i've accomplished what i wanted to do you want to majority [Music] so any other counsel all right i'm just going to try to remind everybody why how this came about and why we put restrictions on ourselves it was basically we were not completely following robert's rules which i did not have a problem with i totally entertained discussions on anything the problem was as citizens would show up they'd be here and at 10 o'clock we would still be arguing over something that wasn't being voted on well they would come to speak about a certain topic it would follow that discussion and by the time we got to what was important to them they gave up and went home so to try to curb the amount of time that we were here on a regular council meeting i introduced a supplemental resolution that reinforced robert's rules and and personally i think it has helped curb some of the the lengthy um non-voting discussions that we were having i would say that the probably the proper fix would be to to have another work session if it's if we've got things we need to discuss i would like to be able to give the citizens the opportunity to speak upon a topic before we do vote on it so that we uh we are able to consider their feelings also but as far as just just randomly having discussions or even if we put it on on the agenda if it turns into a discussion like tonight like this particular topic we pretty much you know i don't really have a good answer for you glenn i wish i did no i understand completely my question to the city manager was there a resolution for this well mr i remember mr gavis tried but i don't think there was a resolution no it was there were three or four uh items on that resolution and all of them were stripped except for that one it's in the front of our books actually and it says that um like in section two it's resolution 2019-09 it was brought by dave gaddis i remember tonight well and item two is what round up one of the items that survived and it said i don't want to read it verbatim it says discussion items shall not be added to the regular agenda um which must uh number two of that says and any item added to the regular agenda must include an action item for council to vote on that's exactly what you pushed then it made it clear yes okay so i acknowledge that then and as food for thought i would say then a reconsideration of the resolution at a future work session with the possibility of building some framework to guide those discussions limit those discussions as far as time frame orderly content and with that i'll i'll that remains on the amendment would be to um to just move i have a very short comment on the consent agenda i'm number five so if we could just move it to regular i'll put my comments in if the city clerk agrees with me she'll make a change if not we'll move forward with that but can we move this uh agenda at this point with that adjustment bringing five to the regular agenda and its place and clerk any any other comments matt clark can you do uh call though i have a comment okay um i would just like to point out we probably spent over 20 minutes discussing this item which we could have in my opinion once it came up on item number 10 so i just want to say we've already sat here and listened to 20 minutes of the discussion i don't understand you know why i can barely hear that and i'm sitting next to her soon um we have any other comments or questions then um adam clark will paul so this is as adjusted we're going to move five into the regular agenda um first to move item five into the regular agenda a yes vote moves into the regular agenda that will approve the agenda haven't done this in a few months folks so just bear with us it's our first one since what was it tonight [Music] ready yes this is just to move imply okay council member robin ockey aye council member dave gattis aye councilmember jody shirley aye councilmember rita swope aye advisor vice mayor glenn gunn mayor joseph manzo all right it passes six to zero as amended the new agenda um we are moving that forward um not any comments that clark please call the roll this is to approve the overall agenda when you get moving today council member swope aye council member shirley aye councilmember gattas aye councilmember aki aye vice not to be a pain but that's a little loud now so if we can cut it just a bit and be great okay we have citizens comments next folks we were just talking about citizens comics is the first time we've met for a little while citizens will come up over here by this podium but in protection of robin hockey i'm going to ask that if you come up and wish to speak just raise your hand go out the door come around come through this door speak and then work the same way back to your seat um there's a close conduct there i'm not going to belabor it basically just speak to the group as a whole here our council as a whole and be civil and we're all going to get along just fine okay with that you have three minutes so would anyone like to address us john hansen is first good evening it's nice to see everybody again um my comments are basically directed to the sheriff's department every question just a moment please on john hansik on 22nd street on october 23rd my wife and i were returning home from dinner it's around sunset happened to go past the traffic light took a glance at the 12th street parking lot much to my surprise three deputy sheriff's suvs sitting in there just sitting and they were firing us back in my opinion they were not monitoring traffic they were all in their vehicles they were not checking cars or anything else now i have an extreme appreciation and respect for law enforcement but when we the taxpayers are paying the sheriff's department 506 000 to change this tax year i as a taxpayer expect more than sitting in vehicles doing whatever i don't see that as being law enforcement i remember we had other residents have commented about the lack of patrols in the side streets and i would like to start seeing some more enforcement on 22nd street and i'm going to make a suggestion to the sheriff's department instead of putting your marked vehicles out there with your lasers use some unmarked vehicles and not unmarked suvs i'll give you a little tip when i used to be a resident of new york state they put troopers on the side of the thruway interstates and they were in beat up ram cycle vehicles and they used radar don't go out there looking like a fancy unmarked vehicle i'm getting tired of the racing again it's been going on and on and on and i'm fed up with it and i can't do anything about it because i'll go to jail i pay taxes i expect something to be done last thing i want to say and i'm sorry i'm getting a little passionate about this but it is what it is if you haven't voted please exercise that right tomorrow as you mentioned myself rick we defended that right don't let it pass you by it's the one opportunity you have to exercise who governs us thank you thank you mr hansen anyone else like to address the council seeing no other hands i'm going to close the citizen comments nellis county sheriff's department office i'm sorry sure sheriff could you give us your name and title please uh sergeant roy switch house sheriff's office good evening everybody uh the ucr part one crimes for the month of september there was one theft that was taken during that time for the entire month there were a total of four people arrested within the city of delaware beach and those were so for some ordinance violations and some other various crimes there were a total of 915 events within the city of bel air beach top in that list was 279 house checks and then all the way down to drug hauls there was one crash in the city and that was at looks like 10th uh 1041 gulf boulevard and then 240 citations issued during the month and that's all there's any questions do we have any comments or questions for sure i just want to make a comment um today my kids were home because their school gave the teachers the day off so my mom was watching the kids and i believe it was the code enforcement officer saw my son outside got out of his car and started playing baseball with him for like five minutes which meant the world to my son having the sheriff playing with him so i just want to say thank you for that that meant a lot to us and for all your officers for being friendly and waving to my kids every time they go by so i really appreciate that personal contact so please pass that on for me i've got of course sure vice mayor looking at page two under felonies carry concealed firearm and especially alas would use firearm weapons during an event what was that all about uh that one actually i was working that evening and that was nothing i don't want to say nothing more but what that was is the driver of the vehicle was stopped i don't know the exact violation but it was initiated on the bridge the stop resulted right here in front of city hall and one of the passengers inside the vehicle there was four total was carrying a concealed firearm during that commission of that crime he was in possession of narcotics so the underlying crime while carrying concealed farmer was a possession of the narcotics sergeant i have two things for you good news and bad news and i'll start with the good news i also want to commend the code enforcement officer danny doherty i saw this one with my own eyes and i couldn't believe it we have had a house on the corner of 7th street and gulf boulevard that for years has been horrendously overgrown i mean it's so bad you couldn't even see the light at night it had blocked everything out with the overgrowth i watched deputy doherty um work with the arm and in a very i just i didn't hear the conversation i could just tell by the body language it was just done in a cordial and professional manner if you go by that house today that house looks so good it has opened up a light on the street it's an example of how to enforce code without being heavy-handed and the professionalism um excellent job and i saw it and i i wanted to let him know and i want to let the sheriff and everyone in the department know that he did an outstanding job now for the one that i don't want to have to do and there's something i've spoken about last month we spoke about it at work session and i just want to let you know so that the word continues to get out we have an ongoing protest at six street sixth avenue sixth street and gulf boulevard every day it's been going since july 21st talked about it at least three times sheriff goldfield is aware of it sheriff um captain mike liner was instructed to call me i confirmed with the city manager that he asked that on october 22nd that you had to call sheriff called the area to get that returned phone call it's not good what's even worse is that there's no enforcement okay day after day people go by beeping horns for an hour to an hour and a half that's against state bullets against our law we said we were going to give it to election day which is tomorrow um what's really great is i happen to be walking by coming back from walking on the beach one morning and the person who heads this thing looked at me and yelled out to me and i couldn't hear him over the horns but he looked up to me and he said i like the sound of horns okay um he likes the sound of horns so i don't know it's against the arguments so i'm asked i've called in multiple times to the sheriff i don't even think they respond it's not going to go away i'm going to ask the city attorney at this point i'm looking at that contract very carefully and please be ready to discuss it at some point in time it says that the sheriff shall enforce our laws and if we can't handle two 78 year old protesters that are closing mayhem for three four months running i got some questions to share with poultieri whose sign i have in front of my house right now so please i'm just asking that you consider this this will come up at our work session if it doesn't stop after tomorrow okay so i'm letting you know that our next work session i'm gonna expect someone from the sheriff to be here to speak on this issue that's still going okay i will pass that information to one catholic and sheriff called the area also i'll pass it along to captain liner thank you okay i'll add i'd like to add sure to that is i think uh the statement that the sheriff is responsible for enforcement there's there's some more to that description i think i think that gives him some discretion not just total heavy-handed enforcement of everything it's an officer's call on whether he's going to issue a summons not whether he's going to stop the hundreds of violators when asked by the city manager and okay well i'm just saying there's there's more to that sentence than just shall enforcement and that's why we're going to debate this at a work session because if that one faults then so does the noise ordinance and so does the work on sunday ruling a whole bunch of other stuff that's called the equal protection clause you can't say it's okay to be porns but it's not okay to play the electric guitar or stereo i'm not sure there's more to it than that and i would also recognize that the city manager is in point of contact with uh the law enforcement and the sheriff's here i i'm not quite sure where anybody picks up the phone and demands a call for i was demanded by sheriff galtierre he told her my sheriff weiner to call me the sheriff when he was here told me and i'm a citizen i pay a lot of taxes and i'm going to call every single time i see wall breaking going on in our city that's what i swore to enforce the law that's what they support to too but we're looking the other way so folks if the noise ordinance means anything to you let's enforce it or else we can pull it off i mean it's fine but you're not going to selectively enforce it that's going to get you into a problem i think your attorney will tell you about that when we get to work session sheriff that's all i have i don't hang on one second let's see if the citizens have anything they'd like just like mr hands have already spoke to you but he has anything else you'd like to add or anyone else please address the sheriff yeah i would like to say something i just want to thank you for all your work i think you guys are doing a fine job uh contrary to some other comments around this evening but i appreciate everything you guys do and thank you for talking to my house and my neighborhood you all cannot pass it along to the others um yes i just thank the sheriff's officers um i think you guys did an amazing job and i know it's getting direction from different people and i fully believe in the fact that he's good he able to use discretion at any time so i just you know i appreciate you guys then on the camera sure do you want to just step slightly aside let me maintain our distancing thank you beach for 16 years i think this is an amazing city and what i want to say to you is i've seen these officers throughout our community helping so many different people and definitely we're really throwing this to honor you guys and they're stopping tomorrow that's the last day thank you and thank them okay and i support their cause i just don't support the horned leg though okay and they can make that happen okay but they they they brought balance short and bella beach together so many times they've been coming together to stand for you guys thank you for what you do every day i pray for your name thank you and thank and thank you very much for that piece of information any one of those june dance card jim van scoyne 7th street feller beach um as many you know i have a lot of law enforcement in my family former assistant chief of police so forth we totally support the sheriff we have the best i think in the country sheriff department the whole issue has been this going outside our bedroom since july okay the purcells didn't want to move around the city as even the city council gave a suggestion to as well as other people including the police department and when i spoke to them personally they said it was not convenient so if you want to keep the idea of having this fresh and and to and to support our police as we should be always doing why not move it from street district in the city and keep it a fresh idea why not there's been many many of people that have offered to do it on their street corners for them to come there i i don't see what the resistance has been to spread it around the city as was suggested in the work session as well from this council so and it's outside of our bedroom since july every single morning thank you thank you and i'm sorry and i want to say thank you very much for all you do all your sacrifices you making your families make there's we have no better sure we have the best sheriff department in the country of my opinion thank you thank you other citizen comments back to council sheriff i just want to say to you i also support you i always have i've signed the highest contracts here i'm trying to get more share of work here and i was the only person on this council that was about to fall in officers memorial last year and i was crying for all the people that had been lost in the history of pinellas county so i'm 100 behind supporting people i just don't want to make it that it inconveniences neighbors and other people like that i think there's other ways of showing the support like going to the fallen officers memorial okay they didn't do it this year because they're virus but when you see how many men and women have lost their lives in service you really appreciate the job that you do but when i look at crime statistics and we talk about one event i mean i was talking to another mayor i mean most mayors were killed to have that so don't think i'm not grateful to you and the sheriff and not only do we think we have the best sheriff in the world in the country he is he got voted that last year charlie claude fell here was the best sheriff in the country that was from his peers so excellent job and excellent professionals again i never couldn't agree more thank you anyone else sheriff thank you thank you okay we move on to the consent agenda this is the approval of the october 5th 2020 city council many minutes for a motion second second there's no discussion on this all in favor all right anyone opposed passes unanimously six to zero item five we're now moving into the regular agenda i'm just sliding item five down which is the approval of the october 19th city council or session minutes um i asked to move that one down so first we have a motion to approve those minutes and a second second discussion anyone i'll say what i have to say then um the only thing i had madame clark and you might remember this was what we just were speaking about on um on item four it was discuss recognition for themselves i just wanted to get in either a sentence or two that i spoke at length regarding the protests and our need to address it as a city so if we could just add those two sentences or something to that effect at your discretion that's all i wanted to add to that otherwise i find it's fine we would need a motion to amend that though from the floor if we want to do it if not they'll stay as it is moved and a second no second okay then we vote on it uh any count any further council comments i was just going to say i mean i remember we talked about that and it's good to clarify that there was not just one or two of us there was a few of us that were against this yeah i think it should be in there but we don't have a second so i can't go forward i'm adjusting it so um our comments are noted for the record and then and the audio will say what exactly we said um and hopefully it looks as if this problem is going to end tomorrow so i'm appreciative of that okay so then is there any citizen comments on that none back to council to a vote to approve the october 19th city council work session minutes madam clerk council member shirley aye council member swope aye council member aki aye councilmember gaddis hi vice mayor gunn hi mayor manzo yeah so five to one it passes three minutes are passed as is okay we move to the item six long one here consideration of ordnance 2004 an ordinance granting to duke energy florida llc doing businesses duke energy an electric fertility rights and way utilization franchise describing the terms and conditions related to the occupancy of municipal streets and rights of way in the city of delaware beach florida for the purposes of providing electrical electric service providing for several ability of provisions and for providing an effective day the description is a right of what rights of way utilization to provide electric services first we have a motion so moved by dave gattis second seconded by jodi shirley open for discussion moving to dave davis uh nope this is a continuation of uh underground yes this is the continuation of the franchise it's a 10-year franchise agreement and jeff baker is here from duke energy if you have any questions i had only one question on sick on section 6a it's talking about franchise fee and i just didn't have time to pull out my bill and see but it's talking about franchise fees are going to be paid to the city but collected from the company's customers is this a new fee that's coming on is this something we already have is this an adjustment to our fee is the baker you want to address us it is something we already have okay that's was my key concern i don't want anything hidden to the taxpayers that they don't know about and you don't know about let's just give your name you for the record good evening uh jeff baker uh to energy 299 first avenue uh the franchise fee uh is a fee that it has a statutory limit of six percent which that is currently what the city is uh collecting and has been for many years so it would not be a new fee whatsoever uh but you know if you do look at your bill you'll see a line item for the franchise fee as well as the municipal tax that's two separate line items i needed as it would be the same fee that we have ever received in for for many years i think that answers my question unfortunately like i said i couldn't look at it but it just takes the money out of my bank account and you don't stay happy so um but i think that takes care of my question so does anybody else have a question while we have mr baker up here i'll even open up to to the citizens so essentially that's just a pass through to the customers i mean right does give us some privileges uh for example uh we don't pay permitting fees and things of that nature so it's a pass-through cost that we collect on behalf of our customers and remit it to the city and just for the council's knowledge for 2019 i want to say we paid 187 000 was what the 187 thousand dollars was to be paid to the city for that right i guess it's just a nomenclature you say but exactly any other citizen comments active counsel any other comments mr baker thank you for giving us the standard nation i'm going to call the question at this point then so i have to read it again what's before us is to approve consideration of boardman's 20-04 an ordinance granted to duke energy florida llc doing business with duke energy and energy utility rights away utilization franchise describing the terms and conditions related to the occupancy of municipal streets and rights of way in the city of delaware beach florida for the purposes of providing electric service providing for several ability of provisions and providing for an effective day city manager i don't see this is the first reading right yes we have to have two readings so we'll have our next one that's not indicated here but this is the first reading so everyone knows as he's just said there has to be two readings so he'll come now and we'll come again at our next uh council meeting in december okay all right any other questions everybody's good with that madam clerk please call the question councilmember gaddis hi councilmember aki aye councilmember swo hi council member shirley hi vice mayor gunn aye mayor manzo all right so it passes six to zero that's first readings it'll be on for the second reading uh in december and i'm not sure the date but the first monday in december second seventh seventh december seventh day that i believe it included okay city council next one seven item uh is consideration of reappointment of planning and zoning board members we have three people brenda bonacera thomas bonicera and j.c hemfeldt um we normally don't do a motion for this because it's a reappointment um i don't think we have to do a motion i think it's just there before us for a boat right correct so um or any of these individuals here usually we let the individual speak first if they wish and then council could have questions for you or we might discuss things amongst ourselves no one's here okay does the council have any comments on this before we go to vote i have a question on this process this is a reappointment but my question is the process do you advertise for new applicants or is it just an automatic rollover well patty uh we advertise all the time for board applications which we don't get very many uh but any then we ask the members that are on it if they want to and we bring that to council that's correct we have i we have never stopped advertising i can't even remember how far back we have had that up there because we are unable to fill our boards and committees so yes it's continue continuous advertisement because this is a reappointment can you certify because i don't see any paperwork here can you certify to us i think there's a procedure that they have to i think within a month of their thing don't call me exactly like within a month of their term coming up they have to request it did they make that formal request to you within the proper time frames and can you document it if asked yeah it's 60 days and no it was just verbal i spoke with each each one of them hang on one second is that our process verbal or does it have to be written um i'm i really um can't answer that i'd have to look it up i mean that's just the way we've always done it but i can't tell you if that's the written process so i would have to check that for you um would you be able to check that it's just i think if it's followed with the process i have no part pardon problem moving it forward um if it's not within the process then i have a big problem because it would be either against our charter or ordinance do you have your book with you yeah [Music] i'll be back that's a good does anybody need a break i mean we're going to need a couple minutes right daddy you'll need a few minutes so you can you want to just take a five-minute break or sure okay everyone wants to turn there's nothing in the code that prevents you from do doing that and they both of the individuals go into it with the acknowled understanding that the law requires that they not violate the sunshine law which means they can't discuss it over dinner or over breakfast or over tv or whatever they do at home if they discuss matters and that's a violation of law and there's consequences for that and um i'll ask lynn reeves and patty gentry to best of your knowledge there has never been any accusation against these individuals correct as far as i know i've never heard it right correct okay can i ask do we have um vacancies on this board what does this bring it to a full full capacity by loading these three are reappointing these three these these these three and um item number eight would fill the board that's only one position i was under the impression eight was um for the purposes of code review were they gonna be long term long-term long-standing positions mr draskovic had to resign from the board and i'm rate is to fill his position right there's one position there's one hope there [Music] the next thing you would vote on is uh two individuals you would select one of them one of the two okay okay councilman surely does that take care of your question it does any of the council comments before we go to the vote so you can vote up to three do not have to vote for three you could vote for zero one two or three this is a paper ballot we will give it to patty gentry he will collect them from us so they will only please select their ballots and please place your signature and print your name council members hope council members okay um you're off speaker and i'm ready to take your

she's on count on that board and i have one two i have four votes for wanda square that would also place her on the board correct correct okay that's good congratulations everyone thank you for serving on this okay now since you just got elected to this we're gonna give you some work uh item nine is to assign the planning and zoning board to review the city code now um well let's let's get the motion first can i have a motion i think um well it's clear we need to revisit the code review we looked at this a couple years back there are some items that did get covered because code is pretty large task to tackle i know that we have a draft charter here that i don't know if we're discussing that right now but i think it's probably important to address i notice there are some items on here specific and maybe some additional recommendations could be made and and want to thank you for stepping up did a great job last time hanging that up um i i wanted to thank glenn gunn and i think he worked with city manager also on this and thank you both for putting together um councilman shirley i didn't think we were going to discuss this tonight this is just placed on our guest i haven't even had an opportunity to read it so i'm going to say we should assign this clear that we're not going to get the um at least my opinion is we're not going to get any folks stepping forward to go on a separate committee so i think we can assign it and i think we can button this up at the next work session and then hand it to them i'm sure it's going to be comprehensive we might have a few little changes but if you follow i'm sure you did the procedures in the past we probably have enough to charge them to get this done i think that was your timeline right yeah that's uh what what i'm asking you to do is assign the task tonight and then uh we'll find hopefully there will be a council member that will would like to be an advisor and i've discussed this with the city attorney this is the simplest way to do it we'll assign them they'll be non-voting but they'll be at the table and their their will be you know very important so and if we get some other citizens that have some interest then you can make that recommendation in december but right now what i'm asking you to do is assign the task and then you've got a draft charter and it's just some things that i've collected over the last couple years that you know i know some areas will need to work on and if you've got some others that you think that i missed then feel free to give them to me so i can add them to the list but we don't want to make it 20 chapters you know we want to try to keep it to half a dozen at the most because it is cumbersome and some of the changes in some of the chapters that are in there it's just minor things like i think there's a reference of our police department somewhere we need to strike that and fix that things like that so what i'm asking you tonight is to go ahead and appoint them and then in december we'll come back and if we have any other volunteers we'll recommend that the council appoint them as advisors so december we'll actually do the formal charge but we'll hash this out so we've got two items now for the next work session okay the glen gun item i would like to see that on along with probably again depending on how the vote goes we may have a lot of stuff to discuss on that ones that may be a session unto itself but let's bring this one in there also let's get these comments if you don't mind so that's two items for the next work session and we're just putting the list together we've got two already yeah and quite frankly that may yeah i mean if we're going to start talking about like all the rules of order that's gonna be quite a night so let's you know we have to have two we'll split this up into two work sessions that's fine so uh do you have any other council comments because we can probably move this one on uh citizens anybody want to comment on item number nine back to council with jody shirley having the last word just to reiterate then i this election of the council members that will participate that'll be that will take place in december as well i think this isn't an ad hoc committee so normally on an ad hoc committee i have to nominate anybody who was interested i was going to nominate it's not holding it back but if anyone's interested i just speak up and we'll decide how many people are interested i don't know that we have a limit i think we were talking about two but um depends what's the time to put in on it it's already open to everybody i'm i don't even know how we're gonna vote on it because i don't think we have a procedure for doing this is just join in on the on the team as an advisor but you're kind of doing it with our well like you you've appointed me several times as an advisor to the finance committee or to the communications committee you appointed me and patty so right things like that just get a consensus of counsel on the next time that would be fine and so anyone who's interested just think about it and speak up all right so um call on the question on item nine this is to assign the planning and zoning board to review the city coding yes votes gets disassigned with in details to come later adam clark council member swope aye council member aki aye councilmember gattis aye council member shirley aye vice mayor gunn aye mayor amanda hi so uh it's six to zero and the um planning board will now review this but nothing to do right yet just wait one month and we're going to give you a copy of this charter which will have much more detail on it and then we look forward to it and again thank you to everybody who's on that committee for the hard work i know this is not an easy thing to go through okay item 10 was withdrawn by vice mayor glenn we move on to item 11. everybody's okay it's 10 7 17. we're moving along here so i'm 11 is consideration of resolution 2020-18 a resolution of the city council of the city of delaware beach florida providing for adoption of administrative policy number 15 regarding to fema policy number 104-008-03 february 2020 providing for incorporation of recitals providing for the repeal of all resolutions in conflict herewith and establishing an effective date will someone bring a motion please absolutely thank you second jodi shirley robin hockey um joey shirley i'm going to defer to lynn is pretty standard policy i think that fema yeah this is uh uh fema uh has changed some rules and they want us to uh we either had to pass a administrative policy and that's what was recommended by uh florida department of emergency management to do this to uh because it encompasses only 100 square foot it's it's really just addressing the accessory structures which are sheds and that's all we have we don't have any mobile homes in the other policies so based on what i got from rebecca quinn and the emergency management in tallahassee she sat back and recommended that we adopt this policy as an administrative policy at some point if we need to adopt more flood regulations then we may incorporate it into that but just moving forward crs is changing some of the rules over the next few months uh one of them you know they're requiring that foot of freeboard which the city doesn't require it but the florida building code does and i hope everyone knows what i'm talking about freeport it's a foot above the base flood elevation when you build your home so there's there's some things that are going to change and this is one of the things and fema is allowing us to adopt it as a policy as opposed to changing the ordinance at this point so what i'm asking you to do is adopt this policy and we'll put it in the administrative policies and they're changing that i know what freeboard is i just built the house a few years ago but what's the story with the elevations i mean it's been two years are they still talking about it here because the floodplain maps were supposed to change so where are we at congress not any further than we were they did send an email i want to say it's probably within the last 45 days to ask us if we're open because they're getting ready to publish the final one there were some appeals you know of course we didn't appeal anything because actually our elevations by the flood maps are going to drop now oldsmar got the other end of the stick and they did some appealing so i expect them to start advertising that final thing and i i'm guessing just march april it'll the process hopefully will be over with okay last year the year after i think i think what happened is because of the pandemic and everything kind of shut down they just didn't go forward with anything i think they're constantly changing and then there is new building code coming out in january too so you're going to need to get on your toes on that too yeah well they'll that fema is you know gotten to the point where we're class six well if you don't adopt their policy than your class a if you don't have a foot of free board we follow the forward building note then we're a class a these are just new rules and they haven't got clarity from the florida department of emergency management that's not gotten clarity from fema they're they're asking a lot of questions it just makes it so much more difficult when you start adding free board to it and then not dropping the elevation i mean you could wind up building the same type of foundation if they would just do it all at once but no you know they're doing it the hard way and for somebody who's building right now that you wind up having to go up higher and then they're going to change it on you you know six months later so yeah i've told anybody that's come in to talk to us about building i've told them you know this could change in six months and the height could drop because that's a lot of money when you're putting them in and here in bel air beach in a lot of places it's going to drop two feet council do we have any other questions for lynn or on this proposal i'll open it up to the city john hansen john hanson 22nd street valley beach i'm trying to understand this conversation when you're talking about freeboard is this for new construction yes now what about sheds because i read that back here the the maximum is 100 square feet which is the current city code anyway so is that also implying that going forward no it has to be oh this is considered an accessory structure what they're talking about free board is a residence is what a residence it's foundation for a new residence oh okay okay we're talking about two different things and this is the only thing the city of belarus beach has is authorized as an accessory structure business shed we don't have any you can't have a pagoda you can't have any of that stuff okay and mr mayor if i made a point of information could we have council members speak directly into the microphone i'm having difficulty hearing the conversations and i'm sure people behind me are also having the same issue thank you i'll remind everyone thank you mr hansigan that comes out on the tape so um i'm not picking on you dave but i'm looking at yours and that's not going to pick up on the tape you have to be like two inches away and i think that goes for all of us so just almost be right on top of the mic these are very sensitive only when you're on top of them so thank you now any other citizens wish to address us on this issue coming back to council then with jody shirley having the last word okay okay oh so let me call the question then so before us is the consideration of resolution 2020-2000 all right let me say that right consideration of resolution 20 2018 a resolution of the city council of the city of bellaire beach florida providing for adoption of administrative policy number 15 regaining regarding relating to fema policy number 10408-03 february 2020 providing for incorporation of recitals providing for the repeal of all resolutions in conflict herewith and establishing an effective day yes vote will pass that madam clerk council member shirley aye council member swope aye council member aki aye councilmember gattis aye vice mayor gunn i'm mayor manzo all right so it passes six to zero lynn would you please let fema and the folks know on that okay i don't know that takes care of most of the regular gen we move into the standard items unfinished business do we have anyone with unfinished business i have one item and uh jody i'm gonna remind you of an item that was you had brought up at the last meeting um let me do yours first uh you had um brought up an issue and it didn't get answered later on the work session about short-term condo rentals and you had a question about that so i noticed it in the minutes and i just wanted to remind you thank you did you raise that yeah um i didn't know if it was addressed in the work session i didn't see any comments in there but um my question was along the lines of the fact that we do not allow short-term rentals yet most the condos have short-term runs the beach is full of vacationers that are staying on bellair beach and i'm not if it's a city code that should supersede the condo documents as far as i'm concerned but clearly there's some discrepancy and this is an ongoing issue and i know because i walk the beach bel air into the beach every week and it's full of vacationers and they are all staying at the condos along the beach so it seems we have a conflict in our code and it's an issue i think the code actually permits it for the condos officially and i know they're doing it short term but yet we're prohibited i know fred reilly at some point you and i were talking you know months back and i think i mentioned to you i said how is it that someone you know my house is 2 000 square feet let's say you have a 2000 square foot condo how is it that you can rent your condo but i can't rent my house short term and i think i think that's an issue and i think it should just be across the board no short-term rentals i mean we're a residential community we're not and to me what happens is if you take a residential property and all of a sudden you allow the guy next door to rent their home as an airbnb you've just allowed them to operate a commercial business in a residential setting that is a residential property and they are competing with the hotel rooms up on clearwater beach it's it's the same thing yet we allow it to happen on our beach it's a problem it's a problem and we need to talk about it and i mean it's we've talked about this since the first day i was on council and no one's done anything about it it keeps getting pushed down the road but we can't talk about short-term rentals we're not talking about changing our policy on short-term rental we're talking about enforcing it on all properties on baltimore beach how do we do that maybe it's a subject for a work session but it's gotta hit the work session i i agree that and and i think it's so you start getting into this equal protection issue here too because again a few thousand square footer is a two thousand square footer or fifteen hundred or whatever i don't see the difference okay um the other thing i'll add to totally support your point uh councilman charlie as i look at the police reports and stuff most of the action when we have problems it's up in the condos it's it's we've had so many things with domestic violence and things like that that don't necessarily show up in the felonies and stuff like that but it's up there because i think again you're getting short-term people and you know lord knows what else is going on with you know parties and things like that but i'm sure there's you know i'm sure the police can tell us too the sheriff can tell us so um mr i i i think it is a topic but i think again maybe we got to get it on the next one because if it's been going that long you're going on three years that you've waited long enough so mayor our our code that talks about short-term rentals is for residential low it's not for residential media and that's what the difference is the code that was established when and and i don't have the exact data was established for short-term rentals but it at the time it only applied to residential homes you know our a single family single family home that's all i would like um and my understanding is the condo docks have different rules for them that they've established you know as far as time things of that nature now i'm not saying we couldn't look deeper into that and maybe create something separate but you know i've warned you don't touch that ordinance it's the short term round because once you do then your grandfather clause is gone as well what i brought to the council last time was the um again i'm not saying it passes legal muster but apparently the indian shores put a lot of money and a lot of lawyer time into they also have a grandfathered short-term rental thing and they said how can we clean it up for some of the problems they were having and they did have a workaround that their attorneys thought worked for them again i don't it hasn't been challenged i don't think yet in court but i i don't know that it's nothing that you know we shouldn't look at i'm just wondering you know i know you say residential lower but as i look at i said what's the difference really i mean you know the square footage is the square footage and i mean it may even be smaller square footage there and we're saying to a homeowner we don't want it i understand you know but you know you can't rent but you can rent and you've got the same properties i mean hell they may even have a bigger property and they're allowed to rent well because of writing to chores whatever you said anything you were saying uh in looking at that further what they attempted to do is not so much deal with the residential they attempted to control more evidently they've got a lot of high-rise condos and you know i don't know exactly so what they did is they created songs or they have zones so they put stipulations so that may be a way to look at this further and i'll have to have some discussions or maybe we even look at zoning and planning and go okay these guys are operating as hotels maybe they are hotels and maybe we charge them a higher tax base because they're hotels they're operating as hotels we're not collecting the tax as a commercial property as such i mean you know if we're gonna allow it we may as well get the tax base for it fred i'm not looking for an answer tonight but i just i think you know it's johnny shirley's point i'll just give you a couple comments um one there's two different zoning classifications so that in and of itself establishes a distinction between the two and if one of them is regulated for short term and the other is not which is my understanding then you know there there's two different schemes going on the thing that i would question with respects of the condos is when when were the condos created when were the declaration created and what rules did they have in place and then where in the scheme or where in the timeline did the um you know the regulation related to short-term rentals take place and that you know it's one of those things that it's um i hate the phrase sticky wicket but that's what it is you have to look at a lot of different things the um that the mayor provided us that discussed this the changes made in another community they they went to i would say great links to try and very clearly regulate in a way that did not conflict with the statutory preemption provision and that's essentially what they did in another community and they they increase the regulation if that's something you'll want to to consider that that probably is a really good model to start with but i i will agree with lynn um you know you you can make changes to it if if your risk adverse the safest things do nothing and that's that's what you should ultimately consider but it's one of those things i really think you would need to look at a lot of different parts in order to adjust the rubik's cube and make sure you're on on sound footing before you consider anything i think to your point i mean i think indian rocks wound up losing their grandfathering and i think it became an absolute unmitigated disaster we want to talk so it i mean i i'm i'm liking some a lot of what i'm hearing but also you know we're playing a little bit of a risk of figurist here so um probably something to talk about at a work session but i think to councilman shirley's point it's been i'm sorry glenn you were next you're next you're next this time um i think we get it on the next session or as quickly as we can i'm sorry glenn oh it sounds like a good task for your new planning and what i would say to that is yeah this has been around for a long time and we've been kicking it down now you know risk averse is one end of a continuum and yeah i don't think we're necessarily exactly there i think we're dependent on you to say okay this is how far you can go up to that line and not close the wrath of the uh changing all that's the grandfather stuff so i guess maybe you can tag a team with the plan in your zoning board and kind of give us some options here how far can you push something like that without necessarily overstepping the probability that you're going to incur the wrath of the legislature in response to the point you're making i'm not telling you i'm not i'm so risk adverse the answer is always no that's not what i'm telling you the the statute statutory preemption goes to the duration and whether you can have habit or not you can't prohibit it or you you but you can do other things and that's what they did in the other city is they regulated it in a different manner and how how successful they'll be with it who knows they they may be a test case you never know i'm just saying to you i've looked at it enough and lynn and i've talked about it several times it would pay to look at it very hard before you ever enacted anything i have a i have a possibly dumb question but since they're considered two separate entities single home versus condos could you have two separate whatever so you leave the housing grandfather one alone and then something new is created for the condos separate from the house so you don't monkey with this is that a possibility i have no idea it potentially is because you're you're addressing a situation in a different zoning classification whereas before you you had never regulated it in in any manner okay so that's potentially a possibility leave the housing alone so we don't mess up the grandfathering or monkey with that and do something completely new for the condos is that a slight workaround potentially i don't like the phrase work around because i don't really yeah whatever i understand why it's used but um to me it's too close to circumvent and circumvent the law is not a particularly good thing or whatever the proper terminology is well again it is but i'm just you know it it's something that merits a lot of um [Music] consideration in order to make sure you remain in the safe harbor that's that's really what i'm saying can we bring this to the next work session so that we can get the ideas down so that we can tell our city attorney so that he can i i feel like you're also getting into planning board i mean this is this is definitely in their ballpark to consider but i think it will be helpful if you had some incredible ideas and i think let's get that over to them and say okay here's what we're trying to do it's our christmas list we may not get everything on it we may not get anything on it but here's what we'd like to see if there is a way to make it happen you know i understand fred i mean that's a risk that's where we have to make the hard decisions as the council and say do we want to i'm not going to use the term roll the dice but take the chance on this thing okay and we do it with the best lawyer we can get which is you and we you take your advice and go with it somebody may challenge it no one may challenge it we'll see how it goes or we may do nothing so we'll see what happens but i think it does bear addressing if you waited two and a half years i think you've been patient enough um i had one other item and mr riley i think you addressed it but i didn't have a chance to read it because it came out as i was coming over here and it was regarding this legal situation with adatrez and it looks as if you have contacted the returning but i don't know if you need to say anything else more i know you issued a memo i didn't even know see if it went to all the council or not but that was only just was that going to get taken care of it looks like it has i didn't issue a memo i i wrote an email that went to uh lynn patty and yourself and the short wars and i was going to say something about it um i wasn't going to use names that i'll be purposely and he used it last time so it's your choice i'll choose differently but the um i spoke to her attorney and he was unaware of any issue and in the discussion i told them that the tone of the voice messages that were left and said if there's an issue that comes forward in the future please call me and we will do our best to try and resolve it and he agreed that that would be the way to go forward wonderful there has been no further messages since the last content that's all i had does anybody else have any unfinished business then we'll move over to you mr riley say your training no further comments from the city manager just a few things to let you know i i put at your place because i got it just today the duke invoice or the estimate for gulf boulevard that'll be coming to you in the next month the penny for money the mayor executed last month and the county executed it within the last week to 10 days because we just got it back so we'll be starting to accumulate some money but the price of that is about 10 000 and there's i think we have 77 000 that was left over from the last penny that we need to use by 20 end of 20-21 so we might as well use that money first and move forward uh we started the beach walkovers so those four excesses were tearing them out and putting new in 7th and 8th street is going to start the first of december we had our pre-construction meeting last week and we'll be sending a letter to the homeowners on those streets to let them know that there's going to be some construction there the tennis courts out here will be closing right around the 1st of december we're going to take the fence out and then shortly after that so they'll be down about 60 days per estimate um the audit has started the stormwater bond validation we've been past the 30-day period there were no appeals uh chris talked to me last week he's we're going to start working on the minimal loan that we have to to buy those uh check valves uh that was part of the validation requirement so we will be bringing that to you the park and rent board chairman they're having a meeting on the 4th she talked to me about having a tree lighting of the same day as a council meeting on the 7th at 5 o'clock and we'll just have some hot chocolate cookies or something here but does the console have any issue with that before the next concert meeting and i'll pass that on to them they're having to be we'll confirm that and we've held up on the city news until after we talked to them and you tonight because we would have sent it out already but we're going to send it out after if the console doesn't have any issue with that then we'll go forward with tree lighting is that the only day the only reason i'm saying it's nice that we're all here but it's just nice it's also in a ceremony like that to have the opportunity to say hello to the citizens people come out spend a little time with them and i feel that if we do this we're going to be very much limited because we've got to come back in here so i mean any other day probably than that but it's that's just my feeling if everybody else is good with it i'll be certainly there either way but yes they were trying to do something simple you know they were concerned that they couldn't get the people out if they did it but at least if there's a consul meeting an hour before you'd have some legal time and you would do so i think it's a good day i mean i don't i for me it works well to be here just an hour early but that would just be my my input is is that i think it uh coincides with you've got residents coming in maybe they're you know you'll get a better turnout i don't know just my dog i'd i would like to speak as well i'm concerned about the city hosting anything like that i mean we just shut down that garage sale because of corona virus and potentials they got sick that they come after that type of deal so i'd be concerned about having sitting by this event the numbers haven't went down and um you know kelsey and the doctor often spread served any kind of hope of people getting exposed and the dangers so i don't think the city should open up to any other type of event until we could just put other stuff under control and ask the citizens what they want this was approved before but it was approved before coronavirus so i'm not going to say that that's binding on us i mean we can do what we want we have a special meeting before the next uh work session have a quick vote on it if we want but i think we would need their recommendation parks board recommendation as to dates alternatives again either way it doesn't matter we can do it before i'm not gonna not be there because it's five o'clock that's fine um but councilman slope has a point that needs to be discussed i think with the council right now so but not today you know but i think then yes so well my concern is if we aren't going to have time to advertise it if we don't do it shortly i mean you're doing two weeks with the what's our work session 16th 16th that gives a three-week notice yeah that seems fair okay then we'll just hold the city news until that point okay uh after they have their meeting tomorrow right so they'll let us know uh wednesday excuse me i told you about the bond validation the code report patty sent out the code officer gave it to us today and you know i want to let everyone know del oro beach got another first we're the first city to get our certificate of safety excellence from the florida league of cities and i want to thank patty and kyle they worked with the gentleman and it was kind of nice to find out that we were the first city in florida that even attempted to do that so that's a good thing i got that information what this what can you explain just for everyone here and for our exactly it's a safety initiative by the florida league cities uh they had some protocols that you had to follow and they came in last thursday or thursday and did a walkthrough checked off that we had policies in place and procedures and things of that nature and uh they sent us an email today to tell us that we were the first city that's another good thing those cities out there trying to participate in the 40 league and we you know we get about 1500 in grant money back from them for safety things and safety gear for the staff so we applied for that every year also and what i have for the work session i've got forward pinellas schedule okay and that's been confirmed it's for november 16. uh mayor i heard you say you would like the sheriff's office here it doesn't look like that's going to be necessary based on what our citizen has said so i let's just hold that aside and i'll let you know how things progress after election day uh we'll have a discussion on condo rentals uh we'll look for if you've got any changes or things you think we need to look at in the code please let me know so we can adjust that charter and we'll have that final and draft form for you uh [Music] contemporary did i miss anything if we're taking the sheriff off for now he's obviously anything else so we've got one two three items actually i mean if you watch the election results tomorrow but if that meant that that passes uh for changing the charter with regard to robertsville's order then a nice discussion from the council as to how they would like you know what we'd like to do let's get the ideas out well we'll just put uh vice mayor is that okay we'll just put this item and transfer it to the workstation yes it could be it'll be part of that i think it's absolutely part of it because you can change ordinances so unfortunately we have the rules what was the outcome of the uh the anchored boats oh [Music] i've talked to clearwater about it clearwater does not do anything with anchored boats it's a florida fish and wildlife and part of the reason is they don't have any what they call submerged lands that they own and for the most part all florida wildlife commission does is if it becomes a derelict boat then they will board it and then have ceto towed away but the city of clearwater doesn't do anything with it i spoke to their arbor master and even the guy that does the merino cross just to make sure they were both telling me the same story madeira beach i talked to them also and they don't have a boat to do any enforcement the sheriff does it for them basically the same thing if it's a derelict boat they will go out there but the way their ordinance reads it's if you've got your boat anchored here and the water shifts it to here the the hour time changes uh because it's not the same place that's that's what they told me the guy at the arena there and he said but it it does take care of daryl and books the boat you and i saw out here that was reported to the sheriff at this point nothing's been done about it but it was reported actually prior to our trip uh and from what i'm talking about councilmember gaddis uh took me on a speedboat ride i had my seatbelt on but we we spent about two and a half three hours we went through the whole city and i've got a lot of pictures and i'm working on a map to try to because you're looking at a house from behind and you you may not hit the right house so you got to do some verification there because you don't want to walk up to somebody and say hey your dog's messed up and they've got a beautiful dog out there so i want to thank you for that and it's greatly appreciated and we'll move forward and keep doing that and one last thing the sea wall on they sure they're actually working on it and i'd say about 50 to 60 percent of the piles are in the ground so and hopefully that gets resolved with the owners uh and the buyer there is a buyer i don't know where it's at so that's all i have can i just back to the boat thing the boat question and i kind of put that on this the code review that was one of my items was to address those items but um don't we have the rights to uh do we have aren't we allowed to monitor the waterways 25 feet out or something or what is that i mean it doesn't have to be our submerged land if they're anchoring off and i understand clearwater doesn't do anything it's clear because there are not only derelict boats but have some boats all up and down the causeway now because i think saint peter or someone in madeira beach someone's chasing them out so they're wrong yeah they're all heading up this way we have two uh right off the northern side of the causeway here that clearly they're not disposing of their waste properly i think we've talked about this before i know that in key west they are required to take their boat in and have it pumped out and have a pump out receive you know every so often there's a whole series of things they do to make sure those boats are no longer becoming derelict in key west and that's a good area to look at because there's a lot they have sailboat road down there where there's boat after boat after boat that's half sunk and they've cleaned them out so just fyi that was one of my items on the code enforcement and we need to talk about what our jurisdiction is and what we have the right to you know how far outcome we go and impose a code if we have it in place okay well noted so okay that's all i have at least i have something for you and um it's uh it's pretty serious um i was approached wednesday of last week by citizen uh and i was approached by another citizen and probably about 30 citizens with regard to the 6th 312th street 19th street and morgan street beaches and apparently there has been maintenance but it's beyond maintenance it's been a mass cutting of the vegetation on the sand dunes um you and i had an email on it i believe it was our city workers that did that um i think there's been over 100 complaints to florida dep at this point is what i was told um and it's quite serious apparently um it does not look as if the permit was obtained and it looks as if improper vegetation was removed which makes it potentially a very serious offense i know they're very concerned about it there's complaints i have complained there are other citizens that have complained so much so that dep has asked me to tell the city they got the message it's under investigation but i wanted to ask you what's happening here because we have um those things i went out there on sunday and i was in tears well clearly the three beach accesses those have been trimmed long before i came here every year uh they they've trim them they clean they aren't tearing any plants out the root things are still there they're just cutting the tops off cleaning all the dead out taking the trash because they're basically trash catchers and that's been done for many many years how long i can't tell you i can tell you that it was done before i came here and it just continued the state statute says if it's private or public owned land which those are that you can maintain them now i will admit that the employees went a little too far especially at 19th street sixth street they didn't go any further than the sequal 12th street there may be a little encroachment but not much 19th street they they got a little overzealous maybe they were tired or something i'm not real sure but uh we've discussed it and you know we'll talk to dep and explain that i think people at first thought they were mangroves well there's no mangroves growing on the ocean side because it's dry land the mangroves were over here unless they're somehow you know along a rock barrier typically so we will have that discussion with the county and dep just to clarify and they will come back like they do every year you know they're not dead and they weren't destroyed uh you know they're just the so they're not i know one person to talk to me about it they're they're tearing the plants out well no they're not the plants are not and next spring they'll be thrown back and then somebody will come and say are you going to clean the trash out the sand spurs and all this so that's what's been happening uh if the state tells us not to do it anymore we'll stop doing it i think the law that you're relying upon part the law that you're relying upon is not necessarily correct it says that but that's for private property there's tons yeah it goes with the construction control line and the construction control line is laid right before most of those dunes most of those dunes are on the seaward side and when it goes to the seaward side a permit is going to be required so this is where the investigation comes in with them i can tell you if it turns out that a permit was required and wasn't obtained we're in a heap of trouble as a city okay that's going to have to all be replanted and they're not going to say it's going to come back my understanding and speaking with them is that in lieu of criminal charges in lieu of significant fines there would be consent orders and replanting and not replanting with seedlings but replanting with mature plants so i think it's significant i think it's serious and i looked at the control lines based upon the tax assessor stuff they're going to use much much more detailed maps and stuff but i i it may not be as easy as what you just mentioned and i'm not so sure that whatever legal advice you received in the past is correct it's um that's not private property it's that's that's that secret of the construction control line you can see those lines as you if you drop the maps over i didn't they you can't go by a tax assessor's map because it's not to scale they have the real stuff um but i think 19th i think morgan um clearly well over uh you're right i think 12 there's a portion of it that got cha chip but i think it's one of those things that any portion of you can't even pick a co and the cos are obliterated at this point so um i got a lot of complaints um this dp's got a lot of complaints i'm just alerting you alerting this city um we may have some problems okay and uh so let's be careful with what we have here and please do not disturb that stuff until we get that ruling coming in here it's very very significant very significant yeah they're not they're they're not doing anything else there's nothing left but i just don't just don't touch anything right now i think until they get back with us i i think the initial word is there's a problem so can i just ask i know from doing beach cleanup that is where most the trash is and trying to clean it out is very difficult and you know i'm constantly walking the beach and picking up trash so that that is the trash collector i'm not saying that that made it okay but but i do know there was a time there wasn't a sealed on that beach and you guys have done a wonderful job planning them so thank you for keeping them and maintaining them um because there have been you know there was time when you had nothing but saying that there was nothing out there so um i'm i find it curious that there are plenty of houses along belarus shores that they're sea oats and then behind a house there's not a stitch of anything someone's out there cleaning them out that is not what we did we did a little trimming like cutting the grass sort of thing so you know i support you and i just would say that you know just get some some get someone from dep to tell you it's okay and you know we just continue with whatever they say maintenance should be yeah and don't get i mean i don't think we need to make a big deal out until we know for sure that it's a problem or not a problem right it's a problem and they'll be in contact with you pretty much don't worry i i have spoken with them and apparently about 100 other people apparently it's happened in indian rocks too which is actually you know i'm not sure what's going on here but they were they just said to the citizens that have wrote to them or spoke to him thank you very much it is being investigated um and the information will come out and we'll get the reports and then we're going to have to act upon it but um just let's make sure we're on top of it and take care of whatever problems we're going to have i i do think we have some rocky road to traverse here okay that's all i have in the question yes david lynn is there any possibility that maybe we could get some official training for the city's employees so that they know what to do and it's it's not questionable in that way there's no one could say i didn't know anything yeah like i said you know i looked at it this morning and they went out a little too far on 19th street i'm not debating that sixth and twelve six they didn't go out anywhere six doesn't go past the seawall because it doesn't uh twelve there's a little hump uh but not too much uh probably a couple feet maybe uh and i think we have to define because you know i have people that say well you can't cut co2 yeah you can cut sea oats if it's as long as it's a lie behind the erosion control level in front of the erosion control line you can cut them to six feet behind them i can take them to the ground mangroves a different story i can cut them to six footer but if they're ten foot high it will only take 25 percent off of them so there's all kinds of nuances here and we just need to we'll talk to the environmental people of pinellas county and ep and figure out what we need to do or not and you know if they've got an issue what they would do in most cases i would think is they'll work with us to correct the problem and if they tell us not to pet them anymore then at some point in time you might as well take the benches out because you'll never see the ocean again instead just spread it and that's what the probably the reason it was always trimmed because i've heard comments about that that yes we want you to trim them and clean out the garbage i know the first year i was here within a week they were trimming them and i recollect taking out just a sixth street four or five trash bags full of garbage different seaweeds because people just throw their trash in there what do they trim with how do they cut that stuff down well i can tell you what we use we used uh it's like a little chainsaw that you trim but it's you know it just shaves it off i think what they used was uh they probably used that and looking at them some of them they probably used to weed either they look like they're really you know kind of i don't know mushrooms if you will you know they're they're black from the top so grab one uh i was just going to ask is this one of those instances where it's best for us to confess up and ask for the mere culpa rather than wait for them to pay us a visit with the 60 minutes camera crew i mean hey you know we messed up we've re we've instituted some training for our people this is our get well plan and maybe that's what you do glenn absolutely yeah it's always better to better forgiveness right now than to have them come after you because um it can be ugly very ugly like fifteen thousand dollars a day ugly so i read as well uh yes is there any way that uh we can get copies of the complaints so we can actually see what uh who complained and how many will get a better career yeah you can make your public records requested make your public records across the florida dep okay yep anything else for the city manager any questions from this uh city okay uh city clerk no nothing i think city council comments here of november we start with rita's vote i don't have any additional comments thank you dave janice um not really anything uh beyond uh what lane and i saw as we toured the sea laws they're not as bad as we were led to believe i they're there are definitely some sea walls that need work but it's not an epidemic thank you for taking the tour um you need the mayor to come out and confirm anything for a speed vote right down that's fine too jody's really good uh just a couple of things when we were recognizing vets there are several other vets in the room glenn lynn rhonda schweer was here um just i don't know anyone else just i know it's veterans day november 11th and thank you all for serving um appreciate it and um that and just thanks for coming out guys appreciate it thank you jodie um quick question when you did your speed boat ride were you guys looking at docks too because i know there's a few messed up dogs you guys may know to them okay perfect you got a picture of yours there were mine's beautiful if there's anything stuck under it from a dock nearby there were there were a few but uh for the most part the ones that uh i remember being so bad most of them have been taken out they're still warranty stragglers and then you've got some that are in pretty good shape but maybe their rails are hanging a little bit things like that but mostly we focused on uh potential of debris falling into the water which is way more of a hazard than a sea wall issue is so i i would say we we actually look pretty good compared to something a lot of pictures did you see the one that i had talked to you about uh that was like three down for me i was impressed yes um other than that no comments thank you thank you robin three issues uh in in the interest of best practices i'm kind of stumied by the protocol for voting is a roll call required what what is a roll call required pretty much on any um any resolutions or pretty much anything other than like you know you want to take a break or you want to adjourn and stuff like that but generally when we have to get each person's boat on the record we have to take roll call though i think patty knows the routine on that too but pretty much anytime you're doing a resolution or an ordinance well i mean those are specific examples like when it is required but my question is do we take that to an extreme practice seems like there's a lot of things we can do here administratively all in favor i oppose i got no i have no problem if we you know if we get that blessing we can do it and that might be something we have to take a look at on our ordinance though i'm not i don't have it memorized but i think there was there's a very definite i think we have a very definite thing when we have to do it and it's pretty much you've got to do it on mostly no resolutions i know uh boards and committee ballots are absolutely correct okay we could speed it up there's no problem can i add to that it seems to me that whenever anything that normally we could just do in everyone's eye if it's something that someone is passionate about they seem to uh want a record that's i i know joshua another thing best practice uh we're again tasking the planning and zoning board i think we as a council we've all seen the benefits from a budget and finance committee code review committee communications committee and the list goes on and we we're about to test the planning zoning board for a second time i want to plan a seat and maybe it's time to create a standing advisory committee for the council the authority to do it is in section 6.01 paragraph b and it can be done by ordinance for a long-term standing one or a resolution for a temporary one but create a standing advisory or a committee for the council and also for the benefit of the city staff and city manager then we can test from time to time on issues on demand five to seven members various backgrounds two to three years i mean but i mean we can get rid of a lot of the redundancy start advertising for people we have a selection process and we have an orientation and then you go through all the normal dynamics of team building and that sort of thing and maybe if we had five or seven people that on demand hey we need your help and advice and consent and recommendations on this maybe it's time to do that you know i'm going to throw myself in the blades and say i'll work with the city manager on developing this troll man concept there just like the drift it's interesting idea so yes please feel good and and lastly i i raised the issue about the uh the process for the reappointment of those those planning and zoning board members i again we're going to take a look at it but i would like to see perhaps a a process where work gets out a little bit more i think we've seen a little more interest from the residents and boards and committees and my fear is that when these are coming up well it's just kind of worrying about they're getting towards the idea okay so it's at the appointment rather than put the word out there saying we're looking for more people who are genuinely interested you know i'm looking for motivation innovative thought i i have a fear that some of these things have been around for so long they're getting stagnant so that's the only reason that's it that's all i thank you glenn if you don't buy them in a second that uh i'll come back to you we're past city attorney but i can do you have something you want to add before yes sir section 7.0 or excuse me 2.07 d of the city charter says voting on voting on ordinances and resolutions shall be by roll call and recorded by the city clerk in the official minutes of the meeting again if we get you know i'm telling you how to vote tomorrow but if you give us that latitude your point can be addressed by us um so i'm going to echo your point here um i think that um you know we let's try and follow our best practices the advisory committee is not a bad idea and i think it's something that let's get it out there and get that you know get a discussion here but um to have a standing committee when these quick things come up that we need to be tasking so we don't have to sit here and you know spend a little more time with it too because we're we're doing quite a bit so i think it's a good idea um i don't have a lot for us um when i acknowledge the veterans it wasn't to single out too i just happened to see them in the audience and i asked them to do it but i know lynn reeves and glenn gunn wanda schweer and anyone else again anyone who served it i said it before anyone who has served served in the past and no longer with us as to honor every veteran okay that's why this country is where it is we thought we thought some horrendous wars and they're the ones who are on the part line for us so thank you from bel air beach i wish we had a way of doing a ceremony in our city but um we're gonna just thank you okay um tomorrow well before i do that leslie detero asked me with regarding um the pre-recording uh john this thursday is a service for mr carrigan it is at the hubble funeral home is that it it's just a visitation visitation and you know what time it starts it's four to six four to six okay so four to six at the uh hubble theater on the one here on indian rocks road right yeah okay so if anyone would like to attend that to honor him that would be nice i think that would be great um and uh lastly i think it's been said by mr hansig and i'm gonna echo it tomorrow is election day we have a lot of stuff that affects our city that's on the ballot um we have a lot of stuff that affects our country so please get out there and study it and vote and uh and we all be better for it i thank everyone who came out tonight it's nice to do this in person it's been a long time so thank you all for coming out and take an interest in your stay in your government here with that i will ask for a motion to adjourn and a second okay i'm glad we're not going to do a roll call all in favor all right anyone opposed there's never been somebody who opposed it have a good night everyone enjoy thanks"
