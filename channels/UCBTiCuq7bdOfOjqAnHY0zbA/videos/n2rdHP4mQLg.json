    "transcript": "we'll call the meeting to order the final meeting of this committee on the zone i certainly hope uh first time is the approval of the agenda [Music] approval the minutes of the 24th supplied to us all those in fact motion care the discussion of the science city coach sections and the review of the approval of the final report are kind of joined together here all right pat okay so what we'll do is go through [Music] i'm sure vita read it and i have to compliment penny and wanda this it's extremely easier to read than a damper so i'll start with rudy on my right and see if there's anything that you have anything particular to discuss it there were a couple things i wrote patty and asked her to add to page three yep page three where it addresses uh my suggestions and on item two where it says determinable expertise is required to correctly identify and understand those codes code infractions and decide if current staff and or contractors have that expertise i just wanted to put in parentheses after that sentence eg example given uh sea walls and docks because we're discussing some required expertise that isn't in a typical staff so you want to put that in the firmware but won't you rudy yeah i'm going to add to the end of number two on page 3 and 14 at the end of that sentence the period g period docks um the rest of the document i bought was no problem with anything there were just a couple of points that i noticed there were you know several items where you were going to supply some text yeah i went through wanda and mark that up some of that stuff that you were you made about me before that talks about me supplying something right i need to have that discussion with the city attorney finally okay all right that's fine so for the for the final should i just remove the highlighting on those say it again i can't understand it so for the final that goes to council should we remove the highlighting on those paragraphs those bullet points yeah once it's all done remember and we had some discussion on the isr ratio and again you were working on that my point being that if you're trying to up and down the streets especially belle iowa that homes are already in place and we're talking everywhere you see one of the new big box homes we had a knockdown or new home go up they've already put in the circular driveway paper ride weights that far exceed the 65 percent for the isr at 65 percent ratio they're close to 80 90 of that so the question i guess for council is is that the new belair beach and we need to allow that because we're certainly obviously asking for it um and that's you know the higher bias the heart it's probably more logical just to say um on the front that you cannot pay her into the side setbacks right yeah and isr the right-of-way doesn't count in that kind of star so right away the first 50 feet that doesn't count in the appraiser and they'll say they've got 3 700 3 700 square feet of living's area and they're using that and it's a two-story house well that's not correct in the effect of the isr it's really 1850 because it's two stories and so there we just recently had two or three of them that have come in with the wrong numbers and we told them to come back and when they do that and take the right away out of it in some cases well actually the last two or three it's changed it for them they've been back down to where they should be okay but i'll give you an example there's a house over here on the 12th of the bay this guy didn't get a permit he didn't do anything and he put a stop work order on him and he's basically paving his whole well we told him to stop work he just he lives on our part of this house so we're going to have a battle with him i'm sure i mean he was going to put it line where do you think we need staying just the isr is okay as is well i i think in today's situation i think it needs to go up a little bit but you need to verify a little more of that with what the county and the flood and see what right right so i think we talked about that one we did and i made a note but i didn't i didn't think i got it in here rudy do you remember what uh section and paragraph the isr was in because i've got a note to recommend to review the isr requirement and um definitions right there and enhance the code for artificial oh and the yeah yeah we have some definitions of 94 and then there are a couple other places in the code that as the isr but the definition is in 94. i think we just need to run a little more background research on it overall okay see if there's any other implications that can hurt us like for our flood insurance all right and then the other thing that i thought was still open discussion was we had started talking about astroturf logs and decided let's go take a look at what was going on in harrison and uh that plastic earth was greatly improved over the old stuff he used to put out on your patio i thought we had an expert in the city on belle isle and i had to run across his wife when we were walking today and i asked her he was in the astroturf business she said no he's in sport in the sports industry and noticed the people in the astroturf industry but not himself so i thought we might have had an expert in the park may be able to get one that wasn't dead was it dead uh i don't know their names they live kind of right after the purple yeah two guns in jack's holes yeah right beside the gravel one yeah he runs a sports advisory group right now yeah so he would know he knows the people who are experts in astro pro if you ever want to have a conversation yeah i know so okay so it boils down to are we going to make any changes in uh well i think that you can have no astroturf or do we start a category where you can have it if we have to go through and set standards and everything else well i think that's what we were going to put in there and see what the city council uh i know just enhance the code for our but there are pros and cons obviously it's vastly different than the grass law and traditional lawn for instance mary says you'll never go to astroturf because the birds can't feed in it and that kind of thing but if you look at how much fertilizer runoff into the intracoastal would be saved if all of belair beach was astroturf would be significant how much reclaimed water would be saved it was all after be significant but it's a big issue in this we'd be rid of the uh road hazards with all of the heart lawn escaping landscaping companies no more landscapers no more lower well you couldn't say that they'd still be working on trees and yeah plant areas and that kind of thing but it would significantly reduce the time and need for it so it's something quite valuable it's a big question the council needs a value and as i mentioned view that's significant enough to me but i think you should go to some kind of vote by the resident of the city yeah if you can afford it it would be just think it would amortize itself out fairly quickly that's why i'd like to talk to an expert one because you know pervious question because you have to make it purpose and then what is the cost in house i know how much i spend a year actually every month on my life significantly well over two hundred dollars that's a pretty big estrogen but i'll never get it because marshall was gone shut overnight then just happened yeah the routine the grass and bertie would be gone the next day so the first one was section 54-153 about the homestead exemption i'm just not sure what we were saying where it said um city manager reeves will contact city attorney riley to provide updates from the election that was that was a november 2020 election we had we had a handful of um a constitutional amendments two of them dealt with homestead exemptions that would affect us and those need to be that needs to be reflected here is from the 2020 election general election yeah that's something for the city yeah i was curious though about the election so did they they were approved additional exemptions were approved criteria no no this was just uh if there's any additional things that we need to know that's all widows of disabled veterans and wasn't there something about law enforcement i forget yeah um and then it was just cross referencing uh section 10-77 on the suggestion to add invasive species and cross reference chapter 22 do we need to cross reference section 94-6 the landscaping requirements so they all read the same 94.6 i says add water conservation shall be achieved by the selection of appropriate plant materials the removal of nuisance and invasive vegetation so you're talking about landscape requirements shouldn't be referenced i mean so now i'll just say what yeah i agree with you okay but what ex what specifically do i need to be doing here you've got you've got it in there but but there's a cross-reference between the two of them it was 94.6 i think we were going to use the florida stateless difference didn't i get that in there this time yeah on 10-77 you've got it there but lynn provided me some wording for the uh florida state page 10 10 77 that's why i'm looking at the thing that that lynn gave me to make sure that i've gotten what he what we put in there yeah maybe maybe i didn't print out the plan it's there yeah florida state listed obnoxiously no it's not there it's it's right here it's not it's not on what you've got unless i've got the wrong copy here it is on 1077 it's on page 11. and i'm working from the wrong copy here okay is it different we can put it there i'm working from an [Music] refer back to it yeah all we were doing was trying to get an annotation and you had to use that listing to get somebody to remove something sure because right now the only real thing that's invasive poison ivy is uh brazilian pepper that's actually annotated so shouldn't 94-63 refer back to 10-77 yes that's what i was asking should they all match up okay thank you i'm just noticing that these section numbers are not in numerical order in some cases for instance 10 10-20 245 332 333 350 then 245 247 [Music] section 22 and section 10 and that those were i think those were the orders we discussed them in this is not the final grant no sweat still says draft then the uh the other one that i saw was just the sentence looks like it's cut off on section 10-88 that's page 11. it says in what time the containers is it should be removed it's probably not in the evening and removed in the morning or whatever now yeah i think that's a discussion as far as timeline console needs to decide i have no problem hearing everybody i said that's a uh set up by the garbage bin well no what i'm saying that city council needs to weigh in on that and say do we want a stipulated time or not what you've told them is should we no yeah okay so to complete the sentence and what time the planners should be removed well because the put out is already in the sentence may be put out at the curb at what time the container should be removed okay well you wrote it john it was criticism page 11. under section 30-52 instructor.org suggestion and replace or repair should have a permit i think there should be something in there about a major repair i mean there's times the window blows something off my dock and i'll just get a board and put it back on or whatever well what the county's code says for doc what what the county's code says for doc if it's structural repair so as an example if you're just putting a board on that's one thing if you're doing anything with the stringers or any of that or hope then you have to have a repair okay but shouldn't we say major repair rather repair itself as nebulous prepared to a structural minimum yeah maybe that's what you should say repair to a structural member member that that's probably that's a major repair right well not necessarily it could be one board but the county requires a permit well i know that but if you at least we can say major then whatever the hell the county says is fine we follow what they say yeah the suggestion should be change the wording to construct replace and or conduct a major repair or repair a structural member which one i would say keep it simple because we're going to follow the county code anyway construct replace and or undertake a major repair yes so move all right all those in favor all right so carey so major do you want to change the original motion i do all right would you like to make that motion i move that we add structural after the word major do i hear a second second all those in favor so carrie thank you the very last page section 20 94-251 defense's walls and hedges we eliminated the word galvanize somewhere else in the code why do we leave it here last page on fences walls and hedges and fabricated wood vinyl natural materials or galvanized well never should be eliminated [Music] this is a question are we talking about the regular chain-link fence right that's okay that's all i want to know what's your interpretation that's what i'm a city manager okay that was an observation yeah somebody took my sheet and shuffled on section 10 dash 32 page nine per minutes exemption we're accepting wallpaper over 100 under 100 drywall and drywall it says wallpapering and wall well the wallpapering is the issue i can't hear that the wallpaper isn't the issue it's the drywall that's the county code right put in more than 100 square feet replacement drywall you're supposed to have it but why should we have wallpaper in there is that necessary to have that you're gonna i can see some person wanting to read wallpaper somewhere looking at that and saying i need to permit the wallpaper no this is saying those are exempted from a permit that's the whole point of this that's what i'm asking the only thing we added really was the 100 square foot of drywall because that's the county's code the other stuff is already there so we're not changing anything all right thank you there anything else to come up under review and pro if anybody can all right is there any unfinished business uh we did have 94 161 i read that oh here it yeah is where did you have it laura i had it up to 161 but i don't know why 94-161 yeah i think we were going to add it there too because of the height is in there so it's going to be above the 161 so what are your specifically saying 161. i'll get the attorney to give us a definition for mockup i believe okay anything else under unfinished business let me just verify for uh 113 i don't think i have that in here anywhere i need to put that in and just say that we're deferring that to the reveal of the comprehensive plan yeah so anything further i guess the only question i have is how is this going to be present i mean this will be delivered to the council and just say you've read it any questions any comments thank you have a good evening yeah i mean unless you want to go live my life just say these are the recommendations of the planning zone forward i think what our board's going to do is okay we got a terrific draft now a final draft sent out and we can all peruse it and if anybody has any problems they can get back to patty express them but i think it'd be represented to the council right we don't have to beat our brains out any further and just say you've reviewed it any questions if not thank you refer to your congressman good luck acceptable to the board citizens comments where is marvin took the day off what i'd like to do as a citizen of the cc and chairman of the board here i'd like to thank everybody that the city people have 100 supported this committee lynn and mara and patty have shown their support to us as we have to them and i think if everything existed like this in the city we wouldn't have a heck of a lot of trouble i'm very proud of the board and their attendance and i appreciate everybody showing up giving your time and i'll call us for an adjournment so moved all those approved"
