can all be movable Parts but like for the most part like this is kind of what um we have um so park and rec board and all of the judges pretty much everybody there typically shows up in costume it's kind of this year I got I got the feedback that some of the uh some of the people that showed up at um Beach cleanup might not show up in costumes who oh Frank and Margie yeah yeah and possibly I think uh rich and I don't know whether they were in costumes last year or not they were High pictures what well like I said it's not mandatory but in the past everybody has shown up in costumes if you don't it's just something fun if you don't want to do it it's not stressful well I it says Park and W is supposed to show up so I'm going to I am I plan I'm wearing a costume okay I think I'm yeah yeah you're on here but I don't want to be the only one you're we'll all have costumes okay all right costume I'm wear hat H I'll wear hat you wear a hat yeah we all wear crazy glasses or something right you um so Deb is going to be in charge of the prizes and then we usually keep those inside just because it's like 450 bucks in Amazon gift cards and then um Deb and Michael are going to be taking pictures cuz we in the past you know you get they're so cute and you watch them and then everybody forgets to take pictures and then you know it's over and then you're like did anybody get pictures of the winter no so no pictures we're signing pictures I had a picture of finny well Co can we get it I'll send you that'd be great somebody took a picture of fny I know we did I took a picture thank you um but we didn't get pictures um the year before we didn't get picture of of the winner we didn't get pictures of all the winners together we're just going to be more diligent about the picture taking so I didn't say we didn't get any pictures we just didn't get all the right pictures that we needed post event um John is going to be handling the basically the refreshment table so the cooler with the bottled water and then the Halloween donuts that we're going to order pre-order at Publix um Patty is going to be in charge of putting out the dog treat basket and the dog water bowls um the music Patty's going to do the Halloween music and we're going to make sure the speaker and the mic are charge like the Friday before um playing the music on what what are we going to play the music on this phone phone and a yeah we got the speaker but just got Bluetooth from my phone or something yeah okay I mean I do have a couple of CDs with Halloween scary music I always used in my classroom but you know that's caveman style so yeah you got have the player to go with it's a lot ofing um so we're good there and then on Friday the day before we will set up on the 27th at 2:00 and you'll get an agenda just like you normally do because it has to be you know like posted we're going to try to get the you know what we can set up so we just it's ready the next morning to carry outside all the tables and like The Deco the tables as much set up as we can the day before and then um who is who is going to be involved in that Friday detail is that a signed or just all of us everybody okay so we'll just all be there and catch as catch can that's fine all right yeah I'm traveling the week of the 23rd to the Friday so I'm not available on the Friday but I will be available for the Saturday Okay so the 27th you're not here right okay that's no problem it's not that I mean it's not that M bad of a setup because we can't set up the tents till the next morning you know the big thing is the next morning getting it all out and set up outside so the Friday is fine can we carry the tables out with the tablecloths on them so we can do the tablecloths on Friday I didn't know if the doors are big enough I can't visualize that we do that I think they can oh and the one thing I didn't put on here is garbage can detail so I added that and I'll I'll add it to the thing cuz we usually put a couple of garbage cans and recycle bins outside and then we do bathroom signs so people know that they can go potty so I'll add that who's who who's got that detail whoever wants to do it that day well I can I can pick up these signs I think uh the table and I can do the the bathroom signs if somebody shows me where they're supposed to go okay we just tape them to the door yeah I can just do that you guys take care of the garbage can I'll throw the trash out okay thank you and you have a recycle bins and yeah we usually have them all for like just the stuff we use for every event right so we for sure have them um and then we are going to do the treat bags so we can put those together today if we have enough time or we can put them together that Friday it doesn't take that long when there's all of us it's just we throw all the candy out on the table and we kind of make sure we're all putting in the same amount of pieces so they're the same size bags and then um so we can decide at the end of the meeting if we want to do it today or that Friday and then if you don't have time and you want to bring them home I could always do them at home for you okay thank you yeah we'll see how that goes um it should be okay though I think we should be good okay um I appreciate it um and then today I got a call from the fire chief oh no it's good and um so the fire department they're going to be here there's going to be some of them here and they're going to bring a fire truck here for the kids and since we're not doing like trunk Retreat or whatever um it would be fun for them cuz you know kids like that so it's he said um it's so it's scheduled they're going to be here from 10: to 12:00 barring any emergencies but they are scheduled to be here so like where we put all the trunk Retreat cars last year that's where we were just going to have the fire truck park there so that'll be cute the kids will like that it'll scare the crap out of the dogs but that's okay yeah especially if they run that siren no yeah dominations no Sirens um so that was a nice little perk today are you guys okay with that anybody OB okay awesome and then Kyle has already ordered for us the new numbers and the safety pins because the first year you know we did 1 through 20 or whatever 1 through 25 and then we you know they go through 100 so last year we started at like 25 and did 25 you know so we made sure we used all the numbers so now he ordered new numbers so we're going to start back one to however many people that we have and then um Kyle has the judges scoring sheets and we're going to do the orange cups with the numbers that we did last year because it made talling the judges scores that much easier for everyone um and then I'll the donuts from Publix and then the music's taken care of I mean it's not like you have to go through and put a playlist together if you literally put in Halloween music it's already done yeah just Amazon music on all of them and then we'll get the water and ice you know the Friday before all set up so it's nice and cold and then the gift card gift bags will be put together ahead of time as well well so um I think so Susan official I think she officially resigned today cuz she's travels a lot for work and she was only at one meeting and then she missed the second meeting and she couldn't be here today so she said she's going to help she wants to volunteer but I will have Patty check with her and see if she can do what she was going to do at the Halloween event what was she going to do do you remember she was going to help the judges with the cups because I think I did that last year when we changed the thing cuz you're literally going through and like say it says contestant number one and you go judge to judge right and you get their votes or whatever I give them just pre-made sheets that all they got to do is circle what their score is and drop it in the cup and that way you can just look at it total it and write it down for each person so one I think last year I just went person to person to person as the judges voted and I put it in cup number one okay um and memory serves like the cups got a little messed up last year when we went to use them a second time for the dog so we got to figure out something to keep it in better order cuz it got a little like whatever but so we'll figure that out but the the I think Susan was going to do the Cups and I think she was going to help John with the refreshment table so like one person could do water and one person could do donuts but um since I'm going to be at this event now you know I'll just one be a floater but two I can help if Susan can't be here if that makes sense I was I was going to say I could help anywhere too yeah yeah we're all going to be floaters it's just you know if we all have like certain things that that we have in mind that we know we have to do then no one will forget and whatever may I uh that's the quick question absolutely I'm willing or statement I'm willing to step up as a um primary member instead of just an alternate if that will help yeah that would be awesome I actually mentioned that to Patty and I think the does the board have to vote on that the city council to be back in that role yeah because she can vote when there's no primary here as an alternate but they'll have to move her back into the primary role I mean because they used to be on it then it came down as an alternate so whatever you guys want I'm just saying if you lost somebody I'm willing to come up no that's great we'll see if we can get on the November agenda should so that's perfect thank you cuz I I was alternate when what was her name Carolyn yeah she was the permanent and I was the alternate I don't know if they had to revote me in or if it just moved up you sure they did I don't remember I just know I don't remember either so I don't go to your meetings because I'm always at work on the Monday meetings yeah I feel like you weren't there but they did move you okay that sounds right okay we'll double check though cuz I don't remember you I mean I I forget who's an alternate and who's a member because every I everybody the same alternate yeah I was like so yeah thanks Deb that's awesome I appreciate that my pleasure and then I think that's it does anybody else have anything that they have any questions or anything they want to add to the Halloween event I think we're pretty good it was still expected to show up at 9: right yeah nine on the 28th and what time on the 27th two two all right and you'll get um you'll get an agenda from Patty for that Friday the 27th you know like a week in advance just the same thing it'll just look like this and it'll have the date and the time because we normally meet at 2:30 so 2:00 will be bold and then hopefully we're out of here by 3 and it'll literally just say Halloween event setup but I guess just to be official publish yeah public notice we have to just so we are going to have a meeting on the 27th to 2 and we're going to do this right right after that is that right no it's not a me it's just a a meeting to set up it's just oh okay so this is a Halloween deal it's a hall it's yes 100% Halloween setup I got it okay yeah and then so oh and then if you um Michael if you can just touch base with Kimberly like maybe two or three days in advance or a week in advance to make sure she's still judging and then Deb you or I can um did wait we had spoke at the last meeting about some type of little you know kind of cover letter for the judges yeah and I just if could you just is this enough like I don't know what information she needs no I just know just thank you for volunteering and you know yeah I mean I could do it for Kimberly if you want no we've never done it in the past and no one's ever requested or needed it um if you just want to write up a little note for her that's I'm okay with that I'm not exactly sure what you're looking for yeah whatever you want to graft yeah I'm just think it's like a one you know just so people you know people volunteers kind of make sure they keep it at the Forefront yes of their thing and they can yeah typically what I'll do is just you know because all these people we know and we're friends with and we talk to you know like I like Frank and Margie I do like through the beach cleanup and stuff like that so I have them on email through the city and then Molly and Darlene so Kimberly's the only one that you know just you know so every body else like we know it that we'll just say hey don't forget and make sure it's on your calend and I can do the same thing where I just you know yeah so in the past what we've done is we'll send out like special thank you to the volunteers like after the event after okay yeah um we usually don't send out things before and after like like the health and wellness Fair because we're dealing with medical professionals we put that letter together that they get in advance and then we follow up with emails and text messages and however you know just a followup to make sure that they're they show up and they know right you know what's going on um but I think we're good with this is there any other questions besides that no okay good and if if there is we can you know just email Patty or we can take care of them the Friday before the event um okay so health and wellness be Patty sent you guys um if you email and if you didn't pick up the copy when Michael did you pick up the copy of this when you walked in yeah I okay awesome so you know not rocket science what I did was just it was like our last two years uh and what is on there are the people that I have either already sent it out to I've heard back from I actually got a yes from clean eats like on my way here so and they finally open and they're finally open yes so you know as we've talked about in the last couple meetings we're we're just kind of like last year Patty did you have three tables or four tables that you were the point person on just two okay so we're going to try to like just one for more variety sake and two just to kind of get everybody involved like more involved in this you know um event so maybe Target five people five Wellness practices a piece if you don't want to that is fine it's not like a mandatory thing but like you know it's just um to get more variety and to get different vendors and different people here because we all have different doctors we all have different people that we work with and so it would be nice you know some of these people are going to be returning some people ask to return we're not going to tell them no but you know we would also like to bring in some new New Blood we need some new faces well I took um the letter to stretch lab uh we talked about it somebody in I don't know who it was anyway lloy not started going to them they're fabulous and they were so excited they said they would definitely be here and I said well you either need to contact me or contact you and I showed her the number multiple times she goes they love to do that you're really glad you hear that because clubes came back to me and said they were unable to do it that they would give us um donations when we need them but they can't sacrifice the Manpower they don't have enough employees so they will bring a portable table awesome thank so and then um Amber and Tom are not coming because they're so far away yeah but they have they are it's not sponsoring mentoring and she's right down here in sany or either just over the bridge Pearl dentistry and her name is Ashley Bradley so um they've spoken to her I haven't okay so so what I'm asking if you guys could do is like fill in like how she's naming these like fill in on the sheet who you know like just right across the top the name of the company who you're contacting their contact phone number and then what they do um if it's you know some of them it's obviously logical in like the name of it but sometimes it's not um and then their response and then I don't know I was kind of thinking just you know we can't come up at the end of December and find out that everybody's a no so we kind of need to make this a maybe like a weekly or bi-weekly or as you get responses um fill it in whether it's a yes or a no and send it to Patty because um once we get all of our Targets on the sheet she can combine them and then we'll just have a running tracker and then like say if Michael you have somebody that you're you're saying oh they would be great and then they come back to you and say no and they're a a a I don't know um a dermatologist like she had a a possible dermatologist and I had a possible dermatologist we just don't want three yeses from three dermatologists because we can only have one dermatologist so we kind of like need to keep each other informed and we need to do it through Patty through the city Patty Gentry Patty Gentry through the city website so I have from the last two years you know I have you know six or seven more people that I could just zip it out real fast and see if they they want to come um like I haven't sent it to Bay Dermatology or one blood yet but everybody else on here I've sent it to um and then Jules asked for the letter because you know she got us a couple people last year she got us the dance and I think one she was trying to get um an optometrist on oh and not the same guy I'm talking to what's his name sh Vision I'm I'm going to go see him uh Thursday end of this month but you guys all have the letter right you all have the letter that you I don't know if I I don't know if I can put my hands on it or not but you should have it on print it out yeah she sent it Emil okay all right all right you should have the email version so you could email it to people or you know you could drop it off I think the first year I dropped off a ton of them and then once I got everyone's email I just started emailing them or I was texting them like if they've been here three times I'm just kind of texting it cuz they know the plan you know they know what's going on let me see if I have some in M um so you know it's not a new gig should we send it out to our new dance guy sure classes start I think right after that time it's like mid January February yeah that'd be good is here no way they are well she didn't come last year did Amy come last year or what's her name not Amy um Tara Tera Tara came the first year she said no last year so I was going to actually ask just 26 but then she's got the new Amy is one of her students so I didn't know if Amy wanted to do it started doing the saw can so I'm sorry so we have categories some we could have new categories theoretically absolutely all right so basically there's a a starting list we have some confirmation some pending and we have who's in charge of it right and this thing Patty jenry is going to keep this basically up to date almost on a daily we daily or weekly basis right or you could send it to her as you get them like if you get a yes or a no especially if you get a no to a certain category then like the group can know and someone else can go okay I can take that where in the last two years other than the two that she did I was kind of doing the whole because it's hard to track through Patty but so this is a new thing for us so we're probably going to have some Growing Pains but that's okay so we we cannot call you I can't call you until tell you no correct okay no um and Pat's GNA be gone I know so we're g to switch it up what do you think um because we can't do it through me I I don't mind it but I know we can't uh probably me okay what did you say Aaron well by the time pat leaves we should have everything set do you know what I'm saying or at least 90% what Last Day November 1th November 17th November 17th is that is that when this this is this doesn't happen oh that's when Patty CU every time you say G oh there's well hopefully the new L she's retired that's a good reason to go I guess uh well do you have somebody uh lined up to do it or a pro town where you you have to have a Patty I know we do okay so you're working on a Patty right now can't yeah you can't she's the best I don't oh and then Kyle I was going to ask her Aaron um I'm pretty sure the park and wreck board and I think our rolls over it's been kind of difficult in the past to get a coffee vendor and they drag us out and drag us out and drag us out and then we run out of coffee and we have to go to Starbucks anyway can we just do Starbucks this year or dunan you mean I mean have city under what we can do both but yeah we can do regular Starbucks and decaf Duncan I'm going I'm going go but I'm going to go to public okay and I'm going to see if I can talk to them because their private label is absolutely outstanding Oh you mean green wives yeah their their their private label coffee is outstanding okay and so I thought I would go over there okay and say you we already got this but I really got to tell you you should get this out I mean this is here's an opportunity to get this to get people acquainted with your private label coffee their coffee is excellent well you know I will tell you the First Health and Wellness Fair Publix was here and they had their organic line green wise here and then the second year they said yes but then the manager switched in the middle and it didn't transfer and so the new manager said no so like um we can't do it the woman The woman there a woman okay yeah she said we would love to I just didn't schedule anybody so I I can't cover she said but next year let me know so if you want to put Publix on your list have added do you have her contact information her name is Simone I can give you her email if you want it all right um I didn't have them on my list because I was trying not to take over the whole thing you I mean I I was trying to share slots and so I was just picking and choosing um I we this one I mean obviously this is kind of the primary refreshment so you know this is kind of like a headliner deal as far as the aesthetic of the whole thing so I mean I would go on this right away but if we'd have we have to be back stopped with coffee I don't dis agree but this is a thing too like for Publix to like showcase their coffee like when they were here the first year they had a table and they had like a display of green wise products they did not sample anything and I said you know they really should have been sampling at least a cracker or something like nobody tasted anything and then like for the coffee I don't know if they're set up because we actually need the dispensers and the cups and the creamers like we need them to donate all of it not just bags of coffee because we don't have they could go to corporate for this though I mean this is a you know what I'm saying this should be like a regular deal their private label coffee is an excellent product okay well ask ask say so you can do green wise if you want but we also you know I mean we also we want the private label we want you to underwrite essentially the The Refreshments for the event it gets you out there yeah you know it's good def they're great on defense public yeah John you're in charge of that get it put put Publix on your list with shuttle I got Publix here okay perfect oh shuttle I know I got Publix in shuttle and if they want to do the coffee refreshment we will let them take the table the table's in the lobby as you know um The Refreshments that are in the kitchen for the participants we're still going to take care of I mean if they want to donate that's the fort on the other side of the bridge the fort Publix yes it's the mainland fort on the other side of the bridge they're great on defense okay okay they are that's that's that's their stick okay well then get them to say yes and she actually said she would I just didn't put her on my list cuz I was like I said I already have eight on my list so even like there isn't even enough for five more cuz we only have room for 26 tables in that room how many tables do we have sold out and we have to have a coffee table so that's T well the coffee table's in the lobby so that doesn't count I see okay uh only 26 tables fit in that room and then as we get closer I mean you read the letter if they you got to get them to answer all the questions on the letter do they need electricity and then ask them if they have a friend that they want to be next to you because that happened before where oh can I stand next to so and so and we're shuffling tables and then it's not a big deal because we could just move the numbers but typically we have like this little like program that says shuttle Visions at table number four but if they want to switch to be by a buddy then it messes up our program and Kyle's back there scrambling trying to fix the program and it's stressful so it on an Excel spreadsheet and it's real time and time comes down boom here it is prints it out and there it is I know but right um and then you have to make sure that your people know that it's it says it on the letter that it's $25 they can do cash check or a credit card when they get here last year we just did we just did the list last year right we didn't mess with a map I don't think we did a map yeah that was smart cuz it was the the map it really and it was it was because people were switching all over and I didn't we didn't know they you know they it's just in that room isn't it no one got lost can't get lost pretty much told you what's at this table big signs yes we were thorough that first year does it does someone else want to take Amy for Cher yoga and contact Amy Amy for what you want me to Cherry yoga sure and it's um I don't so if you don't come up Tammy if you don't come up with 26 and we're short I mean so like uh health and wellness that covers a big I mean it could be outdoor activities you know all sorts all sorts of different things right no yeah absolutely I mean so about the paddle board guy does he come that's that's exactly what I was thinking I was going to go up I just bought a paddle board and a kayak last this spring from the outfit up on beler a very very nice high-end store I thought this would be anyway yeah no someone suggested that outdoor that literally will bring the like if you want to try a new $2,000 paddleboard they'll bring one over here for you to try before you buy it like it's an outdoor water sports company that would be a great one to well I mean i' I'd go up to those I'd go up to talk to those guys okay and tell them to bring one so we can try it out they cost that much the te ones are um Mega expensive you mean the The Kayaks and the paddle boards paddle board oh they have a huge range yeah they do huge range yeah all right I I'll do the paddle I'll do the paddle board guys Co okay so yeah between between all of us it it doesn't have to be equal but we're going to have we're going to come up with 26 and we're going to have a good variety we just have to make sure that we don't do duplicates so it's like we all can't have like I said a dermatologist or we all can't have a um you know whatever a massage therapist like we don't have a stretch person so that's good I had a stretch person we've had her here the last two years I didn't put her down yet so you're a stretch person because I thought I kind of remembered you saying that so I didn't know she I thought that lady was just a massage therapist no Steven was the massage therapist Nessie was the stretch person okay she was real nice she was very nice but like you know again some variety would be good um excuse me um did John go to shuttle Vision yet no I got it I got it down though uh Deb okay honey I'm waiting to see what happens with you before well you know what I think you know what I think we should do we should send a joint letter we should send a joint letter and go over there together and shake them down shake them down I have and I I think I'm going to have a cataract replaced here too otherwise my hunting is is and they think it's going to be right so I might have to get that guy St Michaels and St Luke's and all these cataract places right up the road I mean not everybody's say oldest John and I but um you know cataracts are coming well I'm going to get no I got to I I can't can't shoot Okay who wants to take the Cataract people me we we uh Michael what do you have what are you thinking what John Deb she is he is going to refer me to somebody okay because I got one to should be ripe okay for insurance and so you know with that we could maybe kill two birds of one stone but I thought a joint letter from two customers at one time I said we just go up there huh we could just go up there together all three of us we could all three of us go up there and say hey Dr shettle you know you got this is a great location you're right here all these people you know so yes three why not why not put the the bombs Rush on them that sounds like fun three yeah it does we'll get coffee or something we can't talk about buiness so no so Tammy to answer I had you my P looking all over you have this you have this pencil here I had to pursue the um Panera but it sounds like we're making a push on Publix yeah I'm going to go over to Publix so do you have somebody do you know somebody there is it two different things I thought I was going for them for you sponsoring you go ahead you go ahead I just had a I was just talking about you know they're going to get Starbucks okay but if I was a vendor you know they want uh to me if I was them rather than Starbucks I'd be saying hey check out this Public's private label because it's really good I mean you got to get it out there but having said that you know he has to sign it well he's our new secretary okay but were you looking at Panera for I thought this yeah it was for the you want I thought it was for that's totally okay with me General discussion I got what were you so General discussion um this was for the health and wellness fair and this was back from the September me the Panera I was going to get a Panera contact for 113 but I thought that that contct was for the lobby Refreshments oh do they do coffee they do do coffee and it's actually very good why don't we you do it and then um uh I will tell you though with Panera I'm sorry to interrupt um so there's literally a sign back on their bulletin board that said we love to get involved with the community we love to help out our community and you that number and they say we're no longer doing it because of Co and the store like the store here the one yeah will say at least this is at the time when I ask them oh no you've got a corporate we can't do anything on like an individual but if you're just asking them for a coffee donation May you just ask that manager he may be yeah I'll just go directly there so what I'll do is this I mean is that yeah we can we can ask both yeah I mean I'll make the ask and then what I'll do is I'll make the ass say tomorrow or Monday well this is a way this this thing is like in January January right no I'm saying I'll just try to get a I'll just try to get a quick yes or a quick yes or a quick no right and then back to Publics can always do just a table inside the event with like any of their products they don't have to do the coffee label gotta because like I said I don't even know if they have it set up to do catering cuz literally you need catering supplies to do it's true might have to have it might be a deal where they have to come up with a rum caucus of employees to do this kind of stuff but a lot of these outfits do have a kind of a an organ organization within uh their their field unit okay where they organize and they get people to go you know uh stuff backpacks for kids going back to school or and so on and so forth I think that's pretty common and this would be you know anyway I'll go there and talk to the lady and say see how it works here here's what I was excited about you know yeah yeah that's fine so let me ask this question if um so if it's let's say Panera says the we're not you know we're not doing it right or we're you know because of Co 3 years later or whatever we're we're not doing it anymore but let's just say that that's the case we before we started talking about Publix the question was do we just want to buy Starbucks do we want to just buy Panera or do we want to flip back to the Public's and then you know what I'm saying what's the what's the hierarchy do we want to go Panera for free public for free and then if not we're going to Starbucks and pay so the first year Beller coffee did it and they donated it the owner dropped off it was great the second the second year they didn't want to do it but they didn't tell us for like two months so then Nicole got the coffee mill to do it but they only gave us half as much coffee as we needed and then Kyle ended up running out halfway through the event and having to go to Starbucks so it's we've had vendors they've done a great job but like it was just it seemed to be painful both times both drug us out um just one wanted us to pick up everything and if you're not used to carrying those full things of coffee like Starbucks they have what approximate what's the approximate need head count what's a head count last time we we have all we started with what was it two and two I think two full things of regular and yeah and we had to get like two more yeah which that a it was if it's cold we go through a ton of coffee and the first year people didn't realize we had coffee in the lobby once they realized we had coffee in the lobby it was like get flying yeah so yeah absolutely if we can get someone to donate it it it just seemed like both years it was a little painful and I was trying to avoid the pain so we need like four four what's the average like a 5 gallon I would just say enough coffee for 150 people okay would you say yeah because a lot of people had more than one compared to the people that didn't have any kind of made it up for people had multiples so what I'm going to do is I'm going to kind of shoot for like a a quick no or a quick yes but then let's say if it's a no we're we're not do I want to try to say well what kind of discount can you give us sure and and Panera has really good coffee too so it's just you know if they have the catering capabilities or the boxes Panera probably has the they do a lot of catering for like corporate sure they probably have the boxes of coffee like Starbucks so yeah whichever that can be John's question do they do catering I'm not public ask that yeah we'll find out I'll talk to the lady you know and say you know I was a Bag Boy I was a bag boy at the store up on uh Missouri and Rosary Road they used to have a store up there and uh we didn't live too far from there in anyway so I um not I have a story there you go you have a connection she remember Bob Bob Owens and Bill Matos Bob Owens D from before you were born Lady sure your original public stock record this conversation for me huh can you record this conversation with you go I'll try to do I'll I'll try to be as sparkling as possible you'll do a good job but anyway so um are we do we have any more questions about this I know know it's it's October it's you know yeah but but everything happens now yeah yeah it's you know it it the more we do now the less pain we have cu the the worst thing that could happen is you know two weeks before the event all these people that we've contacted say no that's was always my worst fear that like we don't you know the room is half empty um and you know it's an emphasis on the fact that you know in a very nice way you know we've cut it down to 3 hours instead of four but if you're coming to the event you need to commit from beginning to end because when they start walking out early and the room is half empty of vendors and we still have residents coming in it looks bad they have to commit to the 3 hours is this in the letter even if they're bored yes it is okay it is but um where is that letter you have it on email and you have a I probably do there so much God dang stuff can with me yeah letter so the letter is in a packet it's your a separate packet for the health and wellness the she emailed it separately but we'll get you another copy you don't still have them in your office right I grabbed those you grab I grabbed them that's what I thought so we'll get you the letter John do you want print outs I just want the letter so I can read it if I want it to be if I want to send them out okay okay I when I want to send them out okay and I because I don't know how this works with our you know this is external communication I like I don't do I should I should I not be sending this stuff through City Hall I just sent it to you on a text all right the letter thanks do do I send this directly or do I have the city send it no no you send it you can send it to these people me personally as parks and recck board member John Wagner yes no no no additional affiliations like that I can send it directly from my house or's the letterhead and all that stuff don't have it on Beller Beach letterhead okay that yeah but you're assuming I got you're assuming I got the color copies of that you did get color copies but no you assume you assume I don't just use black and white in my printer well that's I can't figure this out I will I'm going to waste money on color pat patty can print them out Pat's going to be gone a't that right well yeah I'll get you'll have a supply here I will come in say I want I do send a deal can you run me out these other run down here and sign them okay yes I got it got it are you good just address so just to kind of highlight our um our consistency yeah so this is from a the meeting before maybe even the one before that he got me now Panera Bread talk to him about 100 to 150 attendees these Bell coffee in the past and in big bow letters Public's private brand label I'll take whatever if she wants to do green wise or what I don't care you know I'm just saying I you are emphasizing The public's call it's got to it's got to be good I think they that's your prerogative if they want to do the deal you know I me I don't care green wise or this whatever whatever they want to underwrite you know what I mean so is everybody clear that you have a hard copy of this obviously but you have it on email as well so if you can fill in your Targets this is a target list and then as it changes you see over for their response if they are a yes a no or a pending and then we can all get it and see it and say okay I see that um Amy the chair yoga lady is a no because she's out of town that weekend I will respond back with then I will call just 26 and see if they want to table and replace the yoga person does that make sense so this is going to be a moving document I know Patty is going to be leaving Kyle take over but you know right now you all have your targets that you've already mentioned so we can get this target list filled out and back to her next week and she is here and she can kind of combine everybody's onto one email onto one two one piece of paper front and back and then we all have the whole thing that we can work off and see you know and then just like say if um the yoga is a no we all have the whole thing that we can say hey on this whole list of 26 targets we don't have a foot doctor so I'm going to try to get a foot doctor do you know what I'm saying so just to make sure we don't have any duplicates that we all kind of know what each other is doing and where our targets stand you know this will be a working document for that will be updated hopefully weekly not to be a pain in Patty's butt at least as much as you're getting updat if we could do it another way we would because it would be easier but we can't so we've got to make this work I assume that we're starting with last year's attendees that we were happy with and they have kind they got kind of the right of first refusal been here before or are they all I mean how should I put it if we had 26 here last year wouldn't we start with those people well like I said in the beginning of the meeting like um we'd also like some variety too cuz like as people come here and they they've like residents come here oh well I talked to all these people last year so we want to bring in some of the ones from last year like Gold's JY was here the first year I didn't ask them the second year because they left early I'm going to be honest they left an hour early and I didn't invite him back the second year and then I see him at the gym and they're like well we really want to do that again I'll be like well you can but you can't leave early I didn't put them on my list but if I need to because like maybe you know we need we need a gym still then I will ask them but no we're not doing the whole entire list that we did for the last two years because we need some new people too some of them are going to be yeses but not you know again so what's your what's your target expecting to get 10 or 12 out of that I don't really have a Target I mean I could I could throw it out to Gold's Gym I could throw it out to the CB CBD store we could probably get 80% back back of the last two years e pretty easy if they're available but I want more than 20% new people because again if they're there more than 20% it's only five can I know so that's why you guys are doing your own targets and we're not inviting the whole entire list from the last two years so you want us to get some uh people here and then uh then you then you've got your you should get your 26 easy then exactly you just picking pick and then we have some people like everybody likes the bay ha um the the Megan Rodriguez is the point person there Bay care they do all the screening oh sure they're on my list and they they're already down there they've been here the last two years and I she's out of town right now so I'm waiting to hear back from her so like but that table is always full the entire time because people like the health screenings um the the health insurance health markets that's new we haven't had a health insurance person here before I got a g i calling out she not that's on list here yeah but we've see that's where you got to look cuz she we've already got a health insurance person and she's lives in Beller Beach and she's already a yes okay B NE her thanks so kind you got to make sure you're looking at your targets and looking at everybody else's targets um that was my easiest one there so you just said a foot doctor do you have a pedist no well I'm looking for one so I'll I put it on my list de are you good yes I'm very good okay I I Liv through it a couple of times so okay yeah so you're good um emailing your targets to Patty yes okay awesome okay does anybody have any other questions on this no like we'll have a much better idea when we meet in November like all of our targets will all be on this one piece of paper and we can all review it as a group and we can kind of see where we stand and where we're lacking and where we're in good shape and so we cannot communicate between these meetings so you get something kind of an update or something like that it's like the next time we meet is in November and then we see where we're at so that's why you want to get something going that's why we getting that's why Patty is going we're going to get updates through Patty through Patty so Patty is going to send us the information I got it I see okay so you're going to fill out this form and email to Patty just your pencil T you know your four or five however met you have and then she will combine them and then she'll send out the entire list to everybody okay so we all see what we're all targeting and what we all have yes's nose pendings if we have new ideas that not been brought up here we can just add them right through the city yes okay all right po Patty po not po Patty should we be doing it through Patty or should we be doing it through Aaron who do you want us to do it through Pat's for now okay yeah cuz then she has all of her and honestly if you guys are typing this in it's going to take her five minutes to copy and paste it and put it on one and shoot it out to everybody Pat it's not going to be a lot of work for Patty Patty's not going to type all this information in for all of us all she's going to do is you know what I mean combine them and send them out she's not really doing anything with it except for combining I me on a word dock or something like that the word dock Excel Excel okay all right yep get it all right okay so are we all good with that anybody have anything else on the health and wellness fair for now okay good perfect so item number six so welcome back updates we still have three in the store room Kyle ordered new kitchen towels and new hand towels for us I took them to the embroidery replac last week to get the logos and whatnot on them and then we have what we need to put together like 10 more welcome bags um and again if you're out and about and you're you know at Publix or you're at somewhere and you want to ask them if you they want to add something to our welcome bags that is fluid it can change with every single bag we put together they they do not have to be the same they don't have to be inventoried either so like um you know B basically we put like two nicer things we put a couple stickers and the important thing in the bag is they get all the new Resident information things that they need to know about living in b beach your hurricane pass your beach sticker um the city newsletter where you get your information all you know the yoga classes the beach cleanups not that that's the most important thing about living here but I'm just saying things that they need to know when they first move here is you know what they're looking for in that bag the little chachis that the Park and wreck board put in there or just to be nice and say welcome to the neighborhood so um we should get those back the um as far as like just Beller Beach wear in general the Blue Hats were ordered the either tan or gray hats were ordered I'm not sure which was the secondary color tan maybe I think it was tan tan and then um we only have five beach towels left should we order new beach towels for Christmas I you find a good towel yeah that's what I was telling her like I we'll see if the past ones are in stock cuz I like if I was explaining to her if we have to start all over then I usually end up ordering five different towels to make sure they're thicker than my sweater cuz you can't really tell and we have never been able to get the same beach towel twice cotton at a actually cotton terry cloth at a price point that we can afford you know well actually that fits into the yeah fits into the price point that we want to sell it for so cuz she's like she asked if we could get a mix between the like the blue and white stripe and the solid white do you think that she they would be okay in the office with I mean it's not a it's not like there's 20 choices there's do you want blue strip not it's not size is that okay okay so we'll try to get like two different types of beach towels like we'll do 20 of each or 15 of each whatever the breakdown is in the packages and then um Kyle has been looking for you know some kind of cup with the Beller Beach logo that is not a sticker so um working on that behind the scenes and so we should have a decent amount of items to sell for Christmas for our holiday social haveit table is that good MH I need a cup and then Beach cleanup okay so um Patty's going to find out from Susan if she can do November 4th or December 2nd John said he do November 4th if what's Susan can't for Beach cleanup what part of the beach are you guys during clean up well I was going to say are we allowed to do Beach cleanup at all right now it's uh they're they're saying maybe 45 days so the so November and December are canceled for Beach cleanup no that's DEC December November for sure November's canceled okay you still will have bore I was going to say bore we always go left you know some go left cuz they may be done with that first you can do some Val where they're at they're not going to do Shand repl they're keeping that's what 18th North 19th and North they're going to have it from when I was talking with them unless they changed it they're going to keep that blocked until it's complete right but it could be but South yeah it could be complete sooner you can play by ear but still be able to get at 19th Street access and then go just go south make us sound okay so it's not canceled so we're going to check with Susan and see if she could do it if on the fourth if not John will do it and I'll John go forth for their south 19 and then I'll take December um December second um again she's checking with Susan but I think I can do I I can do December 2nd okay um so I'll pencil myself in for that one I could do that with you because um the one we were supposed to do together and it doesn't matter if you don't want to F I didn't do because it was cancelled for the hurricane as well oh yeah okay I got you down so we'll get that Michael Michael has it on the new schedule yep Tammy so then and everybody else is you know again this can be can do November 4th I'm going to be hunting in South Dakota oh glad you check can anybody do November 4th Patty you can I'm out of town okay P I'll trade one with you Patty if you're no I don't want to Stack you up too much so so November 4th is me confirmation if Suzanne can do it and then Patty's the backup yes okay and then the same thing with December 2nd if Susan can't do it then Deb and I will do it all right tamy and Debbie okay yeah because I'm just not sure cuz she said she still wants to do some volunteer stuff so I guess it just depends on that sounds more like she'll show up and have this clean up not yeah yeah yeah so I'm not counting on it but we we have it covered if she if you know just you know I don't want to just take her off if she still planned on doing it cuz she could be here on weekends and not on I just don't know um but then if she's resigning from the park and wreck board then she probably shouldn't be doing it that was what I was saying I understand that okay now I was like okay as I said that out pick up some times what you say she going to do I can do um January well she was supposed to Dov December no we've got it covered all right Patty will do November and Deb and I will do December and then if Susan can come help great and if she can come help at the Halloween event great so we'll just do that okay and then I think we're good with that and then do we need a um I mean I guess this is just a sign up list so we don't need a motion to to modify it I don't probably not and then you do we need uh I did along those same lines in I don't know if we've gotten the official resignation yet um but we had spoke earlier when we were talking about um we were talking about Halloween um do we need to make a motion to take Debbie from a alternate to a permanent member that's something has to go before Council how does that hold it has to go through Council coun all right yeah so we asked for that to be on like the the November council meeting gotcha [Applause] okay all right and then next oh I know I was going to ask you Aon so um so John you brought in the um like the signatures the liability form and then you had the form that you recap to keep pelis beautiful and you sent that with the pictures no um I have not been seeing those with pictures U CU When I I sent the pictures to Kyle yeah I got pictures and the recap form that like you fill out after every Beach clean up yeah I did from my recollection um I was doing it I thought you said that you did that I have not done it no no I don't do it if I'm not at beach cleanup so whoever does the beach cleanup gives it to you and you're the one that's been sending it to yeah well all the gear is in there oh it's in the bag that bag the U are you talking about the signin sheet the waiver it's all in there and I sent you the pictures but you took some pictures too Mike yeah did you send them in I sent the Patty a Patty okay all right okay we'll get it I got you we definitely do that though it's easy yeah it's easy like it's you guys always did it here and then I do it for the bridge cleanups okay um there's two forms and then I just shoot them one or you I you guys get the pictures and then we shoot them one or two pictures so so like whoever is doing like so in November Patty will come in um she'll have the pick up the liability form and you know there's do you not have the recap form um I think I probably still have from an email that you might send me I check right now okay recap form is that the signin sheet no there's a recap form from Beach cleanup so what does that mean I didn't do that what's your recap okay I will I'm going to check right now I we'll get it do you remember how many bags you had huh do you how many bags you had of garbage at the end how many bags of garbage yeah um yeah I can make a very educated guess okay I'd say five five okay five as a matter of fact um he had the he had the fullest one right and some of the other people said it was pretty clean mhm five bags how far did you guys go huh how far did you go on the beach well I think they always go up to the um almost they always go up as far as you said they went past yeah they got P like may like 3500 okay yeah oh I can just email it to you yeah I'm looking all your emails right now I'll fill that in okay yeah I think they got pretty 3500 to the end right that's the end yeah yeah cuz you know we got to like 3,100 and Frank and and and they they were past us okay right did you go up to Morgan Park we went that's the end of the city isn't it go beond that basically we should on those pictures we should be telling people I thought about this but you know he he held his bag so had a picture as I recollect we used to take the picture that what the people hold the bags right I don't know what difference it makes I mean quite honestly so what's the other form the one about this one's okay recap it was it was relatively yeah yours was relatively full yeah they said they didn't get that much um they talk a I'll send it to you it should be on a clipboard with the liability form when they pick it up when they come in whoever's doing Beach clean up the Friday before it should be on the the clipboard and it's on the instructions to fill it out afterwards and give it back to you and then you did I miss that I guess so yeah apparently it's okay oh yeah I yeah cuz I think the last one I did was back in March I was like I could have swore that I put fill out the two forms and turn them in on the on the instructions it's fine um I'll just email it to you again and then um and then you know you can have like a blank of each of them on the clipboard but like make sure I guess that you make another blank copy so when they take those out with the attendance of the waer okay I just made a bun put like you have a master cop on the bottom yeah okay so I'll I'll email you that for don't use that last one it looks just like well I mean I know you the keepy penel is Rec it's I have the same form that they sent me for the um the bridge cleanup and then when Kyle signed up for keep panel's beautiful through the city you guys got that form I got it yeah it's here it yeah that's no problem I'll just make a bunch of copies and here yeah perfect what is this is this reporting to penel county or what yeah cuz we're uh it's the keep penel beautiful it's a project that we do um the city signed up for like oh so they say these people cleaned up you know 1213 bag whatever they summarize it as a whole in the report at the end of the year and it tells how much get remember that nice little booklet John that you were so impressed with that we were in yes um there it is we send the recap forms and then if you go to Bell beach in their little recap it'll say b beach picked up this many pounds of garbage they had this many whatever it says but they they coate that information through the forms that we send in every Beach cleanup cool okay hell we pull in at least 143 lbs of trash hell I typically bring four or five pounds myself each time each at least and you can always pad the number I'm kidding I'm joking so there you go I think that was deal and Mike's bag I would say Mike your bag was at least four or five lbs yeah I was thinking 7 and A2 but 7 and a half so I'm I'm just estimating here and we have regular volunteers there and they would never lie about doing nothing but talking about Phillies and Mets okay and we did and we did pick up a a a bottle of a uh liquid right at the end it was a a pickle jar was full of a golden substance I cleaned up I cleaned up I cleaned up a hobo we had a hobo and I cleaned up the whole godd Dam thing while going south so yeah you know I don't even know if that got picked up I had a 143 PBS I okay whatever we can do a lot better than that a lot better estimate than that it's going up oh absolutely that's very conservative okay are we good with the beach clean up it's it's going to be some Growing Pains everybody's learning it's just a lot and like you know we just miss you when you're not there I'll sign the report if you put it together okay I mean I I'll fill out the report and all it while it's still fresh in my mind okay I'll get it for you good that' be the best okay 7 and half pounds huh okay moving on moving on to number eight other business does anybody have any other topics that we or that are not listed on the agenda
