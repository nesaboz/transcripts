    "transcript": "good evening everyone welcome to the monday august 16th special city council meeting with the city of delaware beach [Music] please i pledge allegiance [Music] peaceful council member robert aki council member frank banker council member glenn gunn council member leslie otero councilmember rita swope here vice mayor dave gavis mayor joseph manzo yeah city manager lynn reeves city attorney fred riley here we thank you reflect that government ladies and gentlemen i'm not a mask and the reason why i'm doing mass is that we got i was away for four days at the new york city annual convention and with a variety of meetings with hundreds of people from across the state various cities and apparently one person tested positive it didn't tell us who that person was or whether they were personally exposed to or not um but in an abundance of culture and following the cbc guidelines which call for social distancing on a mask and uh received the test i couldn't assure you that i feel fine and i um fully documented that vehicle so i think i've been pretty good the doctor's not yes i'll take that as a good sign my other doctor would have a physical tomorrow wants to see me so i don't think he's too worried either so um but just so you know that's why we're doing this so you might want to stay away from me all right item one request authorization for the city manager to advertise for legal services for the city attorney description here the city council consensus at the budget workshop to advertise a request for proposals that was last month's budget workshop and august 2nd 2021 consensus council to discuss of all second numbers present first motion please so it gets motion second check it second quality is small i need to take yes oh yes i think that looking at other options is always in the best interest of the city and i recommend that we move forward council members [Music] uh this contract once again we have that that's why i pointed this out and we need to do the same thing that might need to be consistent the same thing with mourinho when he was our attorney he put me down for rfp we invited him that he could certainly apply a vice mayor davis did that during the work session for city attorney riley and councilmember banker had pointed out at the time about his billing and yes i have looked at the billing too and there's sometimes there's charges on there for specific things and sometimes there isn't but i am concerned about the june building and there was a call on june 8th around 3 46 p.m between mayor manzo and the city attorney that is not noted on here i don't know if it was an oversight by the city attorney and that he she would bend this bill to charge for that call or not charge for one or the other but with that said i still feel like we need to go out for an rfp and he can certainly put in his request and then we can look at it again um i wasn't at the last meeting but i did listen to it in its entirety um i will vote against this because i think fred reilly has done a fabulous job under horrible circumstances i don't think this is necessary at this time marina was a lawyer for the city for like 15 years how long have you been doing it for a couple years two less than two so i don't think that's an appropriate time to go ahead and ask for an rfp as far as the booming i can tell you that i think that it should be higher i think that he is under billing when he probably should be billy moore if there wasn't a column there that was well it's probably because he didn't charge for it so maybe we should bring it up so he doesn't invent it and get more money so if you're worried about saving money maybe not bring that up um yeah this seems this seems very unnecessary and very and i don't know why and it seems certain council members we definitely have a divide in the council i can see that on many issues um i disagree with this and going back to when we did rfp we had the other people just to remind everybody and to point out to friends since he wasn't there the other firms wonderful firms that came they gave us their newly graduated junior lawyer who doesn't have any experience and they were going to get their experience with us or we could have had a well-seasoned attorney who's been in practice for over 30 years and already has this position at another city so knows what he's doing so again to go back to a medical term do you want the brand new graduate surgeon operating on you would you rather be 30 year old better you know so i mean it's one of those things so as far as price i don't think this council as of right now needs to talk about that because if you do or nitpicking about money well then go take it off that thirty thousand dollar sign we just approved like that wave that five thousand dollar weight that would have been money that we could have put towards oh sorry four thousand dollars sorry blood pennies difference my bad um so i'm strongly against this i wasn't at the last meeting i wish i was that way we wouldn't even have to do this today because it would have been voted down i'd just like to say what councilman swept said there are things that he doesn't charge us for i've dealt with attorneys last 20 years of my working career this man's not even doing it for two years i believe he said [Music] but disrespectful gets rid of a car only in two years brand new this guy's still getting his feet wet in my opinion i mean no disrespect there either but he's a great attorney i'll tell you the facts you might not like him that's what attorney does you know and most people hate attorneys no disrespect that any of the three attorneys here until you need one and then you appreciate it i think mr rowlands a great attorney i hope you stay i'm gonna build what dr ockey said um first off you know if it ain't broke don't fix it okay has done a fine job here in the city under uh pretty difficult circumstances a lot of other attorneys would have probably said forget it i don't need this um yeah dr brings up an excellent point we were given the junior league with some of these other places instead we get an experienced attorney who jumps in here cleans up what's pretty much a mess and they've been allowed to perpetuate for decades in this city does it form us at a ridiculously low rate okay so to use the medical analogy not only are we saying let's get rid of this surgeon who's done a fine job um he's not only going to find out he's done it at an incredible price i'm looking at the last thing he sent us here we're going to talk about it in the next meeting he says although i will include a time entry for drafting this provision i will not charge the city for this task why not you helped change an ordinance an ordinance that has real problems as you're going to see in a little while you deserve to be paid for that and you deserve to be paid more than 125 an hour that is an unbelievably fair price if anybody thinks that we're going to lower legal bills we remind people for years no legal work is really being done here a lot of rubber stamping was being done but real equal work going in delving into our ordinances review of our city charter getting involved in all these new areas that this council and the previous council have opened up kudos to both of those councils for doing it but we need legal and all these committees and new things that we've done heard riley's risen to this occasion he's done a fine job he's an ethical attorney by the way they'll investigate some of those attorneys that applied it had been they had cases where they've lost actions that were taken in boards because they violated sunshine law one of them has three violations pretty pathetic federal doesn't have any so i'm totally behind you i know you have announced your resignation and i'm asking you leslie carol i know i did last time she kind of got the ball rolling in what i thought was one of her finest moments i hope he will stay [Music] and i will support you i will have to vote for this only if you tell us that you're not going to stay because i must have city attorney but if you wish to stay my vote will be no any other council members i had a question for our city management uh mr ruiz do you have any other attorneys lined up yes i i mentioned that at the last meeting you have three proposals three three okay all right so if we accept mr riley's resignation we definitely have legal counsel is that correct yes all right thank you who are the three attorneys that you've contacted uh frank miller olive um speaking to them brian miller of salzman and uh press diagonal so trash data yes that would be the one that has the three sunshine violations in the dealer beach go look at the actions by mr william gay and i think there was a fourth one pending up in um and i don't know [Music] enough to see what the result was three sunshine violations that's what you want in your city vote yes for this and what's on council before i open this up to the citizens guess what i'm done i just have a question previously you had submitted a resignation letter has that been withdrawn pending this or i mean what i did submit a resignation letter i put that when i sent it was the date was resignation date was the 19th because that was the 30 days after the last meeting i did not want to leave the city without counsel for an extended period of time so i in the last meeting said i would stay at least through the first meeting in september so that you would have a chance to address this issue the possibility of you holding your resignation and staying is possible if we convince you and thank you i'll say a few comments if when it's time for i think it would be irresponsible as council not to move forward with this uh with this proposal mainly because we have we have a resignation from franklin rival we have to have coverage let's go to council con so well that that said okay he did give us a pretty clear path that he had support he was going to stay i think it would be derelict in our duties and we passed this and then we have to bring in these three attorney firms debate these three guys see if we can find an attorney firm how long will that take we're in the middle of a budget right now are you going to find an attorney okay that knows our budget like he does we're not going to vote on it until we hear from mr riley he has this his revenue he attended her resignation he extended it last time through the first meeting which takes us into september 6th 7th which is ethically the proper thing to do he's doing that and he's being very generous and even altering his step he could very well stay with his original date that would not be enough to throw him to say i gave you a lot he didn't that's what he's really important for him to do if he wishes to withdraw this tonight then we'll still vote on this okay um but i think i've already said it on the goal and so it looks like everyone else has two so um it's really up to him but if he's mr riley and you know i think the world again but if you decide that you are going to keep the resignation in uh effect i could see there would be nothing other than the unanimous vote that says vice mayor dad is correctly stated and as i said before him the same thing we must have a city attorney and i would have no choice but to vote to allow the city uh managed to go out and find a replacement that is not something i'm going to do voluntarily so rather than just one more comment since i wasn't last meeting i want to publicly ask you to please resend your resignation and stay because the city is much better off with you than without you mr raleigh i have the ability to call on you to speak and at this point i'm going to do that okay first i'll start with a correction um my rate is not 125 it's 150. so it's still too much incorrect for for normal general things it's 180 for litigation which there's not very much of that i have involvement with so that that's the first thing second thing is clarification um robin was not here the last meeting but at the last meeting there were three people that asked me to reconsider so that's what i did and as i understand it i've talked over since she she's asked me to reconsider so as i understand it now there are four people that would like me to reconsider and to stay on what i had proposed last meeting was for a way forward so that if y'all had time to consider it and wanted to change your mind on anything you could do that and i would be flexible enough and i still will be flexible enough to not leave the city without an attorney for a period of time i don't know what could be any more fair or professional than doing that at the last meeting i i ask that y'all simply decide i mean if it's time to make the change then do it professionally tell me it's time to make a change and i will facilitate the city making a change and i will not cause a any trouble in doing that that's the professional responsible thing for me to do having said that i i don't think as a council y'all as a group quite understand some of the things that i actually do and i do them because i'm supposed to represent the entire council not one person not a group of two or three it's the entire council and at times that's been very difficult that's not a new phenomenon and i've talked about that briefly before i i wish y'all would put your differences aside and you know that's that would be what happens going forward that i i will tell you go be going forward based on four people want me to to stay and three ready to make a change is is far from an ideal situation for me and i i will readily acknowledge that so i basically will ask a question i'll make one more comment before i do but i i really don't enjoy sitting here being the you know the topic of discussion all i wanted to do and i told you all this when i interviewed for the job i will do my role and i do will do my role ethically and i will do my role within the parameters and i'm supposed to do it and i will hit sit here and look each one of you in the eye and tell you i have done just that so my my question to the the group of seven is if you all want to make a change please tell me you want to make a change and i will tell you uh when 30 days from now i will will be my final day and if you want me to stay longer to facilitate somebody new i will certainly be receptive to doing that but it gets have the professionalism to tell me that and if you don't want me to stay that's fine i would like to say and i would like to continue on and i would hope that some of the conflict somehow gets resolved so that's my question and that's my request going back to rita's comment about the um the bill i just thought of a comparison if you go to your doctor's office twice a week from a month and see them and get care you can't get mad when you get the doctor bill you're using the services you get the bill so i don't think we should be up in arms about his bills and direct that anger towards the money we're spending towards him when he's it's not his fault we should be looking at ourselves and why are we using the lawyer so much so you're blaming him for our actions and that's not fair second of all i will say i i want you to stay that's one vote i want you to stay and i would even maybe maybe you propose to give another chance until march the new election things may change up here that may change some of the friction and maybe consider staying on till march until the next election when maybe people will change some people may not run some people may not win and i don't know so that's my only other common maybe temporary fix for the situation and and trust me if i was you i'd probably run screaming from this place i don't understand how you've dealt with all of us for so long so i commend you for your patience your professionalism and i mean i don't think people realize that when he's giving you an answer he's giving you the answer you may not like the answer but that's not because he doesn't like you it's because that's the answer so if you don't like what answers you're giving you're getting from him maybe you're asking the wrong questions so that's all i'm getting to say so you got me in your order hoping that you reconsider when you stay at least maybe until march and and who knows i would like to go ahead and comment again as well [Music] i was basically mentioning on the gna bill that there was a call mate that wasn't on there with the charge or without a charge i did not know if the city attorney inadvertently left off that call and that we should have to have an amended bill it wasn't about going to a doctor and then him billing me or anything like that and i was just making sure that he didn't inadvertently leave off a call that he made that should have been charged for or even no charge on that same spill there's calls on there or activity that the city attorney did with no charge that loan was not there that was my point in only my point it wasn't stated that anything about his dollar amount to a little dollar-bound bill or anything about going to a doctor so i just wanted to make sure it's very clear on that i can't believe that we need to hear questions about your bill first off your bill is eminently fair you've given more free time to this city than it deserves you don't have to give it any three times not one of the attorneys who also gives free time i'll tell you what in 15 years of practice i've seen at [Music] that meant if you were talking about the baseball game you were paying 400 an hour if you were talking about constitutional you're paying 400 an hour you're very fair in what you do and i don't think you should have to be scrutinized on a monthly basis when you're talking to your client your client is the seven of us city manager city clerk and this city that's your client you send out multiple things about this some of us have more questions about legal some of us may have a heads up on something that we give you and we shouldn't feel guilty about approaching you and you shouldn't feel guilty about giving us advice i have called you at all kinds of hours in the day and night sometimes when an emergency arises to give you a heads up that is my job that is what i'm supposed to be doing i don't get paid a nickel for it i've lost hundreds of hours hundreds of dollars talking to you for the good of this city my god you should be allowed to charge for that you could work on an ordinance you should be allowed to charge for it and i don't like any pressure being put on you and any attorney and i don't care who follows or you know ten attorneys down the road and you're billing us fairly you're most definitely doing this fairly i want to talk about your legal advice that you've given us you have given spot on legal advice and sometimes it's not easy i just approached you people in this meeting with the split i got i spoke to a mayor at the convention who's in a neighboring city and an attorney that i think everybody thinks is a pretty decent attorney and they have a different opinion on something we're doing you quickly recalled what you had done and the research you did and i think you came to the right decision and i'm sticking with your decision i think the other town has it wrong you preserve some very complex issues for us stuff that's never been touched in 20 years you've done it i don't think you need to change after two years the other situation was 20 years of continual redoing of a contract and when i came in and some other people came in we saw that century oh maybe at some point was doing a good job and i didn't think at that point at the end was up to date on all of our laws and voila we're changing sign ordinances and everything else that we're probably not constitutional we have an unconstitutional law we could be in litigation for years it's no good you've kept us out of that and let's talk about timing because they say in the world time ladies and gentlemen i couldn't possibly think of a worse time to change city attorneys than what this city is facing right now this is the wrong time you're not going to get anyone better you're not going to get anyone for less and ask yourself if you're voting fred wildly out because you really think that's what's good for the city or are you doing it for a different reason i don't see how anyone could answer that this is good for the city at this point in time six months from now probably a year or two years down the road no you don't go testing the water with your city attorney all right he's doing a good job but she's doing a good job you have my total support and for any reason you don't want to come back here i will give you a recommendation anytime for what it's worth you've had my total support as mayor as attorney you're an excellent attorney i would be honored to continue with our town so i ask you please reconsider so well i want to address the point leader has raised and you you have your approach to things i have mine i have no problem whatsoever addressing any question related to the bill i'm not insulted i'm not um anything other than i want i i go through and detail it the way that i do and i've always done this because i think the client needs to know what i'm doing who i was doing it with what was involved and how long it took and when i interviewed for this job i said i would do it down to the minute not down to the six minutes or not down to the uh quarter hour some attorneys do it that way i told joel i would do it to the minute and i've done that if there's ever a question about the bill i'm happy to address it if there's any reason that i should you know modify it if somebody proposes that i would consider it i'm not going to sit here and tell you i'm going to do it but i would at least consider it i've tried to be fair i tried to be professional about it and i have also as a matter of course for a long long period of time detailed bills and put the task i took and if there was a reason that i thought that i shouldn't charge as much time i put how much time it actually took and then i've charged something less i mean there's times i i don't maybe i shouldn't feel guilty but if you're on a hole for 20 minutes which is a common thing now if you call somebody i don't really feel like i can charge the client 20 minutes when i'm on hold listening to the same song 500 times so you know i i've tried to be precise about it and i i'm not offended if somebody has a question about the bill some of the things i wish i didn't have to spend time with be quite honest with you but i i have there's two attorneys on the council you all know as well as i do that ethically you have to do things and you have to be thorough about doing that cool stuff and i've been thorough about doing that and unfortunately some of those things take a little time to sort through so that's unfortunately that's what i've had to do on occasion so that's where i stand i hope that's a good clarification for rita and others council and open up to the citizens then if anyone would like to speak please come up here i don't know if the mic is on but if it's not let up green just push the button just give us your name address uh okay uh richard haggarty 119 9th street uh sir we don't we've not formally met uh so i don't know um him personally but uh i'm not a lawyer but i will say i do know a little something about selfless service and i i really just want to recognize you because you obviously as i sit in the back of these meetings you're in a very polarized situation and certainly nothing is easy beyond these meetings behind these meetings so really i just wanted to i guess on to behalf of myself my my wife and my dog say that as a citizen of the dog counts but as citizens uh are we our family appreciates that you gutted out and try to deal with this again very difficult uh situation i'd ask the council a hypothetical question i'm looking for an answer because obviously i'm not privy to all of the inner workings and meetings and conferences but it seems odd and this is the first time i've heard anything that there may be a concern over performance or billing or ethics or advice or anything of this gentleman's performance if we are we are as a group voting him out based on the first sign or the first issue of problems again i don't really want to get into that argument i would just say that it's it would be unique to try to replace somebody if we didn't at least try to as an organization if there are issues sit down discuss them and maybe try to find if there's a better way to do things moving forward i don't really uh have not spent any time with the law but i can tell you the last 12 months just moving here i've spent a lot more time with the law so uh you're maneuvering between all the bel air shore and everything else it has been noble and i just want to say thank you and and my house at least supports you anything worthwhile is never easy and i say that again as someone who's spent a couple years in the selfless service business so thank you thank you just randomly john hanson 22nd street i've expressed that more than one occasion um my gratitude to mr riley one-on-one and so i won't belabor that what i'd like to say is i'm a taxpayer this council works for me and every other taxpayer in the city there's an underlying current in this current council that in my opinion is undermining the forward progress we're trying to accomplish in this city and now it's gotten to this i missed the july meeting because it was on vacation and that's when this all started and apparently based on the resignation letter mr riley certain words and how they were used in their context is what prompted him to make this resignation i've attended most every council meeting and many of the work sessions mr ronnie epitomizes and it's true most people don't like lawyers i have extreme respect for this gentleman the fact that he's not billing astronomical fees or whatever so i'm going to concur with a couple of the members who have spoken out and say you need to retain mr rowley as the city attorney you're in the process of the budget session i'm assuming we're using private counsel for the lawsuit then i'm sure mr karate is somehow going to wind up being involved in it real intelligent decision to change more stream just remember you work for us the taxpayers you should not have a personal agenda serving the city and if that's the problem as we said at last meeting if that's a real problem and you can't look yourself in yourself in the mirror and say you don't have a personal problem you need to step down you need to step down now because i'm over this i'm really over this i only have two opportunities to convey my opinion one is here one's at the ballot box and i'll guarantee you i don't miss an opportunity to vote i defended that for 24 years you would not take that away from me i will remember thank you thank you [Music] whenever we were interviewing attorneys i was one of the two people that did not vote for fred riley if i had to face that decision again i would not do it i'm sorry i i just i thought that we could do better and um i still stand behind that but it's nothing personal it's just that's the way i feel i think with each and every council member in this room says they make a decision based on what they believe is best for the city and all the residents i take that and face value because i think they do that whatever their reasons are i think at the end of the day they are making a decision based on what they think is best for the city of belarus and the residents i think everybody who's come to this job has risen above the personal thing and although maybe something brought them initially to the council they have figured out there are other things that are above and beyond that personal agenda and at the end of the day it's what's best for the city and for the residents so my conscience is clear i take a little exception to anybody stepping up and saying we make decisions based on personal things well no at the end of the day what brought us to the job was making good solid rational decisions for the good of the city and for the residents that's all i have thank you riley i just came down from five days at convention and it wasn't sitting out of the pool because there was no pool the pool was destroyed they were rebuilding it it wasn't it was going to have fun they worked from 7 30 in the morning and you know how much of an early morning person for 5 30 6 30 at night seminar after seminar vice mayor god has been to these he knows what they're all about okay one of the things that i'm not going to sit and do a recitation of everything that i learned but i learned quite a bit and one of the things that stuck in my mind was they said when you go and when you've been elected and remember they're coming to all the elected officials in florida that come to this they said people in the city put you there to use your experience and your talents for the good of your city lord knows we all on this council give our time for this city okay we don't get paid i don't know if people realize that but um we give our time freely because we want to help the city i'm going to use my experience i'm going to use my legal experience and i've seen a lot of good lawyers in the day and i've seen a lot of bad ones you're an excellent one and i don't throw that compliment around please ask some of the people i've been against i don't say that about derrick we don't okay it would not be a good decision in my opinion vote to remove you at this point in time not just now not six months now i see no reason to do it at all you've not given me a reason oh i may not like that you don't always side with me as frank banker said we're gonna give us information sometimes that we don't like i have to do it with clients they want to go on around the bank no you can't do that they don't want to hear that okay well i gotta tell you you can't do it i gotta tell you your case isn't as strong as it is you give it to us straight you give it to us in a very calm and rational manner which sometimes this council can use i'm as guilty as anyone else 10 percent player here you and dr akio seem to keep us grounded i don't want to know what it would be like as some attorney would be screaming and yelling but if you want to know what it's like to watch the videos from two years ago go watch it john kansas laughing i remember that john hansen being disrespected see that happened man's learned that's that's the truth of the name he thought so that we could be doing this and that other guy who was talking about the service that's colonel richard hagerty i salute him every time he comes here that's a leader of men so these people that are standing in your corner telling you how much they respect you take the backgrounds that they bring and the experience that they bring when you make your decision that i'm going to ask you to make in a few minutes if you're going to stay on for us because i value everyone's opinion but when i hear those people talk to our citizens yeah i'm not making the right decision i'm with you council members if there's no other comments i'm going to ask mr riley point blank if you're going to stay with us here and then we will told the president will vote on this well last at the last meeting one of the comments i made was i listened to the tape and i could count and if you can count then you can tell what whether you have a support or not subsequent to the meeting that i wasn't present at i had four people that asked me to reconsider and express an interest in having me say and i would like to do that but it's up to you all if you don't want me to then don't then vote for the rfp and that'll be it and then the next question is when when should i depart when would that be best for the city it's that simple so if this function fails and you'll stay on them for us and receive your uh we'll retract your resignation notice i intend to i would responding to what robin asked i i wouldn't do it for six months i would do want to do another year contract that certainty for me although if you know there's a provision that gives either party 30 days if something happens and i win the powerball three months from now then i probably won't feel as inclined to stay or if something goes drastically wrong and y'all want to make a change you can do that again i'm talking to the council as a whole and two of you are lawyers lawyers are supposed to make it easy for the client to change if the client has a desire to change lawyers and i've tried to do that so to answer your question directly if four of you want me to stay i will say and i will hope things will go better thank you and thank you for reconsidering you didn't even have to be there for us i'm done yeah i'm still a little vague it's not clear my mind did your was your resignation letter conditional i don't remember reading anything in there traditionally just said this is that resign as of this date i'm i am going to provide services up until this date to provide internal coverage for the city but i don't remember meeting any terminal it was not conditional at all it was definitive and i got to the meeting and three people had asked me to stay and one of them an additional person was not present and as i said last at the meeting two weeks ago i have not presumed to know exactly where she would come down i thought that was a better decision for her to make and she wasn't there to make it i thought that was only fair too you know i i think the council is giving animal opportunity to say i withdraw my resignation so if you don't say forthright i'm i'm withdrawing my resignation letter and there's no conditions in the resignation there have been my question does it still stand or doesn't it it's a or b i'll withdraw my resignation letter and if you all vote uh four to three to put out an rfp then tomorrow you'll be giving a new resignation letter so how's that for clarity that's that's a clarity i saw it thank you is there any other council comments dave gaddison you got the last story no the council comments a good day to last word all i'm going to do is ask you nicely and respectfully to reconsider because you know this council is broken and i'm afraid you're going to get pulled into something that you're not going to want so might not be a bad idea to save yourself while you can i'll go back to you i'm not going to take that as last words i i find that to be one of the most astounding comments that have been made to me in 35 years and let me explain myself basically i feel that this is a toxic environment and i'm afraid that you're going to get swayed one direction or the other and that someone's going to take you down the wrong path and that's all i'm going to say that is not a threat what that is is i i feel badly that you have to work in this environment well i i appreciate you looking out for me and i i say that with all sincerity again the i i have repeatedly referred to a rule that the florida bar has for representing the organization and i have repeatedly referenced that in various situations that we've dealt with and i have done everything i could to make sure that i was following that rule and i mean obviously you know something that i probably don't but i mean the easy thing believe me for me to do is to walk away from this situation and that i could i could have done that six months into the job and i considered doing it six months into the job but i committed to doing the job and i have remained on and i have done my level best to try and work with everybody so i i'm again astounded with the comment because i mean i i defy somebody to find something that i have done ethically improperly because i haven't i've gone to extraordinary wings to do things the appropriate way and i i would have hoped several of y'all would have recognized that but you know i i don't know what to say to that come and i'm i kind of know what to say um to me that sounded like a threat whether one you want to call it or not i somehow don't feel like you have his person like you're worried about him personally i think that's a veiled passive-aggressive attempt of hiding what you're trying to say which i believe is a threat i would also say that this man has a lot of integrity to not be swayed and maybe some other people on this council don't have their own personal integrity where they may themselves be able to be swayed but i do not see that in fred reilly i think no matter what you do he's going to tell you the truth whether you like the truth or you don't and i don't care if you think he's your friend or not if you're wrong he's going to tell you wrong and i have 100 confidence in him so i i'm also astounded by your comment and honestly i'm offended for fred that you made that well i'd like to respond to that i'm gonna go to frank banker and come back to you i'll go through another round of counsel then dave i'll come back to you first in the next round sure you've got coupe and trades had a couple so let's get frank and spinning out i i missed the warp session in july and i had poor hearing i didn't know what it was clear clearly voting on i got his resignation i emailed him right away and i apologized i voted for that now i've only been on council since march with mr gaddis's comments what skeletons are in the closet that i don't know about it sounds like there's a bomb ready to go off that mr riley's involved in um i don't know i mean that's just pretty astounding words that you made there i mean whoever sits in that chair is going to be liable for something that's what attorneys do but with the comment that you make mr guess i just don't know where that's coming from before i go back to other council comments him coming back to the next round first okay there's two questions directed at you and i want you to frame your response but let's go but you want me to hear them all when you're disciplined too right i'm an attorney i'm insulted by that comment [Music] your ability to represent the client we've sent out multiple emails on this which is the bar rule okay [Music] you have um once in my opinion showed anyone on this council any favoritism he told it like it is there is the law here's my research here's my legal advice some people have taken your legal advice some people have declined your legal advice another thing i learned in the meeting i learned this the first time i went they said it again it hasn't changed in two years you're safe when you take your city attorney's advice 34-hour ethics course that we must take legally over and over and over again talk to your city attorney talk to your city attorney talk to your city attorney if you got a question the city attorney may not always tell you hey what you want to do is gonna fly with the epic schools or what have you brother riley has told me things that i'm like really yeah i don't like that i don't like it but that was his teddy bear i believe you will take no sides in anything other than the client side which is the city of bel air beach i have zero doubt that you can ethically separate your responsibilities and friendship with an individual or liking or disliking an individual shouldn't change your legal viewpoint and advice one eye okay and i have never seen that happen for anyone who thinks that there is an ethics problem the florida bar has multiple safeguards in place on that for anybody who would do that you wouldn't get their first base with paragraph wasting your paper and stamp right i'm behind you 100 my to clarify i have watched for the last two years you get beat up over and over by one person on this council you've been corrected over and over and over i can't tell you how many times you've presented us with your work your hard-earned labor and then you're sent back to do it a second third and fourth time because it didn't please a higher rule of law in what you offer i also see that you're doing a lot of personal work right now basically a certain council member is directing you to do research that may not necessarily be in the best interest of the city i'm not really sure where it's going but what i can tell you is that it looks to me as if you are possibly getting into that gray area where maybe not your behavior is questionable but the orders that you're having to take are and i i don't have any problem with you personally mr riley i think that you've done the best with the circumstances you've been given however where we are right now with everything that's going on i think that we weren't given clear instructions you were asked a certain night to explain exactly what it was that we were doing wrong and you failed to do that and now here we are and i lost confidence in your work effective that night uh so i uh again i uh it's nothing personal but i just i no longer have confidence in your work and i would prefer that we move forward with the rfp and i respectfully ask you to to consider uh not retracting your resignation and that's it i'm done we passed along here folks mr guy got next [Music] he passed away our job is to pass the best law we possibly can mr riley makes up a proposed law it's our job as a council hone that law test that law and make sure that what we pass is a proper feather constitutional law because if you don't do that problems can be enormous i've heard people on the internet i just pass it they're defendants in lawsuits right now that's not the way you run a city as they told me when i went to the meeting that you all paid for i'm bringing back my knowledge here use the knowledge you have to help your city how many times have you heard frank our newest member talking about his vast construction experience on certain things he gives an insight to it each person has separate insight into their areas mine happens to be law i'm going to attack the hell out of any law that he passed to make sure it's fair and it's going to pass muster better i attack it and some attorney attacks it in a federal lawsuit now we'll get to a real heart of what this is about mr vancouver looked at me and he talked about that he didn't give clear direction i'm not going to talk about the detail but i'm going to talk about the date date was july i believe sixth or seventh two thousand of what twenty go watch the tape folks it's a long conference it's in the middle and you'll hear direction given multiple times clearly listen to it it's out there you'll hear the city attorney i said don't do this and certain people did it now city space he gave the right answer it's on that tape to watch it again franklin england said last week you don't like the answer yet but the [Music] mr chair if we have met the prescribed protocol i respect my request we just called the laws okay so we have a motion called the question um i looked this one up because i thought you might do this i need a second second no debate patty all right i need a roll call vote to hold question at this point this is only to call the question roll call vote by individual yes vote will get us to call the question immediately and continue to debate when they continue the debate mayor can i just verify that council member swope is still on the phone because i can't see it from here are you still with us yes i am hear us clearly yes clearly okay there is a vote to call the question at this point madam clerk please council member aki no council member banker no council member gunn aye council member otero aye council member slope aye vice mayor gathers aye [Music] mayor manchin no you have two-thirds vote you have seven people two-thirds of seven is one five i believe right help me out here folks in a long five days two thirds seven six five four point six that means five motion fails debate continues i'm done we have frank i think [Music] well the last time i looked at the calendar it was 2021. if you're referring to july of 2020 and is that correct mr guys i don't know what specific date it is well are you saying that you lost confidence in them back in july last year or last year i'm saying that a certain question was was asked and the answer was unclear and basically that's not the first time that's happened many more times the mayor has answered those questions well if you've lost confidence in the marriage the right did not vote for okay but you lost confidence in the city attorney a year ago then why didn't you put this thing in motion then to get rid of you and not until now i do not have to answer that all right well i'm just saying that's my question he's declined it and you know he's going to support that process [Music] [Music] um i was going to say that regarding what he said about the unclear my thing is if something's unclear ask for clarification if you were unclear about it before you voted you shouldn't have voted until you were clear and if this information was unclear then maybe or whatever his if his answer was unclear to you and unclear to everybody then it maybe should have been a 7-0 vote because we all got the same information so again i think this goes back to personal feelings personal involvement in litigation and i think from what glenn was saying and what people out there are saying we need to focus on the city not ourselves if some of these folks that i voted if i was just going about me i probably would have voted the way i did but i listened to my constituents as we all said we would and did what's best for them so again if something's not clear how many times have i been like i'm sorry can i'm not a lawyer can you explain this i'm you know i'm fully able to say that so if something's not clear ask for more information until it is clear so you can't go back your vote you own it you can't say well i didn't understand it sorry that you should have said something before you voted so i don't think that's a good excuse i can't say oh i cut the wrong artery i didn't understand the textbook that's not gonna apply in court i'm just saying two things bring back her not helping me get new votes i'm not gonna put you on my real action yet i'm just playing with it um but to the point not sure about something you're not sure about the city attorney's advice tell you something that we've done here many times john hansen has seen this happen because he comes every council meeting you table emotion you don't go ahead with it you know i just saw something on tv and it's sad it's not funny because this was real and the guy died and they were bungie jumping off a bridge he thought that the guy said it was time to go it wasn't they hadn't hooked [Music] like ask okay hey i'm not clear i want a memo i want a legal memo from you mr riley or i want some research because we're not clear here we're in some gray area i'm not getting the right lodge let's table this thing you're done and bring it back and then vote on it and make an intelligent decision and that's if it was not clear so that's the way you handle it when there's not clarity we have the right to understand the legal advice and i think fred is usually very clear with it but in his defense in any other city terms of defense i was told you can't talk to the city attorney in advance well that's what city attorneys like they don't like to be blindsided they like to know you know what we got a problem here take a look at such and such in relation to what's coming up on our agenda tonight there's no city attorney in the world where you can throw legal questions and get instant answers there's none in the world and if you're looking for that person they don't exist as city attorneys they don't exist as criminal defense attorneys they don't exist as litigation in terms they just don't exist the law is encompasses libraries and values of information and even sometimes the spread knows you know when you started searching it you just came up with something one i'll go over there [Music] i'd like to to say a couple different things um and and i'm trying to say it in the most professional way i possibly can this has been a city council that has had a divide and it has been difficult working with the city council that is divided and but good lord knows i have tried and i have spent the time doing the job i have to tell you that the job is far different than what i thought it would be i thought it would be a job where i would be writing ordinances resolutions and reviewing contracts and coming to meetings to ensure there was due process that's what i thought this job was going to be it has been something far different dave i have to say i am still just absolutely taken back with your comment because um i i try to temper my personal feelings about things but um that how am i supposed to function in this type of environment when i have a group that is has conflict over every single thing that comes down the pike and you know i could take that as a threat the way that you stated it i i don't know at times i'm i i should take things from the way they're sad and why why should i continue in a position and maybe that's the reason to say it but why should i continue trying to do this job under the circumstances that i have right now i'm not getting paid a fortune to do it i mean this this is whether you all realize it or not i have done the job that y'all really need somebody to do the one job i have not done is i have not been the referee fighting between the different factions that are fighting with each other i have not done that i told you up front i wouldn't do that because that's not my role i can't counsel the whole seven group of seven people if i'm taking sides and i've tried not to take sides i think the big biggest problem i have is some of you all have a perception that i'm taking sides i i have gone to tremendous links not to take sides and i've to do my job and for me to have done professionally what i've done here and to be sitting here and getting what i think anybody would perceive as a threat is just absolutely off the chart amazing to me so i i i guess i i need i'm going to ask the chairman for a five minute recess because i want to decide what i'm going to do because i in many ways i'm inclined not to go forward working with this group of people under these circumstances because it's really not fair to me to do that mr ryan i don't want you to think that i'm threatening you what i'm trying to do is tell you that you're putting yourself in an environment that is basically because of everything that's going on i'm not allowed to discuss it i'm not allowed to discuss it i can't get my reasoning out well i was aware i'm taking you know five minutes and explain but leslie hasn't said much and i i think it's becoming very obvious what mr hamzik said that the underlying current in the city council is destroying our city and this is evidence of it i agree with robin's comment earlier that if you're going to resign wait till after the next election things may change the whole council may change the underlying incivility the divisiveness within the council may surely change and that would be my my hope for what we do he asked a rhetorical question why should i stay on the job because that threat was by one person there are seven of us total and four of us truly believe in you and i think the other three do or other two do as well on the level but majority totally believes in you and don't let one person one threat sway you because this isn't a uh a council of a dictator where one person gets to say it it's seven votes so don't let one person's opinion or statements sway you when there's definitely four people that have you in the highest regards and believe in you and want you to stay on not only but also citizens and i've never from any sentence i've ever talked to ever heard one bad thing if anything i've heard wow that's tough for him i'm like you have no idea you have no idea how tough it is and nor should you be the referee i've had to step up you know gaddis has stepped up to the point of orders to stop fights just because you know things get crazy so no you shouldn't have to referee the only thing time you should stop it is if we're getting into some legal area where it needs to be stopped but otherwise no you're not supposed to referee right you don't have a bag of popcorn ready and just watch the show so um so that's why you should stay for me for frank for joe and for leslie who just truly believe in you mr ryan that's for brief returns 7 10 right now i don't want to give you just five minutes i'd like to give you 20 minutes um so that you can deliberate if you want to speak with mr gaddis or anyone else of course i'm just going to say it we all must be mindful of the florida sunshine rules so that there's you know we're speaking to fred but he's the intermediary so we can't we can't be commenting on what somebody else said but certainly history is the conference room open can you make it open he'll make it open and he can hold court in there i'm going to ask for 20 minutes in germany first without motion please motion made my friend second all in favor all right hi unanimous read this whole button here we're turned until 7 20 at 7 30. hello everyone it's 7 47 we're back on the record i allowed the conversation on this blood council now [Music] well dave can make a comment if he'd like but him and i had a very um thorough conversation about things and i i think i have a better understanding of where he was coming from and i hope he has a better understanding where i was coming from um i for for a thousand percent clarity um there there was no threat directed to me and i am content with it and so i i have to put things behind me so that one's behind me now and i would um certainly he can comment if he wants but i i would i'll make this a condition of me i don't want to discuss that that aspect again okay so i would appreciate it if that's not brought up because it's irrelevant and i'm the only one that has to be concerned about that and i am absolutely not concerned so um that that's all i'd like to say about that and i again i appreciate the council giving me him the opportunity to have a few minutes and have a discussion before i go to any other council members i want to give you the opportunity if he wishes to speak not really so i'm uh i'm i think that fred another resolve some differences and that's all i'm going to say i don't know many other comments date guys was your emotion last word call a question question one request authorization for the city manager to advertise for legal services for the city attorney again mr rally before i pull this question you are now willing to stay if this vote is another element yes with that said i mean this will be a wall fall go please yes council member ochi no councilmember banker no councilmember gunn hi council member notaro no councilmember slo i [Music] vice mayor gavis oh mayor manzo no by the vote of five or two to five the motion fads mr riley i'm looking forward to working with you as our council [Applause] and ask for a motion to adjourn backward second second anyone uh we're adjourned"
