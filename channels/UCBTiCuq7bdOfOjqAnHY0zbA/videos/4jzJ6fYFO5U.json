    "transcript": "good evening everyone it's 6 pm on June 17th this is a special city council meeting bring to order and now let's say Pledge of Allegiance Pledge Al flag United States of americe Rene would you please call the rooll council member Frank Banker council member Lloyd Roberts here council member Kim Shaw Elliot pres mayor Dave gtis here city manager Kyle reefer here all right thank you Renee we have one item or actually two the first is for approval of the agenda do I have a motion to approve so move made by Kimi do I have a by Frank Banker all in favor I any opposed all right the agenda is approved and we're on item two this is for consideration of increasing quantities of b2301 Street and drainage improvement from night Street to Morgan drive to maintain a consistent flow line in Valley curb on certain nearly level streets and replace curb on 22nd Street um you have the FL thank you mayor um so I this item agend or this item on the agenda is to cover the current St water project that um we are we started at Morgan drive and we moved from 25th to 23rd um and then now we're down here working on Cedar Spruce and pal but this this item will discuss um specifically Street 23rd Street where we're seeing uh you know the curb is not it's atypical it's not your your standard Valley curve and um there's some factors involved on that street that uh our engineer Larry FL is going to explain um and you know what his recommendation is for that street um so the reason that it says uh to discuss increasing quantities a lot of these items are already on the bid um it's a matter of um increasing the quantity to achieve the level of um the full line that we want to see in the curve as well as um the the typical be shape at the fall for the for the Lara Terin um it also discusses 22nd Street 22nd Street was the curb on that street was left out of the original bid um but the curve is in in rough shape and after going out there and looking at it I asked l boy to give us a cost estimate of what what CA would incur to replace that curve it's a little different because the street was already resurfaced in 2022 so it's it's going to um invol somewhat of a change order because the the valley Curve will need to be carefully cut and removed and reported back into place so I'm going to pass it to uh City contract engineer Larry fluty and he's going to give us a presentation of where we're at thus far in the project hello Mr good even good Larry G engineer uh I'll again where we are at we're uh contractors made it uh from uh 23rd 24th up in the North End project and he's working working South there and then of course jumping down out to seear the here Mr PL can I uh talk to you in the pull of the microphone a little closer to okay there we go how's that sort now I can hear me the anyway the the work uh for the project is uh taking out the existing curve and Milling the existing payment uh one in the existing 1 in and then replacing it with an inch and a half of asphalt and replacing the curve and the curve that the direction that that we given the contractor is the curve is to be constructed with A continuous fall so that when the uh when it's laid and done they'll have a continuous flow no puddling or any any low spots and things like that the uh transitions into the driveways you know to be smooth and uh and then at the ANS uh at golf and bore they have to you know make sure that we meet and match the existing Pap the difficulties that sometimes we have with that need of meeting the existing grade at Gulf and down at Bayshore and the road being so flat the difficulty is getting enough drop to uh lay in the gr lay in the I think up in the screen to the next as you can see here uh some of the uh issues that we have particularly on the photo on the on the right hand side that's uh 23rd down at the at 23rd and Gulf where the existing uh uh walk R meets meets the road so it's it's an area that's ping in itself uh and that's what we're having to tie into uh another issue coming up is on 19th that's the photo on the left and replacing the existing ribbon curve and trying to get in a curving gutter on that so that's that's going to take something you can also see that the existing uh driveways are at the gter better elevation so we're going to have to uh really uh consider what we can do there to to make this project work I'll go ahead and move on to 22nd 22nd Street uh we're Sal cutting uh the uh the curb and leaving leaving Al the payment is just put on there and uh we'll do that and this this represents the limits of the work and uh so with that uh we we created our quantities for that and uh based upon our estimate for to work on the 22nd uh we estimated that you know that the the cutting the salt cutting the valley curb replacement uh restoration of some of the concrete areas restoration of driveways and U and then any miscellanous work as far as any sprinkler or or utilities we estimate that project to be around 250 593 any questions so far on that any questions Council yeah on the um I do sure on the um 19th Street you said there's currently the ribbon gutters in there um I really feel like and I'm everybody would agree our real objective there is just to make sure whatever we have there is in fact moving the water to where we wanted to be moved to get into a drainage system so I live on 20 so I drive by the all the time I know we had a pretty decent rain last night so I went by there this morning and there's there's zero standing water on those quote ribbon gutters okay so to me from my perspective I don't care if they're a valley gutter or a vertical gutter or a ribbon gutter the water is moving to a grain somewhere which is really our ultimate goal right so I don't know if we necessarily you're refer to you have to force um you know Miami gotter Valley gutter on that street if in fact what would be the benefit of trying to transition from that ribbon gutter to a valley gutter as long as the water currently is moving the way it's supposed to well that's the big plus right there that the water is moving and it's getting off there so that's that great so makes it a little bitas if we had puddling right or lers it would be a little bit more difficult uh my initial thoughts of of that area is you know where we have that plat ribbon curve if we put in a uh a v like a 1 in deep V it look like the r curve they The Edge edges would match the existing elevation so the the say it's a 1 in heat V with water already flowing that should get it to should get it to the in so that's that's kind of what I'm looking at okay so you're increasing the volume yes now helps direct the flow down there yet and increase the volume more volume the faster come off the curve and just a point of information again I mentioned that I'm on 20th and for whatever reason the water flows two directions and it flows well so from the most um look at the midpoint of the road um with respect to East West right at the midpoint for the most part the water flows the um eastern part of the road the water flows towards the inter Coastal from the middle of the road towards go Boulevard flows to go B bar so it's going into County's drain which is fine but it moves it goes I just want to make sure that the contractor understands it because I'd hate for them to attempt to make it all flow One Direction which could be more of a challenge as long as right now the water is Flowing basically from the center position of that road in two different directions and it works fine that's on 20th about halfway right about halfway right and you can tell I can always tell by the U irrigation systems in the morning so like my neighbor who lives pretty much in the middle when his irrigation system runs all the water runs towards go bar the next house over when their irrigation system runs it runs towards day and again it flows good so it's worth it to start I get with the contractor make sure we doing something that Contin that yeah so in this case in the about halfway down the street it would float downhill now I can't remember the survey picked that up that may have and uh so yeah certainly those you know make sure close the way that gravity wants it to go okay so on the one more on the 22nd Street um I had a little bit of a conversation with Kyle today so the median area in the middle so what was what was the cost to put in new curving just around that area 38 38,000 somewhere around that's the vertical curve okay that's going be vertical correct let right so what um so if it was your money what do you think what's the value in changing that out what we have there is certainly not going to affect anything with regards to drainage it's just more Aesthetics than it depends on the condition of the vertical curve you know once you start you know Milling in there and looking if it's really got a lot of fractures and tracks in it then I replace it if it looks good and solid then that's you may need to make a decision whether or not to place it or just leave there okay any other questions yes just so I understand what the options are am I correct in understanding that we have about a $250,000 increase to remove the just laid curves and replace them with v curv and are you saying that an alternative is to essentially cut out a portion of that curve to make it more like a V is that understanding correct for 22nd Street it's uh since the PVE is there it and it's fairly new and recent the goal is to uh how do you separate the the older Cur the the curbing Gutter and the vertical curve which is in the median and a clean way of separating that and getting that out is to saw cut between the curve and the pavement and then now allows that curve to be removed and then new curve placed formed in place so that's that's what we're proposing on on 22nd 22nd Street is not new none of the Cur is new on this area this is this was overlooked um it Bud for whenever that street was the 23rd Street is and that and that wasn't done by machine that was done by for for so question at hand is laid those forms and graded it out leveled it out who's at fault us or the contract because if it was done by I mean the machines that have the Daya Valley curve they're going to they're going to correct themselves because so yes but when you're doing it by stick sticking water um you're using a crude 3T 6t level um which ends up with results that were having so my only look I want this done right and and I have neighbors that had this done years ago and they had problems and they still have water laying in the street as of yesterday last night um so I just want to done right but I think there's other people should get some consideration too this when you sorry you said there's water in the street the streety valley they get it they get it just nor regular and it lays particular house L corrected after they got brought was council meeting I was looking at this he's always complaining he mosit and everything a comment about that I made um I had the same question in terms of the fact that we know it's flat here and so what about the new curbs that have been done and if they did not properly account for uh the need for the slope who accountability is that and I asked I asked our City attorney to take a look at that question well I would say it goes back on your contractor it's not it goes back to the engineer F they're following the pl I you have to lift it to get the range like talking about now extra as why would you my whole question is why would you lay something out Kyle uh whatever some of these streets were done was it pretty much a rip out the damaged cracked um problem areas that were aesthetically ugly and uh they they were having problems with water flowing because there were cracks all out but whenever they put them back they put them back to the same way that they were originally designed is that how some of these these uh these areas continue to have problems well um with the existing um just an every storm rer project we've done um yeah it's got sunken curve it's got broken curb um but when they remove that curb the idea is to you got your high point you got your low point to make it uh as consistent as possible throughout now a lot of our streets the streets themselves um vary where they go down flat and out sometimes even go up each side of the crown is different um but as you can see with every Mal C we've installed the different contractors and resar of streets there's no perfect situation where where every curve can FL perfectly um there's a lot of elements that I was hoping Larry could cover these and kind of show and contractor too can speak to it that when they're out there there's a lot of adjustments that need to be made um and and they're forming up these entire streets um measuring it out string line I know they have the curb machines now but I don't know with all variables if this C curb machine could do better job even when they did M at ble and everything like that hand I'm thinking like my God it takes so Dam long I you can wa a lot of footage have access yeah to dat no contractor has used Cur machine on a other questions this particular um sheet that shows the profile view of 23rd Street is that the finished profile view or was this the profile view that was given to the contractor as to how you wanted it laid this is this is the existing profile view and and we're Project's not changing the Centerline profile of and and I believe what I wanted to show I mean some of the challenges that contractors and us have had on the project is that it's so flat and particularly on 23 the uh some of the numbers here on on that on that profile you see on the up end up around gol Boulevard the elevations around ground elevations around 5.8 down at bore it's five 4.58 right that gives us a 022 foot per foot slope that's about 268 in a foot or it's two 2.6 in every 100 ft it's very FL right so that's it's a difficult project just because of that and where was this taken like at the crown of the road the middle of the road that is along the Crown Road okay so the these are challenges the when we say all right we lift up one end to make sure that we have a bigger slow we can only uh lift up so for because we're constrained by gold Boulevard and bore and U so with with those is our beginning beginning and ending point really puts us at a constraint of how much slope we can put into that how was it your dream before K were there any issues on that particular Road Main Events we have um video footage before um shot all those curves um you can see stains on on the concrete water it was a dry day when they videoed it I don't recall specifically that street weren't there also some uh draining drainage issues with the check Val so we had some issues back then we've had some backup on Bay short um this eventually close too um but as far as you know what I don't have the actual profile except for the existing survey and video to to what it rules prior so the the 23rd Street issue that we have today so the is approximately $63,000 to do what needs to be done and if that's done you're fairly confident that the water's going to go where we want it to go yes how thick is the valley curve the bottom roughly 6 in in any way you can reduce that to like dig it down to about so run so instead of having 6 in at the end you're only around four which is going to give you a better better run off but you're digging down the things to be careful about you know say we can get a deeper area with yeah we're still limited to it goes into an inlet de elevation that's what I'm saying and and that so we still got that constraint so item number three there is really the biggest cost $35,000 and that's for the the driveway paper restoration how many how many driveways is that for that just seems like a lot hold on well I didn't bring my account on the number driveway so so are there it's half papers half concrete when I was doing the numbers I'm looking and when we do that we're we're just I'm assuming we're we're removing the existing cers and then putting them back yeah let's see my account here about 10 some of them are around but it looks like as far as um half about five of 10 about half the other five are concrete yeah it's it's almost half and half on 23rd but but that's effectively all labor right we're not we're not buying any additional materials to do that broken Pap okay so if we break it or they were already break broken we're talking about the the papers that are in the driveway of the homeowners but they're already broken and they crumble and they take them out and they'll have bu matching chall now the the cost that we have in for pavers is for new pavers so if we use the existing we end up using the existing uhuh then we save some money okay so would you be comfortable saying that that $63,000 is a concern conservative estimate yeah any other questions right now thank you Mr fluty I'm going to uh take comments from the citizens and uh and then whenever we uh a motion is made into de we call you back it just helps it'll be fine would any citizens like to comment yes sir uh anyone except for unless you live on 22nd you're not allowed to come come on sir please step up to the podium and give us your name and address uses this one that's fine as long as I can as long as he has a mic Mr Mayor ladies and gentlemen of the council my name Corner property Southeast Corner G 23 Street right now on the screen you see what what uh we had before the bsh curve and the water was gr roll of mouse might as well just this is the existing one no V shap curve uh the from the beginning of the driveway the words go it's a negative pitch one and a half in water stays there by by uh uh the walkway the last night rain some people were trying to jump their land in the water that's a Southeast corner of go in 23 that's what we have we sh C water flowing down all the way Cur was broken in many places and it was uh uh was building uh so it is it's all cve uh this is the difference uh right there where the curve the new work starts on go and 23 going down towards B so this is the beginning the negative pitch that's what you see the difference here it is the new curve and the exist one govern 23 this is the the end um B sh and uh 23 the first 12 ft of the curb has approximately 2 and 1/2 in of pitch 12 ft this is not there you go from here so the engineers said approximately on every 100 ft we have 2 and 1/2 in of pitch to use but here on 12 ft only they use 2 and 1/2 inch as the beginning very short and3 uh this is how much higher uh the the outside edge of the curve is towards the um the asphal it's about 2 and2 in from what it was and it's consistent the bottom of the street to the top of the street that's the bottom 2 and2 in that's the top of the street by me so obviously it was by Design so this is in red you see the existing the curve that was taken out and in black on top you see the existing one so you see that the v-shaped curve is gone it's replaced with a flat one which is 2 and 1/2 in Higher by the street level the asph and technically 5 and2 inch uh we lost of the the the curve the b-shaped curve right by the middle over the Flo here is diagram that I brought you last time negative pitch uh no pitch in front of the driveway and after that P starts so with all this work proposed we going to do nothing unless the negative pit is removed which means to do the whole curve all all these thousands of dollars will do what nothing new that's what we did last night thank you I appreciate it thank you Rene did you get this gentleman's name and address thank you I'm sure that we'll be discussing this more later in the meeting yes sir hi presenting also yes I am but I'm going to start with everything that Nick okay and what is your name and address sir Pat Murphy uh I'm at 102 23rd Street can you guys hear me my wife tells me I generally don't need one it but um so I I leared a question Mr fluty was that survey that you used was there a survey done I'm sorry sir during citizen comments you you don't inquire our guests my first question I guess is was there a survey done and if so when the reason I asked that question is because today there was a representative from pelis not sure how he got there but that was looking at the street as well uh his conclusion was that there's plenty of pitch from the street he said it was six feet at G Boulevard and then four feet down at bore and then three at the exit to the uh to the inter Coastal now those round numbers to beg the question of a little bit of rounding there right but I it would be good to compare when the respective surveys were done the Gent from pelis did not know the date of his uh but he felt pretty strongly that absolutely that the way this was put in is not going to work and it's probably never going to work and you need to redo it and build a pitch into it because you do have the ele elevation differential to make it work the other conclusion he had was that apparently there was some work that took place toward G Boulevard uh actually uh it was it should be under the cognizance of pelis and they were concerned uh because he agreed with Nick's point on the pitch there that it's actually pushing water back out to go Boulevard which is a problem for them they prefer not to Happ so uh again I think this go back to survey a little bit to understand what we're looking at in reality there and then of course addressing the issue of having that flat Valley curve because it's it's completely negating the benefit of the previous uh the previous curve that we had I've been there for four years and honestly I never saw any issues with any significant cooling of water I know it was a little bit stained to to to K's Point um but in general it was very workable we didn't have any large areas of standing thank you Mr Murphy yes sir please come up that us your name and address John Hy 10322 um 22nd Street since we purchased that house back in 2015 those curves in front of our property have been damaged forever and ever and ever okay and I know watching water flow it flows from Gulf to bore there's no Crown going both ways um the other issue is will we residents get notice prior to if this is approved the contractor beginning any work I have irrigation Lines within that 6 in in behind the curb and probably within 6 in I have a fiber optic cable and if that gets cooked I have no television I have no internet no computer I need to know beforehand so they cut it they're going to have to pay to fix it I just all I'm asking is the courtesy of and heads up so that I can locate it for them before they start poing around with their equipment thank you Mr H I appreciate your comments thank you would any other citizens like to comment okay before we go to the council for discussion I'm going to need a motion to move forward with this uh this proposal motion motion made by Frank Banker do I have a second second by Mr Roberts all in favor now that's not an action way that sorry about that we congratulations no no um let's go to debate U Mr franker do you have the Flor um hopefully I appreciate all the citizens comments hopefully before anybody does any digging they call have Lin Loca okay they come out with the Snickers and the market Flags but my street yes they they didn't rip up anybody's fiber optic uh they did rip up a lot of water or sprinkle WS okay but they repaired them as they ripped them up so that's not issue my biggest issue is you have pictures of the old curve which shows a great pitch in so the design build plan the design build plan have Valley curve in it or did it have a flat curve because if we screwed up then we should pay get but if the contractor put in the wrong curve he should dig it out you know what I'm saying I will say it definitely looks thicker it looks higher well the whole radius isn't there I mean and that what I'm saying is I understand that you have minimal to work with but design build with the valley in there or was it not if it was flat we screwed up we said we need to pay um before I go to other council members what's your uh what's your opinion on that particular stre on 23rd I've let Larry speak on that I mean the idea was that we have a valley in the curve um we knew going forward that it wasn't going to be just that um but i' let comment on what time fluty would you like to come back up to the podium please sir would you like to address the uh concerns on 23rd yes the U the constraints that we have trying to make sure that the flow line from the Gulf makes it down to to Bay Shore and so that brought up the flow line to get enough to do that brought it up a little higher and and in that case I think I got it it's the the inverted or the flow way is it's not there as as it should be but I believe that with the construction bools is that it's because of bringing that up to get enough flow we kind of got got that wedge and to get flow in curve that's when the idea prodct maybe bringing in a little extra uh asphalt to keep it within that curve then that will get it down cuz if it gets down believe Maybe 50 down you get you got the curving gutter which is that am I looking at the corner of bore and 23rd in this this photo yes I get to my I've got that just got to Le out get that on this computer presentation back okay let's uh down to I'm want to find some photos of that this is another view of that pH 23r and go okay and so the curb was raised up to get better flow towards Bas right and now you're you're thinking that because the asphalt is lower than the curve it's trapping it it going ask the contractor to come up kind of explain the the details that the with the flow line coming around and the edge of the driveway and and the asphalt kind of created instead of having a deeper V keep that going that V got a little bit more shadow that I can speak a little bit to this whole situation if you what your name Sir Anthony haror contractor I'm the president and I have my for Levi who's on site every day who's been working through this just a couple uh issues uh or just want to bring some concerns or things up to date for you guys um we were given the project and bid the project the only constraint on the project is a note here that says curving to be laid out to where no water does not puddle and to prevent ponding there's no great Stakes are not given to us no great elevations are given to us the only thing that's given to us is if the road has a high point in the middle or if the road goes at a consistent flow from one end to the other so in this situation on 23rd Street it flows from Golf Boulevard to B now you have two constraints you have the flowline constraint that has to stay completely the same because you're tying into two points of Golf Boulevard and pay and you have the front board which has to stay pretty much the same because you're tying into the asphalt cuz the front board is what gives you the asphalt which has to tie into that the existing the curve that we took out was not that's not a valley that curve went flat and then up like that kind of like like a sight like this what you're trying for us to do is to put in a valley that's it's not it's not possible what really is what you're kind of looking for is more like a road reconstruction project where you go back on all the aprons you take them all out rechange the road profile and everything so what we're doing here is we're trying to match existing grades trying to get the flow lines to work so when we put the front board in and we put the flow line in and they're shaping it with the with the level to get the flow line to go as you get from Bayshore you'll have a deeper V and then as you get to golf the V will slowly disappear as you pointed out on the one street that had like the heer curve the reason it's doing there's no water ping there is because they they took took the one point and the other point and they drew a straight line and it flows down the straight line and there's no value there so what we're proposing to do in these situations is to put the asphalt an inch and a like a half an inch lip in front of the curve to kind of give it like a like a p sudo V almost you know where it'll keep it in the curve sort of enhancing the exactly and we're trying not to go back into the aprons because then you'll if you have to raise the back board and raise the front board then you on some of the houses you'll have back flow because the houses sit don't sit at a higher elevation so you don't want us going back into the aprons and reconstructing everybody's aprons and everything so um I mean we're doing the best we can as to your note on a curb machine curb machines are only really used on new construction projects long parking lots because the curb machine has to sit at the same elevation as the new curve well the road's up here and the new curb recoring is down here so you can't use a curb machine it it's only like we only use it on your picture there the first cone yes is where the the um New where the Milling started right yes so from that cone right there water we see the first cone we see closest to us right it goes towards basore okay so that water there's a straight line that goes from there to bore okay so that's where the Milling started to put the black top down right the first count yes that's where they're like why is the curve reconstructed all the way back to the first the first C well the plans that we were given to bid actually shows if you go to the limits of the curve actually shows it to go into the penel county areas which we're not we we're not doing my here's my problem this when you're doing it by hand yeah if you if you all set because you have such a low pitch to play with if you offset that first cone just a little bit half an inch and I don't know why you would start right there okay and then you came down you lost a lot of your drainage already yeah so what we did on this one we started at we always start at the low point so we start at the low point and we give it almost almost level barely the bubble on the on the level and a foral level is almost not even touching the line on this side to get the water to go it's it's 0.23% fall from one end that's percent so it's like Lar said all the numb repe yeah it's pointless to repeat but so what so from that from the the cone that's closest to us coming towards us the water goes that way we had to tie into pelis County's existing ramp that was right there that's why there was a huge fall difference in that 12 ft is because we started at the low and we came up with the level pretty much flat flat flat flat as you go as we're going up on the road the curve the be starts to this it's going byby it's turning into a header curve like what he saw on that other room and it just it goes byby and we're two we're already 2 and 1/2 inches above the road your asphalt quantity on that road is going to be three times what it should be okay so the next question my thing is after you stick build it okay okay y you had to do a level again before you ped the concrete we we used the level as we're pouring the yes as we're what I'm saying is once you stick build it okay you had to have some kind of an idea this isn't going to drain I mean no no one's going to wait a minute no one's going to pour concrete and say hopefully this works I mean I've been in the construction this all my life understand and we don't do things that yeah well it it is going to drain it's not going to look like a profile of a valley curb with a valley Gunter his header Cur drains it drains it we not talking about his header curve I'm talking about 203 I but but the problem is the problem is the problem is the homeowner is saying that it looks too much like the header curve so we are talking about the profile of the curve that that's the main issue here is no one likes the look of the curve saying that there's no V in it no I don't think the the main issue is they're getting water in their driveway and it's not draining right and you're getting every type of bug and what the St yeah that that whole Corner that whole corner right there holds water will always hold water this project won't stop that from happening it's always going to hold water there's nowhere if you look at the gr shots here there's nowhere for that water to go on that intersection well then we shouldn't be doing anything exactly so but the pictures you showed us before and we we're not allowed to cross talk to you guys but I didn't see any water in the old pictures and I'm not there I I don't go down to the North End a lot but I never saw after heavy rainstorm 23 I never heard of any flooding down there we had flooding problems okay but I don't want flooding in either but um the problem his existing curve was not it's not a valid curve nor it's not any curve there's no word there it's it's it's the existing curve it doesn't follow any profile what we're trying to do is actually put a correct profile in a V trying to mimic a valley gutter I understand when you're marking out your P okay you're going to say this is the level okay that we have to keep at to make up flow yes and but the issue he didn't do that but the issue is is if we if we did that and we we we which we do we plot it we know where the flow line is is consistent to one and the other then our front board would be four or 5 in above the existing a okay so that's what I'm saying so then we should have said stop we can't do this job rather than do the job and say look what we did we did it wrong and that's that's what I'm not grasping in my head I think I think what you're what you're saying is Well if it's not going to fix stopping the water then why do it at all thank you that's what you're saying but I don't think everybody 100% agrees with that I think that um that there there is a sense of Statics that are involved also and you're you're going around you're you're coming right up there and then you just you stop tie into whatever's there and that's it entrance of the street and call it a day um do I think that there's more problems now well right now probably so U but um possibly what what's your level of confidence on raising the as level and how long realistically do you expect that to last you mean raising the as like adding more thickness to the asol corre that that's that's done all the time I mean Indian Rocks is Milling 8 in thick and putting 8 in thick of Asal that that's not an that's not an issue at all and so is that it's just a cost thing too you know we're trying to match the existing asphalt because we're only we're only Milling one inch and putting back an inch and a half on 23rd we're going to use uh it's going to be 4 in thick in some in in some spots which is going to go overage on your asphalt mbers and so what's your level of confidence that's going to help the water is consistently running from one end to the other that's that's what we were that's what the notes and the plant say that's what the spec says that's what we're doing it's consistently wanting from one point to the other I shot we shot shots of our on 23rd I shot every 210 ft and we had almost exactly the same fall every 210 ft and then we get in front of at Golf Boulevard and we have to dive down and tie into the existing that's why there's such a in that 12T that's why there's 2 in of fall because we have to match the existing at golf there's nothing we can do about it it's not it's a it's a mute point I mean so you can't use that 2 and2 in to tell you that you can get fall from there to Bas that's not how it works right so and I could see on all the other like just driving around with it it seems like other contractors might have had the same issue that I that we were having go you know it just there's literally no fall here nothing all Indian Rocks we're in North Readington it's all it's the same it's all it's all the same you know so and we're just trying to we're trying to get the profile to to match a valley gutter with the constraints that we're given matching the existing asphal matching the driveway apron and keeping a consistent flow line okay all right does anyone else have questions I understand completely what you're saying I also just wanted to clarify something when um Mr mentioned that a design build we did not use a design Bild right design build is one firm yeah we use a design bid build delivery method two different firms design build you have one firm they're responsible for the design andru not necessar well yes no not necessary I have my general contractor's license Class A and I'm pretty sure I'm tell you right now they bring in they bring in Subs all the time you know that subs subs are brought in by contract we did not use a design bill that's problem the problem is this this is not designed the problem is you had plans okay and before you do the construction project you should say this is going to work but it's not going to work he's showing me the old plan right there it looks like they tried to do something and it didn't work I'm just trying to tell you didn't use design it doesn't matter cost you $65,000 had we used this design build we wouldn't be having this what do matter seriously one at a time all right Mr Banker you have the floor what does it matter what it's called because it's costing the city $65,000 or something that didn't work that the contractor thought it would work it matters because had we used a design Bill there would be one firm and we wouldn't be sitting here having an engineer talking about whose fault is it the engineers or the contractors that's what matters whose fault is it I'm looking savings fa I'm just I just answered your question line the taxpayers of the city pick up the you know based upon everything that I've heard I think that it's somebody else's fall from years ago whoever designed the city the intersections the way that our streets entered into G Boulevard I mean it's it's not it's not relevant I mean bouard could have raised their I'm sure they did over time when they were put in different layers so Del Boulevard got higher so now everything there's going to be a point there where we can't make it go that direction anymore we don't know where we are where we this so what do we want the problem the bottom line is did they have water in the street before they did this job no thank you okay do you have water in the street now yes thank you okay so our plan for that contractor did not perform the job the way it was supposed to call it whatever you I call a sh job I don't know if that's in your engineering school or not that's what happened I do I don't care what you have all right I don't care if you your past stre sh it didn't work they're not finished point of order both of you we've got a problem we need to get it resolved that's what we're here for who's and getting in a pissing match over who's right and who's wrong is not the way to handle this so I agree that yep we have water now where we getting before Mr reefer can you confirm that I can say that there was always water being held at the sidewalk in that part of the road we might have made it worse slightly um I try to come back and fix it there was this is only important once they did realize that there was a the flow is going in the wrong way from Mr next driveway to to the is the plan is the plan to pave that street So the plan right now we're discussing is that you know if we're going to add material to achieve more of of a flow line in the center are we going to do as is and accomplish water flowing towards Bay Shore um by means of the contractors recommending but either way there is a negative flow at the West 23rd that needs to be corrected we've known about that since the first time we met out there um that's something we can right so it's without making that County depression any worse but until the county does something with their Road there's always going to be water at the very top 23 comment questions I think if someone could restate what the motion is on the motion is to approve this project plan and that but there's several pieces uh what what if someone could restate what the project plan actually is So currently we're discussing 23rd Street so we need to come up with what what we're going to do we're going to keep the unorthodox curb as is correct the area that we have negative flow towards gol Bard um but use the the uh half in Ral as the contractor discussing where we know that the water even though the curve looks not like a typical KN shaped curve the one are still flowing to the West um every to the east or uh what Mr Floy was recommending is that we could add material to try to achieve more of a centerfold line as opposed to it being up against the asph either way you know I don't see it improving very much I think that's the argument but what we do want is a consistent Flow To Go to b and I believe yes you're correct there's the curve may have drained better in some areas but overall that curve was not in great shape there was a lot of cracking was depression um and this is part of the project is restoration of the curve and the resurfacing so to do so um we're going to have to have some kind of curve in the water flows and then we start we can't have a motion in the alternative so we saying to go with the contractor's proposal and not with the engineers alternative I'd like to hear um Mr F's recommendation for 23rd um and what will take as we're looking here I just got a thought at the corner of there and contractor you mentioned that the at the intersection there 23rd and in Gulf there's a storm waterer pipe underneath there there's two inlets on Gulf uh that connects and that pipe would go underneath there there is a possibility um you have that approachis County maybe an inlet can be put in that area to capture water and that would really solve any water back blowing off on the gulf and situation going down the B and that's the best thing that I've heard all night so what I would like to do is entertain a motion to amend uh this proposal uh where we either table it or we amend it and we we negotiate 23rd at a later date I make a motion to table this so we can see if we put spot drains or another type of drain in there Sol I have a second could you explain that one more time so what you could so if you look at that the picture there you can kind of see it uh around that corner there's an inlet um where the second uh cone is yeah around that corner there's an inlet and then there's an inlet on the other side of 23rd what we could do is put a drainage Inlet on that corner slope uh from at the Corner House and at the corner of Golf Boulevard slow both sides to the drainage Inlet and tie it in to the uh City storm water system with like a dogghouse manhole and just have a manhole lid in the middle of the you'd have a manhole lid and of being an inlet but because you're in you're tying in a storm water system to an existing you need to have some sort of structure there so you have to set two structures you have to set the inlet structure right here at the corner and then you have to set another stru dog house structure at the connection point between the between your system and the county system real quick what would that cost to go El I can't put a number on that I mean it's you got to you got a Well Point you got a Tren it it just just depends on how deep the pipe is how big the there's too many factors for me to put a number on anything you think it' be cheaper my opinion was the water was always there no matter what's being said right now no matter everyone it was always sitting there there was always water sitting there there will always be water sitting there it is not it's a counting RightWay it's it's an unfortunate situation that the homeowner's in it got you know I wouldn't want my house I wouldn't want the same thing so it's unfortunate but it's just it's the situation we're dealing with at that corner and the only way to 100% remedy it was to put a drainage inline in there that'd be the only way but then you have to get with the county they have to go over the plans they have to design it too they right I me you're talking maybe a year before we can actually get out there and put the drainage Inland in and and do that work um but as far as the C the drainage project we're currently on it it was constructed to have positive flow from his right in front of the his house all the way to B which it which I confirmed at on our on-site meeting it does and unfor it's just an unfortunate situation at that at that it's always held right there's a dip right there you can see I mean it's that's just my opinion on itself so are we implying are we saying that some of our water on 23rd Street would be going into the county system is that why you mentioned we'd have to get with the county yeah because you're you're tying into the County's system their storm water system there and they um we just did a storm water project in Indian Rocks Beach they no matter what you do with if even if you touch their system you have to get a RightWay permit their engineer has to look at it they have to look at lers design they have to sign off on it it it turns into this whole this whole thing you know which it'd be nice if we could fix the issue by just curve and moving curve and stuff like that but it it just it's not possible at that cor which is not going to happen I would recommend obviously if if we have another solution I mean the water's going to move from what you referenced earlier it may not move at the rate exactly that that we would love it to do but as long as there's some gra and it's always going to go to the path of Le resistance exactly if the water's bonding for 48 Hours 72 hours then yeah it could be more of a finishing issue but if the water's is disappearing within 24 20 you know then it's it's it's moving it's going go any all Valley curves hold water for a certain period of time what's the distance how many feet is it from his house 550 550t and it has a 023 vol that's that's in tens or whatever thousands so it's there's nothing there's no fall so the again what the issue was is trying to get the valley to consistently go and when you get to the end the valley is almost gone inside the curve with us being 2 and 1 12 in above the asphalt already yeah I was just thinking if you put spot drain in there with B plate yeah ideally you in the middle of the road you would put a you know in the valley curve if you put spots oh like a like a channel drain yeah but then yeah I mean you could do that but not too crazy about that I I don't well I guess might motion to table silence discussion it doesn't sound like it did I'll make a motion again to T and move ahead with 20 second I'll second all in favor to table okay it's table please come back to us with more information thank you I I appreciate the time that you've been here tonight and uh I I hope we can get this resolved quickly so Third Street or the now this is the most convoluted motion to table because it's not really wasn't really the right way to handle it but would someone like to make a motion to approve 22 make a motion to approve 22 stre I have a second second Mr Banker you have the floor plans are in front of us should go ahead all in favor I sorry I just want to bring up one point if uh just that vertical curve medum um cutting it out and replacing it um back the numbers here it's pretty significant and it's more of an aesthetic uh element of the project and we have a lot of trucks that are cost over so how correct crack and broken um it's I've never looked at it where it was it was just an eyesore or danger or Hazard um there might be some chips we have chips in most cacs on the vurve um it just did not stand out to me as something that was necessary and you know it's a significant cost um as far as vertical we got the Vergo curb at $338,000 and the saw cut removal curvs another 17 so 55,000 that's big chunk it it's that that functional ASP 17 the saw cut vertical curve where is that at that is a item see the item tell me exactly what that is that's where you're taking out care cutting um would someone like to make a motion to amend this proposal to where we drop the medum completely you mean the meeting yes okay because we don't need it it doesn't sound like we I'll that motion right you like to discuss as I understand it um the proposal for 22nd Street is presented because it was omitted from the initial bid so we haven't provided for this at all the plan is to move forward with 22nd Street to incorporate that as part of our contract but deleting the median because we feel that that's necessary that that all in favor to amend the proposal where we remove the median curbing removal and replacement make one more point that this is the um Engineers estimate so we still would come to agreement with the contract a lot of these um are they're in the bid the original bid um the careful saw cutting informing of you know the valley Cur inside of repa surface might be something that need lots to discuss but um as long as we're on all on board with within the realm of the estimate we move forward I just want to point that out okay so the motion is to amend this proposal all once again removing the median curving uh and replacement taking that part out all in favor I okay now we're back to approving the original motion with the amendment so that was approving the amendment now we have to approve the motion the original motion all in favor I any oppos I you oppose okay it make a record of it that Mr Roberts opposes reping the or not reping okay is that it any other uh any other else that you would like to discuss we voted on side these proposals 23rd will be Revisited hoping we can get this resolved quickly that being said u i will entertain a motion to adjourn this meeting and we'll take a 5 motion second all in favor I"
