    "transcript": "good evening everyone welcome to the city council budget workshop for the city of ballard beach july 19 2021 please join me for the pledge of allegiance i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all madam clerk please call councilmember robynocki here councilmember frank baker councilmember glenn gunn yeah council member leslie notaro here councilmember rita swo here vice mayor dave gattis here mayor joseph manzo [Music] city manager lynn reeves okay just make sure the minutes reflect that frank van gaard is joining us via phone and we do have a quorum we have one item on that discussion and it is a discussion and review of fiscal year 2021 2022 budget city manager brought that in race yes mayor constantly like it a couple weeks ago there's been some some changes that i just want to go through on page 11 in the budget you'll see that the tax property appraiser gave us a revised estimated value what was 6.03 is now increase to 7.6 which is an increase in uh i believe in the millage as it is uh would be an increased total of 87 510 on page page 14 you'll see the budget summary and the expenses basically it's a wrap of each of the different costs in the city as far as budget revenues and things of that nature and i also gave you a separate copy of it so you have it outside the book going further general fund revenue on page 16 personnel is about 20 percent of the budget uh operating is 52 of the budget and then you look at the ad alarm taxes that's 46 of the budget which is about half of what we collect for the year i did provide you an additional sheet at your desk that talks about the tax rate tax rates by agency miller beach only gets 13 of what people pay in taxes uh a lot of times we hear that you know i paid ten thousand dollars in taxes to the city well it's not to the city we only receive about 13 of that overall tax on a home if you look at the other probably the well the biggest is the school board and then the next one would be the county general fund which their millage rate is six point the school board is 6.42 and the county general fund is 5.275 under the current situation moving on to page 19. this is a summary of the budget showing you 1918 excuse me showing you the the increase in the millage uh grade 87 510 and the revenues going down as you will see and i told you previously uh the revenues were pushed back for this fiscal year because of the pandemic we brought them back to the level uh that they really should be based on prior years as far as revenue coming from different things like utility taxes uh rentals the state share grant money we get the infrastructure tax local option gas tax things of that nature uh moving on over to page 19. uh the reserve estimate for uh if we would be taking from the reserve right now the reserves about 2.1 million uh we'd be taking 202 000 from the reserve based on his current budget then moving to page 27 law enforcement uh the law enforcement for the sheriff is going to increase the 522 thousand seventy dollars and there's the supplement that we explaining that is there's a ten thousand dollar placeholder for the supplemental things that you do and the sheriff's is 522 000 his new contract and i told you in the last hearing that the sheriff's contract is going to remain the same as it is currently there there's going to be no separation between us so we'll get that 30 000 credit that and i've confirmed that with the sheriff and with bellerin so that was correct uh would you confirm it within that room of their uh city attorney i talked to her and asked her if it was a change and she said no and i confirmed it with captain honor he said and the sheriff told me he was going to talk to them concerning that code enforcement i propose that we bring the code enforcement back in-house that'll give us more hours that we can use with staff i know mr mayor you asked for danny to just give his side i did speak to him and his supervisor and basically what the sheriff's department told me was there is no side it's provided providing for the law enforcement so danny doesn't have a side in the issue he's they consider him a contractor so he really has nothing to say is what we talked i did provide you with in your packet which we'll talk about a little bit after i go through the budget uh the code enforcement things that danny's done over the last since april i asked for a cad file and i'll explain this is the best i got from him so i'm sure we'll talk about that more page 32 that's the areas that we save money up for for things like city hall painting our replacement things that pretty much is eight stats status quo each year we just put money aside till the [Music] age 46 i just wanted to i just wanted to highlight on that if you look down on the uh where it says ad revenues we're showing you the 930 000 that will get from belt boulevard that's the consolidated amount from ours and bella shores and you'll notice that the special assessments account which is the underground where well real estate's on drop twenty thousand dollars so and that was it's gonna be taken with the new uh assessments that each homeowner will get so that's i just wanted to highlight those couple lives uh moving on to page 48 uh some some things that are kind of new in this budget are thirty thousand dollars for the video upgrades uh twenty five thousand dollars for docker replacement you'll notice in bridge repairs for harrison and uh we have a healthy fund there so i did not put any money in the budget next year but it was a little forego uh the bridge repair expense we will have some expense this fiscal year and kyle's working on getting those prices together for the 22nd street bridge because we have a fdot inspection of it and there's some things and every year they or every other year when they do the inspection there's squalls oils and things concrete that needs to be replasted and things of that nature so but the bridge is is fine as far as their inspection goes uh you also also see the build boulevard in here so that makes that number look big because of that 930 thousand dollars the marina which is page 70. over previous years the funding that we've received from the marina revenue next year will increase about 20 thousand dollars based on the new increases in the rental rates that we did uh about six to eight months ago or something like that so that money that money typically the the what i'll call is the profit from the marina transfers into the general fund at the end of the year so we'll get a little a little more a little more bit of money there and then you'll go to 78 down where it says operating expenses this is the thing that i was talking about at the meeting the house bill 53 that passed this is an estimate and we put this out for an rfp it could come in higher but based on what i have gotten from other cities and the estimates they've gotten this is the range it's going to cost us for this needs assessment for the stormwater infrastructure and that report is due to the state by next july to the department of economic opportunity and then we have to update it every five years stormwater project for next year is 17th and 18th street and it's 336 thousand dollars is projected for that and we already have on 18th street we didn't check out the city staffed with that month or so okay uh any questions about the dollar numbers at this point questions okay so so keep going i provided you an update um yes um council member banker it seems to have dropped off so i need to recall okay well wait wait you gotta let me know okay um hello it's patty you're on speakerphone you dropped off i guess i guess okay all right well we're going to continue now all right thank you all right so um before we go over that i have questions uh a couple questions actually um you just got hit with a massive lawsuit what are we doing about our insurance increase next year is that in this budget at this time we haven't received our estimate and usually that won't happen until sometime in august so if if there is a major increase we will come back and you know before we pass the kind of budget we know that before we do it okay and um do you anticipate needing additional legal staff and clerical staff to fulfill that announce the requests that will be coming in regardless that will come across the street they're actually hiring outside people and everything else so we're gonna be able to do that in-house so we're gonna need to bring new people because if you do i don't know if it's in this structure or not well that's that's not in this budget uh our our issue right now is is being handled by four legal cities now uh point of order i i feel like that this is a sensitive matter and it should not be discussed here in this week what's sensitive about the budget this particular case i'm not discussing the case and discussing the budget so and if you want to look at the ordinance the only person who could stop the discussion on the case which we're not discussing the particulars of this medium or the city attorney i don't see the city attorney but i'm not calling the point of order so it's out of order answer my question please with regard to how we're going do you need a budget to handle potential requests for documents computer runs what have you i'm not you know again i can just say in general what may happen now that works he's privy to that information i'd like to ask if the members that are involved in this can step out of the room so that we don't have any kind of a issue with us being in here so i will be happy to step out of the room when these questions are being asked there's no way you could you can step out of the room any time you'd do you understand the question mysteries yeah i understand what you're saying mr helper can be covered in housing well i think that's something that i would need to have a discussion with the lead insurance representative so until i do that i can't answer it so it's not in this question no okay that's it um the other thing i'd like is a salary chart by individual not broken out by department i don't remember seeing that in here i know in some cases like for example city manager it's very obvious that's you but there's split things particularly with code and stuff like that i would like to know what each position we're paying what each person you're paying for just a supplemental schedule i don't need it today you can give it to me for the next budget meeting as far as i'm concerned does that end the discussion where council members will excuse yourself are we have we moved on i'm not sure why she excused herself but yeah i have no more questions with regard to staffing okay thank you okay she's coming back yes thank you back in the chambers [Music] well if uh so you're asking the you want to know exactly what the salary is by each department uh by each person by person yeah because some people split departments particularly with this code so i'm having a hard time getting a handle on what we're paying people um like i said some of it's very obvious i know of yours is because we're your own department in the sole department but some of them split out so i just a supplemental charge is showing what that's saying that's not the problem yeah and i don't need all the benefits at all just the salary number the base salary we can figure out the rest of it that's it that's all i had anybody else mr reeves contract okay uh every year i've been providing you with an update on contracts you'll see the numbers that we've spent are encumbered in the prior year which is this year like the sheriff was thousand 503 hundred and eight dollars so this year uh the duke energy franchise uh well actually i'll start at the top uh we're talking about the code enforcement which we'll have more discussion about that and the value of the contract and what i've proposed in the budget is to it's a warship it's not going to cost the city more money than it currently does yeah so then we go down to the city attorney uh i made another comment about you know we we need to look at some cost containment because year to date we spent 33 000 and if it's going to continue like this then we need to increase the budget to some level um i would like to see us i mean it was a big conversation and ordeal we had moreno in here for us to not leave opening new contracts i really feel like at this point that we should put on our next agenda to have you the city manager go out and advertise for legal services so we can see what else is out there what our options are so that we can take a better [Music] i agree with that i think that this should happen it's gone too long and we need to see what else is out there i think it's time if uh if mr riley is the best uh the best we can do and we'll keep it but i would like to look at uh i'd like to start energy um i don't believe that a work session we can authorize you to do that so i think you need a resolution at the next meeting this is this is a recommendation so there's continue to settle those keys well what would have to happen i would put something on there requesting authorization to provide an rfp for legal services at the city council correct that's that's the consensus of the council that's not my consensus but we have two so foreign yeah yes you'd like to go out yes you'd like to authorize him to set that resolution up i i have a hard time hearing the questions frank can you hear it if i talk like this [Music] i hear all buckle up chairman um on your system i think the last time we had a council member out of town they were planning on i think i breached your resources for better again this is not a vote this is a consensus but um the question has come up should the city manager put on the next agenda uh a resolution to enable him to go out for rfps for legal services city legal services okay tell me if i say it correctly council member banker can you hear me i can hear you okay the question is should um council advocates they're asking for a consensus to have a resolution at the next meeting to go out he said yes yes okay all right so you have it's it's not a resolution it's just a relationship okay it's just like we did last time right yeah absolutely so you put that i will debate it we'll vote on it then if that goes forward then you'll do the advertising and we'll do the whole process like we did last time yes okay okay uh ford canals we have a comprehensive plan uh review due uh very early next year and they've started on it uh you approved that a few months ago it's uh we have a contract with ambulance for five thousand dollars not to exceed uh going down cardinal that's an mpds contract that's a report that's required for the pollution system every year to maintain our and pds permit and they do that work through the continuing contract that we have with the engineering firms engineering sciences group cpw we now need dual cardinal uh the next thing you renewed that in december by ordinance uh the franchise fee for duke energy which was a six six percent that's that's just something you did for the next 10 years the newest thing was the salt marsh cleveland again contract we paid in 17 750 in fiscal year 21 and at the last council meeting on the 12th you approved their three-year contract for 17 750 the first year 18 750 the second year in 1975 for the third year that was their proposal that they submitted for the rfp that we went out and uh council approved that mr wolfe the board of adjustment magistrate since we've been successful in keeping the word of adjustment to have their meetings i didn't see a need to renew that magistrate contract here we've never used him at all uh since we've kind of put the board of adjustment on a system where your meeting's always going to be second thursday of whatever month it is that there's a meeting and the board of adjustment is still fine and putting any need for that so i don't feel there's no need to reduce you know so what are you gonna do if there's not a quorum for some reason what do you do if there's not a quorum for some reason how about your what's your you don't have this guy under contract how do you these people well i i could leave him under contract if he still wants to do it but he's been under contract for two years and we've never used him i understand but i don't use my house insurance policy for fire yet but i'm not going to cancel it so i mean my i'm not the only one to make this decision but my question is if i'm an applicant and i come here that we have a lot of trouble getting board of adjustment uh attendance in the past it just goes tremendous now the last three years i believe they've been attended but if for any reason you can't make a quorum and these people come you know with their attorneys and their other people that are making this presentation they're paying big bucks and then we're gonna tell them sorry i mean i'd be annoyed you know if i paid my attorney two hours appearance and stuff and he shows up and we don't that's probably well i i'll be glad to talk to mr wolf and see if he wants to extend it what we did last time we just went out to a legal firm and asked the legal firm to be the magistrate [Music] remember the firm but i think her name was lauren christopher or something we just went to a legal firm that does that and uh i think you were the first one that had the board of adjustment marketing in a while yeah yeah because previously they struggled and what i did i brought the court of adjustment in to a kind of a workshop session and i said i asked them can we set up a specific date that there will be a board of adjustment hearing if there's one required and what's the best day because you know we wanted to make this so it's the residents doing it and it doesn't cost them the additional 500 that an attorney would cost them so uh the board is a group pick thursday and uh we haven't had a problem since and i think it's the fact that periodically we had some training for him we asked him to come in we just had that six months ago maybe we had a training session for him we went through you know everybody that came but you know there were a couple people that were missing uh but for the most part they went through the training so that they're they're uh you know a little more up-to-date so that was i think that process has helped look it's a suggestion i don't really care i'm not coming before the board of adjustment but somebody may and i think that they deserve a hearing on that night and you have a pinch hitter in case your team is is absent that's all i'm saying if you want to have it fine if you don't want to have it then you deal with the applicant that's it's up to you i you know if you could have someone on call that's fine chances are they're never going to get used you know based on how things are going right yeah that's kind of where i'm at with this and we do have the capability to have an attorney okay so let me make sure we've got this straight 18 through between 2018 through 2020 we've had to guide the contract and then we dropped it in 2020. yes we haven't used it i haven't used him at all actually i haven't even talked to him because he you know but like i said we do have another uh firm that we have i was just wondering why this was even on well i want to make i try to be transparent make sure everybody knows our contracts where they're at and uh so i just wanted to let you know that i don't you know this his contract expired during the pandemic and we just you know it didn't see the need for it but i will ask him if he would be an on-call person just like the girl that reused i can't remember her name but andy's the one that handles that so uh victor he charges eight thousand dollars a year that's uh for the videotaping of the console games so uh and he's told me that's not going to change so that's kind of a the rundown of the uh contracts actually for the most part i'd say till 23 probably we don't we don't have a lot of contracts that need to go out really at this point other than now the request for the rfp excuse me [Music] okay next item the sheriff's department did provide me with danny's kind of work history and just to kind of give you an idea of what i'm referring to uh it's in your packet it's in your package want your packet yeah i attached they gave me this from the first of april till the 24th um and it's really a cat cat file to some degree danny is required by the sheriff to put all this information into their computer and for us to keep up to date we require him to annotate his stuff in this book in case some calls so we know that if danny left a violation notice that he wasn't here that day we would have knowledge of what that violation is for as an example so if you look at the report on the 5th of april and you don't get a lot of information from this report you get the monthly report that you see is a council member every month of what what he's done from a code violation but as an example in i'm just going to start with the fifth i just want to give you some kind of concepts of what he's picking up uh the first item of 98 harbor it was a shed when low requirements and made contact with elmore uh because they were taking down a shed that's that's what he put in them you know this is supposed to be a fy 2122 budget review and i have no problem if you want to go through this you know separately but i i don't see that well i'm just trying to it's a performance review and i just wanted you know i i'm hearing tonight that this guy's not doesn't able to speak i'm going to confirm that with him but i find that just unbelievable but not amazing but unbelievable um but you know if we're going to go over this he's a citizen he can sit in an audience and speak all he wants if he wants to as far as i'm concerned i just would like to make sure we keep the budget with the budget and well this is part of the budget because i what i'm recommending is we bring it in house we would contribute about 40 percent of laura's salary to code enforcement 40 percent of her time which is more hours than we currently have uh we would uh hire a part-time person to help in the office during that time frame and it's a war it's not gonna cost the city any more money either way i will tell you that danny and i have talked i've talked to the supervisors i've we've had this discussion about code enforcements and things that uh we've had residents say that hey why why did he get this person across the street and give me this person across the street on the same street on the same day so those are those are things that i have concerns about and now with the new code enforcement law that says if you made a complaint you gotta tell us who you are and i think that is going to restrict some people from making complaints because they don't want to tell on their neighbor so i think our code enforcement needs to be more visible more proactive in that portion now if if you want to pay the sheriff's office for equal amount of hours it's probably going to cost about 50 000 a year so i'm looking at the benefit to the city as far as cost wise that that's what i'm looking at uh i'm not saying they did a horrible job i'm just saying that there are things that we really need you know as an example somebody didn't cut their grass and johnny next door calls okay well now they're probably not going to call because they don't want their name associated with the code enforcement thing prime example today although we've been monitoring this house we had a call about some people that were up until 12 30 at night in a swimming pool it's a short turnaround and we've been monitoring it before we had the call and we we did make contact with someone that was running the house today but that person that called this morning didn't want to file a report because he didn't know his name but we were monitoring it anyway so we did make contact and found out that they were renting the place through tomorrow so you know my thing is if if we want to be we need to be more proactive then we need to spend more hours at it we made the decision to go to the sheriff it was a decision made in a council meeting so i think the decision if you're proposing that we all i mean i don't have no problem with you putting it in the budget what your intention is because we can spend the money we're spending money on the way together so it doesn't really matter which pocket it goes to um but it needs to come into counseling and anybody having a proper input it's not a decision we're going to slide through on a budget it's going to be something that comes through as a council meeting well it's part of the everything's part of the budget just because we approve a budget doesn't mean everything is approved now we did this that way there's about 20 other alternatives to what you're proposing and i'm not going through it in a budget meeting i'll go through when the public is here i'll go through it when danny doherty is sitting in that audience because he's a citizen and he has the right to be here i don't care what anyone says this is an open public meeting and if anyone's telling him he can't be here then i would like to know who that person is who told me he can't be here um this guy deserves a fair shake i got complete galore when laura was doing this and when i went around campaigning as mayor it was the number one complaint i got on even code enforcement and that has stopped ever since danny took over so i want everybody in the city to hear this and we can make an intelligent decision when we hear it i've seen this man in action as somebody did on the street corner with the house that was so overgrown by me and a very difficult person to deal with and did a wonderful job wonderful without issuing a single citation warning summons he just worked with the guy that house looks really good today you know so um and i know some of the stuff he's done around the city where he's went above and beyond the call of duty so i think that story needs to be told you know in a fair way and then if the council decides they don't want to go that direction that's the count everybody has a chance to have their input but it's not something we blow off in a budget i don't think so it's like this whole issue had its worth in bunch of meetings because when the council looked at the line items they thought perhaps there was a more efficient more effective way of dealing with career reinforcement so with the acquiescence of the city manager we said hey you know other cities are using sheriff's officers to assist with co-enforcement so we went down that route on a probationary period we knew we were going to look at this thing and see how it work well we've kind of wrestled with it even longer than we initially thought we would and we've tried tweaking it and adjusting it and i think the city managers looked at it in depth because he deals with it everyday on a tactical basis and his observation is that he can do the job more efficiently more effectively at a cost neutral basis within house so i think we we need to consider it in a budget perspective because that's how this whole thing came about and if it needs to be discussed and accounted that's fine that's not the side of the picture that this guy deals with it every day on a daily tactical basis and he's saying he can do a more efficient more effective job on reorganizing within his staff so i just want to make sure we're not reciting that agenda for the city council so that we can just set it out there discuss it vote on it move on so we don't keep the cane down the weather fire i mean i know this has been going on for a while as far as concerns with the code enforcement we're not having an in-house and stuff can we just put it on the agenda and so that we can vote on this and move on i mean i've given you what i'm going to tell you yeah i'm not going to tell you anything differently i'm just going to tell you that if with the changes in the law about not being able to people not wanting to share their information i think it's incumbent on the city to be more proactive in it and if that's what the council wants then from a cost standpoint then we're going to have to increase his hours and that's fine i don't i don't have i just think from cost efficiency and we keep talking about expense expense expense and we're thinking you know you say we we have unlimited budget if that's what the council thinks then that's fine but i'm the one that's that is responsible for the budget to the constant and i'm making the recommendation that we bring it in-house so and we can put that something on the thing just discuss code enforcement if that's what you want i'm not going to discuss it you're going to vote on whether you're in a full public hearing so how should that line how to read these are consensus so we can kind of draft any uh emotion or agenda i mean my opinion is to take the of the city manager he's put thought and observation into saying so my opinion would be to draft a line item for the next council agenda moving forward to give the city manager authority to put anything else and reorganizing staff accordingly i agree that's fine that's that can be your agenda it's still going to be voted on and debated and you'll be able to comment and [Music] [Music] if we have to had to go back through the stuff i remember having a vote when we actually decided putting in a budget is one thing we budget a lot of stuff you budgeted for you know buoys so you're going to put them in you know before you put them in we need to talk you need to come to us and say i'm putting in the blue easy okay but then we say yeah go ahead or we say no don't do it so that's the same thing here it might be intelligent but let's you know i mean we heard you know what you're where you're coming from i also know what i've seen so i want you know maybe i'll be the only person defending them what else is new but i want to hear it from danny and i'm inviting danny i'm inviting the mayor of this city patty is inviting danny doherty to this meeting and if any law enforcement say he can't come i'd like to know who that person is he was i passed on to them and they you know captain weiner and his uh sergeant uh artiste i think it is said we're not coming here to give sides of stories that's just what he said they have the option just like we did with salt marsh and the other auditor they're invited okay if they choose to stay home yeah i've covered you know are there any questions or things that the consultant is wanting to add or subtract what i've proposed for what the status proposed council yeah i'd like to uh ask a question about the generator budget in the last council meeting there were a lot of um there were a few people that brought up we should have generated and i see that there is some money allocated is that a five-year plan yes and that's quite a large amount of cash at the end of that five years can you kind of explain to me how that's how it's supposed to work it's like we do with our savings accounts we just put money aside each year i did get a price for a generator i think it was last year and was given somewhere in the neighborhood a 210 215 000 for this building to power this building uh with natural gas which we have natural gas here so that's not an additional cost so uh i guess how i look at it if if the council you know we were burning our reserve our burn rate was a lot worse previously i think the staff has done a wonderful job at maintaining costs for the most part our projects all come in under budget we worked really hard to make sure that the contractors you know we're going to get at some point still don't know when we're going to get that american recovery money and as an example this year's stormwater project is 336 thousand dollars this school year 22 we can use that money for that stormwater project well uh what that would do if you really wanted to look at it you wanted to move the budget up or the generator up there's another thirty thousand dollars that we didn't have to touch on reserve because we've moved that project uh into the american recovery funds that uh they don't give us a date yet but i i expected here shortly because everything you read it tells you you know end of august then another one will tell you the end of september but i expect that money is going to come here shortly and we're going to get we will collect up to 75 it can't be over 75 but our number is set at around 670 000. we're going to get a first probably half of that the first time around and then we'll get another bundle next year in july the rest of it and we have until 24 to spend it we can put that money in the bank and collect what a little bit of interest we can get or we can go ahead and use it for things like stormwater projects and then we would have some funding that we could move the generator up i mean with our our current uh reserves i think we could move the generator up anyway we're talking about 120 000 roughly difference okay so i was uh i was looking over since that last meeting generator technology and what's available and uh and then also i recently installed generator at the house and a large majority of that cost was plumbing and elected it was way more to have the thing installed that it was to actually buy the hardware so i'm wondering did we consider diesel at all i would i would not consider these and the reason i wouldn't is if you have a natural gas line the chance of that staying hot is a lot higher than the chance of me being able to go up to uh when we did our gas up here at the convenience park and get diesel if there's a hurricane i will tell you my experience in those markets i replaced three three generators in oldsmar smaller let's say kws to 200 kws and that's what we'd be looking at and i converted them all to natural gas yeah because you know i've is yours not really sure why we did that but i know that it's a nice all inclusive package where there's a large holding tank and i think we're good for about seven days so i don't know just throwing it out there just want to make sure we're getting the best what we can get well i can go out and get another quote we have to would have to put which you probably know this dave since you do not want you got to have a transfer switch which is would be put next to the panel in the electrical room here uh and then you you put a location for the generator probably somewhere outside the building where we can get the closest connection to uh and it would be probably [Music] i don't know ten foot by twenty foot in size just to give you an example and probably eight to ten foot hive and don't told me if that's the exact now looking around i think it's just you're right it's quite fun but i can i can ask the generac people to be surprised if the council has some interest in maybe taking some of the reserve money and the potential with the american recovery money that we would shift some funds or it wouldn't really hurt us at all [Music] local distributors don't typically handle the little tiny ones you've got to go to uh acf uh and there's one in jackson also a big company i'm trying to think of the name of it but i don't recollect it on my [Music] yeah commercial wise you're talking about a big human but you know we can call the guy that gave us a quote he came from the jacksonville company in my camera like but he's in sarasota so maybe i mean that would be a benefit to have this building although the hurricane was 17 this was the only building that had some power i'm the vice mayor on this thing i think it's time to move up the priority on this thing that the capital timeline showed the acquisition targeted like 23-24 so i think all the budget indicators point to the ability to move this thing up i think the burn rate has changed from two to three years and maybe five to ten years we've got the influx of stormwater fees now i think we've got the american rescue money pretty much looking pretty good there but more importantly we've addressed the idea before that we've got this huge reserve set aside for emergency way more than is required by the state and or our own charter and we've talked about the idea of maybe using that more responsibly to deal with problems now so it's just a matter of how you you frame the situation i mean if if we've got this big part of disaster money set aside i mean really what we're doing is focusing on being ahead of disaster so i mean why can't we use that money accordingly and be physically responsible and paid back in in overly uh short spans of time i for me i think the only question is do we want to push it up to the 21 22 time frame of the 22 hours that's the question here as i see it is that i mean is it within the realm of possibility from 2122 or were you talking about the first part of maybe 2023 well i what what i kind of suggested is if we i think we could move it up and be fiscally responsible and i think it would be a benefit to the city to have this building basically in a situation where uh it could be utilized if we needed to utilize it it doesn't qualify as a shelter or anything but it doesn't stop anything else so this budget cycle 212. and what i'll do uh i'll see how fast i can get up well maybe you can just update the quote i don't know uh so because we would put that out to bid anyway unless there's a state contract somewhere which that that can do too any other uh did frank banker hear everything does he have any questions patty council member brother yeah to the jet motion generator that please uh i i have some suggestions on january i wish i was there uh i'm not picking up the whole thing now well frank when you when you get back in town if you've got some thoughts on the generator just stop by and see i just think caterpillar has been making generators forever uh we should contact greg powell [Music] well this is going to be um anyway for that time number we're not sold supposedly this one any other council comments had a citizen hand uh josh if you have to is this on we're going to use this mic up here yes okay come right up here and your address three minutes josh hall of 7th street you hear me yes we have a diesel generator at my work which is the hospital today because now i can't hear that there you go we have a diesel generator at my work which is a hospital a data center for a hospital and uh i believe it was irma we were out for a week of power and when we called to get our diesel tank refilled every diesel to every company the first thing they said is we're only delivering the hospitals and so we said okay good that's us so i would advise against diesel here because you're going to be way at the bottom of the list that's just my my suggestion i want to put it thank you thank you anyone else okay back to council okay lynn that's basically this so um this is just a workshop we don't have any vote that's coming up next on the next beginning for the vote for the right right further for the all right that's it that's the end of the workshop uh motion to adjourn second [Music] uh"
