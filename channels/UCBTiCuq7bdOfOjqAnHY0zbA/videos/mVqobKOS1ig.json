presentation from the Phyllis County Sheriff's Office beginning with the monthly law enforcement report all right we do you have a copy of that service no I do not no I don't know who is supposed to be here tonight all right let's uh I'd like to make a note of that it's uh this is not the first time this has happened why don't we just move right on over them to the monthly code enforcement report and thank yes sir thank you Commissioners mayor City officials and residents keep popular for the record as you see in front of you the monthly report from code enforcement you'll notice that our weed and grass and overgrowth has raised a little bit but we are taking care of that and our impermanent work at the garage I'm happy to see that it's down to 7.5 out of percent of the circle there I've been doing a lot of follow-up working with a lot of the residents on the overgrowth of weeds and obstructions on the roadways I've been in contact with the city manager also and getting God's direction to help go along with that we still have a few problems along Gulf Boulevard that we are working with to do the Duke Energy contract trying to get the underground utilities other than that that's it for my report and I'll stand for any questions Council if we have any questions for the decade no thank you very much all right thank you have a great evening hey you too um while we are discussing the police police report I do have a question for the city manager but you know what the current procedure is for parking and fishing this is where I'm going what I've noticed is that suddenly the bridges and the shoreline anywhere where there's not homes has become free fishing and I have yet to see anyone control and do anything about it I've actually rolled down my window and said hey you might want to reconsider doing that because people look an hour later and they're not leaving Mr verified they addressed that on the fours I was out I did catch several people uh out on the bridges they were parked and told them they could be there can't partner one of them was up on Harrison we had to move over to the marina as far as Park fishing off the bridge there's not really much we can do about that because it's considered open Waters but if if somebody parks on the roadway I get the opportunity to move if they don't they were going to sign them and move them anyway this one individual that was a part of Harrison went to the marina didn't pay ended up getting a 55 fine anyway so but I am I am honoring any type of street parking like that for anybody who is not doing any type of work in the residential areas okay just for clarification how do I apologize it's the parking at the injury or exit sign yes I'm wondering if you said in your neighborhood also we see it Zone on Harrison but I know I know someone who got tickets at so they were part of the Inland Park areas but you know where they can park off or they can fish off the pier and they were part there in a fiance and so I know that the sheriff is doing their job when it comes to that but you know along with that I picked up a bunch of beer cans on Harrison because I'm sure they were standing there during a beer and fishing and so yes it's a you know it's a and also at Bayside Park through it and writing a lot of citations out there for the same thing whether you're just pulling in there not paying and then going out and fishing along the coast here all right and um please see that is there a better number than they permanently on hold phone line that we can call um what I can do is I will get uh Joe and David's cell phone numbers so we can recall in directly because they they do not mind having that happen and they just out code on it when it does happen same thing I've been giving out my cell phone number so if there is an issue I will go check on it but I will address this with Sergeant Steward to make sure that we get it at the line and make sure that this is taken care of I appreciate it thank you very much yes sir any other questions or comments all right let's take a bridal to item number four uh is Chief Davidson here tonight to present for the vanilla Suncoast fire and the rescue District all right we'll just move right on number five presentation before I call Mr Davis to the podium it's important to know why he is receiving this award since 2000 and possibly earlier Rudy has served Bellaire beach in various capacities including serving on the steering committee that made recommendations to the council to replace our aging City Hall he served on the citizens advisory committee it worked closely with Pinellas County to agree on the design for the Bel Air Causeway Bridge he served as president of the Bellaire Beach resident group that form a pack and brought the council manager form of government to referendum he served as the first mayor of Bellaire beach in the new Council manager form of government during that term that the council elected to move forward with the construction of our community center he served as a member of the board of adjustments he served on not one but two city manager search committees he also served as Vice chair of the Planning and Zoning Board I could keep going but I'm pretty sure that everyone here gets my point now I'd like Rudy Davis to join me after Cody Mr Davis on behalf of the city of Bellaire Beach I am honored and privileged to give you this distinguished service award you have earned it and we are very proud of all your accomplishments and we're truly grateful for everything you've done for this city thank you very much staff I sincerely appreciate this recognition of my service to the city of Bellaire Beach it has been my pleasure and privilege over the years to work with so many dedicated residents who shared my life of this community and the desire that to maintain the unique character and lifestyle that we enjoy while working on various committees for some special projects over the years some of the most satisfying your confidence accomplished once I've been serving as the president of Southern page residence group his smart work across the recommend referendum and subsequent approval by the voters of our city serving as mayor during the transition into this economic profession just more professional affordable government that continues to serve us well today and most recently through help organize the campaign to defeat the mayor who would be taped I've always felt like the 73 years of Bellaire Beach Medical members before me that service to our city was fully compensated for by the opportunity to maintain and protect what we have within this law of an Asic community and I never wanted a saddle where you go to work to me if I were here for the money my cheer for the wrong reason As I Lay behind public service to attend other matters and require my full attention I do want to alert our residents from what I said he tells him already knows there's a serious challenge to Bellaire Beach and all cities in Florida by the current Florida legislature in Tallahassee they want to end the whole room that was mandated by Florida voters in a 1968 referendum their objective is to take away a local municipalities ability to control what happens within its own borders and take that power to Tallahassee so they can serve the Monday's special interests or go want you and me telling them what they can't do in our account [Music] was the sponsor of the bill that would take away our grandfathered wife to live in short-term rentals and their local state representative Ken Berfield voted and supported that measure of the house really depress them through either change their views and support the whole world or face removal from office by local voters to put them there mayor and Council should take a very proactive stance to retain your Authority in local matters and our residents report that support their efficient to do so for Tallahassee will soon take that right away from us we should all actively support the local the local voices United project sponsored by The Parsley of cities I ask Council to make sure every resident is aware of the project and how it sort of supports our right to self-determination mayor council and City staff I thank you again for this recognition I wish you and all of the residents of Bella Beach the very best thank you thank you all right we are on to item number six which is quarterly board reports let's begin with the board of adjustments report from Mr Mike Kelly Mr Kelly you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor I appreciate the opportunity to tell you that the point of adjustment has been busy I want to adjustment normally sees two or three variances a year we've had two this quarter and we're supposed to have one this Thursday but we postpone them and so we have an active board we've had the same three kind of cases that have come before us regarding polls um Kyle's already got a plan to make that get reviewed and I'm sure everything will work out just fine but we got again an active board we're getting a lot of experience for the new members and if there's any questions I'll be glad to handle it this time Mr Kelly do we have any questions or comments I think you guys are doing a great job and I'm hoping we can get this absolutely thank you thank you ladies and gentlemen all right now we are on to the citizens advisory committee report from Mr bronze again thank you mayor council citizens advisory committee at this past quarter under our other title as the audit committee and we approve the final comprehensive annual financial report uh on May 3rd and it was approved as the council approved it and they had fixed some errors and filled all the reports of that were missing so I will be meeting later this week to review the budget and that's what we've been up to thank you do we have any questions or comments for Mr Smith thank you again all right next up is the Park and Recreation report from this again just a couple things from the Park and Ride Board once again I'd like to thank Oliver between up volunteers over the last quarter we are looking at new items with to put Ballard Beach logo then I like the table with us but um so if anybody has any suggestions please contact anyone on the park and rec board or please call the city We are continuing our new welcome back program for new residents along with all the necessary information that they need as new residents um they also we also include some Bella reach goodies and some local Merchant info if you as a resident own a local business and like to contribute something to the bag please drop off at the city hall in batches of 10. City website or our e-sign for upcoming fall and spring events our third annual health and wellness fair is in January and we would love to have more resident participation as vendors if you're in the health and wellness field the last Beach cleanup there was a couple residents that raised the issue of breaking the beach more often and I know you were traveling the last month I mean I did bring it up Kyle that's what he won't get into it it's not much speech to break anymore but um I think we're working on it yeah that's great I don't I know like there's a schedule that the city maintenance team has to to rake the beach are you looking for the park and rec to maybe get volunteers to do that and I'll I'll volunteer when I go about you know somebody get hurt or I'll drive the tractor I did I did contact the fdp and you had a lot of permit and they said that we can just have to be the cognizant of the terrible season you know and so that was you know during the busy season we 've driven Turtles are clear on the beach getting people out there so you kind of can't get involved we couldn't begin around how frequently we'd like to do it um [Music] is there limitations for volunteers and people if I go to what you rate you got to dump it and then you have to have I guess a dump truck to pay wage you said can we put residents in those use of equipment I also can't because yeah my personal information you know Etc to me it seems like it would be difficult because we don't always know when the beach needs to be rigged just based on one that there's like something like a big a lot of goop coming in out of the water so like you know I know it's scheduled but if I don't know we can have maybe something not on a call but like that we could do through the city without trying to get groups of volunteers because we can't always do that on short notice anyway and we have to sign a waiver to even participate in each command a piece of Hardware but uh Mr Rayford we used to do this regularly I don't think it was on a regular scale I think why did we stop um the last two times we did it when the wings were accumulating on the beach since I've been here since 18 our permits have been filled out for tri-annually and after major storms so um typically what happens is a resident will report guidelines at that point we'll schedule something any other questions or comments available no thank you thank you all right and finally we have the Planning and Zoning report for Mr JC and a question here vice mayor council members 3221 hibiscus Drive East representative [Music] the zoning board as matched several times since the first of the year it's not a board that just sits and looks around one time sometimes we look around and wonder oh why wake up certain things but we got the comp plan and just as a for instance we spent four meetings on the common plan and return them to the council and total of five hours two two one and one and this is the times that the citizens to both and we presented that back to the city and recently we were presented an ordinance considering signs and it's only this thick and when you go through this I'm wondering whether it belongs with a zoning board because most of it I have three college degrees but one of them is in law and most of these presentations early leads and we're not attorneys and I would like to ask the council to reconsider putting this towards the board for our consideration because when it was first reviewed by us there were a ton of questions someone in the answers to but the the neon flights on the board did not understand a lot of the herbage so I don't believe that belongs with our Lord it was referred back to the attorneys and and we proceed from there I'd like to thank Patty for helping us out quite attention and the city manager is always there and Randy and we're a silent Lord but we do get our job done and we know that the city and all you people do a good job too and the people behind me that show up they do a great job and I've asked remember just they didn't die but they might as well Rudy ran away from me this year and that left their home in on the right side of me we have been on boards together for the last 28 years and then another person resigned when we got new ones there and I'm familiar with but we keep trucking alone to get our reports but some of these things should be reviewed before they're built on us are there any questions that any of you lovely people have I uh I would like to make a comment first uh I think that there was probably a little bit of miscommunication of what we were looking for from Planning and Zoning we certainly I hope I'm speaking for the entire Council we're certainly we weren't looking for legal advice and unfortunately I'm afraid that that's what was interpreted whenever it made made its way to Planning and Zoning we received numbers that were highlighted and it was our job to kind of look through it and make some recommendations into planning and zoning and see if you agree you your the other members agree I don't know how we went down this rabbit hole but that I don't think that's what we were looking for I do appreciate your effort and your time and I apologize on behalf of the council for the miscommunication I think maybe the next time we pitch something to any uh one of these uh boards or committees we need to make sure that it's clear and fully understood as what we expect um would any council member like to make a comment on what I just said I sympathize with you with that so I wanted so I was hoping Council would throw it in the trash and I think we went from six six items to 40 pages in that new sign organs um Justice King I don't want to commission Carter but she says this will come back to court one day all right when they I guess it got some alarms from residents but I think the old wall uh the old city manager handled it Mars beautiful Whenever there was a problem this man right here I think has the same ability to handle it I think we should trash it but I sympathize with the whole door to even addressing it thank you very much I am uh I'm I'm not going to waste Mr trash time to try to explain why as things have changed over time that we have to become more uh protective of our liabilities and I think that that was the original reasoning for even altering our side policy all the way around uh again on behalf of the council I apologize for apology is not necessary it's just a matter of communications everything's accepted you have your job we have ours and I appreciate it I I do have a question for you now that we know what the actual task is does Planning and Zoning have enough energy to review a copy that has the numbers that we that we insert in showing businesses businesses Heights it's not it's not terrible but I would feel like a standard opinion on it I understand I'm looking for a yes or no I didn't quite understand the question you don't think I would like that I would like the kids to talk to you again but this time highlight every number where it's feet inches so that you have something tangible to look at instead of Legally speaking if it's shorter than 45 pages it will be 45 pages but all you have to do is look for the yellow where it's highlighted here it should be pretty straightforward and if we put little marks on the side saying something that each translation I think we can okay we were just looking for another group of citizens absolutely so but say that the council did not dictate shape size pipe with link Etc that's what I tried to say to notice of what we came up with F Well more than half 95 percent of this was passed by the legislature in Tallahassee so we couldn't do anything about it if we wanted to correct and so anything that could not smear will will serve it we'll see we'll take care of it thank you so much Mr Ebon I appreciate you call me JC everyone else any other questions or comments or JC well thank you so much for your report thanks have a good night all right and Mr reefer if you track down that copy it's got the highlighting on it to make sure that they yes what I gathered in the meeting was um the amount of pages the language they felt that it was impossible to understand and they didn't worry that the average resident trying to follow the code and understand so he was left for Mr Mora to try to streamline it is he working on that yes yes so when everything happens it needs to come back to us first okay thank you very much all right now we are on to number seven of the City attorney report contract well trastanio is filling in for Mr Moore tonight Mr krask you have the little boy thank you I did speak to Randy he said that although he has been talking to you about the adoption Senate Bill 170 which is one of me to [Music] that was the only update he wanted me to give you today all right good thank you very much any questions for Mr trash all right thank you very much now we are on to number eight the city manager's report has agreed this review and thank you mayor I'll start off with the underground project uh we actually started construction phase today for the conduit going on the ground us from the 28th Avenue south southern jurisdiction in the city of two Causeway Boulevard and then moving on the utility Consultants of Florida are working on acquiring the expensive and profile design for for phase two the stormwater projects we are currently got about half the streets surveyed they're coming in as they come into Gemini engineering they're being designed and um George a ship and Associates is planning on their finishing up a survey so a matter of I mentioned two or three weeks not long Series in personal policy manual to continue to work on this received the City attorney comments back from Mr eschenfeld he provided a lot of insight added a lot to our personal policy manual that was missing bring it up to a good legal status and we did a little history looking into some of the ordinance that were referenced um previous documents and it's been in the past with Personnel policy did this industry has passed it by ordinance so much in order to make our revision legal we need to pass an ordinance which I have Mr Moore of drafting at this point hopefully uh in August we'll do our first reading and then what that'll do is it'll sort of uh supersede all the previous ordinances and allow us to whenever we amend the policy manual to to identify resolution [Music] um I would like to bring up that uh in our budget Workshop we discussed future savings for a City Patrol vote for uh code enforcement from the water something that's come up this past week where some of our Waterway markers were already experiencing issues with a Clearwater Harbor another use that that's going to come in handy to us I just wanted to bring that up to the council good news this week the the ongoing Code Enforcement issue a tree I have a scheduled to meet with an Argos I got permission from the property owner to go on private property and we're going to do the sterile analysis of that tree we can pick Us in there and then I'd like to come back up to the top project which is our 2023-24 budget we have our next budget Workshop coming up on July 17th after that we will adopt the tentative military tonight in our last budget before Trump meeting we said that tonight we would make a decision on waste collection services on whether we are like to renegotiate with waste management and holds our current contract that is expiring the end of September or uh if we're going to advertise RFP Google services over the weekend I've provided me with some documents of some information that was gathered in the past a week and a half or so first document kind of laid out the price increases the rage increases that we've experienced in our current contract also provided a document from Waste Management that summarized all the cost increases in the different areas of the third Waste Management there's a document on the recent Florida Municipal big results across the State of Florida from 2019 to this current year showing you know the different contracts that went out to RFP and we're awarded they are awarded to what the percentage of increase was per municipality and mount RFP and this the percentage of an increase Compares their services directly to their previous contracts so as you know every city is different and the contracts are different so the best way to prepare is that and lastly I prepared I did a lot of research on working with the county on our our Utility Billing how it's set up how it's built through the multi-family not sure is first of all their family cans and single family residents I tried the layout where we're currently at our bi-monthly building is is in the utility bill with all the other County utilities and um how that covers our revenue from that and how that covers our current contract and then what we were looking at as far as a rate increase for a future contract that the proposed or the estimated and I should say increase of 25 council do you have any questions for the city manager yes Mr Roberts so excuse me so I also with regards to the waste management contract situation if the city wants to go out to and use the requester proposal do you need a decision on that tonight it would be preferable or the last time we did an RFP it was it was advertised on June 22nd of the contract of the Year expiring and um they've received the bids on July 24th so we're a little bit behind that schedule I was told by Mr Moore that our RFP schedules is aggressive per what he experiences in other cities but I do think it's doable we've been done in the past so I propose that if we do rmp we advertise July 26th and receive updates on August 29th regular meeting okay so is that something we need to to vote on I make a motion I can put it in the RFP out you don't have to foreign how did you feel about the price increase when I compared it to the other uh this valid cities counties that went out to RFP the data shows that the the awarded contracts are coming back higher than the proposed estimator we negotiated for hate release Madness my biggest concern is that we go out to RFP and we side that we want to Circle back to waste management but at that point we're actually paying more for the same services it's fair enough what I'd like to hear out of your mouth what your recommendation is to be tonight my recommendation based on the numbers figures speaking with other municipalities and also take your own municipalities who are satisfied with their service after being changed would be the sticker Waste Management through looking at the history of the services to our residents we've been with them for a long time and I know there's a very positive relationship with our residents I rarely hear any problem if there is a problem at least management response immediately and address this at all so in my my times management even my previous position I've been very satisfied with you Mr Baker after hearing his comments about this are you still moving to make a lotion for an RFP well I don't think an order of Peace would have courage putting it out for a bit so the council doesn't want to council wants to stick with a higher rate we didn't come back with any removal of those couple holidays and they ever come back with it they did um it was going to make minimal difference to remove the holidays per week um I just would like to make points at it in my getting into Waste Management if they renegotiate they estimate 25 percent increase what they're saying is if we go out to RFP they are they're based on the numbers the people who are going to come back and hire even when they're noticed there um the last time we did an RFP in the lowest Critter was 13 we special it was 30 more in the lowest paid maybe up going with Waste Management after building reviews of the scoring process um again I would just looking at all the information I feel based on the time we've had waste management and my experience with them and hearing the feedback from the residents I I don't believe that the numbers are going to come back I know that waste management is saying that they're going to be higher it would be coming in the bid than what they're going to reach negotiate yet and like I said um fire I got one of those cities that have changed their services and they weren't happy with the so the lowest Banner is always the answer so that's why I recommend that all right so it sounds like we are down to the wire on making a decision but I don't believe we can vote on this because it wasn't on the agenda for it in a microwave even though it's not okay so um would anyone else could make a motion to move forward to approve this this contract right reasons well that's going to come back to you this is just do you want to go out to RFP or not the negotiated contracts will come back for approval okay well that's what I'm saying is we have to approve that's a whole month from that oh we have to do with a special children so that contract will come back to you at your next break I mean if it's if it's improperly repair yes they want us to come into renegotiation to start the process to give you three okay so if anyone would like to do a new RFP another question we're not into the briefly proposal was great yeah you're not locked into that region came out and said because you're so the projected rates we're looking at 25 increase now they're going to throw up a contract that's in a way probably very similar to what we have now I think what Mr wiesler is saying and correctly if I'm wrong is that if this goes in an RFP they have to get in on it also and we may not necessarily get the same rate back is this something that we would need our ads or comments for the citizens but we're not voting on anything we're just asking questions okay yeah yes so so I appreciate you very much the position that Kyle's in here's what I have difficulty with over first of all when the current vendor common that we're willing to negotiate a certain percentage increase which we think is very good that they're saying however we go out and we ask for a request for proposal they're sort of threatening for lack of a set of term that when they give their proposal number it's probably not going to be as good as a negotiated number that sounds very odd to me first of all secondly when we're dealing with taxpayers dollars and we don't know we have no clue what the other competitors may be bidding through their proposal meaning and anytime I've ever been involved with a government organization I spoke with Carl and there's every organization has some minimum amount of money that you're going to spend the Western bid or request or proposal that exceeds that number which is a good thing now the problem went down to me that actually there's verbiage in their current contract that may have waste management that says we have the option of renegotiating with them without going out to another RFP again I don't support that only because the unknown is and what we may be hit with if we do it the other way another company probably will come forward and say Hey you know if you're going out to proposal I'm confident I would be that number and then we're sitting in a very uncomfortable position for the way that we spend taxpayers dollars so that's what I'm uncomfortable with without going that route I can't imagine another company like Waste Management saying we would negotiate with you with a number of x but if you go out with a request or a proposal what my number is going to be X Plus that makes no sense to me I think like comment other comments well the only other thing is the number that waste management is throughout this is supposedly information and deal with contractors all my life anyone that's going to fit this job for more connect number so and say I can read it or not completely I'm not saying the racial management or whatever attractions that they're doing it but um I had no problem with Waste Management they do an excellent job I just think um they're a little bit high on the cost I mean they haven't last year you remember they came back and said well fueled up and find out the gallon it messes up and labors up in labor their labor costs have bottomed out past year fueled down six and where we get 25 increase so that's that's the problems I've had well I guess what we need we need we need to find out if we have it so what I would just like to hear is from each council member of what they think Richmond to move forward with the uh the proposed contract or to do an RFP and so on this level so I really appreciate Kyle's Vision on this and where you're leaving us to go and I appreciate everything that you do and no doubt that your decision what you've recommended be relate wholeheartedly that we should do however Frank and Floyd have a very good no business goes without getting a request for a proposal and I love voice management I love what they've done for the citizens they're great but I think doing our due diligence with citizens have been seeing Korea Mr Becker [Music] vice mayor sure I think we should um go out in front of the bills Mr Zealand concur go out for geography Mr Roberts are available position on this case I am in the minority I agree with Mr riesler also but uh the council is pretty much said their feelings and I think we need a motion to go tomorrow standard motion made by Frank Baker so I've got a second move by Mike Sable Mr Banker do you have before I think we should just see a competitive biddy um I don't think it will but that's all I can say all right so we made a motion on the Fly I'm going to have today Knowledge from a citizens what do you mean citizens like to make a comment for yourself yes sir Mr answer John Hanson 22nd Street I was here for that Workshop I was one of the few sole person here when you discussed this contract listen to the waste management guide my question would be are we at the end of the current contract typically when we do these contracts we're multi-year contracts and within those contracts it stipulates a maximum cost increase am I correct you it stipulates a maximum cost increase of four percent based on the cost index in the past two years if you look at the layout of the CPI increases they've asked for more due to the inflation prices okay just so you also the original agreement that was prepared specifically was important set term until September 30th 2023 so the term is up so we we're not going to be able to bind over a waste management on a specific dollar amount because the term of the contract has expired but the contract also provides as the city manager is mentioned uh and I'll just read the language for you the city May indicate the desire to renew the agreement for an additional term the term is 60 months upon giving the contractor 30 days prior written notice the intent to renew renewals shall be by mutual agreement in such event this agreement may be renewed under the same terms and conditions including the payment adjustments as set forth and section 9 section 9 shows the dollar amounts and then all the sub paragraphs saying these are the reasons why we can increase it like the CPI and the gas and those types of things okay I wasn't completely clear on whether we were at the end of the current contract or not so okay um the other thing is as I recall from the budget workshop on this topic the census then was you were going to lean towards leaving that door open but consider seriously part of peace so I think it goes in the right direction take a chance but I can't see what this gentleman was trying to justify 25 Investments Way Beyond whatever I think is reasonable that's mindful thank you Mr Hansen for any other citizens like to comment on this topic all right back to the council so this is a motion to do an RFP [Music] way services I guess we can just do it all in favor all in favor any opposed all right so we had one opposed I went the other way to be with the group and the opposer was president material anything else Mr Rachel might as well I'll get on it okay I did have one more question for you which was um the boat what how much money are you uh proposing to spend for vote um right now I'm not a government contract for a full vote has a lot of options on it it's for shallow water if it's good until 20 20 thought of some time on the purchase but I I called you a hundred thousand I know that's what that's how I I know we can negotiating if we decide on the exact uh model that we want and then guadara less options one thing that I want to choose that we need something that's that's new and you know in good condition and a hundred thousand dollars today um let me ask you this um if you got your vote we keep you from jumping in the water again personally because I wasn't doing it I can't say that 100 all right any other questions or comments just real quick yes Mr Roberts and Kyle um back to the stormwater Improvement context which is wonderful that we're moving forward with all of the balance of the of the streets my question to you is I know we discussed once before you had actually offered then the engineering firm at some point would come forward interview a workshop which is probably more applicable or counseling what would you kind of visualize and how that was going to work are they going to be more on the front end or after they had completed the design I was envisioning and the movie kind of laid out in our our schedule is once again to about 90 design um but you've looked at it all at all different objects are coming and the council that's still on the table perfectly thank you any other questions all right so now we are on to item number nine this is the city clerk report Miss Gentry you can have the floor [Music] any questions or comments no or the city clerk all right thank you Mr Speaker all right now we are on to

zero four Mr Trask are you prepared to read the summary so this is resolution 2023-04 resolution of the city council of Bellaire Beach Florida approving the fiscal year 2023 and 2024 non-apple more assessment role for the Bellevue Estates Island assessment area directing certification of the assessment rules of Pinellas County Tax Collector and providing for an effective date that was the rate of your resolution 20 23-04 by 501 thank you very much Mr Trask Mr riefler I'm assuming that you 've had a generation is that correct that's correct all right would you like to explain the need for this resolution so with the assessment this is a requirement for the new every year we recertify it and do it in July every year foreign [Music] recertify and we submitted to the property appraiser to get Bill all right thank you before we move forward with any citizen like to comment on this proposed resolution let's get some comments all right Council I'm going to need a motion to approve this resolution we should make our laser material do I have a second seconded by Jody Shirley Mr Terry you have four thank you any uh other comments resolution oops pretty much just standard housekeeping every year in that case this is to approved resolution 2023-04 Miss Gentry would you please call the roll council member Baker yes Castle River Livingstone yes councilman Otero yes council member Roberts Iowa [Music] thank you very much Mr Rayford all right we are all to item number 17. this is your authorization the city managers to execute a contract for law enforcement services for the Pinellas County Sheriff's Department for fiscal year 2023 through 24. to your manager research thank you mayor this is the law enforcement contract typically in the previous years we had law enforcement on its own contract and the code enforcement I don't know contract this year when the new contract was drafted it was made clear by the sheriff's office that it's unusual that we have two contracts and asked if I was um considered going into one contract and they said the terms and the contractor would be the same essentially um just combined and leaving our code enforcement Services as a as needed basis unfortunately has been in the past so the new proposed contract for the the amount for the law enforcement Services is the 592 715 that is an increase of 7.94 from last year's and then the code enforcement is built on a per hour basis and it increased to 55.66 per hour which is a 7.5 increase uh there's a little history in the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office has done our law enforcement since two thousand 2007 when we expected the police department and the code enforcement Services we've used uh sheriff's deputy to assist since 2020 um from the beginning of Code Enforcement being done by Pinellas County we use them at a 20 hour program per week rate last year we decided during our budget readings that we drop it down to 15 hours per week at sale and um it's going well in my opinion and I propose that uh this current budget Erb starting October 1 we utilized 12 hours of Code Enforcer per week supplementing with in-house staff and this contract has been reviewed by these training and it's privately thank you Miss riefler that we could move to the students were any citizen Supply to make it happen yes thanks for answering John he is a 22nd Street it's interesting the annual increases year over year get higher and higher this is more than three percent more of the nice this current fiscal year I believe so I don't know what's going on inflation's family any other citizen elected time United States and comments are closed and now we're back to the council before we continue I'm going to need a motion for authorization execution of this contract so motion made by vice mayor Shirley do I have a second second second by Lloyd Roberts vice mayor Shirley you had before yeah we take a look other questions or comments Mr Baker page for this contract if you refresh the accountant memory and the citizens Feller Shores shares our deputy how many hours a day at least one hour to a shift for two or one hour I don't have those numbers in front of me I know it's been reviewed at least in the past two years um I forgot what was determined um I was told it was like one hour per shift but a couple residents have raised questions to me and I've noticed in the last couple weeks I'm not I'm excluding July 4th weekend because Bel Air Shores actually paid for extra research and insurance like just noticing on the beach in 40 months and I frequent just one day two weeks ago the deputy spent almost three hours or Sixth Street to 12th Street ticketing cars taking a tank off with the Sixth Street taking two umbrellas off of 12th Street and taking two bicycles off of 6th Street now we spent over seventeen thousand dollars current value and 365 days a week 77 an hour I believe Bel Air Shores is getting more in here because we no longer get the tax we never go longer get the fine to the parking and there's three parking lots so they get out they have to write it up one citizen is doing inquiring how much time is being spent it was well over you know three hours a day because if you look at the households they do every day they do them twice a day there's no way they could do this in two hours and I believe we should be getting get Fellowship beginning at least three hours a day back to us which would save you guys and not Seventeen over seventeen thousand dollars in this contract so I think we should table this contract I'm going to put him over the floor right now and we should make a motion to enable this contract so we get a review on how much time valer insurance is actually using our Deputy on our time we have a motion in the table on the floor right now if anyone like to second that motion all right the motion dies and so would anyone else like to make a comment about this contract yes sir what's your favorite yeah um I understand that obviously the rate didn't go out uh referring to code enforcement but the dollar amount does not because the lower hours obviously offset any potential decrease there what I'm going at I mean I understand the concerns about Bel Air Shores but at this point I believe the best method is actually if you approve the contract and now that we have the contract then we go forward to approach Bel Air Shores with you know reducing the because this contract is between us and the county not us and Bel Air Shores so I'm recommending that we go forward and with this country thank you Mr saber another comments early legal question can we sign this contract and then go back into charge embellish where did we find out here Computing and without any more than they're paying for this contract specifically provides that you're in the share of the Deputy doesn't say anything other than that so once you assign this contract this um and full force as for any contributions made or set out by Belair Shore that would be an agreement between this city and build our shore could have nothing to do with the sheriff my question is it's an open-ended contract when it comes to time that we're sharing instead it is open-ended to the extent that the use of the word share and it doesn't have any specific and that's why but that's my problem is we're getting our citizens are getting tickets or citizens are coming there they need to remove this and they have to move remove that thing our Deputy we're paying our Deputy to do that I can't I can't vote on the contract when we get some citizens I'm not sure whether or not this has changed from last year whether this was the same language last year from what I understand it's the same language the same assessment every percentage of time I believe it is and because other areas have similar contracts with the Sheriff's Department I think the goal is is to be able to to tend to demand anywhere that it's needed and other than the share of not being realized shall be in your life which I'm very disappointed about considering we're debating over their contracts I have no good plans with the service that we've received I think that we could step up directly such as the street on Street Act and that would also be interested in knowing yeah part of that contract includes a leading leader because this I believe is the second or third time that we've had a meeting a public meeting and did not have I do have a problem with that and it needs to be resolved I don't think that it will it definitely won't prevent me from voting for this contract however I want this address going forward and I think no matter what we should always have someone on site to make sure that the community and the council and any other questions or comments let's take it to a vote all right this is for authorization a city manager to execute a contract for law enforcement services for the Pinellas County Sheriff for fiscal year 2023-2024. okay councilmember Baker no council member Livingstone yes councilman rotario yes Pastor Linda Roberts aye council member stable all right vice mayor Shirley aye your goddess hi so it passes six to one Mr ring for you are authorized to receive thank you mayor item 18 unfinished business we have eight unfinished business we will move right on over to city council comments item number 19 this month the randomizer begins with council members Sable great um to make items that are up in front of the Florida people right now especially us one is Beach renourishment and signal is high insurance rates and I just wanted to draw your attention to the work the city council specifically uh councilman Banker at uh in this continuing fight to get more insurance rates or even get questions about the insurance rates answered by our elected representatives in Tallahassee second of all is featuring Hershman the mayor has been very vocal in working with various local groups specifically on this topic and maybe in aggression later on but the next Big C median I understand there's going to be some updates on that issue and I believe we're hosting it here on the 26th yes okay so that's uh usually Supply free food you know coffee and it's really good to understand what's going on with the rest of the beach communities that's all I have thank you thank you Mr Sable all right now we are on to council member Notaro all right we'll move right on over to council member Banker um today I sat down with uh representative Ken barefield our state rep about when Insurance um and the change they made last December she was unaware of a couple of things in the state and I'm talking about any statue now which requires each individual if they want to carry winning shorts it now has to match their flood insurance and she pointed out to me that she's looking into secondary homes compared to primary homes and maybe Justin that reads there to make it more equal but one of the things I addressed to her was about Assurance program what the state has done now is they've put themselves into 750 billion dollar liability when it comes to cost because they're escalating all these policies to be maxed out so you have to match it 250 75 000 for contents and your foot has to Max it back and to rebuild some of these homes are well under four hundred thousand dollars and the first thing people do is to get the insurance adjuster to come out and they just Brave everybody now she says well you know that's insurance fraud in that engagers to do this they said there was over 125 000 roofing insurance fraud claims were found fraudulent claims just in 2020. I said so if they found 125 000 how many really got away with it so she's going to readdress this and get back to me with a couple people in the state and the other thing is I've been talking to Ray Scott's office I thought I was getting somewhere with him and in the last month he sent me a consent form to get into this fever and then last Monday I got another consent form from one of his land shots to fill out and I actually blew a gasket I had his chief of staff on the phone saying no it was a misunderstanding we're going to get it so I wrote to Rick Scott and I mail it right to them it was Naples address and I did get a call today from FEMA we're going to have a sit down hopefully within a week or two about the percentages deductions noted in 2.0 per flood elevation and everyone is supposed to be getting here but if you look at your elevation certificate without or with if you look at your premiums without your elevation certificates it's probably the same with your own relationship where each foot or age six inches you're supposed to receive a discount plus the city is supposed to get a 20 discount for the things we did to modify to 2.0 and nobody from the nfip FEMA can show us where that discount is so that's all I have to say thank you Mr Baker all right Mr Roberts hero thank you I understand the compliment both Mike and Frank at our last uh Workshop that we had a topic came up that might have been working on for a while regarding the sandbag challenges that we had back over here on the 9th Street and the cool part about it was so Mike made his presentation as to why he thought the best idea out of how many people saw this was to move the sand banking operation to the which was an idea and then Frank said brought up reason to ask for why that probably wasn't the most effective process for our city for our citizens that's when it really happened and this should happen I think in time we have discussions about what we think is best for our city because through a discussion by all seven adults that are up here a whole different approach came to be which was really the best solution and fixed the problem the problem was traffic flow coming in and out but through that discussion I don't know how many you people have actually participated in that Infamous you're on a rocket ship and you crash on the moon and you have 50 islands that you need to rank from one through 15 that's the most important you do it individually and then you get together in a group and I've done it many many times with with departments that I've worked with and and each and every time the group solution is superior to every single individual ranking in the 10 to 15 amendment group that's been put together and that's what actually happened with this scenario about the sandbank operation because Mike then heard a different input and he put together a solution that we excuse me that I remember we moved the traffic flow problem which there's a little space behind us over here that's going to allow the traffic if everybody agrees to it could come down 9th Street and then exit all in one motion and get back out to go forward which was really the problem so it was just kind of cool I just wanted to thank everybody on this Council to work that through and it came out really nice thank you council member Livingstone I just wanted to thank miss Connie and Mr leaks for volunteering I appreciate it thank you Dr Square Shirley okay that's all right okay this month I have little to report concerning Beach nourishment at The Big C Beach nourishment dominated the meeting however the county is still holding out in hopes that the Army Corps will have a change of heart I get the feeling that the county is afraid that if they fully fund it once they will be expected to fund it every time in the meantime the majority of the millions collected from the FED tax continues to be spent on Advertising to bring more and more people to our beaches perhaps I'll missing something but if there's no beach when they get here then what happens I would encourage everyone here to contact your County Commissioners not just one not just the one that represents us but every single one of them can demand that the county creative plan and fully fund Beach nourishment for Santee Island as mentioned once before Council we have an upcoming budget workshop and tentative military meeting on the 17th and finally I have heard from Links at least four members on this Council were either ineligible or have decided not to run again apparently having to submit full Financial disclosures is already having an impact which I suspect was the whole purpose of enacting it so the question is do we really need seven council members or should we reduce the five next should we increase our terms to four years and align them with a general and midterm elections aside from cost cost savings overall turnout should increase dramatically finally should we increase term limits to three currently we are limited to six years or two terms I have seen firsthand that this letter prevents RC from gaining any traction in the county our needs and our opinions have little weight in Pinellas County due to the lack of time to build these relationships my question to each of you is are you willing to consider restructuring the city council in our election cycle I ask this because it's very very important to me that our c is its very best and it looks like the path that we're going right now we're not going to have either the amount or the quality of candidates we've had in the past so I just want to take a informal survey right quick Miss material would you be interested in having that conversation Mr Isabel yes Miss Livingstone Mr Roberts about the changes Mr Baker vice mayor Shirley yes all right so I have a four to two and then I would make five so uh I will be reaching out to Patty to see if we can schedule a work session to discuss this whether we make changes or not I believe it would be irresponsible of us not to have this conversation as always I'd like to thank everyone who came out tonight as well as those who watch remotely do I have a motion picture motion made by Franklin things always first starting line right who used to do in a second before uh Leslie all in favor aye any opposed all right good night everyone foreign"
