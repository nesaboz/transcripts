new sign uh i'm gene prue i live at 118 7th street um been there for 37 years and i was on the way uptown this morning and i said to myself a number of my neighbors have asked me about the doc at the end of the street i noticed your sign said there was a meeting at 2 p.m today so i thought i'd show up and and uh and in choir um the uh specifically my neighbor pam barber across the street and leonard and sarah coladizia who are next door um ali and his his mother who are on the other side they've all asked me about the doc and i want to compliment you on the excellent job that you guys did in having everything removed from the old dock there's no footprint there at all the company had pulled out pulled everything out it's absolutely clean but everybody in the neighborhood because it is such a uh integral part of our little neighborhood i would say for several streets around there's almost nobody there's almost never a time that i walk down there that there isn't somebody enjoying the seat on the dock uh what that time frame might be uh from any previous discussions for the replacement uh of the dock is that in the works yes that's in the works and right now we're getting the sea wall on a boat ramp designed by uh by an engineer just have a plan so we've got a bid for it um are you gonna redesign the boat ramp the low ramp well the dock the bow ramp and the c-log are all getting done oh see already i've learned a ton i didn't know that yeah and the 1956 ramp is going huh yes yeah it's got the old phone it's got the old 1956 uh scratched in with a pencil obviously in the old cement yeah and uh at the same time they are working to do a sea wall here and at 16th so that's going to be all one big project throughout the bid and once we have the design plan back then it'll go up a bit so i want to say three to four months that's wonderful is so we will have our our boat ramp leveling yeah it's coming back this year yeah it's funded um it's just a little gem i've enjoyed it for decades now it's just a little gem i know it's one of the reasons i bought the house there yeah it just and and of course uh everybody enjoys the dock so it's in the works and it's gonna happen at some point yes it'll definitely happen and it's the first on the list right because there's like a schedule for like all of the different parks as far as like the order of importance and how they will get funded right right right so yeah terrific thank you for the answer that's all i i was interested in i've addressed it in all your activities but that's my specific selfish reason was to see but to report back to everybody that's in the neighborhood that seems to come to me for advice or walk in the garage and tell me what they need this will survive this will suffice thank you all for your uh attention to that sure okay thank you um okay and then not item number five on the agenda so um i'm so sorry that you two missed the halloween event because it was so good it um you know we got out here i woke up in the morning it was pouring down rain i don't know if you guys remember that and then we came nicole and i got here at nine and kyle and there was a big black cloud over the sky and we were like oh and lynn goes if that comes this way we're in so much trouble because it was out over the water and then it like the skies opened up it was a beautiful day we had like what 20 dogs and like 16 kids or something like that yeah there's more and we expected more dogs than kids but there was a lot more kids than you know i was happy to see yeah it was a good showing in both categories um somebody walked up to me and said i went to another town's um halloween event last night and this one was so much more organized and it ran so much smoother and i'm like for our first one it was we're very happy to hear that just because you know you kind of don't know and you know so we did figure out because like we had this great plan to line up you know i did my vision line up all the you know the kids in like a half moon and then line up the dogs behind them the dogs just weren't having it okay so like there were dogs all over one dog escaped i mean the lady couldn't catch it and so she's like i have to go home my dog's too excited that dog never got even a number like to like be in the contest or whatever but so it's like the kids had fun and the dogs had fun and like there should be a lot of good pictures that get um posted somewhere at some point either in bella living or on the the city news but um i think everyone had a good time and it turned out really really well and like with you know i know this is only our second event and you guys weren't there but like suggestions for next year like things like you know as you're sitting there and you're at a million things going on and you know everybody did what what could we do better for next time if we do a second annual and the very first thing that popped into my head and it was kind of a bummer because um we didn't set like a you have to be signed up by 10 30 or unfortunately so it's like all the kids went all the dogs went i literally had the kids lined up in you know along um the causeway and then more people walked up so it's like raw stand there going where are the dogs you know so like we had to go back up and heard them and so we we needed a more precise like cut off time and um but the parade was really cute and the judges were like thank you thank you it gave everybody time to like tally everything up and people were stopping and honking you know if there was no traffic around and everybody was waving and i think you know it was it was a good little john it only took like what 15 minutes yeah when i did it real slow it took 12 minutes so with the kids and like trying to get everybody to walk at the same pace which no one does it was um and we had a three-year-old leading it okay haley hi i just wanted to say for me that the pets and uh the halloween event had some piles forgetting that already was wonderful and i heard a lot of really good comments about it so you guys did a great job and i appreciate that thank you yeah it was it was well done it was fun it was fun it was good and you know what i looked over the clock because i didn't have a watch on i don't know why and everybody dressed up in costumes like the costumes were great from the emcee to like all the judges like everybody dressed up and then all the kids were of course and the dogs and um i lost my train of thought thank you thank you appreciate it thanks um it'll pop up in my head for a second but anyway so suggestions for next year i would just say one the cut off time um because we literally had the best costumes i don't think they were from bella beach not that it mattered because we didn't turn anybody away but the best costumes showed up an hour and 15 minutes late yeah like a whole it was like a whole fam like the dogs and the parents were dressed up as a wizard of oz like and there's excellent like it was like perfection like they were like makeup out of costumes yeah and we were like yeah there's a picture when we said we'll introduce you blah blah but you just can't be in the competition because it's over you guys kind of missed it so but i mean other than that like i really nicole did you kyle anything or anything that you guys thought of maybe just or they're gonna be more reliable portable pa yes you return that so yeah our little sleeves are going to get one of the cities oh that's useful well our mc actually had one and offered to bring it i said no we have one and so what it was it was fine when he was speaking but if he like he paused to like let whoever walk around then it timed out and shut off kind of like you know your car does if you don't press that button your engine stops but i mean we gotta go once i was sitting there and keep it awake then it was fine but it was pain so yeah don't want to do that yeah and i want to say thank you too because we had 12 volunteers that day and we could have never pulled it off without them between like we had two people manning like the um you know like the donuts and the cider and the water um someone else was doing the music we had the six judges we had the emcee his wife and his son like it took all three of them to to get everybody kind of going in the right direction as far as like when they were called up and whatever so yeah so definitely a microphone but that was not i don't think anybody really noticed like anything weird or anything but it was like when it first turned off and we thought it didn't work we were like oh yeah i was like things break wow could you have done it with that huh if it broke could you no it was it was helpful we needed it yeah because i got in here do we have a record of how many people that attended our beach and how many were non-valid people i would say 99 were bellar beach residents okay there's only one person with a dog that was not from bella beach well that i know of yeah i think everyone i and i didn't talk to that person everyone i talked to was from bella beach and i met a lot of people that day so it was really nice like so it was good yeah like people that like didn't come to the last like to the jazz fest it was like all different people and yeah it's interesting good people registered in advance oh so nobody i think we only had three people that pre-registered but like people got there like 20 minutes early and like we just as soon as they would sign up we would give them a number and like a safety pin i mean everything that we talked about kind of just flowed through we didn't have to improvise or do anything no we just would go around like oh did you register if you want to register like go because then they like they were getting involved like groups you know like talking to each other and they're like oh you want to register and they're like oh yeah let's like do that and but yeah it all worked out the only thing the other thing that i would say is and this may be more on the part of like bellar living but so like the sign up sheet literally said stanley the bulldog is whatever um a fireman and he's number one and that's it and so like she was going around taking pictures and then of course when patty wants pictures for the city newsletter who is this like and we didn't have any of the names because like the parents names were on there and um you know we might have just got the kids name but there was one family they're so cute and i know them because they live on like third street i think um but like i you know what i mean like i couldn't remember their last name and like the baby's name but they were a whole farmer family so like so cute like the baby's only a couple months old and then cora is like three and then the mom and dad and i couldn't remember their last name so it's like she's asking me and i didn't know so that was the only thing it's like people are like okay your name your picture is probably going to go in something you know could we just have your name you don't even have to tell us what street you live on really but you know just so we have as opposed to just saying residents of bellar beach you know it would be like oh nicole sussman and louie yeah oh so anyway um so the sign-up sheet i guess could be a little bit more detailed where we put the name of the dog or the child and then maybe the parents names and then that would give us a fuller picture of like so there was a dog or two kids and two parents so we would know that's four people and then we had a total of like did you ever do a total head count i didn't but i didn't but i would say like like 60 yeah that's what i thought [Music] so roughly but anyway other than those three things like again we didn't have to deviate from our plan or nothing like really what arrives so it was good right and yeah we cleaned up and i looked at my watch and it was 10 till 12. i don't know it was like for every time yeah so it just it just went smoothly so and the cleanup again just like jazz was minimal like it seemed to like after this really yeah and it was easier to like actually put together too because we didn't do as many decorations all we did was decorate the table the day before yeah so that was good is there anything anybody else wants to bring up in regards to the halloween event i think too if we would have had the sign up earlier we would have had more people too i think more people would have seen it earlier because like again it's a 50 50 shot hey gene did you get our postcard that talked about our three events in the mail it was two-sided see we mailed it out to every every address and it's a 50-50 shot when i asked people if they got and i know we get like 10 of those postcards a day we know his address is on there yeah oh everybody's address was it's the same you know you get weak cinnamon well i know what they are but i don't remember that one the hurricane information that came out from the city it was like a green trifold um i think i got that see they use the exact same company same mailing address in fact i know i got that because it's on the kitchen table yeah so we use the same company my neighbors went to the halloween thing they loved it oh did they oh good awesome yeah so i it was a 50 50 shot on the mailer so i really think that if we would have had the sign up and it was going and people saw it like the sign was up you would have doubled the people i think so too and that would have been good and we were ready for that we had extra apple cider and extra donuts and like they're you know you were you were driving by today and you saw beginning yeah oh good everything's working that is fine i was literally gonna i had to pull in to get a sticker on a new vehicle anyway but then i saw that and i said i'll stop in this afternoon and have a meeting but uh yeah i know that was very effective print's large enough you can read it on one pass you know you got to keep your words real simple because you're doing that uh but you know it's it's uh it was good 2pm there was no it's nice yeah well someone said that the title was a little confusing like they didn't really understand hudson pal the pals part i said i would just bring it up but i mean that was when i heard the beach clean up so yeah no that's good that and then i mean we got lost like we kind of like lost the dogs at the end at the parade but i just think well i'm saying like because a lot of people came so early that the dogs were just like tired and they were just like going different directions and then like yeah we had a little like where we were waiting and then people were like where are we going what are we doing it's like it got a little cray cray but then we pulled it together at the end and so like that was the only thing because it was like people started to like spread out and i couldn't like i was like just standing in the military like waiting for people to come because there's like 20 people back there 10 people in the middle you were up front they were like trying to catch up and like the dogs can only go so yeah no so that's a pretty easy fix so next time what we'll do is have um the mc at the very very beginning before anybody competes say okay this is you know how this is going to run and it's like we're going to go through all the kids or all the dogs whichever one would be first and then immediately after as the judge's votes are being tallied we're going to line up and do the um the halloween parade the costume parade so it's like the dog you know the kids can go first and then the dogs behind because there was one dog that was so upset that it wasn't with their kids and did you remember that one yeah yeah it was being like it was crying because it saw its little you know kid family like at the beginning of every so whatever if it gets intermingled that's fine but like if it would have been explained earlier then we wouldn't have had that issue so we'll do that next time yeah um because i know it said it but like if you've never been in one of those parades you know it could just say we're going to line up starting here and just kind of fall in order if you want to be in the parade and it'll take 15 minutes because you know and we can just explain exactly where we're going so people aren't like taking my kids yeah well we weren't taking kids anywhere without their parents nor the dogs uh you know obviously they had to be on a leash um so maybe is like with the cut off time to when you can sign up we also say like i didn't see any kids without parents though did you well we got i had a few of them that were just like on the road like bye i was like oh hurry but it worked out like we didn't lose them so they were with us like we returned them back to their parents we didn't have to open the band-aid box the first aid kit stayed intact yeah no kids like fell thank god nothing would no no band-aids no no like scrapes or dog issues we just needed a scissor but that was it a scissor yeah remember the little cowboy hat on the dog got like wrapped around it's like fur something so i ran in and got scissors but yeah all good we did great yeah so okay anything else otherwise it was good yeah so a couple things that we could tweak but nothing crazy that we would have to like rethink conceptually um okay so number six um i'd like to open a discussion on a possibility of a january health and wellness fair here at the community center um we've never done one i don't think colorado beach not i mean to any memory that i've run across possibly but kyle has done them in his like previous places in oldsmar yeah yeah and so like in lynn too right lynn has a little bit of experience so like they're very very familiar with the concept so um i thought initially um we would have to get it approved by the city council but it ends up it falls under like just like yoga or stand-up paddleboard it's like it's a health and wellness thing that isn't costing any money um it's just really just setting up the tables and then um having the different i don't want to call them vendors but the different um houses different businesses for health and wellness so it's like this was my brainstorm and every time i think i'm done i think of like three more things so uh but they're just categories and we literally don't have room for all of these different we don't have this many you know there's many tables and there's much space in that room so like obviously we're expecting some no's but i i gotta tell you i've asked eight people and i haven't had a single no if there would be interest if we if we do this would you be interested and they've all said yes um and they love doing things like this so do you want me to um i would like to one get your input on whether you think it would be something that would be of interest in the community 100 i think yeah i think it would be great i mean there's i mean i don't really see a downside to saying hey like the one thing that i would like to do that i i don't know how to go about it and it seems to come back to a lot of our our things on like if like say we have a chiropractor that lives in beller beach i would love to use them as opposed to the chiropractor that one of us may know that may not you know they may not work you know their offices in here somewhere else but i don't know who those people are like you know i know dr aki she would be the only one and then obviously we already have like the beach yoga instructor we have the stand-up paddleboard person when nicole and i did the stand-up paddleboard yoga class she's the one that actually said hey have you guys ever considered doing one of these i've done them i'd be more than happy to work a table it just lets more people know about you know what we have or what's going on and then um so i've been kind of playing foam tag with morton plant because they do community outreach programs they have a person that's dedicated to doing this we just keep playing phone tag to see if they have interest or availability like say i went to nature's and i talked to a manager there and i went online they need a three-month lead time so automatically nature's got knocked off because if we're gonna do it in january we we don't have enough time um and then my husband mentioned he said that um i don't know if it's more coveted driven or whatever but like say walgreens or cvs they have like government funding for community outreach programs right now so he's like you know you could maybe ask them to buy the bottled water or maybe hand out kind bars that kind of thing and then like um there's a produce market that opened not too long ago on gulf boulevard so i was going to see if like maybe she would do like a table and maybe give out apples or something like that like you know just so we would end up spending no money if they would we would set up the tables and they would all bring in kind of like they did you know for the yoga table or whatever she put out her own tablecloth and her little lotus tree and they can make it however nice that they want um or whatever so i just what do you think george physically what would it look like well i i'm not trying to stand up oh yeah so like say for example it's an open house um say it would be from 10 to 4 on a saturday and say in a perfect world we get it on we wanted it on the 15th and of course there's wedding that day so because the blood drive would actually have been on that friday and they were willing to move it to that saturday because obviously if you donate blood they check your cholesterol and if you go for a blood test that's a hundred bucks easy even if you have insurance so it's like um but anyway so like we would set up the tables like we would have a welcome table or whatever and what we do is we kind of have a list like this in the order so it's like say they would have a table number one and you know on your sheet that number one is morton plant and maybe they're going to do a blood pressure check or they're going to do whatever a coveted antibody test they probably won't do that here but um so but they would just we would have a welcome table and then the tables would kind of snake around kind of like a a trade show or a conference so like you would go through and the tables would be in order and you kind of walk along and like say if you don't want to go from table so this would be in the big it would be in the big room yeah should be cables around the perimeter and then some in the middle with enough space how would this um i mean this magnificent list you made thank you it's not exhausting either broken down i mean we can't have i don't know how we're 30 no no because we're going to get some no's and certain available options yeah there's options we i mean we could take half of the we have to take them all half of them off and some of them are going to say no um and as far as like i don't we could do anything alphabetical order first to sign up it doesn't really matter the order because it's like say it would be kind of like number three is the chiropractor so if jean's looking for a chiropractor he knows to go to number three to get a business card and maybe some information like say nicole is looking for a massage therapist she would go to table number seven they're in the back because literally they will bring like their little massage table and do like a 10-minute like neck massage you know how you have those chair massages or whatever um so we would have a program just like you know maybe on a nicer piece of paper than this saying who's at what table so you don't have to go table to table to table if you want something specific and if you want to walk through the whole thing great but um no we have what did you say we had room for 25 tables that's estimated yeah yeah so we only have room for 25 businesses um i just was brainstorming but again like when i think i've thought of everything i think three more and i'm sure you guys could probably think of 10 more i was just like well for example though morton plant probably could do half of this yeah but i would like to give some independence no chance that's what i'm saying is they could do half of them in publix you know could do a bunch and so it seems like these could be grouped a little differently yeah well this is the thing this was my list without me talking to anybody so if i actually get a hold of someone at morton plant that like is in charge of this because i've talked to another lady who gave me another lady's name she could say these are the five things that we would do and then i'd scratch those five off the list to your point um like i've only talked to nature's they're already crossed off so i need to talk to publix next because they're closest and i'm gonna try to do closest proximity like we you know like so you know it's not like we're gonna get a chiropractor from safety harbor we're gonna get one within like a five mile driving radius that people might actually want to go to from bellar beach so um but like say for example like i have um cryogenics down at the bottom gold's gym does cryogenics and you can actually buy a package without being a gold's gym member so like they would have that covered so that would and then they also have personal trainers and you know what i mean so to your point they would cover three or four of these and we're going to try not to duplicate so we're not going to have gold's gym la fitness planet fitness like if gold's gym commits then we're not talking to any other gyms does that make sense yeah because then they get more like a spotlight and they're not competing with other people in the room how do you envision getting what was tied down well like i said i've talked to eight people and they've all said yes so as soon as we get a date approved and i would love to like have an anchor like i look at morton plant as an anchor i look at cvs or walgreens as an anchor and then like publish publix like a big name that everyone knows and then have all the other independents fill in after that so like um it's been super easy like um i just give a two second hey we're thinking about doing this would you be interested and they're like absolutely so and they've done they've all done them before so like all they're used to having to bring in their own tables i told them that we would set the tables up and they were like woohoo um so i i'm kind of thinking this is the easiest event we've done as far as um set up and we have nothing to buy yeah we're not spending any money i mean we do want to find people that will donate like things that we normally buy like the water or like i said apples or kind bars or whatever um what's your footprint going to be that that room over there yeah i don't think it'll be big enough you're going to get a huge response huge you're getting an enormous response so even in the open house concept oh it's wonderful it's just going to say you you'll have requests for space all over this lobby in that lobby i saw what they did over at the church i go to and it just got enormous really quick did it change your arms on handling the health fair just got when was it every year they do it it's enormous okay they can't fill the parking lot and whatever space stay alive is never enough it's just people come and come and come and come you'll have an enormous event okay so is if we just literally say that we have to cut it off at 25 vendors because that's all the room we have or you're talking more like attendees oh i'm talking the number of people that will attend the the and the number of vendors is is also going to be i think you're going to have a willing group of vendors and a willing number of participants i think that's great because my biggest fear is we'd have the room full of vendors and only have 12 people showed up so and i've launched saint jerome and i've never been to the health fair so i'm glad you mentioned that um it's in uh i think it's in january they fill the parking lot every year okay but you know obviously they didn't have it the last two years okay what hours were you thinking ten to four i'm sorry ten to two four hours that's where i got the four ten to two um and what time frame in terms of time well we were thinking january because of new year's resolutions and all that good stuff january 22nd was like the pencil end date is that that saturday yes yeah with 15th is that going to compete with yeah i don't know i was never involved in the one narrator and to see how enormous it was walk through but you might want to check to make sure you're not competing with somebody else who's done it for a while syndromes st well i have i'm on the adult faith formation committee and i have a meeting there with sister lucia tomorrow night so i'll ask her because that doesn't fall under our umbrella of what we do in that group so it's never real she knows everything yes she does yeah and you know honestly like saint jerome is it open to like everyone or just parishioners everybody um well i mean i guess i i mean i don't other than limiting the number of vendors that we have obviously it looks like it's open to residents and and i would welcome it to be very crowded we'll have it on our side and we'll have it but it'll be like the other events are just kind of marketed to this community so i don't know if it's going to really pull in too much i don't know how much marketing oh hannah boulevard in that in those states up there imperialist that's the draw for for that neighborhood on hamlet boulevard obviously yours is going to be our city yeah so yeah it's but i still think you're going to have lots of participants because everybody just goes up the hill for their health care yeah so i i think that'd be great i would i would hope that's how it would be um so george do you kind of have a picture in your mind now i do thank you okay um okay does anybody see anything on this list that they think that we shouldn't have or anything that you would like to add to this list because it's like you know because i some things it's like they came to my mind because i do them or i use them or it's you know part of you know but then i'd also like to open up new things for new people that would say hey i would like to try this or hey i just hurt my arm so i'd love to work with the stretch therapist or um i you know have plantar specialities i need a podiatrist and i don't have one you see those postings all the time on next door i just moved here and i need to find a dentist or i just you know whatever um home health care i see those posted a lot i see um you know right away i think maybe i'll take off happy feet we don't really need a shoe store here um but like wheelchairs and lifts i thought you know that can't maybe um and like i said some of these i'm just not gonna you are not gonna be able to find anybody like they're not gonna be available that day or i think the produce is a really good idea surf side medi-spa like radiance there's a lot of them i think that's a good idea bang care i think that's a good idea good idea for everyone and dr mackey is right down the street they're very close i think there's another one yeah and if you guys have like nay like if okay if you know people that you could like the ones that have check marks on are the ones that i know and i've talked to already and they've said yes so it's like if you say like my chiropractor is next door to nature's it's too far like there's chiropractors that are closer so like if say george you go to a chiropractor that's like you know right on west bay that you have a good relationship with or whatever um like we can split this list up i call everybody it's been so easy it's so not a pain in my butt like i don't mind doing it all but like if you guys know people that you've worked with for 10 years and you're like oh my gosh they're great that's way better than me calling someone cold turkey going hey we're doing this i never met you are you interested does that make sense yeah absolutely oh why do you have mother kombata here and juice habit those are people you want to call to see if they donate yeah well that's mother kombucha is in saint pete and i would love for them yes and i love i was drinking a trap that i bought at nature's and i was like i was at a red light looking at the bottom like there literally there was a florida flag and it says made in st pete and i would love for them to do a table juice habit is right off of indian rocks road and they do fresh juices and like salads and stuff like that and they're an independently owned you know they're great and they're great right okay you know where that little um there's a producer right there yeah i'm heading south here yeah this bridge or take a right or you're right yeah between waltzing yeah and so it's in between there and then you go and then it's like on the right side it's like right before there's a little no no uh there's like the coffee mill they keep going and then they're on the right closer to development yeah like yeah because there's nothing right there's another juice place on missouri but you know i've taken this lady she's a the lady that owns juice habit is she just got her yoga certification and i've taken a couple of her classes so it's like she's really nice and you know so it's like and she's local and she's independent and she's so much closer than the one on missouri so it's like i would love like to start in and then if she says no then obviously we go to the next one if we're still looking for vendors and then another thing um you can like mix this it's not good but all the people that like already do classes here so like meaning like the sub yoga and then like we had all the other people remember like um the lady that did like the training on the beach like all the people that like already have classes set up for ballerina they're automatically i feel that they should be at least like a one or two table combined you know what i'm saying because i don't think we need like three yoga people no and then like we'll keep it that like the activities are just for the people that already are here in ballard beach like doing because then that will narrow down like okay we don't need four tables for that maybe they could just do like share a table yeah like here's all the activities of bellar beach boom and then that get then that opens up like two or you know extra room for other no that's a good idea who do you have for a personal trainer um he is so the dietitian and the personal trainer are the ones that are in bellar living every single month uh lindsay and jorg yeah they're golden um if you work out with him you go to gold's gym but she is yeah it's like they're all yeah and then there that would also be the cryogenics too right yeah the same umbrella yeah yeah so that's good so you're getting like four two or three or four things under one table yeah well yes they would work together because they um i talked to the owner and go to gym this morning and he you know he'd be like yeah that's great and i could work with yorg and lindsay and yeah that would be perfect if we put him at the same table because then to your point it gives us opportunity to put more people in but like say the bikram yoga one is completely different from the other two yogas that we have but she also um she's had the cold sculpting there she's had the vitamin injection people there she sells lulu lemon there so it's like she would be like if she can do she loves doing events like this and she's got like ins on some of these other categories where i don't know anybody um and people would love like if you want to buy a lily lemon jacket you don't want to drive to international plaza or work what does that call international plaza yeah yeah yeah so it's like she just started selling lululemon i bet you a lot of people don't know that um if they're interested what is lulu oh get your wallet out there buddy lemon is a brand of yoga pants yeah it's like athleta or athletics yeah yeah i know they have fabulous stuff but it's better get that money out but it's good stuff i mean yeah i think stress management life coach someone like that would be really fun i don't know if one but like the healthy home food delivery i there's a couple there was a lady that used to do it out of the crossfit gym that i went to and the people raved about the food and she's an independent but there's also like hellofresh where they send you like a whole weeks of food free to start if you want to try it and if you don't like it you cancel it but i think you know i think the local independent as their first yeah i didn't put anything specific i just thought hey if someone doesn't feel like cooking anymore or they don't want to cook or whatever yeah it might be nice to have some healthy options sure as far as consolidating people to tables like also if like when you're recruiting them if you could ask them if you know if they're okay with having a six foot versus any foot table that they are then the more six foot cables we could use if we could use them all but if i can get people to commit the six foot cable is fine that'd be good because then it just opens it up more you have 25 in total i have at least twenty at least one i've got and they fit that many in there for a while i wouldn't want to give someone eight foot table if they don't need it understood so the eight foot tables would be for sharing it doesn't have to be one way or the other just if just tell everyone it's a six foot table what are they pulling up an eight-foot table with it is a big table i mean like yeah i mean what i think it would be hard to fill up a table that size with you know because mostly it's just like information cards yeah okay well how about this okay so like maybe take this home and read it like think about a little bit and then email patty if you have anything i will email her this list and then so she'll have the master or kyle do you want it um you know obviously patty okay yeah usually she's the one we're just getting people right now that are interested because we don't even have a date right so they can't fully commit to yeah well see this is my thing because i've been chasing morton plant for a week if she whatever they say yeah they were kind of like yeah but if she doesn't get back to me within a week i mean i know bake here now is morton plant but baycare is still separate so it's like if you know we can just get anybody from baycare or morton plant because i know morton plant like you said they could cover i forgot that they had a health and wellness like whole center that people can join like a gym which i wasn't really thinking of them for a gym you know i was like i was hoping the independents could do that because they're such a big entity and they cover so much stuff oh um you can get i don't know anyone who sells it or i'm sure somewhere but locally like beauty counter or things like that someone who does that kind of base products you know what i mean or not really well we're not having anybody sell anything is that what you mean well every one of these people are kind of selling something i don't really like it that way but i mean like someone who does a subscription to beautycounter is the one that doesn't do any kind of like harmful chemicals and things of that sort interesting yeah or you use that eminence eminent thing yeah maybe that could be do you sell it yes well i don't sell what maria does and maria sells all organic hair products maybe maria wants to jump in she's already got a check oh what is she under she's under healthy hair okay yeah so the organic health like skincare and i'm just saying people who sell those kind of things yeah and she's giving away she can give away samples and there's like a link on her website or my website that's like you can just like say if you just wanted some organic moisturizer you could have it mailed to you yeah so i'm sure there's some residents here that do that kind of sound yeah yeah so that's i think we're good with that um if anybody knows an acupuncturist or a holistic practitioner pediatrician like some of these i like we're shooting in the dark like and like say my my gyno she's so far away i would never i mean i would scrap that one and holistic practice practitioner or pediatrician i had to say i'd describe i know but then we're not like you know obviously people here have kids you don't think that we should cover every genre of age group no well i just think the amount of children that are here okay yeah i mean like i said a lot of these are going to be scratched because we don't have room so okay we can what about that vitamin store anything that's necessary with like we got walgreens or cvs all the way around well you know that all our vitamins are supposed to be bunk but if you want to or so to be what like you know they took like a sample off their shelf and half of them didn't even contain the vitamins oh yeah sorry walgreens now they'll listen and go oh no we're not going to work this off yeah okay so we'll take that off because i can see them kind of seeing that as being a competitor i think dermatologists i don't have a recommendation if somebody close by would be a really great i do oh you do or you no i don't but i want to do yeah florida dermatology right across the street from balor country club yeah so like that's who i was going to ask but like again i could say no what i think they would add a lot to it you know yeah i mean we're in florida we need a dermatologist like you know we might need we might not need uh reiki i'll take that off that was stretching at the bottom second right above the massage therapist reiki is like a form of um stress relief it's not really like massage but it's um it's a form of that it's funky it's holistic have you heard of it have you heard of it okay well we'll take that off uh like physical therapist um like the detox thing um you know we can kind of maybe uh combine the detox with the juice the juice bar kind of yeah oh if you got the the orthodontist you probably don't need a bit of line okay yeah a lot of those do like they do both yeah okay um so like for the wheelchair home health aide um did i put that twice i did lifts so i put wheelchair twice so i did do and so i'll do that i'll like try to get that at one table um hearing aids yes yes okay do you have someone in mind for the health and nutrition author yes okay i'm just curious i know okay that was me dreaming big uh i i was like oh my god it would be great if we could get to someone who wrote a book about health and wellness and he i found one but he lives in um it's like two and a half hours away it's by saint my uh for myers yeah and um it's here i took a picture of this book because i found it on amazon i looked up authors in florida and then i looked up authors of healthy books in florida and he came up and it was um [Music] oh i don't know where it is but um i i saved it somewhere and that that's good that's a far that's far reaching okay that was me dreaming big and that's probably gonna get so i'll just knock it off right now because he's not driving five hours to come to our health and wellness fair um okay so um again just like look over the list if you have any additions that you want to add email paddy and then if like say you have a great eye doctor that you would love to call like you work with what is it st michaels or whatever you know if you want to tell her these are the five people i'm gonna call since you know we and we'll just organize it that way is that okay or if you send her three ideas george and say i don't want to call anyone just tell her that and then i know um that like you know these were your three but like you would rather have one of us or me or her call [Music] yeah i mean i think or do you guys just want to divide the list evenly i don't care i'm just confused about it doesn't seem little organized when i look at this list oh george's is just my brain is it's not supposed to resemble organization this is a this is like a brainstorm this was as soon as it popped in my head i typed it there was no organization involved it will be well organized once we get the yeses and then we'll have a nice little spreadsheet that'll say once we have the date and everything then we'll get everything kind of organized and we have all the commitments and then we can kind of look at it and see how we can group them okay it's gonna be good george once you see like the planogram and like everyone is in their position i work from the other direction i guess i say what i want to have and what different categories and how do i fill those categories and then it seems like we're making a what's called a shotgun list or an elder sculpture brainstorming [Music] just throwing everything out there and seeing what sticks and then we'll regroup from there yeah this was the first time we talked about it so we weren't going to be real organized it was just kind of like well let's just kind of throw it out and if it was organized it'd be done we wouldn't be talking about it right here you go exactly all these people agreed we have everything done at the end yeah so at the end of the day like again just review the list and then if you know you think of somebody else or if you say okay um just type petty an email and say i would like to take um the chiropractor the vein care and the physical therapist and i know people that are local that i use and i'm going to call them or just say i'm gonna here's my three ideas but i i i'm just not gonna call anybody and then that way i know where you all stand without like you know us having another meeting and yeah does that make sense as you get people on so that yeah and then i'll have patty like um she'll have the like the master list and so like when it's checked off she'll know that they've been contacted and i'll put another like excel spreadsheet together that says okay so the dietitian is x her name is lindsay and she's with back and balance and you know she needs us she's sharing a six-foot table with the personal trainer and gold's gym so we'll have the more organized list that you're looking for as they get signed up i'll work on a layout and then um as we get vendors in up to all of them we'll just fill it in ways of grouping and then we'll finalize it all okay yeah that's perfect is everybody good with that yeah yeah okay all right awesome um okay so item number six on the agenda um okay so our um holiday social and christmas tree lighting is december 6 and it starts at 5 o'clock so like if you'll see at the bottom our next it's not really going to be an official meeting we won't have like meeting notes but it will be december 6 at 4 pm and we'll come in and set up like the christmas cookies or whatever we end up with and make the hot chocolate and coffee or you know whatever we're having we'll get everything ready in our hot craft dispenser and then um nicole is going to handle the merchandise table i did an inventory right before this we've sold out of almost everything we are going to have the beller beach embroidered towels back in stock we found towels and um they were backwarded on amazon but we have an eta and as long as amazon doesn't say oh it's going to take longer we're good yeah so but they should be able to invert them did you guys do you guys want to see the towel do you care yeah okay okay are you sure yeah yeah um just on the shelf by the t-shirt yeah because what i've been doing because we've had such a hard time ordering finding a towel like the first white ones were great and they were eight dollars and so we were able you know and then the embroidery was like six dollars and so we were literally selling them for exactly what they cost us we weren't trying to make money off of residents well then um that towel was no longer available and i have had so many towels mailed to my house and set back is it going on this with the stripes and everything yeah oh no so we got the cabana stripe because then that way the people that actually bought the plain white ones like if they want to buy but instead of putting it in the middle because the middle stripe is blue we're going to put it over to the right and the white and it matches our hats and our logo yeah and it's it's a little bit more expensive yeah all right it'll be worth it were you able to order the big like the bulk so we got them cheaper yes i did it in the longer order or whatever it was okay oh no it's great so they're nice yeah and that hasn't been washed and usually when you wash it it fluffs up a little bit but we have to give them to them free like before we wash them to embroider them what's the retail gonna be on there uh i think kyle's is gonna be 20 what did you they decide all that we don't see 20 20. okay yeah because we got a decent price on them and then with the embroidering you know 20 was the mark and then i think it was like if you ordered 25 gave us that just got better one was like 27. it was packs of 30s or something like that okay that makes sense yeah well or 28 was it 28 it was packed before i don't know we're reordering the merchandise too yeah because we literally have two men's seafoam green t-shirts left everything else sold out and those literally could also be women's t-shirts because they're like um you know they're either or we sold all the tanks already no no we still have women's but i didn't get um i i didn't get through my inventory because the meeting was started but we um so kyle found the stickers that you're i'm sorry i don't remember what they look like are they the bellar beach logo well i just stuck the logo in there as an example um and they were coming out it was like 90 cents 93 cents each which is great the logo's got at least like three colored on it but we could make whatever design we want to come up with like those other stickers like you know they have to just kind of say well with this fbb or something yeah i actually liked it there's the logo you haven't done those before right just um no we haven't yeah let's just do the logo and see how those go is everybody okay with that since like we sold out of all these some people like that you know they have like i love lrv or something like that you know you can get creative with it or well do you want or we could duplicate kind of what people like or buying i mean it's whatever you order is good i'm not sure what you guys think about oh shirts and stuff no no this is for the stickers because we sold out of all the stickers and we were paying 3.33 for that little biggie sticker and so he went to the i where are those people the banners.com but then it was like a branch site off of that but i wonder what people were what they did with the stickers my stickers went on all my on like cups and stuff yeah people like to stick them on things that i don't know like trunks or whatever they have stickers or not when did we have stickers with the jazz at the jazz and before jack you see people that always have it on their vehicles in the black and white white right yeah it's just bb so and you said the magnets were a lot more expensive magnets were more i mean i think it was like a four by four magnet i was looking at i was like close to five bucks see i would put a magnet on my car would never put a sticker but i know some people don't mind i don't know the magnets do if they stand on that paint for in the one spot for a very long time oh it ruined your painting i've noticed that it would um we have like this promotional stuff magnet that went on the back of one of our bands we were in oldsmar but after a while yeah it like deteriorated oxidized right yeah yeah yeah so i don't think stickers do that as much well stickers are like obviously if they're a dollar versus five dollars i mean and the stickers were selling and i don't know i don't know if you think it's a little more versatile i guess you know because you can stick it up that's true yeah they're vinyl stickers right yeah like this yeah so that you can like wash them yeah water bottle and stuff like that yeah yeah okay so yeah so we're gonna reorder you're gonna re order the stickers you're gonna are you gonna get more hats in let me who are we we're doing the stickers for just sale i know laura some people are asking for stickers i'll just have to get the approval okay but i never went that far okay just throughout the price okay but what they got what we got what we have to do i don't know what our design must look like i know we did have them before um you know i would love it just to be the logo because we've never had stickers that were the logo and you know okay as long as you guys think so yeah i love our logo and what side are we talking what size yeah what size i'm saying with a three by three or three i was like the size of the lid it was pretty decent so yeah i wouldn't want to get it too big but well you know how we had two sizes before i thought the small one was too small i like the bigger one can i get a window sticker a window thank you for graciously allowing me to hang that kind of run yeah i use the fire ramp extensively thank you and the pitch and all the rest of that stuff it's all it's all critical okay i know that boat ramp stuff decades of doing it anyway thank you so much for letting me know thank you thanks for coming like four months before the rfp right uh that's what i'm gonna estimate yeah when the rfp isn't out yet no no um well they did their uh the engineers working on the design oh first we got that back um i can wait look at this love to you know love to i've just seen so many boats over the decades stuck there or couldn't fit there or it can fit there it's actually a very clever little ramp i put it in the 50s okay we just want to make sure the run out goes a little further anyway thanks very much appreciate it anytime you want to come back you're on you're doing it you're doing it right in the front you can just come ask your questions and you can head out you don't have to hang out if you don't want to you know what i mean you're terrific thank you [Music] he's lived here a long time he probably knows he doesn't have to stay i think he wanted to leave at the very beginning that didn't want to so stickers yeah i mean i just i would say the three inches yeah would be good okay and then um we only have one blue hat left and we only have four gray hats left and then we have no stickers i need to count the koozies but i can tell it went down from this number the license plates i don't know if we've sold any and then hopefully we'll have the towels back in stock so nicole can do the merchandise table we do have um some i think we probably sold half of the women's and they've been asking for colors other than pink so this is just based on laura i'll do like an order you know if we have to do you know 15 minimum i'll do like uh say like peach or whatever yellow and then um on the men she said the plain navy blue that just said bella beach went well and then she never even saw the light ones light blue ones from jazz that sold in four minutes everybody loved those shirts so i think those should be reordered um since we have no men's shirts whatsoever i didn't order anything really last time because we had some and now they're all gone yeah i'm glad that they went because we kind of have the like the different different variations lingering yeah they're all good well and she made a good point and i think you mentioned it too is that like okay even if they don't come in for the holiday social like people have to come in for their new beach sticker for january so she's like everybody will be she's this is my time to sell she's like because everybody will be in the door yeah january january because it's a yearly sticker and you guys don't do like like one like in the beginning of the year like one night that you guys are here late because like we were talking about that like people like who work like in order to afford to live here like can't get here before four o'clock you know what i'm saying that's why i was like if there was a day or don't have to actually come if you call us um and if we've ever done them for you before we could mail it because that was like people like the only time people that like worked and were able to get the merchandise without the event so that's why i was just saying like there was one night that you guys offered that like oh we're gonna be open from like five to eight like you can get the sticker and then we can sell the merchandise i can't ask about that i'm not i'm just i don't know because there are people that like would like to get it um we were doing the city all open on mondays during the council meeting nights we weren't getting anybody coming in for business just okay but well although people may not have known about it though you know what i mean i don't know how long you did it but it's it's hard to get the word out and i think now that the sign is out there and if you can add stuff at will i think you'll get some better response sooner than you have maybe in the past just because it was so hard to get things out to people i mean they may not check the city's website but they definitely drive past the sign you know what i mean yeah so but yeah i was just no it's true and there's a lot of people that still work in bel air beach that like work during the day monday through friday and they they can't get in here so um i don't know how they get their beach sticker typically they just call and if i need if they got a new vehicle i'd just say send me a scanned copy of the vehicle registration and mail it yeah it's different though trying to buy a t-shirt or a tank top because you want to see the color you want to see the size yeah yeah so that's what she's talking about like people that feel like a merch night i mean well that was what i was saying like closer to like the new year when they have to get the sticker so be like oh from five to eight you can purchase your sticker plus like we will have all the merchandise the night of the council meeting i mean that's [Music] we did ask about that though like a while ago it got did it we asked you so much you guys before the yeah well now that people are like coming in and they know we have it maybe there'd be more interest i mean you guys would you do your merchandise table like you did what would you be doing yeah i would yeah i mean i could definitely do it and like we don't have a like shadow box outside do we what's the shadow block like the box with the keys like a picture yes thicker or you can hang things inside yeah and then you close it off yeah yeah do we have one outside uh no oh i was just curious to put samples oh yeah because there's nothing by the door and i know that she doesn't like when people ask about it so but here this is the display here's everything that we have to sell do we have an empty wall out there i was gonna actually ask if we could do a community bulletin board like for a shadow box like a community bulletin board like where people could put like their business card i mean it's a community center and like i think that's great you know it's you're not allowed to pass anything out or do anything but it would be great if like you know people are walking through here to even go to the bathroom and they can look up and go oh look there's you know the lady who makes the cups or you know like i said a chiropractor or a podiatrist or whatever that you just don't know because they don't live on your street you can uh put restrictions on their size you know what they can put up that's for residents residents only a community board just for information to just say hey and you guys can approve everything that goes in there um but it would just be nice if we had a community bulletin board in the community center or like you said a shadow box that's kind of like a silent sales person for the stuff that we're selling and then merchandise that's why i'm like it would alleviate i know the sign is there but people can't see like even you know yeah that's what i was like you could just get like one of those like i even i was like thinking about ordering another one like for the truck but before i use it i'll just bring it and then like we can like drape the towel over and pull like a little side and the towels are twenty dollars and then like pin the sticker on the board and like pin this like tank like with the load like with what it looks like and so then you know they'll just ask like oh do you have this size but like they're actually seeing what's there instead of it like being a mystery if they didn't come to an event they didn't see what's there let's go shopping for this list off our community oh well like for that yeah doesn't have to go in the back and get samples and bring them up [Music] it's just the board like the board will just literally lean up into that glass i love the idea we can do even like um a white clip if you want so it's not just the push pad it does [Music] and you'll see what a community board looks like and there's your idea go walkers babysitters real estate yeah that's everyone who lives in this community kind of i don't know what you're saying there's just got to be approved i guess yeah well how do how do we formally ask for it to be on the i like um how are you going to ask them kyle when timmy goes by and just talk to him directly who am i talking to lynn oh yeah yeah okay so that's fine an example so we're not trying to verbally explain what something is going to look like sure let me show you get an example of what she was looking at for her yeah yeah well the shadow box thing is whatever but i'm saying like like i'm picturing like it's a box that like it's like it has definitely a high school where you have like a trophy yes so that like but it's already like that thick so it doesn't stick out it's like a flatter yeah but it's protected and locked so no one can you know walk away if some random person walks in and says hey i really like that tank we got cameras so if somebody really goes that far it would be funny yeah it's i mean it's just the thought for the merchandise but like the community board i understand that we'll have to like get approved because of whatever but i'm just saying okay okay or i'll just buy the board and like come in here and put the display together and then they can be like yeah we like it or they could just nix it no no just we'll just ask okay i mean it's the same idea as what we did at the events it's just happened here it looks like that cabinet behind you but it's clear glass and thinner yeah oh but you guys put that roller thing down don't you that gate well see that's why the shadow box would be better yeah like maybe on the other side of this wall i don't know what's over there or on that wall we shot that even someone's looking at it doors closed we'll find it the christmas tree lighting is happening between five and six the lighting happens at like 5 30 or no the christmas the carolers start at five all i have to do is right so we're gonna have the carolers on the stairs starting right at five yeah and then you know like just as people walk up that you know we're gonna just start serving cookies and hot chocolate and coffee or whatever we have right away and then after george sings a solo and everyone's required to wear uh dickens attire christmas hat yeah what oh really i don't yeah so dress festival whether you have a santa hat and lights around or whatever like george evan wants to dress up it's fine george you don't have to just like this yeah we're going to get you the same hat [Laughter] they had i don't know what it's called parkinson's group or something where people let that parkinson's get together and talk about what exercises they do or what's available to them sure is that appropriate for your listing absolutely yeah what is it palms of largo offers um parkinson's awareness and therapies you can be doing now as far as the lighting do you want me to try and look into something that's a little more dramatic about the switch whether it's or i don't know how far they design we actually have this guy made out of wood like made like a cool looking throwing lights for the kids you can't i don't think you need to think about is what time is sunset because you know what's up we're not going to have the mayor the mayor can't believe how fast she was typing you type faster than i shake who are you envisioning like the uh like the mayor being like whoever's leading the event like just being like you know now we're gonna light the tree well who is leading the event well i didn't really think there was that much to lead it's more like a cocktail party with no cocktails like it's like a build-up to like when people were there you like the tree yeah um you know should we ask the mayor to just say like a little holiday message and then flip the switch or whatever okay how okay that's how it's done it's like sunset's at 5 37 but twilight end is at 601 which is that means it's dark you know yeah so it's near the end so 5 45 10 till 6 raised to the end 10 6 that's what that sun is like but it's still light out yeah yeah it's going to be like the countdown it's just tight with the 6 pm start time here that's all i would say so we'll we'll light the tree like 5 50. so can you please talk to the mayor and ask him if he will do that if he wants all right patty reach out okay sounds good so just that yeah a little holiday message and then flip the switch at 5 50. um but up until then it'll just be christmas carolers and like you know cookies and chat chit chat yeah because otherwise hot chocolate marshmallows and maybe coffee yeah coffee we have to check the inventory because did we get marshmallow you didn't get marshmallows yet no i was going to buy this yeah because so they're fresh yeah um so yeah so nicole is going to do the merchandise table uh nora you and i will do the refreshment table george you can do the community table are you good with that what is involved nothing you just stand i'm good at doing nothing no but you stand behind the community table and then like if people want to come up and put their business cards yes you have to be very organized over there yes it will be you know what you will have to do george you'll have to explain to people what the community table is because this is it's a build you know what i mean like people don't know what to bring or you know you just say you know if you have a business or whatever you can bring your business card or you can put your cards down and we're just trying to get some um you know local business local business interest so i need kyle to make a bucket or something so people can throw their cards in it no no it's not that like you like uh like you bring it like i would bring a stack of my business cards and put them on the community table so if someone's looking for an organic esthetician they could come up and take one of my cards do you know what i'm saying or like if they're looking for a real estate agent they can come out and take one of nora's cards or if they're looking for um like trouble they call her truffle they're looking for then they get nicole's card yes exactly so yeah you don't need a bucket it's just like explain to people what it is so it builds we've had it at every event so far and like last time people you know like anthony came out hey can i put my cards on this and we didn't even really use it for that last time but like it worked out good you know so it's like someone may have taken this card so yeah you can sit behind the community table like we obviously have the signs we have the tablecloths like we you know we've got our little arsenal built so like we didn't you know we're going to do anything for this except for go buy some christmas cookies where is it going to be and some marshmallows well the carolers are going to it's going to be out by the tree yeah i know where's the table outside can you be a little more specific no because right there yeah right on the channel the other two and we ended up moving the tables four times yeah so we'll set up the tables and then when we go out there we'll be like okay here's what i'm just trying to decide whether i should try to bring down it or not or just do it yeah right donna and we'll put the table wherever it's easiest for you okay yeah we're putting the merchandise outside i thought so we had it outside for jazz and it was fun yeah well we were just saying because they're having the meeting and then i don't know i thought it was inside i don't know what no i thought all of this is outside because the carolers are outside the trees outside but like the building will be open and obviously it's decorated so nice for the holidays already like can we leave the front doors open so people kind of feel like it's an open thing or no because of ac or either um that's probably fine to have the doors open i don't know well then you can set up the merchandise table right inside the lobby so you're not going to bugs will fill the lobby i don't know we had it open for the uh at the end of the jazz and after your bugs the bugs are like nowhere near as bad as they were at jazz it's december yeah yeah it's so nice because then that way like she can set up the merchandise table right inside the front door and she can see because she's going to be dealing with money oh yeah you wanted to be in a safer area too a little bit yeah yeah that was like i was like oh i don't know if there's lights outside well should we do the like merchandise on one side and the refreshments on the other and then george in here too should we put the tables inside her and then just have it open and then the caroler's right on the stairs i don't see an issue like that and then people can come in and get their stuff bring it down once the meeting starts just close the doors and we can break it all down it's probably it may even be better a lot better lit you know it's not getting dark out there you know you're just indoors the tree's out there so people can be in and out but kind of makes sense okay for what to be indoors the tables like the merchandise but right inside the door so it's like see if the christmas carolers are on the stairs i mean literally it's from the carolers to kyle where the tables are it's just in versus out so then that way it's you know you can yeah i think and it'll be good because they'll be like that and people come in or out like yeah because the carols will be out so there will be a reason for them to come in get their hot chocolate and their cookie buy their beach doors hot chocolate cookies outside inside well what we just said was like um say like the on one side of say the doors are here on one side will be the merchandise table and then on the other side will be um the trees out front right yeah it'll be right out there but the door will be open the doors will be open so you can we're just gonna these doors would be open the christmas carolers would be right there on the stairs and then the other table would be over here okay and then some trees like that it's going to be okay with the kneading happening and shuffling and they're like happening they always go down there those doors okay yeah i think it'll work the tree's going to be centered on that right next to the green connecting sidewalk between the outside sidewalk on the inside yeah so it'll all just be one shot from here to that green box i thought we were outside you know i did too but when he brought that up and then i thought her and money and light and um you want the drinks inside though not out well this is the thing they come in they get their drink they go right back outside but the caroler's on the train all they do is come in and get it and go back out oh because they're passing through here anyway no one's walking around the building yeah okay go to the bathroom so they can literally walk from right here [Music] okay does everybody go with that absolutely okay as long as i saw the characters yeah so if the doors are open you'll have a view and you'll also like people can just walk back out right on that little deck and again we might move the carolers down by the christmas tree and then light the tree yeah because they're going to have when you call them make sure they have like a microphone sure they have like a microphone and to make sure they're loud enough where we can hear them i think they're i'm guessing that they're just they sing loudly and they're used to it okay yeah i don't know trying to think anytime i've seen carol is it like a microphone or you know they're just caroling without an actual pa system okay i'll ask them i'll just i'm curious but i just assumed they were just you know voices that carried yeah okay because we don't know how many people were to get if like people are going to see it i want to get the pa though for if you know the mayor is doing whatever yeah so we're going to order one so that we have it available okay okay that'll be helpful and then like say we do end up having like just the normal crowd from the meeting say we end up having 50 or 60 people then you know they can scatter between the lobby just in here and still hear the care alerts or they can go outside and like go on this little deck or like kind of go down the stairs and spread that way um which is kind of another reason we probably want to keep the carolers off the stairs if people like want to get in and out yeah it's cute i think they should just probably be out by the tree yeah yeah how how long are they going to be one hour because the meeting starts at six so it's just like a one and then we're gonna light the tree at ten till six and then the meeting will start okay um so four o'clock on december six we'll come and set up actually we could probably yeah four o'clock because we need to make the hot chocolate and all that stuff yeah if all we had to do was set up the tables it wouldn't take that long but like we need to i'll be here or mix we need to make it okay all right does any any questions on the okay perfect uh so other business i know we kind of talked about the little fly me to the moon or whatever it would be like an event for like april or may does it right yeah spring event did anybody have any other thoughts on that or just want to kind of table that for now did you find out about the piano people yeah they're going to be really expensive for dueling if you want to on one from your church or your neighbor from who's in a band right yeah anyway they the name of the group is north two with the two south and they do what he called classical rock and roll how fun from the 70s and 80s so i don't know you know that's just another option sure there's a bar down here that i think they played on saturday nights or something like that if he's just my financial advisor that's definitely here that's what i want gotcha and i asked him about it and he said if you go to the website and you can get the information i don't know i i'm not pushing it one way or the other flying me to the moon sounds great too so whatever you guys want to do okay does anybody have a preference if like we do april or may like we said spring because like i know we were gonna push the jazz back maybe like a month because it was so hot and whatever so that's why i thought maybe may instead of april just because then we're pushing everything back yeah i don't have a feel for it one way or the other okay all right we can table it for now but we'll just kind of leave it i mean sometimes it's really beautiful in april and sometimes it's just too cold yeah that's true are you a problem yeah a little cold for me i don't know you guys would come with me yeah we can just kind of see how it goes um and then um beach cleanup we obviously know it's the first saturday the month from eight to nine um the it's not so much a legal release it's more like a sign up sheet um i haven't even seen it i guess i'll see it before the next one um but like lynn said we're going to kind of keep a rolling tally okay so the very first beach cleanup that we had was june of this past of june of 2021 so in june of 2022 we would take that sign up sheet and plus all the volunteers that we've had i know exactly who they are i might miss one or two people that came once because i wouldn't know how to find them again um but we would have like a thank you party for lack of a better word um for their volunteering for the year and that was from lynn lindsay yeah we're gonna do this sign up sheet and we're gonna have a thank you party for all the people that have helped through the year with all these different things um so that's just something else we could think about like where it is and what it is and all that good stuff uh uh we sent the previous names before we started these lists to patty or something just no but i killed them fresh yeah well i was just gonna collect them as we go so like say i know that okay so you started the list yeah well like with that sign up sheet and then so like as they come again you know like some of them are going to be on the list month after month others you know but they've only if they volunteered once they're going to be invited but like does the list have like their address or their phone number yeah we'll have to get out as email email yeah just a way to contact them so we can send it in what about all the previous ones before we started those yeah so like some of them are going to show up again and some of them i'm just going to write them in and then try to find their info and um he didn't really say what kind of thank you party it would be i don't know if he's kind of leaving the creative details up to us and i'm sure he'll give us a budget yeah and i'm sure it's here when did he say that i was taking place he didn't i just thought the one year anniversary is june of 2022 so i thought that would be a good okay if it's a once a year thank you um and then we would also include not only the people that help with beach cleanup but the people that help at the event and a lot of times there's crossover but some of them don't because they can't be there on saturday morning or whatever but they've helped with both events like my friend laura so yeah old man used to do a big one and each department submitted the volunteers that they had for you know so many different things and then what'd you do like a pizza party or did you have it at a restaurant or did you have it at city hall i think it did tampa bay downs if i don't remember correctly they're all that was something they did they did a dinner yeah people so many businesses they cater tonight yeah no i mean parks and rec people and the city council i hope so whatever i don't know if they plan on doing that i don't know if you go maybe as a lab or as a dinner but something like that no i'm just saying it might influence no i don't mean i'm sorry i didn't hear what you said george oh we were i was talking about they used to have one for this committee a party or i don't know it was a dinner party they catered something and put up tables out here and we came around like every time of the year it was yeah it was pretty good for a while but they they haven't done recently since i've been here they did something like that they haven't done the code yeah but they had the there's like a you know the boards the council right and whoever else the deputies you know whatever working committees they were here it was like in there and i was just catered yeah so i'm imagining something like that okay yep sounds good um so we'll keep collecting names and then does anybody have anything else they want to talk about or any additions to anything we've discussed i have a question if i find some things on here should i call them first ask if they're interested and then email patty hey i got xyz to you know say that they're interested do it that way okay yeah all right see what my fear is with that is like say you call a chiropractor but then i've called a chiropractor yeah so should i do something else well i that's why um if i was thinking if you say if you email patty and say i am going to call the chiropractor the podiatrist and the whatever the thing is is we don't even have the date though so say i get somebody to commit and then they can't commit on the date that we actually pick then it might not be bad that you've had to be really bad if we had two committing to the same day right yeah so i don't [Music] i'm going to call her every day maybe twice a day this is stalker what is portland gonna do they have a whole kind of well they have a person that's dedicated to it yeah so they're gonna do what they do i don't know what that is and then we can knock people off the list based on what they're already gonna cover but like you know i'm sure they get requests for this stuff and i i wanted to see what they had availability for and like february wouldn't be bad it would be like uh you know we could do [Music] not heart healthy but you know i mean like we could tie it into you know something any month that we do it doesn't have to be january for new year's resolutions but um yeah like i said i wanted to either get we're all hungry in january for those well that's why people may not be available no i don't know as i was saying it's not a bad thing not to be not something it's gonna matter here yeah it's the first one yeah and no one's expecting it and so um we just need an anchor we need a big guy and then like say we don't get sa morton plant never calls me back but we get cbs or walgreens then we're just going to still go with whatever date they give us and then try to backfill check like bake air or whatever so when are we pulling the trigger on one plan or not friday we're going to bother for a week yeah because i started last tuesday and then i did get a call back the very next day but then the lady that i'm supposed to talk to i've called twice and she hasn't called me back so we'll see how that goes um but yeah you know it's like just i guess if we all call like if all five of us called a chiropractor you know i mean it's and just to check interest like we still our pen our date is still in pencil we're we're hoping for towards the end of january would you be interested if we could get this nailed down and then at least you have some interest and then we could do the final and only call back the one you know that we want does that work and then it doesn't matter if we duplicate call okay is that cool yep okay yeah and then just everything goes through patty and then i'll talk to her so she knows what to expect and then kyle's gonna work on a more organized like excel spreadsheet for us so as we're putting it together we can just plug people in and um fill it in that way and then so we don't have any data let me um send me the final categories that you enjoy yeah okay yeah perfect um oh is there a way you can kind of like a like a firm commitment from these people because it would suck if somebody if they're like oh yeah yeah and then they don't show i mean how do we kind of ensure that okay we chose this even though we had maybe multiple but we we chose to just be well we would say that they have to tell us by january 5th because we need to put the program together yeah for you to be on the program and for you to be involved you need to get off a firm commitment by this day so we can get the printing done and that's so it's like it's november you know i'm thinking we don't have any time really but it's you know the middle of november so we do have time i kind of feel like february should be a little bit seriously because holidays are coming up not a lot of time and we can get it all organized by see i think we can't because it's only the middle of november and i think that we could get it organized by the end of january if we get a big guy like so say for example like if morton plant or cbs like if they have availability in january i would like it to be in january if we could get it but if they're like no we're not available till march then maybe we take a vote and if we really want morton plant because i think that would be a draw and people would know that this is like a not a serious health fair but yeah i mean like you've got a big guy here and um and then we would vote to have it like in march instead of january based on that but if we could get if they have availability in january and we could get 24 other commitments then i i don't think it's this isn't a lot of work we have to set up tables and and put a a program together they're basically doing all the setup and everyone that i've talked to has done them before like these they're not like this isn't like brain surgery for them they know exactly what to do i said saturday 10-4 they're like oh my god absolutely we know you know they've already got their brochures printed up they're not trying to reinvent anything they're just pushing what they have okay so like i don't think january's too early and like i said if we give a firm date of say january is january 5th of monday i actually looked that up because i knew we would need that like a firm commitment by january wednesday oh um yeah it's a wednesday so maybe it was january third that i put down but if we were gonna have it on the 22nd is january 10th long enough or should we do it on the third because they'll know what just to put some printing materials together no for well for them to say we will 100 be there on january 22nd do we need to know by the third or the tenth tenth is probably okay as long as most people the only reason i would be like yeah i'd be a little nervous because like say what if we have 10 people that call us on the 10th and say i can't do it then we're scrambling to find replacements and to get the printing done so if we ask them in november well be able to tell us by january 3rd if they can do that yeah now that was my only thought if we wait till the 10th and we don't have enough time to yeah or yeah if all of a sudden hopefully most people that are interested can commit you know i mean you can kind of feel alone but yeah you got like 10 things you're looking for last minute that would be rough okay so should i do the 5th and it doesn't have to be on monday or the 7th because of friday so we're looking at the 22nd i think we should do the 5th because then we could call people the fifth six seven yeah yeah i mean really we're doing everything in house so it's not into the world flipping things around i mean i'll be doing it and printing it off but it's still nice to have a little cushion just to find if you can find alternates that would be the big thing the printing wouldn't be the problem it would be trying to find a replacement on short notice that's available on saturday for four hours yeah yeah so okay cool anything else no okay so our next meeting will be december 6th at 4 o'clock to just set everything up for the holiday social it's oh quickly we got the cocoa we just need to get marshmallows are we gonna do coffee cookies um we never talked about coffee so i don't know because then we need another urn right i don't know we just have a coffee pot and i have like a or you could make i think a pot or two pots to you know just like one of those and i think it's actually a dispenser too do you have a coffee pot here i mean yeah we can make the maxwell house coffee is not the best can we get starbucks i mean it's your budget you could get i mean they make those little portable you never see you know they're friends like when you're in meetings and stuff oh oh no no i just meant starbucks coffee or like oh like ourselves yeah yeah i mean yeah yeah and i could bring my coffee maker and then we could put it in my dispenser and then just have two full pots maybe a decaf and a regular and then have a dispenser and then we could just just keep it going because maybe people don't like hot chocolate oh yeah some people probably don't want the sugar yeah so we would have coffee hot chocolate water and then whatever holiday cookies or whatever look really good like i was so happy you guys should have seen these donuts these halloween donuts they were mummies and pumpkins they were they looked too cute to eat they were so cute um so i'm hoping they do something similar for christmas i'm sure they will see like puppets cookies yeah probably publix whatever cookies or marshmallows marshmallows we can use whatever coffee supplies we have in-house as far as i mean i don't know how many cups of coffee you're going to go but we already have our sugar and sugar packets and uh we have to go buy like if we're going to actually get some kind of cream can we just do that at like publix yeah we can do that just what you want you just let us know okay our green wise organic half and half would be great we want at least like starbucks coffee all the flavors you can imagine yeah we'll figure it out um but that's not gonna it's not gonna make or break anything because it's not that i mean it might be an extra 30 bucks yeah to do the coffee because we don't have to buy any equipment we just i'll bring stuff we already have the cups and the napkins we're not decor i mean you guys have already decorated so we don't have to do any of that sure okay yeah anything else you guys can think of [Music] okay what or they have to take a little break for an hour if they take a break we're not paying them yeah so they don't break go yeah yeah all right i mean i would double check but i don't why would they need a break for a one hour gig like when they were playing for three hours i could see them needing to make but one hour they should sing straight they should be ready yeah like singing get them out of the car they yeah they need to be singing out of the car at five o'clock they need to start seeing it at five o'clock no set up they need to be ready to start okay are they expensive these kind of like 300 bucks yeah i mean forgetting their time nora you better be here early to hear them and clap them up per hour they're more expensive than the jazz fest people were they lost costumes huh they do have they do have the dickens costumes that they wear so excited to be the first one here like where are they it's gonna be great it's kind of cute i don't think i've ever seen legit carolers in my life when she said dickens she didn't know who that was like what yeah i lived under a raft but that'll be cool i'm excited to see you know what i know it was a week came or whatever the other thing was all the 11 one 11 ask your wife yeah your wife knows that she just hasn't asked for it yet um okay okay do you have a motion to adjourn the meeting do i have a second to adjourn the meeting second okay the meeting is adjourned"
