comments do we have any citizens that would like to make comments today at our meeting so no comments agenda item number three um okay so um agenda item number four is just a quick recap from august beach cleanup we had 24 people i believe it was really successful um the donuts were awesome they were flowers and fishies and i have a picture you can look on the city newsletter if you'd like for the picture of the donuts yeah yeah they're awesome yeah they're always good and we had a couple of new people which is always nice and it was the first beach cleanup that we sold bellar beach items so i took six hand towels sold all of them i want to say i took four or five shirts i sold two shirts and i sold three out of i sold i brought three hats and sold three hats so yeah so it was pretty good for just kind of like a sitting behind me on a box saying hey if anybody wants these and you can't make it to city hall when they're open we're going to have these for you moving forward so it was good so um the more the merrier as always but yeah 24 is a good number and um we found a ton of garbage which obviously is our sole purpose for being there um they found all i mean huge items they look that were taking two or three of them to drag them back up to the garbage like like one of those big tents that they're complaining about like somebody left like it blew apart in the wind and it was in pieces and it was all bent and mangled and yeah they had to dry and they were twisted concrete blocks and like so that probably fell off a boat but yeah there was a bunch of yeah a lot of stuff a lot of odd stuff that's unusual yeah i actually haven't seen one of the big like ginormous tent frames that someone just kind of broke and they left it we usually we got those you guys find them yeah yeah they're pain sometimes because they don't collapse you kind of have to break them up yeah they're not fun it's a rug right after fourth of july like a living room rug area rug probably like a it was at least a six by eight size when i went out after fourth of july and just picked up fireworks stuff on my own but i'm like oh bro and it was covered with sand and i'm just looking you're like what is that so i had to go over there and kick it and it was a problem thank god there wasn't anything rolled up there yeah [Music] so anyway it went well so hopefully they'll keep on rolling [Music] the next one is saturday what is that the saturday the third so yep oh i just got a text from caroline she's on her way anyway okay so item number five um so you know as you all know the beller beach community foundation has been meeting monthly or twice a month we're in the process of filing all the paperwork for the 501c3 approval and so one of the things that we're considering doing is you've all seen the where you sell the bricks and it'll say tammy and tim lavenda and then maybe 2017 or you know the year we moved here whatever you want to put on it it's kind of your choice you get to fill in the lines so we're going to be selling those like as a fundraiser so what the park and rec board has been asked to do is discuss options for locations for the brick walkway to go so just kind of obviously like we need to vote on it and then kyle will present it to city council and then they have to vote on it so a couple of the different options that we were looking at at first i think we kind of talked about like kind of like a more not a walkway but a wall or like a planter but those are kind of difficult and as you're only part way through it it looks weird and then when you look online all of the examples are walkways so um i don't know kyle if you want to kind of usually and what you see is there's bricks like the walkway or at least a portion of it is done and then you swap out the bricks as they're donated um so that you're not building from scratch and having a partial project and then yeah with like a planter or a wall it's like you can't pull bricks out quite as easily because they're mortared together so exactly so um a couple things that we talked about was like obviously we want visibility so if people are getting bricks they would like to see them they would like to you know for people to see that they are donating and participating in community programs so um if we could initially we talked about maybe like the marina or something like that but if you don't have your boat there you really don't have a purpose to go there so we we want to try to do it somewhere around city hall or craftsman park so it's close if like you're walking or if you're here and two of the options that we talked about is maybe like earlier the park and record when we did our surveys of all the different parks and whatnot um i think nora did this park and the bridge going over to the little beach it doesn't really serve a purpose and as it gets more run down and like dangerous you know we've talked about just taking it down and leaving it so we talked about like maybe a walkway going over there but kyle's like it'll get covered in sand and blah blah and something about a sea wall so that wasn't a good option yeah because we get the with the tie levels coming up and eroding that's the purpose of the seawall we're proposing um it would the way the water comes up here would just be it would be covered yeah yeah so after talking about multiple options the one that kind of seemed to work out the best that i wanted to throw out and we can talk about other things is you know how like we have i've heard it called a starburst or a helicopter pad or it's basically the big circle concrete pad that we you know is we've had some of our functions on in the past so as opposed to doing a walkway because we really don't it's not like there's an open space for a sidewalk or it's not like we have a brick road already in place that we can just take out the bricks and exchange them so we kind of talked about a like two brick like two bricks wide like border around like the sidewalk and the circle um and then that way if someone wanted to buy a double-sized brick we could do two bricks side by side and then a double two bricks side by side and then like they could be in our match because they're exactly double the measurements so it wouldn't be off it would all be in alignment and it would be very easy for the city staff to you know to just do the two brick wide thing and just keep building on it but we're open to any options i know most of us have surveyed almost all of the parks in velar beach or been to all of the parks in beller beach but really i think if we could find a location here at city hall i think people would be happiest with it being somewhere they could see it like when they come here for events or they just come here to pick up their parking sticker like they know where it is um do we know how many bricks would fit in that space well i mean it's a lot it's a lot and so um especially if we started at the sidewalk like right back there like right where like you're you have that circle like for the driveway like the around and the sidewalk starts right there so if we it could start right there or it could start up around the circle and then we could go back down the sidewalk um i mean i don't know the dimensions on that so it would be one of those things like that location i could lay out possible arrangements and things like that because i would have some kind of visual for city council to get an idea i think it would be a great idea to know how many approximately would fit in there like you know 300 if they're just 500 plus easily okay 500 plus well what do you think about only one brick deep then and just sell single size bricks because i mean 500 is like half of the people that live here and i don't know if like if you would if you were to go that you don't think that big understand that it's pretty much open infinite for what our population is right i think the demand okay but some people you're right are going to want two wrecks right or a double sized bird double size correct yeah and we don't necessarily want to take that option away if they want it which is why like to do the two brick deep would kind of be ideal because then would all be in perfect alignment no matter what size they picked they would all be the same color which um would also be you know council's decision to go but that the just the circle of starbursts or whatever is just concrete it's not like it's a you know a certain color so it would be whatever accent color they wanted to add it seems to me that if you go that route we never get enough bricks to encircle that head i don't know what do you think i mean if it's i can figure out how many bricks it would take it's gonna take 500 bricks i don't know maybe not i mean you could kind of play around with design options i mean i was more focused on like is that like a good location of maybe it sounds like where it should go i mean i'll play with like some options for just the way we lay them out because we're gonna have that problem anywhere george because we don't know how many we're gonna sell so like even if we put like a location that holds a hundred bricks but we only sell 20 i'm just throwing it out there then it's not going to be finished so it would more be like something where we like maybe started at the top and worked our way around and then if we sold enough bricks we would take them down the sidewalks so like started kind of at the top where it kind of looked just like a little you know sometimes on a patio it'll have a little kick out where you can put a grill or so it obviously wouldn't be that big it's only two bricks deep but where it wouldn't stand out like a sore thumb if it didn't get you know if we only sold like you know we can go both directions so it's even like as it builds and we sell it the program yeah i'm just concerned that the project that was never complete because we have so many bricks that we need and yeah we can kind of segment it with a reasonable amount of bricks and um build it i have a plan to build it out if we do get a lot more maybe um if we encourage people that want to buy bricks buy multiple numbers of bricks rather than just one brick well the bricks are 100 a piece and they're 200 for a double so i don't think people are going to be buying like six bricks they're not like 20 they're not five for a hundred i mean that way i could see it but like the other thing is i don't know like if if the whole border thing if they like the concept then maybe if we don't sell enough to finish it we just finish it off in plain bricks and then trade them out i don't know that's what i'm saying you can you can have you can finish just to have something completed or at least a second and then you're footballing we need to do more and then you do more i guess this would be the most popular part to do this although people might be interested in you know like other than 20th street how many people antonio's been interested in doing it at the park at 20th 20th street if we did it by street then we would definitely have half finished projects everywhere and we can offer other things like we talked about benches and trees ultimately you know we can offer other things you know so for people who want something in there i can and it's not that far but there are some um like memorials yeah right hibiscus has a couple so we could potentially do this two times [Music] have you guys seen them since we read them we did the podcast yeah i have the one there's one donatello i remember his name because i work with a guy named though which one is this that's it yeah it looks good i mean it looks okay it looks now it looks good cause we tried moisture over time and then what we decided on doing is give it a coating and then sand it so that the letters shines through on the on the black color i live right between the 20 and the 25th and the one says gone fishing that's the one in 20th and then the donatello one i think is at 25. they look good okay but i think there's options to sell other things that people want one close to close to where they live i like the idea of this being like a legacy too how long are these supposed to last the bricks like are they well they're not stamped they're late they're lasered so the ones with the program that we looked at are supposed to laugh they're supposed to be long-lasting that's what i mean it's a nice legacy right so we're thinking in terms of how many people are going to buy now but over 100 years you know what's up we'll have enough room for those new residents all right and i think as long as the aesthetics we can design like something that looks good partially done yeah balance it all yeah if we can looks great have a nice yeah i think it's a good idea donatos red bricks i meant the print pictures donatello's versace yeah knew what you were talking about very nice yeah i thought that came out yeah it looks really good it looks really good did you do the one in front of where's the one that's close but there was one here that was the greenish color it's right out front i thought i'm sorry right there yeah it looks really nice i think the idea is great okay does anybody have any other thoughts of where we could put this side or like if it's a sidewalk as opposed to a border because then it would be like five or six bricks wide and it would take a lot longer to make it look like there's any sort of progress as opposed to just two bricks wide which you know i would think we could fill up a section pretty quick what is where's the do we have we have a flag here right in city hall what's what's around the flag is there anything around the flag because that's like i just think about because that's what we did at like the college like when they had people donate a brick it was like there was like the flag poles and then there was like that designated area i was just saying so they didn't think that's what we should do but so it's like mounted in the concrete yeah and that's where they put all like the bricks before but but did they build it up and do do like you know like you you know yeah i know what you're saying like a circle or a box shoe i'm not sure i know there was some on the ground but i don't know if they had so many that they started small school so but that's another option if someone wants to be buy american play but i think if we did the names going up the path i don't know how many people like for the events look at like the space out there before they book you know what i'm saying but i think it's great i like the idea yeah that is a good idea though especially like it's say if it takes 500 bricks to do the back but it would only take 100 bricks to do the surround because then we could gauge interest level and if the interest level was exploding then we moved to the bigger project which i you know i don't know that's what we have to decide and then can you talk about weddings i think about how like the bride and groom are kind of at the end there in front of the water you almost could have like a separate standing area yeah that opens up like a whole new group of buyers too maybe people who you know who are in permanent residence but get married here would want to break yeah commemorate their their wedding right that's gonna be that part of our pitch [Music] i would like that okay we have any bricks we need to buy at a time say 25 no we don't we um to get free shipping we have to buy 15 burks at a time but if we buy one brick at a time it doesn't matter if we buy one brick or a thousand bricks they cost 19.95 but if we choose to ship two at a time because we don't you know say we have two that we sold we don't sell any for three months if we want those shipped because we don't want you know we want them put down where they need to go well i think it's like four dollar shipping so you know if it's not that much it's not like even though they're heavy it's not that much to ship them where did they come from um pittsburgh and it's the same company that does the united states air force um he does tampa bay um humane society i want to say animal shelter humane society he gave lots of local examples but he does places all over the country and they're also the number one in the country for like pet memorials you know how like if you're yeah so they're they're used to shipping everywhere and um they will create a website for us they will create an order form for us they have like say if you want to get a seashell on yours or a starfish they have different like clip art that you can add to yours or they can put our logo they can put the beller beach logo on it so there's all kinds of things that like are on the order form that you can like up charge or whatever people wanted to make theirs stand out a little bit more but it seems like a very they've been around forever i think 1975 or something so it's a very established company and you know this is all they do it's family owned so and they're sending samples to us they're sending a color chart to us they're sending samples with our logo stamped or not stamped our logo on it with you know he's sending the clip art he's going to send everything so we have eyes on before one brick is ordered so we'll have all of that to show city council as well so they know that like a quality product is going you know around the helicopter pad or the starburst or whatever you want to call it the pad so do you think we should give city council options like maybe around the flagpole and around sure and then maybe they can pick i mean i'm fine with that i mean i'm kind of like up for whatever they think is the best as far as like visual to make it look nice where it might be needed i'm not opposed to anywhere where they might want to put it i just thought it would be great if we could give them some really solid options so in their mind they can kind of see what it looks like and if kyle can do like a little diagram and i'll send you the information from the brick company so you can see because they do have some examples but i didn't see anything with the border they were all more like walls and pathways but they were in much larger cities so they had the opportunity to sell many many many more bricks than we do so do we need to make a motion on these two areas um or are we i mean i can put together what we're talking about some more design and some designs okay um i can bring them back okay that's okay yeah and then you guys can give your input and approve what what you think and then we'll take it to a council meeting that's perfect is everybody okay with that okay so we'll just vote on it after we get some visuals is this going to be an ongoing fundraiser kind of thing and when is it supposedly going to start well if we're lucky we'll get our 501c3 status around november so we're hoping to start selling them or have the ability to sell them at the chili cook-off um november 19th is our hopes so hopefully if everything if the stars line up everything will be ready to go by that we could do something right back to september meeting and then the october meeting exactly yeah okay every does anybody have anything else to add to that or any other questions or comments okay okay so um item number six so if you go in your packet i had patty put in why don't i see it oh so it looks like this it's the beller beach health and wellness fair a little spreadsheet with the yellow okay so if you look down the list everybody in yellow has been contacted so one thing that we learned last year is the um park and rec board will have two tables one at each end because we were kind of down at this end so people snuck in down at that end they weren't picking up a map they didn't see anything on our table they weren't seeing anything that we had to offer so we literally just had someone stand down there handing stuff out but they missed everything that we had down at this end so we will do um hopefully bell our coffee they're pending but bell or coffee will do the table out in the lobby again and then the foundation will have a table in the lobby and then park and rec board will have a welcome table at this end and a welcome table at that end so we catch everybody that's coming in the door because that was one of the things that we learned last year right that we were missing people because they were coming in the other end so those are just the tables in the lobby and then like i said everybody in yellow has been contacted the ones in green are pending um paddy by chance did you contact wellness way no i did not okay do you have the paperwork i have the thing that you sent that letter yeah and i sent it to my daughter and son-in-law but not to wellness okay let me remember that okay what's his name ryan yeah lloyd deals with him more than i do okay so if you could please just present that to them we do have um clearwater spine wants to be involved but they're not holistic they're not going to do chiropractor screenings they do a whole other onslaught of services so it just it doesn't even sound like the same kind of like you know the the chiropractor um office that we had last year like they did photos of your posture and they did that kind of thing which is kind of what i'm thinking yours is more geared to do ride does maybe they did it on site um it's just if they have the equipment but if they just want to stand there and like pass out pamphlets and information or whatever else they may have to give out they don't have to do any actual screening i would say about half the providers in the room did actual screenings would you have a question oh you look like you're going to say something um so then it's just contact information phone numbers and then um if you look over to the far right it's got the responses so right now we have 10 yeses i only have one no and then um everybody else is pending so um who knows oh sorry i forgot tara said no too yes tara said no but um she has been replaced which it got replaced today so this is why it's not on here with um the magic dance studio which is kind of fun and they're gonna do little dance um like whatever so it's good so i'll add that to the next one and if i can get another um you know i don't know like tara does yoga classes here on site so i i'm kind of thinking about leaning away from getting another yoga instructor um just because like if we can replace you know an you know like a form of exercise like yoga with dance then i think that's good to have that covered um but anyway does anybody have anybody else that they think that like maybe like that you know well um the one person i haven't heard back from is mole patrol which is the reason why we started so early this year because when we started in november october and november last year they were already by the time we even heard of them they were already booked for the date so that's why i started so early but i haven't you know he gave me the email to submit the request and i've had no response so i'm just gonna start calling um but a lot of the good ones that we had last year like you know they're definitely interested and want to come back and i'm just gonna you know as we get a little bit closer i'll just keep following up with the bigger ones like bake hair and palms of largo and living young center med spa etc so um since the dental guy hasn't said no so my daughter maybe could do it the holistic dentistry sure okay so can i put her she number 25. well the tables will change did you did you make more copies of the the health and wellness letter you said you got them yeah oh you don't have to get them now yeah um so this is your daughter's a dentist and she's in the area she's actually on mlk in saint pete but they have patients that come from orlando and um north florida and missouri okay okay holistic yes okay yeah and we still we didn't get um i have a suggestion for an optometrist um we don't have is it an audiologist what do you call a hearing aid yeah we don't we we didn't have one of those last year so there's lots of options for like different types of things that we didn't have last year that we could possibly do for this january i just like the ones that did a really good job last year that like you know they really brought it on they did a good job with their display they were very interactive with the um the residents they brought good information to give away they brought little cha keys to give away i really like if they wanted i'd kind of like to give them first option to say no so but yeah absolutely so if you can let me know so yeah he is his daughter's 16th birthday so and i totally understand that so does anybody hear them the mole patrol is like um they check your skin dermatologist yeah so they look for um sun damage like skin cancer yeah yeah awesome and they're they're uh um kind of like the blood mobile so they won't have a table you'll actually go out and make an appointment in the parking lot kind of like if you were giving blood okay and the flood mobile is here that day too right they are yes so they are they're going to be in the parking lot and they are going to have a table in the room they are not going to be sharing a table in the lobby did you see who said yes the people with the peanut butter thing just letting you know the peanut butter balls yeah y'all ate all their food do not take a whole gummy and this is a healthy it's a healthy smell yeah they're like super they're protein they're protein balls clean eats no it was from uh it was from a trainer it was from a dietitian and a trainer right yeah yeah yeah york yeah yeah this sounds great i missed the one last year i'm sorry i did so looking forward to this one yeah we'll show you pictures it was really like the whole room was really good and um so and we had a really bad weather day it was freezing and windy and rainy there was zero foot traffic on the bridge i mean it was just like nobody like everyone's like oh my god it was so cold that day i stayed home i forgot about it i was like i don't blame you i would have stayed home too if you didn't have to be here but does anybody have any questions on this also what do we need to give to the documentation yeah she has it yeah and what i did this year was all of the questions that were asked over and over and over like and i kind of gave you know some of them verbal last year i included all those bullet points on the letter this year so there wasn't you know they actually had it you know in black and white on a piece of paper because like sometimes you know you can say something a couple times but everybody's busy and two or three months go by and you forget so there there's a lot of logistics involved in who needs electricity who needs to be by a wall who needs that because some of them had ginormous displays up behind them some of them like the stretch therapists and the massage therapist they have their tables out so like they were busy they could have stayed here all day and had someone on their table like they never had a mo he goes you had coffee in the lobby like yes so last year we didn't charge anybody anything this year every vendor is going to be charged 25 but all of that is going to pay for is we're going to like have bags i think we talked about it we're going to have beller beach stickers that we stick on the bag so as people are walking around the room and they're getting all this stuff they don't have anywhere to put it i saw people laying stuff down everywhere and like forgetting it or whatever so we're gonna have bags that we give away at the two welcome tables um they're not gonna be like a twelve dollar reusable bag it's gonna be like just something you know just you can keep it if you want but it you know it's the sticker's gonna make it look cute for the day that's about it um and then the rest of is last year we had in the kitchen you know we had water and yogurt and snacks for the vendors but i paid for all that so like this year it's going to come out of like the 25 bucks the only people that i um we excluded from that fee is bellar coffee because they literally they set up the table in the lobby they leave us tons of coffee and they leave and it's a serve yourself they're not you know what i mean they're not working the table they're just doing a courtesy for us and so we're not going to be charging them and then it's the fee a lot of people didn't know it was out there i know i had too much coffee i was like i know i was running around like crazy and then george is like where's tammy's like oh she's on the massage table and it was cold you said right it was freezing yeah yeah and if it's hot it you know i don't know if it's gonna be hot in january but we can always just put a bucket of ice out there and people can make iced coffees to the left bellar bluffs yeah the plaza wine shop okay right next to the one shop actually [Music] the side we did all of that constant contact i announced it every meeting we made signs and put them around the city as many as they'll let us put and we put it on the city newsletter we we used every single option available to us that didn't cost us twelve hundred dollars yeah what is the charge for that little newspaper we get every wednesday the b whatever it's called do they charge a lot for their advertising they didn't want us to put it in there because they don't want any of our events in any of those papers because they go to everyone along the beach and we don't have you know city council pretty much said we don't have the parking we don't have the too many people show up okay we don't have the cape like if somebody from anywhere walks in off the bridge because they're walking the bridge we would never turn anyone away but it this is what i equate it to so when we started working with keith pinellas beautiful for the beach cleanup they advertised one time in something like that it was a zoo there was not an empty parking place people were pulling in and pulling out like it was a mad house and we couldn't accommodate it so well that is a good idea in theory we can't do it because we don't have and especially because like what do we have 75 parking places but the blood mobile and if we get the mole patrol they take up a huge chunk and we have to leave the handicapped parking places open obviously and so we just vendors and the vendors have to park in the back so we just can't accommodate posting anything in a in a publication that reaches that many people we did we posted on we did best of bellar beach on facebook and we did we do next door neighbor app yeah yeah so i guess that's is about as general as we get and we didn't get a mad rush but again the weather was so bad even that neighborhood because anybody can can access that right you don't have to be able to reach to see yes so that's the most public thing that we did um and last year it didn't affect it but like i said last year i mean even the vendors in there that some of them that's what they do every weekend that's what they're hired by their companies to do they're like the second they walked in they're like the weather killed this event and it hadn't even started yet i was like ah you know but they're just like based on experience of doing stuff every weekend they're like floridians do not go out in this weather they're like it's not typical and they're not happy and um so we had about 80 people which you know was good i think the people that came were really really happy because they got so much attention if they wanted to sit with the people from daycare for 30 minutes there was there was no line behind them booting them most of the time i saw maybe two or three people deep every once in a while but for the most part people just went around in a line and it was the vendors do any pretty of co-marketing like i've done any spokes kind of they do they do they'll put they put it on their site and they they'll show me what they put so but there wasn't a whole lot of residual from that either i don't tell them no but if they don't ask me i don't suggest it yeah just because i don't know you know right like if you can get too many or you can have two few right yes so it's kind of like with anything that we do i know we talked about a banner was that for the chili cook-off putting a banner somewhere you were talking about it used to be up there what were we discussing about we did a banner for jazz in the park and there were some comments at the time because there were issues with the banner ordinance or the the sign ordinance um the staff doesn't really like them because they're a huge pain in the butt to get up there and to take down and to make level and all of that stuff and and literally as you're driving to see that sign you have to go like i mean you know what i mean it's not like if we had the capability of putting it over the causeway as you're sitting at the red light which we don't that would be a different story so we've tossed the banners around they're expensive and i just don't think people see them i i would drive by and see people walking and they turn and take a picture of the banner but i just i don't know how um how much it affected it i mean we could talk about it as we get closer but we definitely make the yard signs you know how they do like the city yard sale signs we do those and we put them you know here and by the red light and each end um but this time we should put one like right here when people walk and then we could put it out like i don't know how far i forget do we have about two weeks in advance a little bit more than that yeah just like people pass and then like oh even on the day it's like oh they're like hopefully it's nice because that's what we were hoping for last year and then we got the kaboom there and on the day of i don't know if you do it the night before this the sign freezes on our event just like it freezes on a wedding so i just did that on the from six am on yeah so it freezes so anybody that day will see it if they were like oh i gotta go but yeah so we advertise as much as we can within our parameters that were given and what we're allowed to do so okay so you're going to contact the two if you could please as opposed to waiting and i don't know until next month could you please email patty or kyle and let them know and update and then i can keep this tracker updated and if i have a lot of changes i'll send it to patty and patty can shoot it out to you guys so you kind of know because then maybe if you know say for example if a bellar living magazine is a yes too so i do have a couple updates that i literally got this morning um but say like if if optimal performance um says no and one of you know a physical therapist that you really like then maybe we can you know just kind of trade people out but otherwise are we good with this okay awesome okay so item number seven so all right here we go and we're gonna go over calendars and dates and stuff like that because we know the dates of the events but i know we have because we have some new people and we so appreciate you joining us like you know i want to make sure you know the full schedule and kind of what we need to do before each of these events so there's no surprises and if like you are out of town or you can't come we know because we have to find other people to help um but as far as the halloween event i did include a picture um and i there's a budget in there so there's two different sheets that um reference they look like this one it says bellar beach event budgets and one is like these little like wooden spoons so they should be towards the back of your packet i'll give everybody a second to find those are we good okay so like if you look at our budget for the halloween event so like last year you know it we did it on a saturday and we did it in the morning but this year we've known the whole time that there's a wedding that day so we we moved it from saturday to sunday and it's from four to six so my first thought was are we gonna do donuts at four o'clock or should we just do cookies like halloween cookies halloween cookies okay do we need to make a motion on the cookies or can i just say george is donna gonna be good with cookies are we good with cookies not donuts okay i just wanted to make sure i was thinking about that and then um so the prizes for that was at christmas too she had enough for no that was christmas yeah hey she was enjoying her she was enjoying herself anyway so like the prizes for the contestants are gonna be the same we had um a first second and third for the kids and the first second and third for the pets which was awesome so another thing that i wanted to ask about because as we were looking at it um as you know or maybe you don't know there was a boatload of really crappy trophies donated to they're all scratched up and they don't look good so as a joke for lynn's depart you know his retirement i switched out the plates on that to switch out the plate on that is kind of expensive for what it is considering it's not really a nice trophy so um for both the halloween event and the chili cook-off where we were gonna use those trophies and it's gonna cost a couple hundred bucks i really in my opinion it's a waste of money for something that someone's gonna like not be very happy to do anything with at all so um uh my suggestion is we're gonna be i think i don't think we're gonna spend 250 dollars on bottles of water and halloween cookies so i think we could probably move some of that money down to and even if we had you know how you just get the little like ribbons that say first place second i mean what last year a three or four year old one he would be so happy with the little ribbon and then he gets the amazon gift card and his parents are happy with that so or he and hopefully they you know let him pick something out but um but the same thing with the the chili cook-off if we don't use the trophies what i put in here is just a sample like i i have to re-look this up but if we could get something like this for like thirty dollars and then include like a gift card you know for first second and third we're spending the same exact amount of money for something that whoever wins is going to be much happier with that's something news yeah because i know all these golf trophies were like dust bunnies yes yes i get it so that's why i was like they're so pricey and they're not nice and for lyn it was fine because it was a joke but i just wanted to throw that out there because i think we could make much better use of the exact same amount for something that people are going to be happy with so um and this is something they can hang on their wall if they want to you know in their kitchen or even just stick in like the little container with all their other ones and they just don't use it and then give them a gift card that you know that they could actually buy something that they want to with it so are you guys good with that that's great i think it sounds perfect okay awesome no trophies no donuts and then um okay so the other thing um halloween by far is i mean well we haven't done a chili cook-off yet but last year halloween was by far we had the most um volunteers we needed them so my thought process is because we had six judges we had um two or three people working different tables we had the mc and then we had the emcee his wife and his son like they were like kind of you know it's herding cats you know these kids and the dogs and like trying to keep the dog separate and get everybody where they need to be when they need to be there so there was one mc but there were really three mc's and they really like they needed three people so my first thought is that we you know we contact first and foremost the people that helped us last year and we asked if they want to do it again and if they say were there if they were a judge last year and they don't want to be a judge this year will they do something else will they work a table or the other thing because we actually need more people this year is last year we did a parade and it was great that it gave the judges and kyle time to tabulate all of like the voting sheets but the parade wasn't exactly you know people don't stay together so it's like one kid fell one dog didn't want to go you know like and people weren't staying in a straight line they were all over the place so i don't really want to repeat that so what we were talking about doing and what we talked about initially like months and months and months ago was doing um like a trunk or treat thing so while the judges are doing their thing if we get enough people like just like say um you know like you guys know what a trunk or treat is right so the kids and the dogs would just go to different people's little tables or their however they set it up like in the roundabout parking lot and get candy and stuff while the judges are doing that or it's too big of a pain we have to find people we could scrap it and just give them cookies and water while the judges are doing their thing i don't know last year we had um they got their prizes and then they got we had treat bags that the city did i think the city did a treat bag and i did a treat bag so they got and then we had doggie treat bags so the kids got two treat bags and the dogs got one treat bag you know i they get so much candy at halloween i don't necessarily you know we haven't advertised any of this i just we have to find people that are willing to come buy the candy sit in their cars and hand the candy out or put them in little bags or whatever they do and i don't know if that's because this event needs so many people without that if we want to try for that or just because i think last year um i think what we envisioned was we have the parade and then every come everybody comes back and then we do the prizes and then everybody has donuts and apple cider well it didn't work out like that because not all the kids and people wanted to go so those people went and held you know said i want a donut now which was fine and then when all the kids came back they swarmed to the tables so it was kind of cute that they were covered in icing while they got their prizes but it's one of those things where i think if we just give out the cookies which won't have icing while the judges are tabulating no icing is like we have problems with icing at the beach cleanups if it's hot and it gets all melty and it's all over their hands and faces and it's all over the place especially the boston cream they just plop everywhere so yeah and then you so anyway so i guess i wanted some feedback on the trunk or treat because then we need like 10 more people that we didn't have last year because i don't want to ask all these people to do double duty you know what i mean like ahead we do all that ahead of time okay so that's all ahead of time yes everything's ahead of time i'm talking about other people like we passed out three tree bed three treat bags we did all of those ahead of time we set up all the tables ahead of time everything is in the office locked up every single thing that we can do ahead of time is done ahead of time which is why we meet the friday before which is why i said get out your calendars because i want to make sure that everybody has the dates down um we don't leave anything till that we can't until the day of because you were saying people should be sitting in their cars getting going out well that's trunk or treat we can't that's i okay so trunk or tree they started having that like um they have them at a lot of churches so like say the parking lot will be filled with cars and the kids go from car to car to car because like say in bella beach there is no trick-or-treating i was here three years before i had a single trick-or-treater we just don't have it so if there's kids in in beller beach they've got to take them to places that do trunk or treats so if you look at if you google trunk or treat you'll find one million examples of it okay yeah and it's just instead of going to a house you go to a car yeah yeah and instead of going ding dong you say get me out in your trunk so we can simplify it by not doing it they get the three tree bags that we do ahead of time the kids get two treat bags the dog gets one and we just call it a day because we're already giving them cookies and we don't ask people to do trunk or treat because if you bring your dog or you bring your kid you know these have to be all separate people that don't have either of those you know what i'm saying like they have to be other people that want to participate in this that aren't entering it so it might be more pain than it's worth and that's why i'm offering the opportunity to scrap it i don't like it for a totally different reason just being where i'm from i think it's a security risk for the kids to get near somebody's car like that i wouldn't want my kid to go up to somebody's car oh well they're all it could be uh lloyd and it's all going to be residents and it's probably going to be people that we know there's so many crazies out there it'll be like from me to you it's like literally we're on the circle and the cars are going to be in the little turn around where we had the so it would be pretty safe it's very safe like it would be in a church parking lot like that yeah and we we will know all the people they will be vetted like like if we're not going to let somebody pull in off of the street and go i want to hand out candy yeah kids no no it's a sign up sheet and it's a resident so it's not that so that's that's not a worry it's just um asking people above and beyond like what we're because we like i said this event needs more volunteers than any of our other events so we're already giving them cookies and a couple of treat bags i'm kind of leaning towards that's enough they don't need i was looking for something to fill the void of the parade that's all i was doing it doesn't need to be that consumer a time yeah something to take up their time is their music yeah because one of the mcs could do like you know let's do the hokey pokey or something you know where they could do you can ask dave if he'll do the hoping i'm sure he will he'll volunteer you i'm sure but no that's a good idea yeah we could do them we can macarena we can get those kids out there dancing that's a good idea yeah but and there's lots of cute spooky fun like kid halloween songs that they can dance to so like yeah we can just put on music and let them eat cookies and do their thing and you know we can try to simplify the voting because last year we thought it was simple but it seemed to be i don't know if there was a tie i don't know i wasn't back there i was leading the parade which was another oh how many categories are there is it just one kid and one dog or is there like three and three okay yeah there was first second and third and then they um they voted and it was a scale from one to ten and each judge gave a number and then we just added up all the numbers why do we have judges rather than like just people that come to the event because there's prizes because there's what prizes like they win first place second place in third place i mean like you come to the event like you ever go to like these christmas tree things and you made it on your favorite christmas tree so the people everybody everybody i guess it's because everybody attending the event could vote on their favorite rather than having the show who shot the most friends with them right but that's like how is it different than having a judge like you know what i mean that would eliminate the need for judges if we could give out tickets you know first second third or even for the you know i mean that's the way it works i used to use christmas tree like vote for your favorite christmas tree events at a senior center every year yeah everybody's got you know first second third and you put it in here and they have somebody like you manning it and making sure we just didn't get a lot of like spectators like most of the people that we had there were like with a kid or with a dog and there was no miscellaneous either chasing the kid or chasing yourself and that's a fact yeah cutting things out of dog's hair like it was a hot mess so that's why like it's a good idea but there was maybe like five yeah like maybe like 10 people that's like just showed up and there was no guarantee yeah so um and last year it was cute because like we had like the judges were all dressed up in halloween costumes and none of them had kids and none of them had dogs and so i would really say they were as impartial as they could be because they didn't have any stake in anything and um yeah to make it simplified george we just like you said we play music while the ballot box we try to make the judges sheet simplified so instead of having a sheet i think we should have voting for each number so that i can collect them or they can be collected as each person comes up so then they're all the hardest thing about those sheets was getting out you know five different sheets and they were listed in different orders and you were trying to trace across yeah so that would just consolidate to allow you to do it oh that's good like somebody shows up in their house when you give them like a six or seven that's what we did yeah and then you can add that every one of them they had little like runners they had we had a table with safety pins and numbers and they each had a little number safety pin to their costume or their collar or their leash or their whatever so yeah they were numbered and they they went up in order but that makes a lot of sense and that would make it a lot faster and then we wouldn't have a lot of time to fill yeah oh so that's what i was getting ready to ask how did they looked are the judges just meandering and looking at their numbers you know what they actually come up we have a video that i'll send you so you'll see the judges table you'll see how the whole thing was set up so like last year you know we got we bought the tents and we bought the the microphone like the portable microphone so all of that stuff was purchased on last year's budget so we have all of that stuff to reuse without having to reinvent the wheel yeah so it's we're able to do it at a lot less expense um but you know the biggest expense on this is the prizes but like people spent a lot of time and they spend a lot of money on those costumes some of them are really unreal so it's kind of it's nice to get a good prize for something that you put your you know your time and a lot of thought into i think what is the age cut off for the kids i'm just curious do we have an age cut off like did you have teenagers or does it generally i think that the oldest kid was 12. and then we had this oh we had this family like show up after like the fact they were all dressed up like the wizard of oz and it was amazing like they would remember they the dog even had a costume on like they came as like a tribe it was so it was like i get goose from singing about it because it was so good yeah like because they came like afterwards or something but um it was just cool like people did come out like dressed up and then yeah it was like all different dogs and then kids some people had like two or three kids like in their family and they all kind of got rated on their own so speaking of cut off though we really can't cut i mean you know 14 15 i don't know we didn't have anybody you know they reach a certain age and they think that that's yeah they they don't want to be with the little three-year-old in a costume contest but against the young kids too it is because they're so darn cute but the one thing that we will do this year that we didn't do last year is we are going to have a hard line in the sand about what time you get here and enter because people were meandering up after like people were walking up after like we every one thing was done in the you know the parade was going on and they were just walking up saying oh we're here we want to be in it and it's like well it's you're too late so we talked about that too because you know dave felt bad if like you know a little kid comes up and he didn't want to you know cut him off or whatever but we need to be like you know we need to make the point of you need to be registered by 415. and it seems like it happens yeah that's true we always have someone we always have people that show up at the end and go oh we thought it was just this before the time changes or is it right after the time changes right before right right right yes yeah usually so but it's usually saturday night and so it will be that day won't it because you guys usually have it on a saturday but now it's on a sunday and that night i think is when we turn fall back so i'm just saying that somewhere just gonna get dark by six o'clock no it doesn't fall back that night it falls back on november 6th so we don't have to worry about that anyway so um as we get closer we'll go through more of the details but um i like the like the little like the time cutoffs because we'll do that when we have to turn in the final proof for the signs um but just a couple things that we learned last year that we definitely will tweak a little bit how much confusion though this picture you know we okay so we couldn't have them come up and like the kids we had line up in a row you can't do that with the dogs because there were some dog fights and there were some that didn't want to be around other dogs so the the people with the dogs kind of spread out all over for their score well what i'm asking is do we say anything by eliminating the drugs and just having it oh no but the dogs were so darn cute like that was like half the joy was the dogs in the costumes they weren't that much of a problem well and that dog got sent home it did she took the dog home so no the dogs are great but what we could we couldn't do like the kids we lined up in numerical order like in a half circle and then they went to the middle when it was their turn to be judged and then you know dave would ask him a couple of questions and they were real cute and we'd had music halloween music playing in the background with the dogs we couldn't get them to do the little half circle because they wouldn't stand by each other so the dog owners were just kind of spread out all over the place and that was fine then when they called number one dog number one just came it was no big deal so it wasn't chaotic at all really there wasn't anything that was like super chaotic other than the parade parade yeah because it was like you were where was the parade we went in a circle and up ninth street and back around up in this parking lot and just you know i couldn't keep people out of the middle of the road on 9th street like i said like people would go real slow or they'd go real fast so like nobody stayed together nobody stayed in the street i needed a whistle i didn't have nobody stayed in a straight file line i mean we tried and like we walked we had orange vests and we walked on the outside so we kept everybody kind of in but it just wasn't other than the time killer that we needed it didn't serve a whole you know we did have some you know it was for the people on gulf boulevard and the causeway that were honking and waving at the kids that was fun because that's kind of what it was supposed to be but anyway you could do that just in the parking lot yeah just like a circle around if you want to use time again yeah exactly on the street yeah so we're not doing that that definitely we cut that out we cut that out immediately last year it's like very nerve-wracking when the kid like the parents are like yeah go ahead and they leave the kids with us and we're just like here's gold boulevard people are like racing down the road and they're honking and they're looking at the kids they're not paying attention to the wrong like i can't i'm like no no no and you know it was fine but it just wasn't worth it it wasn't worth the trauma so the parents were like yeah go ahead i'm gonna add my doughnuts and me and damn you're like oh yeah it was fun we learned a lot that day um okay so anyway um so then on the it's on sunday but we're still gonna have to get together on friday the 28th and we usually get together around two one o'clock one thirty what do you think oh one's pretty good one o'clock one o'clock on friday the 28th for set up and then on how long does that usually last for a second yeah i would usually say an hour and a half two hours at the most because we're we are putting together all the treat bags and we're getting all the tables set up and all of that good stuff and then the event starts at four so everybody needs to be here at three um because at that time all we really need to do is set up the two tents and then we just carry the tables out because they're already all set up and then bring all the stuff out and kind of lay everything out did you guys dress up last year okay i have a video i'll share i do like you know how your phone just turns all the group pictures into a cute video and then i just edit it and yeah so you just see the pictures but i'll we were going to show them at a city council meeting but somehow it always gets pushed off because we have videos from all of our events just so you can kind of get a concept of what it looked like or what we did um did the council members dress up well dave was art now huh there you go that's what i'm wishing for did she talk about her tribe that she taught we did star wars a couple of years ago we got an eminence chewbacca chewbacca yeah yeah yeah for that voice almost everybody there had a costume on kids dogs and adults almost everyone so yeah it was definitely festive and um there was this giant huh what were you again oh and then i actually ordered these these little um dishes for an event at my house that i'm having but they're um i'll pass around they're great for chili samples because there's room for just a couple of bites of chili and then if you do crackers or fritos or condiments you have room for the do they condiments the heat well have you tried is there a plastic no we're not doing that i mean i i don't it we're going to take the well what do you think i don't know no i'm just concerned that it steeps oh i thought you meant they were going to burn the bottom of their hands no i meant like melt kind of from the heat if the chili's too hot we should toss them all the chilies are going to be in crock pots on warm i mean i don't it's not like it's on a stove with the fire um and i have a feeling as opposed to scooping out one cup at a time people are going to scoop them out and put them on the table so people can grab them so they'll have time to cool i don't know if you want to do some research on a cup with the heat well that we can afford i just don't know i don't i i can't picture what you're talking about like you know what chili's that when you get the to-go orders and the chili's comes in the salsa comes in the little cardboard paper cups and they even have lids on them you know what i'm talking about i know they're about the same size as that but they're huh i said those will probably hold up i think they're probably fine too but it'll be good if you're if you're serving it something at home with them just put something hot in there but you know honestly they're ice cream dishes they're for desserts like for a cupcake that's what they're made that's like it says for ice cream right but um as long as it's not too hot it'll be fine but if it was hot it couldn't start melting yeah you want to test one i'll i'll test one i'll test one as we get closer um so what is mean like i said i bought those for my house for an event at my house so i just um when kyle orders them for the city like but this is a thing i said to him because there's a price break at 50 100 200 and a thousand so if there's 24 things of chili in there that's why i keep talking about price points if there's 24 crock pots of chili then every single person that walks through the door needs that many cups because we're giving the cups to the people that have you can't take a white chicken chili eat it and then put a you know a turkey chili or a beef chili they can't use the same bowl over and over everybody's got to have so if there's 24 chilies every single person that walks in the door needs 24 bowls yeah um so it's a lot they're back they're bad for the environment but styrofoam is good for that yeah styrofoam's even meltier than this would be um so what would be the issue with using the same cup for the other children it's like mixing wines you can do it especially because you're judging what you're tasting so it's like you're contaminating you lick the bowl thank you for your input would you say you can do that at your house good practice to do a new one yeah um yeah i thought about because you know like how you like they did once that person burned their hand on the cup of coffee and they had the um everyone assigning a liability waiver to come to this event because when we're serving alcohol and two we're serving food that's not you know that's made in people's homes so i don't as far as getting something that we can put give everybody 24 of and have like a heat thing on it it's almost like i don't know you're talking about melting the cup i was talking about burning i thought you were talking about burning their hands you like how starbucks they give you those little cardboard i don't i just don't think the chili is going to be that hot because it will just tell everybody take it off a high not re it doesn't have to be room temperature but just so because you know you have plastic dishes and then i don't think put it on warm yeah and that should be fine do you know how many participants you have so far well that's what we're talking about so like the next item i think is the chili cook-off yeah so no because this event's november 19th um i am going to present at the next city council meeting because this is where we're selling tickets so you get the chili samples and you get two drink tickets so you get a beer or a wine or a water they're all one ticket if you buy your tickets at the door it's twelve dollars so that's going to help offset the cost because the insurance for this event was 550 um we are going to be our own bartenders because we're not paying someone 500 to stand there and say here's your miller light i refuse to do that or your cup of sauvignon blanc that's not gonna happen so it's like we'll just read labels and cans yeah i mean there's no mixology going on here it's you know it's a red a white or a beer and i don't even know if we're gonna do the domestic and import we didn't get that far yet it's gonna depend on how many tickets we sell and that's a good thing we're gonna sell tickets in advance and we're going to do sign up sheets for the people that want to have a chili in the event now if you if you go on google and you google i want to throw a chili cook off what are the guidelines 90 of them will say the chili's need to be anonymous and i was thinking about this and thinking about this i don't know how you do that because who's going to serve the darn chili if the people who made the chili aren't behind their crockpot because it's like the way i envision it we set it up similar to you know like just around the edges two people on a six foot table we do plastic white tablecloths because we're not ruining our good white tablecloths with chili and then the tables split in half and then you know if you have your chili on that side of the table you can do whatever you want you know you have your chili you have your sample cups they will be walking through with their spoons and their napkins and their tickets and but if you want to you know dress up as you know whatever with your bobby play yes exactly or if you want to put like some kind of display on your table like you know some peppers or some hot sauces you have all your condiments you can do whatever you want with your half of the table um because one of the categories that we talked about and dave because obviously this is dave gaddis's he's the one that requested this event we were kind of looking at something else in november um so here i will read to you the three categories he sent me the other day that he was good with okay so um category one would be um so it wouldn't be first price second price or third prize i think that's what the spoons say it would be like crowd favorite or best all-around chili we could do whichever one because it's basically the same thing different wording category two would be most flavorful slash spicy because spicy you can make your chili as hot and it will set someone on fire but it doesn't mean it tastes good it just means that you put enough hot peppers in there to kill someone so that's why i kind of want to lean away from the spicy because you know if flavorful can mean spicy without setting someone on fire so um and then category three would be most creative and so creative chili because i've seen people make chili with things i never dreamed about putting in chili and they all look like different different recipes different colors i know nicole brought up the suggestion of people providing their if they want if they want but like what they did suggest was that um they get us they give their chili a spice rating so if someone is like no no i can't do hot so we can set the rating on a scale from one to five or whatever and you you know you say you know my chili has ghost peppers in it so it's definitely a five or i can say mine has nothing in it so it's a one or mine has green chilies and jalapenos so it's like so i think that was a good idea but i just don't see unless anybody has an idea of how we can do an anonymous chili cook-off so there's no they were talking about their being like you said like ballot you're stuffing the ballot box or like people paying favor favorites like this person has like kyle made really terrible chili but everybody loves kyle so kyle won i don't think that's gonna happen but like i think that was what their point was i just don't see how we get around that you can rotate [Music] we'll just have everyone stand with their chili and then be like everyone move one spot to the left yeah i thought about that too because that was my original idea yeah well maybe they'll start bad mouth and then chilling like that seems good i feel like the rating is just on the chili you know the other thing with that is like say on your chili you need like you know you have the little two bites of chili and then you put your condiments on top you may not do your con i might like if i'm at your table i may not do it like you want it done for your chili so that i just think you're gonna have to suck it up once that i've been to i was just wanted a pretty big church up north and they were everybody served their own chili okay yeah yeah and how is the boating you're gonna have like everybody's gonna have a jar in front of their thing and no what it's i think we're gonna do is we're gonna put the three jars one for each category at the welcome table we're gonna give everybody with their spoon and their napkin three colored tickets category one is a blue ticket category two is a red ticket category three is a yellow ticket and then we'll have a jar one two and three and then they just go take their tickets and they put they put the number like say every chili is gonna have like you know those we bought those for um the health and wellness fair the sticks with the numbers so like if george's chili number three and i think my vote is number three for the most creative chili i just put a number three on the back of the tick the yellow ticket and drop it in the yellow jar and then that way people aren't fumbling because i found all sorts of like again all these papers will just be a nightmare for us to try to add it up so if we get everybody three colored tickets and then they get two drink tickets because we can't sell alcohol we have to sell them tickets everyone will get their spoon their napkin and five tickets when they walk in the door and then that i don't know if somebody has an easier way but like can it just be like one ticket and it says one two and three like the three categories and then you just put the number that you're voting for you count yes it is because he has to lay out all of the papers that's similar well no one take it further and then you'll have all three categories and then next to it you just put what one you're voting for it's easier if you kind of separately separate it manually by having the different colors because then i always do is take the yellow jars and like because that's kind of the idea to kind of manually separate it in the process rather than have them do it i got you it's quite easy um no that sounds good i was just thinking about from an awards standpoint so you identified three different categories if um george wins best overall would we also allow that same person to get most imaginative or whatever the third category was or do you want to if you win best overall or to say you can only win one category of course best overall seems to be the highest rank and then i don't know what you would determine between the second and third categories which one is better do you have to have the first section do we have like they're just equal they're just different categories and then they can all get like a 50 gift card or something and we don't have to do like a hundred seventy five and fifty we could do fifty fifty fifty yeah and then but we would like say if like um there were uh on the yellow tickets for most creative george got four votes and paddy got four votes like there we would have to figure out how to do a tie breaker is it yeah you win you gotta have a tiebreaker and then you gotta like yeah if you do have someone score the highest of those groups you could just give them the highest whatever they score highest and and then the next runner up could win the other group okay you know that's good yes what about a tie breaker how do i break where you can go to the other category so let's say they were tied for first in category three then you can say well where did those two people finish with respect to category one and or category two you know type of see that would be the tiebreaker because they weren't they didn't have the most votes in best overall or most flavorful but they had them tied for the most votes and most creative so how did they stand those just those two people too whoever got the most votes in the other two categories somebody break it like not let him do the tasting and he beats the tiebreaker oh no he can't wait to enter his chili yeah he can he's an entrant so he can't yeah he's an entrant okay so he can't participate but it'll be good if we could have somebody like that somebody that would be the designated tiebreaker we'll have the new city manager do it i think it's certainly the whole concept of this hopefully i was just going to say if we have one but anyway we couldn't retaliate the total votes of george and patty in that example in the other two jars you know and we're not getting there at all conceivably right it could be but yeah he could be good yeah that is really a tie right then you have to have some other tie breaker outside those boundaries flip a coin how about a chili eating con it's a good problem to have you know it's not a bad problem to have um what else okay so like i guess what we i'll put something together and then i'll have patty shoot it out to you guys if you guys have any like suggestions or comments or tweaks like what the sign up sheet looks like um if you want to enter a chili and we have enough room for what did we say 24 chili's how do you come up with that yeah maybe oh no it actually could be more than that because it's two at each table so it would be more like well we have that many people entering who's gonna be testing well we're hoping to get so you want me to figure out how every time we've had an event in the past we set we like to set it up like he's talking about we move tables everywhere i mean we're moving tables and moving tables and moving tables and moving tables and then it's like okay we start in five minutes we gotta be done with the table no yeah so i mean what do you guys think about doing the chili's on the parameter of the room and doing the bars in the middle and then the welcome tables at the i don't know if we have two like we're gonna have to have two one at each door because people are gonna come in both doors and we have to id people and they have to be on the perimeter because they're gonna need the outlets yeah there's some outlets in the middle but yeah it'll just be cleaner i think if we do can we put the bar against the glass oh against the guys because there's maybe there yeah because there's no outlets or you don't need electricity i'm only gonna admit people that have tickets right no we're going to sell them um 12 bucks the day of but okay but the second every person that comes in that room has to have seven tickets yeah okay and then what if someone comes and they're an adult but they bring a miner they stop the purchase the tickets but then they don't obviously don't get the drinks well no water water beer and wine are the same amounts of water okay yeah yeah even if people bring like a family comes each kid has got to get yeah because you're paying for the chili you're paying for all the cups yeah yeah i mean so it's like the people who are drinking alcohol are getting a deal and the people are drinking water they're still getting a deal it's not like it's that much money you know it's like lunch you're gonna pay 10 bucks for lunch you're getting a ton of chili and like all the stuff that goes with it and then whatever you know your choice of something to drink with it i guess is my i don't know well you know do you remember dave in the meeting was like wine who drinks wine with chili so then i was like should we just have beer i i don't know i mean i was like some people like wine with everything like and they don't drink beer that's like so in my head it was like it was a good option to have a red a white or a beer but i remember that cider if you can't drink beer that's what i was going to mention two things it's not too expensive so people that um you know can't have gluten celiac type deal if we could have a small amount of crackers now are the are the cookers going to provide the crackers or is that they do but like we will have some kind of crackers so we can have that's a good point so we can have some gluten-free crackers and some just regular crackers right that'd be great um do you have sealant i can drink the wine yeah the wine is no issue but um in lieu of beer but you don't have to do this but cider is an acceptable you know alcoholic beer type beverage and replacement of beer so that was the first question i asked i was diagnosed does this mean a can of beer but they do have gluten-free beer actually yeah and some of it's good but wine is gluten-free yes and bourbon doesn't know it's gluten-free but the process that it goes through actually kills the effectiveness of the weak and barley stuff so that's the thing to say learn something okay so water that's the best one right there what and water that's the best one right there yes so i will have kyle or patty email out the form for the um the entry so like if patty you're going to enter your chili we just need xyz information not a lot it's going to be like three lines my other question was are we going to keep this residence only up until a certain point and then if we don't have enough residents are we going to open it up or and the only reason i say that is because like where nicole and i live like she's the last house in bellar beach i'm the second to the last house in biller beach people that we hang out with in our neighborhood all the time live in indian rocks beach and like we go to their events all the time i don't think we're gonna have a ton of people from other places that want to participate but if we don't have enough participants in from beller beach by a certain point are we going to open it up or are we just going to keep it residents only amber with my yeah no i think that's a good idea mom i would think that's a good idea to have a specific day and then if you guys didn't feel comfortable that that's enough participants then sure how are we gonna know when they buy a ticket like are we going no no it's not to come it's to make a chili oh to make the chili to make the chili yeah i mean we're not we have never turned away anybody but we also haven't had like a big influx of people from all over trying to come either so um i think just for one other thing to go back to it we have time but i wouldn't necessarily if you really think that people aren't gonna drink wine i'm a huge wine drinker but i'm probably not gonna drink it with chili it just it usually doesn't go that well it's hard to order like how do we know how much to order well that's why we're pre-selling tickets that's right so whatever you're gonna do then you're gonna have to ask we're pre-selling tickets and you're gonna have to ask whether they're going to drink wine or beer like you know what i mean like it's hard to judge right it's kind of like you know when you're on a flight and the one thing that you want is a snack sells out on the row 4 you know and you're in 33 it's kind of that way it happens it's kind of that way with beer and wine i think the majority of people are going to buy beer so if we do get one we probably have to be conservative and or just eliminate it and just offer wine and beer soda and water you're so you're you know like coke yeah yeah no no no i knew what you meant yeah instead of wine i just think it's weird he's probably right a lot of people i drink a lot with everything but even i don't drink it with chili see there's a professional right there jonas yeah i mean i might think but i just tried no no i i don't even know how to order it yeah so you can order it more accurately you have to order it yeah we don't want a lot of leftovers it could be a waste of money because you're not going to be able to get a decent wine for less than i don't know twelve dollars a bottle or something so if we do just beer do we need four choices though beer cider soda and cider with chili either that just seems weird yeah so just beer soda and water yeah that's what i think yeah i'm i i'm good with any of it are we good with beer now is it just domestic are we doing domestic and import how many choices are we giving because there's a million i think we should do local a local one like three daughters or something well i don't drink beer so somebody could make a recommendation can we have it donated yeah i was going to say we live next door to the vice president of anheuser-busch so i'm going to ask for donations so like for the ciders for things that we don't need a ton of or you know he's you know some bud bud lights you guys budweiser bud light so yeah and they go buy a lot of those anyway but it would be nice to give a little if there is any idea yeah so we'll see what we can get comp from him and we will take off the wine and we will add what pepsi and diet pepsi coke diet coke yes no yes and i'm a coke over a fancy person coke i just drink water coke diet coke and then um we'll figure out the the beer and um cider but we'll just do again and there there's so many choices do you do bud and bud light do you do a mix dude i mean you should be a professional about what beer goes best right chili and this is the bellar beach side so they can make a donation right so the budweiser guy can make a donation if we have our status by then yeah because we we don't know but you know what we he it can he can still give us a donation to it and hopefully the um foundation will have a table at this event if everything like i said earlier lines up so yeah so good good good good that's very good um you know in lieu of a cider because i don't know how many people would drink that i only drink it because if there's regular beer i can't drink it but just just you know a small amount of the gluten-free beer like about a 12-pack that would just be enough for me you get two tickets but you know what this cider thing i'm getting confused because i'm thinking a child cider i thought it was like cider like apple cider vinegar shortly it's 3 30 yeah just a couple more minutes okay does anybody oh i know the other question i wanted to ask about this is um are we [Music] i can't remember if we talked about dessert are we doing like brownies or anything like that or is it just chili everyone's going to be full to here with chili and alcohol i think it should just be chilly but i and i'm indifferent i i can go either way it doesn't matter to me i think keep it simple okay yeah so off no dessert i just couldn't remember if we talked about it um okay okay so like i guess just the only follow-up from that that we need at this point because we already talked about the no trophies and we talked about the liquor which was the biggest thing is i'll shoot out the entry form to you and um then you guys can like give any feedback if you'd like and then the the last item on the agenda is other business um does anybody have anything that they want to talk about you need us for any dates other uh for the chili cook-off it's saturday november 19th assuming we probably need to be here at like 10 or 11 on another day oh we need to be here on friday the 18th same thing one o'clock and what time does it could start it starts at noon doors open at 11 it's noon to two huh because chili cook-off is going to be a lot of setup with all the tables and tablecloths and bar we'll do a lot of the tables up on friday yeah yeah before you guys get here okay so one o'clock on the 18th and then we'll have a list i'll work with kyle i'm just making sure you know we have ice and the spoons and the tasting cups and all that stuff that we need i'll put the other room design to send it out for okay and then i can give it to the fire department because they'll they'll be able to determine where capacity is based on the design okay that's good thank you and then the other thing that we have is the event in december we don't set up early for that though right i mean didn't we just come in the afternoon of because it's just like two tables so friday december or i'm sorry monday december 5th we just come at 4 o'clock and the event starts at 5. nicole you'll have all these dates and times you need to be here in your summary okay um so nobody else has any other business all right bye caroline thank you all right all right where is the the tree lining is the tree right out here yeah so last year we had christmas carolers and you really couldn't hear them it would have been better if we would have just had music blasting like really good christmas music because um if they were outside you couldn't hear anything inside and then they would walk inside and the people outside couldn't hear anything and it's not like you could play christmas music in here while they were outside so it's just it was before they got here we had just christmas music pipe through and it was great so i mean it was they were nice but like we're gonna save the money and oh you paid for carol oh yeah it was a professional [Music] so no other business the only thing i have and i wanted to see if you guys wanted me to add anything is um so i i'm not going to be on the agenda for city council in september i'm just going to get up during citizen comments but i'm going to cover the bellar beach community foundation i'm gonna cover the chili cook-off the sign-ups and the ticket sales i'm going to um kyle's going to present the brick look well he's not going to do that september now that got moved to october um and then i was going to talk about the trunk or treat sponsors but we took that off so i'm not going to talk about that now and then um but you could add couldn't you ask for donations of candy bags of candy from just the community to for us to fill the little bags it could well i mean what it can't hurt to ask okay anybody wants to donate bags of candy yeah i will do that is there anything else you guys want me to include in the presentation just gotta bring someone to donate maybe their minutes someone that donates at three minutes oh yeah yeah she's gonna ask that yeah do you need more time it sounds like you've got the online she can only have 12 minutes yeah i mean i literally i have like four sentences and if they ask a lot of questions say about the chili cook-off then that doesn't affect my time if they want to interact yeah so i it was just more of like you know because they already voted on the chili cook-off so it's more of just like um giving information about the sign up sheets and the dates and stuff or you know the dates for sign ups and stuff like that and is this what you're doing if you guys like it yeah it won't say it won't say first second and third it'll say bellar beach most chili cook-off favorite yeah i love that yeah and then we'll just because the prizes are all equal there isn't a one two and three it's an equal equal equal then it's we could just do 50 bucks and if that's less and then it's cute yeah i know you wanted to do your little skillet though so i didn't know are you are you okay because i just figured you have a lot in your plate and yeah no that's perfection are you limited are the board shares limited in time when you when the different board chair person's update but this isn't going to be able to the board updates are going to be in october so this is we're just going to have her promote these different topics
