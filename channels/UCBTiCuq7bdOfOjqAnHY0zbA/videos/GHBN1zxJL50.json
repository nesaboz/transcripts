    "transcript": "good okay so i'd like to call to order the september 1st 2020 park and recreation board regular meeting so uh first uh order of business is a poor order there are only four of us on this board um june van scoyek was removed burke seraphin has resigned and lisa elliott has been signed so that means they're right now we have three so we're right at the minimum i guess so so we can go ahead and have the board the board meeting okay um i've not met you tammy i know i was at the city council i'm gonna take this so i can speak uh i was at the city council meeting when you were um i remember if you were here yeah you did you spoke for a minute i did yeah so i just seen you there so welcome well i don't know where jean is she's our other member but here we are we haven't met in a while we haven't met since march and i think a lot of things have changed since then so um so our roll call is george rick and tammy so i'll make sure that that's noted um and the other people are not missing because well gene is missing but the other three was two resigned monsters so all right i'm having a motion um for somebody to approve the agenda as published please okay you want a second that okay okay anyone know anyone opposed all in favor all right okay so agenda is approved okay uh first item on the board is the nomination election of officers it's a two year term as when appointed by the city council i served for the last year as a vice chairman i am no longer going to do that so someone's going to have to pick up um leadership of this board i would like to continue as a member for the remainder of my time but i'm not going to take a leadership role with it so someone's going to have to someone's going to have to step up and take on the uh the chairmanship the vice chairmanship and um you know i don't have the objective to be a secretary i'm pretty good at taking notes i'll be happy to do that for continuity purposes but um before we go forward we can't do any business without elected officers so does anyone want to take on those leadership roles all right okay all right i will i will take you on the assignment the secretary i'm happy to do that okay so let me make sure i get this right george and then we seconded okay so chuck chair last year yeah and so the duties of the chairman are to run the meeting to develop the agenda um that's that's really pretty much it to provide you know general direction i don't want to say um you know leadership but general direction of the board our focus has changed significantly from what it was um under the prior chairman we were very very focused on events uh no matter that we had a list of i don't remember now eight or nine events that were approved by city council um and they have all been obviously cancelled due to coving and for quite frankly some lack of interest and some flat-out antagonism in my own personal opinion and i understand a lot of that i wasn't a large advocate of having a bunch of city events personally and i expressed that to the prior chairman that was the direction we were going and that was the director of the city council approved and then covet came and everything was has been put on hold so the reason we're meeting today is we were asked by the city council the mayor and the city council to address the items that you should have received in the email that patty sent out to you which specifically relate to the marina and the slips and the rental the slips and things like that so um to answer your question the chairman just just kind of kind of leads the meeting directs the meeting um disseminates information through city hall as uh he's probably saw that email that i i sent out when when gene had sent me you know i can't with the sunshine laws you should also receive that in your email okay the short story on that is is we can never meet outside of an open forum like this um and nor can say i have a good eye i think it was a good idea i can't communicate that to you and say hey tammy what do you think about this you know you should bring this to me because that would be ganging up or it can be seen as well it is seen as improper so anytime you communicate you need we need to communicate lynn is like he's like home base lynn or pat you you can talk to lynn about anything you want or you can talk to council members about anything you want but we can't talk as members of the board amongst ourselves unless we're in this form so that's what i was trying to explain gene even though i think i mean that's probably a little bit of an overstatement but it's a safe way to go we could have conversations about when we're going to meet we've had discussions about that and that's been fred riley said that was okay but we want to stay clear of that that way you know nothing is uh can never be seen as being improper that's true if we were friends or we were friends outside we could certainly get yeah of course yeah yeah we can do that and that reason is so anything that is officially city business like we have a visitor here tonight i invite her to stay with so you know she's welcome so anything that she hears tonight is open to anybody in the city so that's kind of the way that works i read it yeah yeah reading it yeah is one thing but understanding how it applies i think sometimes another so i just send everything normally i send everything through patty and and i copy lin and then how they do it internally in the office i'm not exactly sure but um but you have anything you want to talk about on any subject you can talk to lynn about that's that's good yeah or the mayor or any of the council members or any of those people can all be communicated with on an issue but just not support so that that's what's required for chairman just to make sure that everything is being done in a proper manner kind of give out the general assignments if you will things we want to talk about set dates and then just facilitate really you're more of a facilitator than anything else our focus like i say was extensively on events um before that came into play george was here before i was i think the focus was on a um a whole park grant which we received and then the city council decided not to approve it so that was a lot of work done by prior um boards um but for whatever reasons i was just decided not to go forward with that so our work you know parks and rec you know really kind of kind of what's left we should probably be taking note on a regular basis of what's going on at the various beach accesses and parks within the city maybe come up with some suggestions and things a way maybe they could be approved and we're a point of contact for the residents if they're if someone calls and they're not upset but to say they have a concern they want to bring vote they're probably going to call lynn i mean most of those calls go to him he's been doing this a long time he had probably answered well not probably 99 percent of the questions but he might say you know what let me get all the park and rex board and we'll be have them address that at their next meeting and invite them to come to that so we try to do everything to get the community involved in the decision making so it doesn't all fall on him and then the city council approves it or does it for something beach accesses belong to bel air right they are they're not part of the park that's a separate industry but i don't think that's the their nature questions we maintain them through interlocal agreement so the sanitary the condition of those are i think the the business of this board to monitor for the citizens since they belong access and belong to the citizens of lrbs but yes that you know the land belongs to bella right now yeah so you know if you see you know we need new trash cans or the lawn is not being cut or you know you're not going to contact bella or sure you're going to contact bella beach right that's i think what she's getting at yeah right or cars parked there they're not starts to be there or things like that it gets kind of deep but so are we responsible for him he'd say no i'd say yes but you know we understand what each of us needs when it comes to that so then we first have parks i can't remember how many we have in the city three how many actual okay so that's one thing we had talked about doing is going back and and uh looking as as a group go to those and look and see you know what the condition of them is if anything lynn probably has a keep some notes of the things that are brought to his attention and things that people want to see improved or cleaned up or whatever in those parts this board this one is pretty much a picture of what the chairman decides to do that was my next question because you said this the last one focused on this previous chairman three times for the whole year not just i previously had two chairs but we need three times unless the city council says would you study this for us was more proactive she took it under leadership to design me get very involved in recreational parts of it born by the recreation from so she had a much different picture sometimes we've been twice a month just three times a year so pretty much my state city council [Music] all phases of the parks and recreation particularly recreation so it's kind of a desire to change oh that's right i mean yeah so it really is a reflection of uh the city because we have a city manager who's you know is very efficient and on top of things it takes care of most of the business of the city so we you know we we can be as or the chairman can be as is proactive or you know i'm sure that the years where the board didn't meet regularly and really didn't do much and then there was a whole initiative getting that grant together that was a lot of work but that was defeated so um we're kind of at a new start really we really are we're at a new point and it's going to be really the vision of the new chairman with the direction of the council and uh able-bodied or the city manager to kind of direct us because i'm sure lynn has some things in his mind that you know down the road he's probably gonna say i'd like to have you look into it so that's kind of an overview um so i don't know if somebody wants to step up and um take on that position or how do we want to go with that and then we'll get to the you know we have to select the officers i don't think we can continue as a board without officers correct so we can't like skip down to the next item which is what we were asked to get together for which is to do with the marina and the prices and the slips the work of the planning zone can i can you tell us a little about yourself sure um my husband and i moved to belgium beach three years ago and um we still have our house at the end of my career i was a district manager or a larger server in chicago so i managed anywhere from six sales people to 35 sales people depending on what was going on so i ran reviews every week so that's not like out of my comfort zone sure sure once i know the topic so you know like i did it for 26 years so it was pretty familiar and the chicago is a union state so like all three very very various for my sales reps not up to management but like so i'm very used to talking like you have to do this this this and this as far as like you know how i handle myself moved here i started i got my real estate license my broker's license i started buying properties not here but in indiana so now i just manage our mental problems so i can do that from here i mean if the toilet breaks i call somebody i don't fix it anyway so like most of my tenants don't even know i'm here um so that's what i do now is very flexible and i wanted to get more involved in where i live but i didn't want to do it like my first six months living here so now that okay all right congratulations george i don't need your you're okay with that george has more experience he's been on it before any of us um so he's seen probably three iterations right of direction of this board right all right thank you so would you like to you can do it right from there so i did i didn't move this entire package i had a couple questions so this research i'm sorry i couldn't hear you item number three make mm-hmm motion we approve the meetings of march 4th our 2020 was asked to do a little research on previous research does anybody know like when he did his research yes actually mr lawson's right here oh okay you did a great job i learned more about all of this it was wonderful i did that back on july 22nd i've done that in 2018. probably every two years i do it for the city so i do have a slip down there and you can play away with questions if you haven't i got a ton of questions so like is the total number of slips we have like 23 or 25 i didn't know 18 18. 19 total okay i couldn't tell if they went around that corner and then the homes it sucks okay and how many people open right now oh yeah one just opened just a quick yesterday i'm sorry just yesterday one open okay so it's pretty much all the time okay um so when we were asked to do like more research what was the agenda was it to improve revenue was it to make hours and lines i think i'll help you with an initial answer and then let them live in the world so i got involved in that chair where i attend a lot of meetings and i heard a council member suggest that we raise the rates at the marina via a utility fee our utilities are getting higher let's just split it up between all the sprints i hear light things throughout the years and that's okay that's that's one of our revenue streams for the city is the breeding so to help council i offered again to say hey let me step you back a little and provide you information about the marina and then look at life marinas if there is anything i'll be alive what's there really and therefore you would have some current research to make educating decisions on what to do so that's how it came about at least so we really don't have like there was no type of like a budget to try to improve it and there's no looking at doing that it was just like to raise it based on what it looks like in comparison to raise it to raise it is just to give you a little background the marina has been around probably 25 years it's been city property at least that long maybe a year or two longer but basically what they've done over the years is it slips the marine is very basic you don't have any fuel or anything like any other marina you've ever seen it's more for convenience for the residents and there's a few non-residents that live there right there but for the most part it's a place to document it's got water and electricity but that's pretty much all it has the parking in the marina is dedicated to beach renourishment we would have to have 70 spots yeah okay and that's what's dedicated there and you know you've got some more information in here you know the planning board did some research and you know because the concert was asking well can we do something to get more revenue out of the brand and you know there are some options there but it's quite expensive and top looked into adding spaces in the back of your packet there's a kind of a design all right that has to go through the army corps of engineers process i mean it's not just that particularly bill jobs and it's pretty expensive and the city did the initial thing with this probably 2001 or 2002 and the city at that time hired a consultant and that's where this design came from those woods consulting and we did go back to them and ask what the cost of the design work in the future it was a significant amount but i'm talking recently so every year at budget time we're asked to do comparison of the victories and unfortunately it's there's no apples to apples we've got a great deep water area for boats to get in and out of that's positive so when you look through what bill will do you have to look at when you look at the marinas as an example we'll just take st petersburg for example well you know they have different grades they have different slims they they have facilities they have gas they have all this other stuff then you look at a place like safety harbor which directs you very well they're only for residents but tampa bay to get your boat out of safety harbor the tide's got to be high and if you don't get back before the tide goes down you're not going to get right because the bay is very shallow and you know but they have limitations too so you know then you go look at dunedin uh its rates are pretty similar to ours in some respects depending on the size of the bulb we have a minimum you have to have a 30-foot mirror which is seven dollars a foot so the minimum superficial is 210 depending on the length of the boat and if you have a low that's 20 feet you still pay 210 and you have to if you want to live it's your no they take life out or if we know who's going in there they could sell it to them and that's happened a few times but the majority of time they take it out because it may be a different sized boat that's coming in and the lift won't handle it or vice versa the city at one time let people just leave them and it became dense city property so every year we put budget money and it's failing for things like the catwalks or if we've redone the walk along the front over the years some of the owners that paid to put papers in well it looked kind of patchwork so we finished it as a last year yeah i think it might have been last year earlier on the papers yeah papers were probably a year and a half ago i would say over the last 15 years and i'll just help you with this comment i've been down there 15 years as well the there's never a complaint from a slip owner that goes to the city but if anything is ever brought up the city is right on i'll give you an example 15 years the fence was four feet they brought it up to six feet beautiful thing now lock key thank you for doing that like glenn said we did start some pavers down there might not have had the right approvals at the time the city came in and finished it up uh we've had the new decking put on within i would say the last five years yeah so it looks great and then we have penny for pinellas lighting that i think we received and we have new lights down there too so there's uh you know from the slip renters perspective everyone really goes down there to look out of the water and get out not really go there because it's a marina that helps and there's no like um [Music] probably depending on the time you might drop six feet talking coyote right right and then you have to jump in the water uh no it it's it's basically you know got in space this committee has spoken about potential kayak marketing places for all at the other class and that was briefly discussed because mission of looking at all the parks and all the parkland there this part here is a florida community's trust grand park where it can't be used for anything but apart and some of the parks that were given to us they were needed for stipulations that they had and then but most of them are single laws except this one the city bought this property in i want to say 94 and they developed this things that are there right now were developed in the 2001 time frame and so over the last 19 years other than maintenance the marina itself is you know i think what the city cox was trying to find out is what you guys feel is appropriate or mr rusk and i met and zoomed in but if you look there's a page based on the data that he collected and you know if the city council chose to raise the rates then you know i thought it should be over a time frame you don't just go in and say because some other marina has a rate of x dollars one to make it fair maybe you the first couple years what i me and mr lost discussed was okay you reduce the minimum and then you charge eight dollars a foot for residents and charge 50 percent more behind those days as an example don't eat charges double for someone's discounted and that that and then the other thing we discussed was if you started new the new rate over the five-year period that anyone who knew that came in would automatically be charged the 10.15 rate as a new renter so they knew it up front this is the cost it's going to cost you and you know we kind of looked at would that provide a little bit of revenue and if you look in he's got some sheets here and talk about the different varieties and what the cost might be so you pick up you know as an example uh based on if we did the 20 five foot minimum that raised into eight or 12 right you pick up a few hundred dollars a month so the annual revenue would go up over a year maybe three or four thousand dollars but over time if you took the same amounts if you just use the the votes that are there now over time pick up significance yeah so uh that's that's kind of where the point i'm sorry when was the last time i couldn't tell you that i i know they've been this way for several years but they haven't been there i can tell you it's probably probably been six or eight years since wow but on the other hand we've made a year as a savings account because as an example if one of those board rocks uh catwalks go down we've got a replacement uh or iphone like the hurricane we have a few time holes so i guess like um i'm looking at this into this discussion and i'm trying to figure out like how are you supposed to like just kind of write some like some ideas we could certainly do that or if we like the work that they've done and that was a joint the recommendations a joint reputation from the u.n bill right just the line of your program that could be a motion if you know um because there were obviously they took the time and looked at this and had a little more background right so um personally i don't feel that we we need to go back and look at the numbers and everything ourselves because i know lynn's background and also that's that i would be willing to make a motion to be approved the rate increases as suggested by the the board and i guess and endorsed by a city oh i make the motion that the phased-in rate increases as proposed by the board and endorsed by the city manager is that fairly yeah okay be approved thank you okay just something that a resident brought up sent me i'm sorry i couldn't hear you a resident sent me a request on ask the city manager getting a lot of questions lately oh man a proposal to to have no smoking on the beach and they're they're mainly talking about from 19th street north because that's all we've been forced and i know some beaches do have that she mentions somewhere i guess where they they have a home here in delaware we've installed cigarette containers in each of the beach accesses down at the north end of town and uh it would but i told right yeah it's i've wondered about the parks to use [Music] yeah see that it's very hard to very very hard of course that that would be like trying to catch a dog because the only one that could enforce it would be a deputy you know we can put signs of no smoking uh [Music] just like you [Music] yes i don't think though whoever called you to ask for it i mean we put up signs that they feel better if they got down there and every time i've got you know i'm not a smoker but i believe or not i have a little bit of empathy for smokers because they're not allowed to smoke any you know i mean it is a right to ruin their lungs in their lives if they want to i guess but i'm also not a big advocate of having ordinances or signs and then you just don't do anything about them you know sign signs everywhere signs um but you know i'm more concerned about the the uh the litter and i think that's the main i mean there's enough you yay all cigarette smoke a long way away but generally you can get away from it if there's one person's focus i don't mind moving a little bit it is bothering me um i just don't but what what bothers me and what you know if you're reading in the tampa bay news all this stuff about indian rocks it's all about the litter i didn't realize the cigarette butts they say is the largest single um item of litter they find on the beaches um so that's really the i think was this resident more concerned about literally breathing the smoke or the or the the litter yeah what she asked about was smoking you know because she's what she said to me and the question was we're from delaware and up there they have a little smoky prohibition on the beach okay and i i know there are some places i mean there's there's uh parks even in the tampa bay area that have a sign up the system is going to be and they're yeah yeah there are some but there again sometimes i think signs of kind of a bricks you know mentality you can spend a lot of money putting up a sign but if people read it or follow it or do they read what they want to bring and then the next question is okay so someone is is a police officer going to give them a ticket for smoking they could but probably not probably surprisingly so if some of the most beautiful beaches in the world than the saint bartles i've done the saint john they're pristine they don't have this discussion or problem right and i think some of it is in your heart if you're a smoker you know why would i damage this beautiful place what they've done instead of just take place up where you walk if there's an ashtray there's these really cool little uh beachy cut cans with a rope saying smoker just grab one put it back when you're done and they go to the beach and that smoker will go down with their chair but they've got a little can and that can come back up with them they should empty it and put the cam back up so they i think they addressed it in a different way instead of punitive it's whatever like you said go ahead and smoke your cigarettes but hey keep keep it clean and i think but it's one way okay you're wearing too much perfume you've got a peanut allergy if people are slobs they're going to litter it doesn't matter how many signs you put up it's all about who they and what they are what they believe so but the resident expressed it and you know you know it is something to think about i don't know how many people would be like just just right now if you took a vote for science and who would vote for putting the sun down would they would be available i don't know i think someone would not let the sun set no smoking on the beach don't bug rick no smoking on the beach no smoking on the beach and they're considering i would suggest maybe for the next meeting the work that bill and his room did has to do with the engineering report about possibly building layers building actually building another layer to the marina i think that was that was planned oh i'm sorry but yeah we wanted to make sure you got that information planning boards spent several meetings okay discussing that and that would probably be something there was just to give you a little bit of background there was a discussion about oh could we lease the marina to a restaurant and they built a second story restaurant there but the parking underneath it so so those were or put in another 19 slips which is a substantial amount of money to do for the future and we don't know if we could approve so you know i don't know if uh but those were suggestions that were made to decide that they did their thing um well first of all i think before i didn't go anywhere you'd have to find someone that had interest in yeah yeah i mean i don't know for a restaurant well i guess they might i don't know yeah frenchies in bel air all right so that's that's really it so those are things that you know um the city would probably have to create a rfp and put it out to the public and you know anybody that had any interest in it would give a proposal to the city kind of like a development thing so the city council has received that report right there so we don't have them yeah they they haven't done anything with this since then kind of all these reports came in and we had uh we had the charter review the planning financial and culture and then covered came yet we were on a real roll really yeah yeah so that's kind of where it's at in terms of other business kind of short circuit problems but um i think we at some point need to talk about what this park means i mean really some of these we had a grant that we would have had to it was a four hundred thousand dollar grant and the city would have had to match 200 and the grant would have put gazebo boardwalks new playground equipment tennis court was renovated so the city council opted not to match it we having a budget for next fiscal year the money to renovate the tennis courts which we will do that's in the capital budget and we have money to build a gazebo out here is that for weddings and foreign well unfortunately things changed they had a lot of remnants for a while but then the city council at the time this was before my time decided based on some recommendations that we're going to raise the rental price and it kind of dried up well when i came i told the city council the opposite you just because you have an incident that's part of part of doing business okay you know if you have a a restaurant that does or a catering haul and you have some people that do some damage okay that's in this that type of business it's going to happen you aren't going to get the perfect clientele all the time that's just life they didn't pay for it but and i don't really know how it came about what i've gathered is the staffing at the time said you know it's too much of a headache too much trouble and there was things every weekend and some saturday and sunday so they raised the rates um they squashed so now we were starting to pick it up um back up because we lowered the rates and did a little accommodations you know like you know we kind of created an hourly rate for short things like three or four hours and it was starting to pick up and you know with the park ramp we were figuring we'll get this gazebo we'll build at a reasonable size because we've got a prime location it's on the water for sure and you can you know you're going to get some extra rental out of that plus on top of that the residents would have if they want to have a picnic or something that had another opportunity to use it so that that that's was the plan and coleman came along and basically we we had some cancellations so we had to refund their money but we've had a couple of them that just said we're going to move it to next spring so you know they've delayed their enrollment reception or whatever it was and i i do think once this coating kind of gets along its way i think this will pick back up but i think you've got to invest in like something like this but those projects follow yeah the tennis court will go out uh probably next month after the budget's approved and uh kyle's already i think you've got the quotes right yeah yeah so to be considered for new business one of the initiatives before we went down the entertainment business uh in in the entertainment business um that i was excited about was looking at the parks we're fortunate that we have the public works department and kyle keeps on top of all that but one of the ideas was as as a committee to our as a board to go to the different beach accesses as well as the parks and look and just kind of see what the general condition of them to give them another set of eyes i mean kyle probably can close his eyes and see everyone and where every garbage can is and everything else but um as a resident and i've lived here 10 years i certainly haven't been to every park and i i didn't realize we had 13 with the three beach accessories so there's 10 i'm not even i have to really think about where they are that's something we probably i just would suggest that maybe this award we get together when the weather cools well i don't know whenever it's a convenient time and go out and we don't have to do it together we can do it individually and get together and compare notes you can each stuff you know get an address we could go to each of us could go what's that uh four parts basically just take notes and then come together and see if there's anything in the four parts i look at hey i noticed these and of our time that would help you get a little background on what we have and i'll also be more than happy to let you have not have but take this book because it's got all the notes in the last minutes and like the things the rental rates and all that this is kind of really up to date because i don't really i'm not going to refer to it between now and next week yeah and uh and that might be helpful to you to see kind of what we did and all the rest of that strategic plans in there all that type of stuff the single website has a nice section from parks and recreation it does it chose all of the parts beautiful pictures [Music] i was curious can you help me with this what determined over time what park uh was provided a couple pilings and a little pull-up document or not i you know that was done by you know the city staff was at the time yeah they were they would make recommendations or there was a dock there like i don't want eighth street the dock that's there was just refurbished it's been there since i've lived here so that's 22 years the one with the boat ramp they found it out though yeah yeah yeah so that that's another one on a bay shore that's really cool yeah so you know over time those i want to say those were probably 10 years ago you know they got somewhere between five and ten years ago they were they came in and replaced all the wood and the filings that they needed we've got some money that we're putting in to resurface the boat ramp at 7th street uh because if the concrete's practically and we did look into a voting grant for that but unfortunately we would never score enough points to even get close to the bottom of the list mainly because you don't have any parking there i'm wondering about that right yeah and really we don't want parking we don't want parking there and we do have a problem with uh residents using it and you know i get complaints about that occasionally but we've got a stormwater project where it's out to bid right now we're going to go through where the actual ramp drive is that's where we're going to put the storm water pipe so that area is going to be kind of tore up okay and we have looked to talk to a couple contractors about redoing the concrete on the ramp but they haven't really given us well bill would stop powering his boat up on the trailer here at the program without that problem i don't know what a lift on another video he just drives his boat up here yeah so i was purposeful on that question um you know as i'm listening and i didn't really realize that part in my report kind of goes through these couple of year phases on entertainment and then yeah you know that was this grand theft auto saddens me a little bit but it is what it is so i mean it's your opportunity and i think one of the things that goes through my mind is and i always find this true not necessarily with the parks but especially the marina what is the long-term vision you know what are we really trying to get to so we can talk about the fact that a slip runner buys a lift and then has to get rid of it what are our rates compared to what what do we really want down there and some of it's determined by the parking lot what we have to have or not and the same thing applies to our parks which i don't think there's one that doesn't look beautiful right now but that might be based on that foundation of really scrolling it out as a group it might not even be your tenure that it happens in but set the next five times yeah what does it look like what are we really going for versus the incremental decisions and linda brought a drawer of consulting fees all right we did these plans we have these drawings we did you know where are we really going well that's when i read this deck and i was like i'm not really sure what the aim is what's the goal like we have all this information where are we trying to get with it so i didn't know if like we were truly trying to make more money if we were trying to open a restaurant i mean obviously that we're bringing more money and then how much money are we trying to get to like if we feel like we need to find an additional ten thousand dollars in revenue and then this or whatever the numbers looks like like how are we going together so it kind of sounds like what you're asking for and that's what i was learning when i wrote this picture i was like i didn't couldn't quite figure out what the name was if we were trying to make it more like one of the marinas that offers bathrooms and security and this and that and the other to make more money or a new one is simple and it's working right you know it's not working let's not fix it but like where can we do something else with that huge parking lot like it was empty today i rode my bike down there because i wanted to have like a vision i'm tripping by the one time that i wanted like close-up vision on my bike what like all of this stuff looked like and like looking at the pictures of people now because of when it said no security i didn't realize it was a nice pencil that you know gated so that was more than i thought it had so i didn't know if that meant a secure yard or cameras or like i wasn't sure if we were trying to get like one of these arguments that were better equipped or if he was kind of like what we're saying so that kind of that answered my question because i didn't really realize that that's what we were doing was just voting on those or we were like looking at this major project well a little bit of the background i was the chairman of the finance advisory committee presidential and if you look there's a report there on the website take a look at that because that's what we were asked to do and the planning of zoning board did a whole bunch of work so a lot of that work has been done and i think it's fair to say it's current but that's not fair so i think this just my suggestion is at this point maybe if you want to go online tammy and get those 13th marks and just send us an email via patty and say rick take thump bump george and go with an open mind and just like take a review of them and see what what our reaction is and that might be one of the agenda items for because you're going to find when you read through this material planning the zoning board minus all this was done and it was just done so we we're kind of here at an enviable point here where we can really focus on parks and rec and trying to make what we have in the city better better maintained for the residents we don't we won't go up any rabbit trails on festivals and things like that we're just going to stay on what we're doing oh because i like some of these places i've never i don't think i've seen like right along where i kayak i can see you know seventh through eighth street all in one but like if you go london yeah bridge i know nothing like i haven't i'm scared i can't get into the vehicle mine probably the same way i've lived here for ten years i haven't seen all the parks sitting and watching the landscape or something like that but how can we enhance them for making better like do they have is there need for electricity we need water or is that just no we don't need that we don't like that looking toward the future you want to improve something what's the goal well like saying that like on 2nd street there's like a fish station but there's no water so honestly that's disgusting and i know like you know [Music] um um so anyway that's something when you're there consider utilities because in the board that george was a part of and you'll see it in here they were consumed for i don't know how long probably two years putting together this plan it was very extensive but when the grant was was not approved by council that so that's water in the bridge now so now also the maintenance plan is also in there i think from the financial advisory board so you can see when the different work is scheduled to be done um that would be helpful to you too but i think now is our time to really focus on parks and records i think we're supposed to know just something we have four beach i call the the three easements we have four speech accesses they're just walking past off the belt boulevard and if you drive or drive down to a pool bar some places you'll see some bicycle racks and things like that we got a fifty thousand dollar grant from nellis county did the project and the city's gonna put 15 in it also we're going to replace all those boardwalks over the dudes that go out on the beach as well so we got bananas counting and sharing the cost that's awesome a lot of good stuff going on the issue with the beach is is that anything we do with them we have to get approval from technical events you know if we did our approval there we're supposed to ask them and i'm going to tell you 18 years ago the park board put oak trees in there and they had to take them out in the leaves and if you go to this park they're inundated with oak trees because that's where they went so so in essence uh we moved those trees to to here and now we have like monster forests of trees that are all connected together and that's where they came from yeah they the park board uh or the city did yeah from uh and they put them in without approval really nice camping but realistically there's too many trees in that park [Music] area i think we it was like 12 of our remember they you know you're just planting trees i guess so if i determine i think it's your time to make your motion unless i make a motion i seconded"
