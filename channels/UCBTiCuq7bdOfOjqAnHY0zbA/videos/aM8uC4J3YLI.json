Liberty Justice for All Renee would you please call the role council member Frank bankard present council member Lloyd Roberts here council member Kim Shaw Elliot present mayor Dave gtis here city manager Kyle reefer here and City attorney Randy MOA pres thank you Renee all right we'll get right to it this is the city of Belair Beach Municipal Code review and uh I'm gon to I'm going to uh pass the uh the agenda over to city manager Rafer thank you mayor uh we have our consultant here tonight Lou sna and he's going to get us started we have four chapters to review tonight and we're starting with chapter 10 good evening everyone glad to see you again uh we'll we'll uh try to keep this light as possible uh given the subject matter but um hopefully you'll enjoy it and have some comments um there we go so these are the four chapters we'll be looking at uh tonight um chapter 10 22 30 and 50 uh been working with the manager on uh dividing up the other sections of the code uh tonight's um given our experience um in writing and implementing code uh and also with uh issuing permits we're probably not as familiar with these sections of the code sorry about that as uh as others uh but we're going to uh rely on a lot of your comments for these sections uh we did go through we did check and make sure CR references were correct uh made sure State references were correct uh we did read it to also make sure that uh it may sense that we were able to understand it so what I'd like to do is really just walk through the sections we're not going to go line by line um because that would take all night but go by article by article in the sections and find out if anybody's had any comments and uh I can give you the comments uh that that we have um the first section first article that we're looking at is uh this is uh chapter 10 uh building and building regul ations uh it includes the sections on your on the screen in front of you uh we noted section 10.3 the Coastal Construction Control line uh might that might be a section to move into uh what's called the land development code or at least cross reference it because that's something that uh is commonly uh referenced or commonly looked at when you're developing uh are there any comments on these sections or anything you'd like to discuss just one question what what you what you provided us is the exact same thing in the immunity code right now right there is no changes there's because I was looking for Red Lines no I'm thinking and I didn't want to dissect it but I'm thinking what are we doing just re visioning the code right thank you I had the same comment so so this is existing code this is existing code yes yeah we will provide strike through and underline really what we want to do is find out if you had any comments that we could address uh any based on your experiences and you'll see as we go through but we have not provided any any uh red lines or anything I'm just going to read to you you know like I said with chap with Section 10.3 uh our recommendation is to to move that or cross reference it in the Land Development code Mr Roberts yeah I was just goingon to say I think it might be helpful to all of us I I went through it uh but if during the meetings that you had with Kyle if you guys identified some things that you thought needed to be looked at more mostly and Randy as well with his experience from a legal perspective if we can discuss those specific things for sure and then anything else that we may have as a group found and had a question about add that to it but I think a good start would be the items and areas that you guys identified and Kyle's experience with hey I've had some issues with this particular area with citizens or whatever the case may be and possibly we need to address that change the language and to subtract whatever he and we did and that that's sort of what we were planning I I did identify those sections that Kyle and I discussed and and things that we discussed I wasn't sure if uh you all had anything in addition based on comments with the public or or experience so uh yeah what I'll do is I'll just walk through these sections quickly and I I'll point out the sections uh that we that we found things on uh includ and Kyle if I missed anything uh through these sections uh let me know um and like I said I think we're going to get more into that when we get into the other sections of the code the Land Development code especially zoning and things like that uh and signs and things like that but these sections probably not as much as the others before you get started with that um council member Elliott did you have something oh a similar similar feedback I was wondering what what might I be able to research as add new to the council so what might I be able to research to identify where there have been issues that were points of discussion from the citizens where how can I find where the rub points were um we provided the uh the list of variances we've had in the past couple years um since we're on chapter 10 one of the biggest ones that we kept having over and over again is the height of a swimming pool so um that's a definite one that I'd like to hit I'm I'm sure we could get comments too from the uh Board of adjustment members okay all right but as of yet we do not have a compiled list that has been brought to your attention through um either Planning and Zoning or the board of adjustments anything like that no okay so the council is starting with a blank slate yes okay all right yeah and if it helps we're going to we're going to prepare an analysis of the code and and and issues that we've identified based on our experience but uh at this point we're just trying to find out issues that we're not familiar with uh based on your experience okay so yeah I I'll go quickly through these and stop unless you have anything or I can identify where we found comments but uh really these are just the sections that we've identified and and nothing in these sections here under under article two building code so far so I did have a question about building code um it's been I've actually had two people uh they're both developers uh question the U twostory rule in a 35 foot building um I thought it was best to bring it up because uh I'm going to lay out a scenario that's happening you are allowed to build two stories um either one story is next to your garage and and the other story is above your garage uh the other scenario is you build a garage and then you can build two stories above your garage well I think what seems to be happening is people are building a garage or two garages and then there's non-liable space down below and then they build their allow two stories um eventually they fill in that non-liable space and um I I don't I'm not really sure why the rule is the way that it is but uh I'm coming to the council to find out if this is something we should even consider looking at or if there was a reason for this why why this rule is in place I understand if you're below base flood elevation uh that that would be a problem but if your first story uh that's adjacent to the garage is above base flood elevation and you could successfully build three stories in the same 35 foot box um what would what's the purpose of doing that and why would we not want to have taxable living space well under the nfip if you try to convert bottom floor they'll drop they'll drop your policy they could infringe penalties on the whole Township I understand that but they still build in yeah I understand it but I mean um if you ask anybody about it they're going to tell you no we didn't build it you know what I'm saying it's going to be a lot of like smoken mirrors you know well that's my question we know that that the majority of of homeowners are eventually going to do something with that property and so my question is is if they can successfully build a first floor next to their garage below the second and third story what what would prevent us from stopping them from doing that well if you didn't if you don't have a mortgage on your property nothing no I'm just talking about new bills yeah anyone on the uh the board out there any comments on that just see violated all over the city they're all just like you said yeah but the thing is if you don't have a mortgage and you still you still have to follow our building codes absolutely but like like the mayor says they do then migrate downstairs and make it in a total living space now if you get washed out you get washed out I don't think that's your concern your concern is you want to be able to tax I I would say that if they're able to build anything above Bas flood elevation yet not go higher than 35 ft our code restricts uh Builders to uh why would we not want to have more living space in that home uh that's not taking up any more space for setbacks or height or anything else and then you've got more taxable Revenue coming in on that home what's what's the low what's the highest uh base elevation here base foot elevation on the maps currently yeah and is actually 10 yeah used to be higher but it's 10 yeah oh right on the air Co so that would be above there yeah yeah that's that's that's why I'm asking the question yes you guys either one you 25 no now I will say that that um that changing a rule like this would would make possible for a house that was recently um Turned Down by the board of adjustments because it's absolutely you're not allowed to get a variance on that particular type of build uh so there are certain homes that may be waiting in the wings to have this done and that may be why a developer has approached me on this but um I I still don't understand why the why the rule is there yes sir I tell you what can you stand up can't hear you very well I don't really know I don't I don't have the answer to that no so what is the process right now so if I if I have a vacant lot lot and I'm going to build and I've got plans and specs to that do I have to get the city's approval first before it goes to the county yes so they give it to you guys and somebody within our organization or somebody who we Outsource to so if it's a new build um our city engineer will review it okay yeah and then so he reviews it based on our codes yes so he would know all of that the 35 foot oh yeah height and all that kind of stuff okay and the 10 foot elevation minimum for FEA right well it depends on where you're at well yeah five feet then you have to go five feet up yes so you got the base elevation whatever the map says currently and then you have a foot or freeboard um adopted from the state then did we contact the County or does the owner take all that information once we've checked the boxes and said we're good then takes that we review it we stamp it and then they take it to the county and put it in their portal got it yeah does anyone see any um drawbacks downfalls uh of of changing this rule uh or does anyone see any advantages to it I'd like to know what everyone thinks well are we restricting people from building and using their land and could we get hit with an inverse condemnation suit you know the Fifth Amendment property you know the question well that I'm going through it right now but I'm saying uh property owners have a lot of rights with their land you know and that's why you have Varan hearing today excellent question remember Banker the question posed was do we run the risk of facing some kind of inverse condemnation claim as as we restrict the Land Development code I will tell you first that as we Endeavor on this process it's an important it's worth noting right now before we begin that this is a process first and foremost and one of those one of the limitations on this process that you may recall was during the 2023 legislative or 2022 legislative session I'm trying to remember the date sorry 2023 legislative session a bill was adopted that um restricted development and or sorry restricted local governments from regulating Land Development a way that was more burdensome or restrictive within a 100 miles of landfall from where hurricane Ian and another hurricane that hit the East Coast hit we cannot presently adopt any restrict any Land Development regulation that is more burdensome or restrictive that has a sunset provision in October of this year so part of this is working up work product that may not be adopted until after October so I first want to say that as a good entree to what to expect as we Endeavor on this process I will be working with that's one thing we will have to be mindful of um we will have to consider whether particular restrictions depending on what you um what you adopt if they are consistent with your comprehensive plan if they are already memorialized in your comprehensive plan for example then we we Face less legal liability as a claim that somebody could not have reasonably expected that to be regulated as it is already regulated for example um an inverse condemnation claim is interesting because it's it's the claim is that you've fully devalued my use yeah the the which is a harder showing to make the I think the more challenging um statutory scheme that we will have to be mindful of is found in Florida statute section 70 de 001 which is the bird Harris act we've talked about around it in the past the bird Harris Act is a unique uh creature of Florida statutory law different from inverse condemnation where you say you have not done a complete taking but by your government regulation by your action you have diminished my reasonable investment backed expectation for the use of my property that is a very fact and legal intensive analysis that will have to be taken on a case-by Case basis anytime we adopt anything that's more restrictive or burdensome you face the possibility of legal claims that somebody says wait a second part of that's going to come in into where were they in that process if you had high in the sky ideas of building a castle at your property but you've never hired an architect you've never submitted a plan you've never manifested any real intention it's a lot harder for you to claim that than hey I was halfway through the development process you the most successful um ber Harris act case for example involved a concrete batch plant where they were planning to get a concrete batch plant they were halfway through the process and then the commission said you know what no concrete batch plants um so that sort of thing is obviously easier to perfect but I will tell you I'm as we I want to get ahead of this question because I think it's a Salient question that's going to be a through line through a lot of this discourse I'm never going to be in a position to tell you we can adopt this without an inverse condemnation claim or a Bert Harris claim because nothing's an issue until somebody makes it an issue um and then we'll have to take it up on the on the merits of that but anytime you restrict people's land use rights you face the possibility of a legal claim and then it just gets down to what are the merits of those claims no and I'm glad the mayor brought this up about living spaces and all like that because I think you could get jackpotted like you said would the city then the city could get sued personally right if we restricted their well yeah the suit would not lie against the Commissioners the suit suit for Li against commission I would lie against the City generally but again we would have to look at what expectation did they have that this would not be regulated and if you're regulating in a way that is consistent for example you change your code in a manner that is consistent with the way it's always been administered but you we never really changed the code we clarified it and this is consistent with a demonstrable history of enforcing and administering it in this way then maybe you have a better argument than you used to be able to build two floors and now we say you can't build higher than 15 feet for example that's a lot more explicit and I didn't know we had a base flood elevation certain parts of this area of 10 feet and I I just didn't and and Florida the one other part that we're seeing in a lot of coastal communities and and you're seeing this through short-term rental and other and other legal concerns when we talk about base flood elevation regulations and FEMA restrictions those are federal restrictions we don't have the ability to just ignore those uh the challenge becomes for local government what is your plan of Entry to learn about investigate and prove that there is in fact violation one of the reasons you hear that discourse a lot more in short-term rental restrictions and and systems is because those regimes give in local governments an opportunity to inspect properties get in people's garages and the like but if somebody keeps their garage clo all the time and we we suspect maybe there's bunk beds or something there but we never really know and all the neighbors say well everybody knows it but the city doesn't really have a point of entry to to to establish it and that's where some of that disconnect comes between the community awareness versus the local government's regulation or enforcement of it um so it is important to note that disconnect between the alleged Collective Consciousness versus what do we have actual records to prove Because unless somebody for example submits to permitting Kyle staff doesn't know you know what I did in my house unless I invite them in somehow so how is Kyle staff to enforce if I never let anybody in and turn one bedroom into three uh so those are the sort of challenges we we face on the administration of that enforcement okay all right I know it's a tangent but I think those are those are important legal Concepts that we need to address now before we do a whole LDC over overview thank you Randy and I think Dave what you were suggesting doesn't sound like anything that's being more restrictive no no LCT 5T right and and effectively if I understand it correctly we just say we would have three stories it doesn't matter if the first story is a garage or a bedroom it would be 35 feet three stories and more Revenue right right because square footage of living space would be more and from the outside uh I've seen two identical homes one is living space one is not living space but if you look at the pictures on the outside it's exactly the same building uh the only difference is is that they finished the inside by permit the way that they're supposed to and now they're being taxed for that that extra square footage where they weren't uh with the I did it myself while no one was looking so anyway that's I don't I'm not sure exactly where that is uh I I was looking it up earlier and and I haven't found it yet but I wanted to bring that up so our current code if somebody had a garage and then two stores above it and then they came three years later and said hey we want to finish that garage and they applied for a permit and a review by the city would we okay that as as our current we couldn't we couldn't yeah so how did they do that you said they permitted the no no no no what I'm saying is in the future if if we we decide as as a group that we're going to move forward with this and and allow the third story to be Story number one correct then they could effectively apply for a permit and finish their inside because I think current code requires them to have Breakaway walls and and all of this good stuff for flooding that doesn't even exist because it's above Bas flood elevation is that correct it really depends house to house if you're we'd have to check if they're proposing that they have a third livable floor we'd have to check that that is above the design flood elevation right so if it was um and the only thing restricting it right now is that height code um in section 94 or chapter 94 um that says either two adjacent or two above so it's been interpreted as one or the other if you were to change it it would be less restrictive but they'd still have to meet all the flood code regulations and that was uh that was really the the only only um item that I had that I thought was just okay maybe we should look into this anyone else are we talking about the entire uh section here the entire article or excuse me chapter 10 because I have a couple please go right ahead um here's a little knit on Section 1040 second line at the end says uh to issue permits to reply on inspections is set is that intended to be that to reply on inspections that's 40 oh never mind I'm reading it better now but it makes sense no um um one issue that we probably want to be aware of and you may have some ideas about this later uh but section 1077 uh deals with the materials that are appropriate for off street parking spaces I there's a lot of discussion as to whether shell is appropriate is it not you know is not kind of I know it's not um should it be their their uh Turf block what is that I mean there's there might be some questions there that we want to be aware of as we look at this see some of those questions uh probably some of the reasons why we don't allow those types of of driveways is because whenever the water rises things tend to float and move around and go everywhere clog the drains can I jump on that what you just said because you were talking about bark after Dal yes um is there something that's going to be put in there regarding this yes that was something else we wanted to bring up I know that that a lot of this is uh it we can't enable until after is it October Andy is that what you said uh yes presently unless the legislature somehow extends that process during the current session the sunset period for that um moratorium if you will is through October 2024 two years from the September 28th uh 20 2022 landfall of Ian don't be surprised if they I and and they may not do it in the way that you expect they'll find they may find some other language so um we're having the session concludes on March 8th uh so we're having to closely Monitor and see what comes out and there's a possibility especially in the last three days where rules get suspended that um something may pivot so um absence some kind of legislative extension the the the prohibition against Land Development regulations that are more restrictive or burdensome extends through October 2024 okay and I think that that falls under a law on maintenance so whenever we get to that section we'll definitely bring that up thank you for reminding me Mr Banker well K's looking through that I just noticed a few times or more than a few times the terminology that was used was talking about um occupied residential and non-residential buildings so help me understand so what nonresidential buildings by definition do we currently deal with I guess just the uh in institutional the city hall and the public works okay that's the only non-residential that's what I thought so there anything that's on anything else even though they're quote condos obviously they're residential multif family yeah or single family yeah Okay and like the the building across from me that says Motel on it by our definition is not a motel right it is a it is a residential it's residential medium one residential media okay good so it is appropriate for us to have the terminology non-residential buildings because we do have City Hall we have the book of Works building which would qualify for that I would think so I'm not Mak sense the only thing I got in this whole section is and I brought this up before is 102 the start time of 7 AM um you don't see too many landscapers at that time but by driving pile uh you got a lot of you got a lot of retirees you know you don't have a Vulcan Hammer here a lot of times but just the the monkey in the and the wedge hitting it um shakes up the neighborhood a little bit I don't know if that would be better to move to 8 o'clock or 7:30 I don't know why but I know I don't have a la service now but when I um receive the one that the person I purchased the house for he had one already set up so we kept it and they would come out and park in front of the house at 7:30 but they would never start mowing until 8 you see don't know if they knew I'm sure all us seen a lot of them well past six o'clock in the summer cutting ons because we're supposed to shut down at right right but I think more people would like the hour moved you know what I'm saying I don't know if if you're getting complaints or I I just get we get complaints every time they're driving piles but that could be in the middle of the day yeah yeah true um I don't know I I the guys that I've dealt with since I've moved here they they won't start at seven they'll wait till eight just because they don't want to be obnoxious and there's a big sign on their truck it says who they are and and uh you make your neighbor mad they'll never use them so um I don't I don't know how much of a problem starting at 7 AM is for the community as a whole but I don't I don't really have a problem with it Council yeah just seems like we got to give people some leeway and how they manage their Crews and not that much of a problem and people seem to be polite anyway why change this Mr Kelly um what time do you start you make noise at 7 usually wait 70 7:30 set okay see the the problem is you're from the construction world like I am you got a crew and this is what wheny my my old neighbor when they were doing our street that the crew would show up at 6:30 and start drinking coffee screaming and [Music] yelling it's all to all yes yes absolutely yeah I want to correct my my complaint there was all outside yes so is that something we want to that we want to consider changing the 6:00 pm to 7: am. quiet time do we want to adjust it we can take an informal vote on it uh who wants to change it who wants to let's say who wants to leave it I think I'm fine with leaving it it doesn't I'm just if you're fine with the mayor I'm fine with just telling you what people are asking I know I know I I I think no matter what they're going to ask what he says they're going to say 11 11:00 a.m. they're you know people managing their Crews I mean it could be like it's excessively hot let's get out there early absolutely safety of the workers you put the roof on yeah or you know we're running a little bit High let's get this going I think they should have that kind of flexibility I have two little knits uh page 29 of 30 and sub paragraph three the last line swimming pool decking and ring wall shall not be there included in the completion of setbacks just a single word 29 and 30 said 29 of 30 this is about the fence or wall paragraph three swimming pools okay the last line shall not be included oh yeah a typo and little knit is um the discussion about swim out seats so as I understand and I don't know what a swim out seat is but it seems like it's I guess it's a projection from the pool walls to accommodate steps of getting in and out the pool his soon and my question is uh does that mean that the area around the swim out meets the same criteria as the rest of the pool otherwise it seems like that would be a weakness if the swim out is in exceptions does that make any sense it's not so the f are you talking like five feet from the any structural component yeah yes yeah so it's has to be 5 feet away so that's part of the pool okay good thank you we have anything else and um chapter 10 um I have time limits um me jump to it it's uh 10:33 and currently we have every permit on an 18month time limit from the date of issue with a possible six-month extension granted by the city manager um I feel that certain remodels or things like swimming pools smaller projects don't need that long to finish to finish yeah so what you would do is would have for these types of projects you have say six months for these types of projects you have 12 right something that well I guess um maybe put your thoughts in writing and Sen to the council and and we'll we'll discuss it in the next meeting then unless you already have something in mind no I'll work with Louie on some times based on what he's seen yeah I I could see that happening um when we bought our house on 20th Street the owner said that his pool was being constructed at the same time same uh construction company as the $16 million house which is basically a water park you know on on go Boulevard so the Cru would come and work on his for a day or two and then be gone for two weeks working on the big projects and coming back and working on here so they probably use that fulltime because they were doing it that way but I don't think it should take them I don't think they should be doing that that you know they should be held to a shorter acceptable time frame but as Ry was saying that may fall into the definition of that's more restrictive and we may have to wait we have to wait but I think it's reasonable well if the design of the pool is like really architectural where you got some slopes and all like that do you need that a week to set up you know what I'm saying before think could probably answer sure he was saying that one neighbor had a pool they would do work and then leave for a week and I was saying depending on the design of the pool they may need that time for the concrete to set or whatever yeah where they could 2 M just like L said they disappear backs is right should be done finished six months Max got one having uh restrictive code like that would actually protect the uh the homeowner definitely I think it it would be a huge benefit but it also may have an adverse effect we already um there's certain markets that people don't want to come and do business in belir Beach because we're a pain in the butt sometimes so um just be mindful of that also we don't we don't want to make it where we can't get anyone to do anything so so true yeah okay yes sir it goes hand in hands police it's all about enfor as far as our time go time to start I build on same we can't do anything set till 7:30 we set up we wait because the cops are there to write us up we start 7:30 if the cops enforce it you're going to have the contract more period thank you for that comment any other comments in chapter 10 on chapter 10 going once twice if I could come back to um I think 10- 174 was the uh the height issue height of a swimming pool and my understanding this was an issue that was addressed through uh has been addressed through variances so I thought this might be uh something the uh Council would like to discuss I'm not sure what the issues were exactly um but I did Circle 10- 174 paragraph G Mr would you like to address that um yes um I would actually refer to Mike Kelly on this one because he builds pools for a living he has a lot of ideas as he was here when they actually were working on this code to begin with 2014 2016 um it was a dispute of How High the pools could be built relative to the grave in the y definition of grave is what started this whole Council finally passive it that we can't can't be any higher 18 in above and there are so many houses not just new so existing especially where just doesn't work so every one had to come before the VAR board or 5 in or sometimes twoot variance based on what the Flor elevation is in the house it was it was very contentious when it was passed our current engineer was the engineer with another firm went he and I both argued that 18 in above the road is to restrict got to be higher 24 30 36 because people aren going to be able to to build so we look at it as as a board saying needs a rewr needs to be a complete re and maybe the the road really should that's counil to consider maybe that shouldn't even be a factor Ground Road does play a factor in garages right yes 24 in for a garage floor above ground what relevance is is it the pools you know every new pool the last two years has had be before our board to be built and just it needs to be either go much higher than the 18 council member Elliot what what is the risk of having a higher pool I'm gonna um if it's okay with a council I'm gonna call on um used to be vice mayor Shirley I believe that there was something to do with the elevation that kept coming up with you and it may be a different opinion Mr Kelly has can you re refresh my memory everything um there were several and our down it's not a six foot but I think that was part of why this became an issue we've got a couple of houses on our corner where they have six foot wall and the ass council at that time opposed to that they did not like that driveway sled up and wall was six foot they see two houses right they they didn't like it so that's why that's how this came about I'm uh there's got to be right I don't completely disagree with them I see a six footall you know looking on to the S home I I don't disagree with that but there's got to sitting below andow the entire I think we have problemes on C planning when it comes to drainage ands not enough inform I thank you Mr B the thing that come up a few times in my neighborhood you've got a pool that's above and they look down that that priv said the walls between homes again we going to have to look another safety ISS glass railing something like railing keep falling off thank you are we talking adjacent grade crown on the road or adjacent grade to the property because there's big differences here when you measure so you're taking the crown is that in the code the ground of the road yeah okay it's not the adjacent grade of the road right not be and if you're building up your fortifying your property U then your pool is actually below grade I see I see where you're going with this right it's all related to water drainage off your lot right so you build a the house too high how keep yeah and some of these are built up so so high that there's a big ditch between them a giant Ravine don't say you can't D water right that's in we look at that for every VAR to say what what is the elevation of this proposed pool going to do to the neighbor yeah I I this is something that I'm really not all that familiar with I know what my one neighbor or not really neighbor but on my street she took like eight inches of water in a diet and I helped her sandbag her house young girl but her pool is actually about two feet above her sliding doors which is 10 ft from the pool so the water comes in off the pool goes right into the sliding doors now there's a drain there and I'm thinking like who the hell architect this or engineered this you know and I told her to pump that pool way out she only took like six inches out so she got the rest of it in the house but um yeah well yes sir another problem that comes in home built landscap and they'll build up that property ier every time we have a Del right so I guess the question is if we alter the pool code are we creating more problems somewhere else or should we consider actually hiring an an architectural engineer that can look at our code and make the best suggestion uh and I'm sure it's going to be different for each neighborhood it wouldn't be just like we yeah we we've been taking notes and uh there is a separate drainage section and you're right it's all interrelated and uh I'm not a I'm not a an engineer an architect but I can uh I have access to those resources that we can look at so did you feel the fingers pointing at you just yeah absolutely we've been uh we've been taking notes and and uh yeah it it is it is a complicated issue and it is related to the drainage section as well which we will be gone over separately but um yeah I'd like to have somebody who's uh knowledgeable in these issues to to look at it on my behalf uh I'd like information on the variances as well if if someone could send me those and yeah we we'd be glad to provide some recommendations do you have engineering resources we do we do we're an engineering firm with planners would it be uh too much to ask Mr Kelly to maybe Redline this and reward Smith it a little bit I mean this is his livelihood I mean I I don't mean to throw it on your lap but I mean you probably could come up with a better answer to all this than all of us that's what I'm personally saying you yeah we're going to still use the CR of the road I'm saying we got to take that 18 well that's why I'm asking you maybe if you could Redline this thing and we SMI it in there what's what's your average right now whenever you're doing a variance what are we talking about in six in Tony's was 14 in that's the most I think we had in two years well we had the one that was a room model that was well over but we you could see that there was no effect on the neighboring property they had a lot of land in the correct drainage and their pool was already at that level minimum got think yourself if we're is higher than 24 prob 30 or 36 want me to put that down I will we think if you go to that 36 Plateau you shouldn't see many in many variances the one the just talking about REM where the house buil up so high buil up so high there no relevance and you're suggest you're suggesting 36 inches I think we should take him up on his offer before he changes his mind I just the one thing that I don't want to do is accidentally create more problems and I think that there needs to be some sort of a check valve on more of a sanity check of of maybe anything above 18 maybe you should have some kind of a survey done that's that somebody certifies that this is not going to impact your neighbors uh that's that's a suggestion uh wait wait Jody Shirley that's but I think that as part of construction you should be requ to put down the problem problem I I can tell you we are allowing too much are I have neighbor thank you don't don't we need to do then something I agree with what you just said something with flood plane management then I mean uh well we you've heard plenty tonight and uh maybe what you should do is take everything that you've heard and come back with something that uh that can be presented to us and uh maybe every every piece of code that's impact by these changes we just get but maybe we have another a second look obviously you're going to have talented individuals looking at it with you but uh they may actually want to come down and ride the ride our neighborhoods and see if this code was applied here on this construction how would it impact the neighbors we'll take a look and I know there are drainage regulations in the city and um maybe they're not being enforced when uh through the process so uh that that might be another issue but we'll we'll look at these okay definitely been scribbling notes yes sir that's a very good point that's that that's true um and maybe there needs to be unfortunately it's it's more restrictive but there probably needs to the code that uh that once it's built you you can't just elevate your property uh on a whim it maybe it requires permitting there's no permitting landscape anything you're talking about landscapers after the pro project is done you're not talking about the the finish grade of the land for landscaping because that has a soap plan on it [Music] okay I'm thinking that you're when the pool's being built you have a site plan where it says this this is the elevation and that okay that's follow okay and the come right all right right all right and and as a function of just in part Administration but also the legal side of this I understand that the lawyer role is in the common Parliament to be the naysayer I want to issue spot for you and identify you are a small municipality um you you do have very capable people and I mean that truly that knowing your team here you also have limited resources your budget being a statement of your priorities and where you put your resources that that's one thing but as you talk about additional permitting requirements additional inspection requirements you're creating bureaucracy that's going to require resources that you may not presently have that doesn't mean you can't establish them or put funding behind additional permitting tax additional and understanding that a lot of that's been outsourced to the county and what how much support are you getting in that Administration but I just the the sometimes the disconnect that can happen between what our regulations say and then how they get administered and and you know you've got your your your law enforcement is contracted out your Building Services are contracted out you do have people in the here and now but just understanding that limitation I think it's worthwhile as you consider how robust you wish to make your regulatory framework thank you Mr Moore anything else on chapter 10 all right so let's move on to chapter 22 uh it's probably not going to take as long but uh after 22 we'll take a bathroom break and then uh and then we'll get back on the the 30 and 50 all right chapter 22 is environment it's not environment in the in the sense of of the natural environment uh this article deals with nuisances uh I think one of the issues that we discussed uh that kyin I discussed was um section 2233 prohibited conditions decare Declaration of a nuisance um number 24 under that section is children's toys uh adding to that section uh exempting basketball hoops so those are not uh considered a nuisance when you set up a basketball hoop in your yard well they are at 4 in the morning oh yeah yeah this deals with things like children's toys bicycle skateboards garbage cans tools or any other portable items that are not part of the natural landscape shall not be left on the owner's property and visible from the street uh longer than longer than for 24 hours so you know bicycles skateboards uh do the question is I guess these movable basketball hoops do you want to exempt those uh is that an issue if I've if I'm understanding this correctly Council yes you're talking about the type of basketball hoop that the base basically is full of sand and yes that's my understanding that's concreted in the ground yes because this this would fall under the uh other portable items uh so yeah I I know personally I've had a couple of those from my grandchildren but that's not something you want to move yeah it's very heavy even though it's quote portable so I I would agree with exempting that all right because it's not typically left randomly be like if you had a two-car garage would typically be right between the two garages something like that so it looks symmetrical and it's not unattractive un council member Elliot you had a comment I now I have mixed feelings about this because when I heard this it's saying portable items basketball hoop I'm thinking Fisher Price yeah and and people leave them sitting out for a long time and I don't want to see that that put those toys away so um and then the portable Hoops they deteriorate more I mean I guess people have a choice as to whether they want to fix one permanently or whether they want to have one portable and if it's portable move it perhaps I think the only problem with the portable ones that I have is the fact that uh whenever we have storms they are a hazard yeah yeah I didn't think that um we have to define the term portable I need to Define it with regards to the height of the basketball Boot and and the weight I seen and used the bottom is plastic of some type and then the actual pole is a normal metal basketball pole it's almost like you usually have two wheels in the back where you can tilt the pole yeah yeah and you fill the fill the Middle with water whatever sand sand yeah sand and water combo is theoretically supposed to be the heaviest but yeah something important if you put one together it's going to stay there until you're tired of it that's just it no one's going to move those things around and park them I'd like to see how you're gonna get sand and water out of that thing busting it up so uh the basketball hoops everybody good with that yes no I'm good with it we would need to Define it because as Kim said so if it's something that's three feet tall in ways 15 pounds and it's just laying in the yard that should be moved right so we could give it some definition regarding the height and the weight and the reason I brought it up is because it's just a decision point I drive around I see basketball hoops to to meet toys we say you can't have toys in but then you see the ones that the guy put 10 cinder blocks on top of it yeah I'm not around here I don't see it but if you drive around look around you know just on top of the base top of the base or the old couch yeah I have noticed in that same area section 22-33 um subsection 4 any condition that provides harbage for rats mice snakes other Vermin and PS Etc I've had a couple of neighbors complain about other neighbors where they had fruit trees and we have along with the fruit trees the fruit rats so some of those homes are only occupied 6 months a year and 4,000 mangoes fall off on the ground and then all the rats come as a result of that so that when I read that that's what I thought of I talked to my neighbor now he's there all the time and he loves fruit trees which is wonderful he gives me fruit all the time from his fruit trees but several months ago he was overtaken by fruit rats first time I saw one going across my fist I thought it was a squirrel um next I found one inside my grill when I opened the cover of the grill and he just was right there so that was exciting but um he put traps out didn't want to poison them so he put the oldfashioned traps and he killed 18 in two days wow in his garage so they can reproduce quickly and if they get up in your attic no it certainly is a problem could I bring the black snakes down to your neighborhood and and and council member I don't think you were suggesting to do so I just want to be uh cautious about legislating around our natural habitat um I have seen attempts at doing so in other communities it's it's perilous and frankly impossible in some respects certainly nuisance properties overgrowth um on you know those sorts of things are dealt with um one thing we'll have to be mindful of in a general sense again another legal concern um as we talk about these different restrictions or or regulations better stated um is our equal protection Notions of of making sure we're we're evenly treating Property Owners sure um it's very hard when you start trying and and I'm not suggesting you were saying this but there is a Temptation when you do things like this of making a distinction between well a yearr round resident can do this but a resident who's here six months has to do that and that becomes very difficult to if not impossible to administer and may present other legal challenges so just being mindful of those sorts of concerns thank you yes I mean it does seem that we have uh nuisance rules on not maintaining the property and I would think that if you have you know two feet of rotting fruit sitting on it that might be considered a nuisance attention um yeah you know just like leaves or anything else that you're not maintaining it and I do like the idea of promoting an environment that supports animals and animals come and eat all that fruit which is nice um I had a question about noise and there was a definition that had yelling but it seemed to be limited to see where was it I'm sorry I don't mean to hold you while I looked at that 12 is the noise section how close are you here to Golf Boulevard Golf Boulevard yeah one house between my house and golf bouard now do you hear um loud boom not boom box is showing my age but cars going down with the windows you know especially from Clear Water back and forth with the radio blaring um those I call them trikes of three-wheel vehicles and they got the radio in volume 10 because were there was an there was a law pass I believe two years ago limiting um noise from your vehicle I think it's if if you could hear it more than 20 feet or 15 feet I don't know if Randy is uh I'm generally familiar with that what I would tell you is I I've very recently deeply litigated the issue of noise ordinances um it's something that I can definitely look at in terms of where your code is relative to current statutes and also current legal norms nors relative to like plainly audible standards versus objective measurements there is not a requirement that you have a specific decibel um reading for example as long as you have um either temporal or um proximity limitations that might be relevant like if it can be heard more than 150 feet from the front property line from where the sound is emanating uh restrictions like that um so I can look at your noise code in addition to what whatever your planner may add um planning Norms I'm obviously not equipped to say that as we sit here now but I'm very familiar with this and if that's some if your noise ordinance is something you'd like more carefully reviewed as part of this process I'm happy to do so well what I'm referencing is ref into the state statute relative to sound emanating from Vehicles yeah because especially around the causeway okay this time of year you get people stopped there for a long period of time because they're waiting for us the people in the side streets the people in The Causeway way people right around there some of these people just have the volume up to 10 and you you can hear you could hear you could hear it almost at the city hall if they're at and that is a violation is it it may be of the statute I I I'd have to look at the statory language I will tell you one of the challenges with that statute is let's say you're sitting here on the meeting with Dave somebody Drives By sorry with the mayor and somebody drives by making that noise you call your Deputy by the time they even figure out which vehic it is they're either over the in their garage but yeah but I'm just saying it's it can be annoying I I sympathize with the people that like boy lives right on there yeah and I to answer your question if I'm in my house and the and you know the windows are closed and the door shut um I don't hear anything that's out on G Boulevard if I walk out my kitchen door into the garage and those same noises are being produced they sound pretty loud you have probably hurricane windows right um I have double pain I don't know what they're rated for because they put in a while ago but knock on wood whoever built that house did a lot of nice work for sound insulation because I really don't hear anything it's amazing I've even made that comment to my life yes my thanks to Mr Roberts for pointing out the section I was looking for um but it is 22- 61 on page 10 and it's item four yelling shouting Etc it's creating similar no is on the public streets and I wonder why we have the limitation of on the public streets might we delete that because if you're screaming in the house if you're screaming in the pool if you're having a party in the backyard you're not on the public Street that's certainly language we can review I will tell you the other concern I have just hearing that language is your streets and sidewalks are the most traditional public fora as it relates to First Amendment speech and so if somebody is out on your not not obstructing traffic which is its own statutory violation most especially B after following the 20203 legislative session um but the or 2022 legislative session but the um concern of if somebody's out there saying you know God is savior repent now and somebody says well they're yelling on our city sidewalk or or Street as long as they're not impeding traffic flow or anything else that should I I would have concerns about enforcing something like that and so that's language that we should definitely look at and make sure we're harmonizing it with those constitutional Norms makes sense getting back to nuisances I'm I'm not seeing I see that there's um there's a lot a lot of lines to look through at one time time but uh I know that we're very protective of uh trying to prevent uh trees and shrubs and everything from getting out of hand but I really don't see where it's where it's violating your next door neighbor where you've got this big tree and now it's growing way over and over the fence and into the neighbor's yard and now you've got six feet of overgrowth in shade that you didn't ask for and don't care about do we have something like that in our code now yes did you tell me where it is um it's not this section think it's 94 so it's not considered a nuisance it's in a different section of the yeah I mean there's a couple sections that kind of cross over um so we'll be covering that at the next next meeting right yeah we do have we do have more comments on the uh the Landscaping section okay and maintenance of landscaping and clear zones and things like that you go back to what Tim was saying about number four are you are you suggesting just eliminate the word public Street yes I I agree with you it's uh section 9469 Green Yard Landscaping requirements for yards of budding public okay yeah Landscaping is covered in multiple chapters like a little bits here and there yeah I was just wondering if we needed a to declare certain things to be a nuisance because they are yeah there's other cities that um establish protected trees so if someone has an oak tree and it's growing older they actually won't let it get cut it has to get permit so yeah we're not exactly a tree City we don't we have very little laws against trees Bell Beach yeah yeah other concerns in chapter 22 just what I brought up about clarifying Kim's 22614 I I think we should eliminate the word public streets is that I know you were talking about this Randy would that be a eliminating it would be the direction I would probably go I just want to make sure that because I'm not intimately familiar with the language I'd want to make sure that I'm looking at the ill it's attempting to address and see because if it's otherwise addressed by for example the statute that was adopted um in uh 2022 that specifically prevents stopping impeding retarding slowing all the other verbs and synonyms the flow of traffic and pedestrians well then we don't have a need for any kind of corollary code provision because there's a Flor to statute on it whether it's constitutional or not and so I think we're moving we'd probably move in the direction of eliminating that language I'm just relu to commit to doing it until I've looked at it in context yeah uh Tim uh how about the 10 pm and 7 a is there I think that's fine but I have I have experienced like loud loud partying going on yeah I've had neighbors complain about kids in the pool especially you know yeah and if it finishes by 10: fine but if it goes until 1:00 a.m. which I have experienced or shortterm run um and another one was just I this sounds crazy but there was I won't say it never mind but anyway loud noises are you know fine people can have fun but let's be quiet at night Wherever You Are I would actually recommend to remove the word particularly to say between the hours of 10 and S otherwise I don't know how we're going to enforce that so somebody said well it says particularly between 10 and seven and it's now 4 in the afternoon and I'm Raising Cane on the back of my pickup truck going down Gul Boulevard you know they're going to point to that and say I don't really think that applies don't we wouldn't it be better just to strike that whole list from public streets the the period after am 7 am right or just remove that whole you know what I'm saying particularly between the hours of 10 pm. and 7 AM yeah it's such a matter I think this is uh R Randy will take a look at it and okay do his harmonizing my last question is a general one um there were several sections where it um a penalty is imposed uh based on um an interest rate and I'm just wondering what the current trend is like 12% is listed in this ordinance is there a current Trend to instead posted to 2% over a benchmark of some sort or just how are people generally handling that I'm I'm really surprised that we have this as an ordinance at all because it seems to me that it should be more of a um discussed and um set by resolution um instead of just having it memorialized forever until you have to do an ordinance change so instead of setting 12% uh you have set by the council uh by resolution and then that way as hress go up you can raise it up as interest drops down you can lower it down but um we should have the flexibility to be able to change that well that's why using a Brent Benchmark might work so whatever that is you know it's if if it's the government rate if it's the CPI whatever that Benchmark is but then you say 4% over that or 2% yeah I I'm just wondering what the current trend is um because I'm not intimately familiar with the language I want to make sure I understand is that language saying that code enforcement fines shall be subject to interest AC cruel or is it use of interest in another way it's unpa unpaid fines and leans on property right our subject to I I believe that there's a statutory figure set for that I want to say it's six something percent I could be wrong about that just conflating it perhaps with post-judgment interest in the Civil context um but I there is I know it's not explicit in chapter 162 I think it may elsewhere Which chapter 162 is the Florida statute governing code enforcement fines fees and leans um so i' I'd want to make I'd look at the legal Authority on it I think we usually do it um as you know judgment interest that would occur with a judgment uh but I want to look at I'd look at that I would not have it set I agree with the mayor that I would not have it set in your code one so that if it does change by Statute you don't have to be concerned about that and two if it is something that we can set unilaterally and I'm not sure that we can but if it is then have it set by resolution and adjust it as appropriate without the need for two readings and now a a business impact statement and all those sorts of trappings that come with ordinances well and again if it's a benchmark it's eliminates the need to take annual action I think it all begins with the Florida statute and then we go from there uh if we're able to I mean we may we may not even be legally allowed to charge 12% correct look into that and that's a general comment we've made uh where fees are listed as well just to reference a resolution what else any comments out there no well in that case um we want to take a five minute break yes sir and then we'll get right back on it all right 730 yeah 7:30 will work 20th Street which effectively is and obviously right Street beach oh yeah right there in Rock Beach since they did the Doom restoration yes I have got a z look I haven't seen there well you have houses it's got it's done then nothing and houses again I'll tell you the ones that didn't get it done are foolish because that's where the water's go it's like a map now it's a giant bottle yeah I say thank you please let me know all right it's close enough to 7:30 we're uh back at it and now we are at Chapter 30 yes sir yeah this this chapter deals with seaw walls um and then uh restrictions on boats and marinas uh or the marina rules at the marina um we had some minor comments on this uh I think one of the things we're recommending is the added definition of catwalk uh because there are regulations uh dealing with catwalks and no definition uh but other than that just open it up for your discussion and what was the um what was the suggestion uh that the the fix for the catwalk problem just um defining it uh that it's um essentially it's a small dock not more than uh three feet wide I think is is what we found as other brush we have a definition under section 30- 53 under uh section J yeah I thought it was pretty precise uh whenever yeah oh four feet okay y um yeah I think I saw that let me see oh it still didn't Define what a catwalk is it has the part of a dock structure but no wider than four foot yeah does have the four foot restriction but yeah I think I'd recommend just adding uh adding a little bit more particularly what that is um but it does that that does have the restrictions on the for four feet wide and no longer than 45 feet from a seaw wall but um I think um there's also regulations of how far they can be from a dock but that that was really our only comment other other than uh you know correcting some terminology um and references to other statutes all right any comments on this section Council I have one on page 11 uh sub paragraph n aircraft operation I just wanted to confirm whether that includes drones it doesn't specify drones age 11 you say yes talk about unmanned aircraft so I think that includes drones but would it be helpful to add that be clear well it states model or remote operated aircraft I believe that would cover drones okay good and we just have to look as well that there is some degree of preemption relative to the regulation of drones we'd want to make sure that we're in line with whatever those state and federal preemptions are I'm I'm GNA tell you this is probably uh code that will eventually have to go away because Amazon is probably one of the largest lobbyist in the whole world oh yeah and I think the future is they're going to be delivering stuff by drone uh and it's something we'll see very soon uh and so that would that would shoot this down so to speak and and similarly in that regard while you're talking about aerial approaches there's already preemptions that prevent cities from regulating or preventing autonomous vehicles from operating on their roadways um so as we talk about Transportation regulations we'll have to make sure we're we're consistent with statutory schemes that has interstate commerce issues yes Mr Roberts thank you sir and call number 10 in that same area that's referencing fireworks where it says at the end that if somebody wants to do fireworks on the beach they have to come and get rid commer from the city manager has anybody ever done that because of course any Fourth of July or New Year's uh you know right across the street from where I live on the beach and we go out there to enjoy it there's plenty of people out there that put off a fair amount of fireworks right from the beach so they never do paron they don't they don't oh they never come to you and right we're headit in the city correct yeah so I don't know if they leave this open for if we wanted a specific vendor to do fireworks or something yeah sure why that except just even a family if they if they wanted to get permission I don't know so what would you do if somebody came to you and said hey want to do fireworks I wouldn't permit it okay because City doesn't CL that period those May embellish people too they have those big parties and works it's always those people yes just kidding I wonder if that's in their mun code but firew Wars probably is within our C limits I'm talking about shorts what else um uh seaw walls um there's been a lot of mention of just uh maintenance of seaw wall so I don't know if there's something we can add just to give more language to maintaining your seaw wall as we talk about the requirements of building one um I know a lot of this our code you know gets into some of the constructional uh requirements and specifications but they're not all up to date but that doesn't really matter in our case because the county covers that when they do the inspection um but we we do it might be helpful to uh mention things about um draining correctly out the seaw wall as well in our code that's a good catch because it does relate to construction and uh criteria for how to build one but it doesn't address maintenance well there was there was a big problem with one uh what was it two years ago three years ago that completely collapsed into the water and uh they almost lost their pool because of it um it was you could see a clear crack going end to end on their seaw wall um I don't know if there was any fine or if there was I don't I don't know what the outcome of that was other than well they got it fixed they got a new seaw wall but um I think we were aware of it and that they had applied for permit but by the time they did it it was too late um then there's the argument well how do you how do you even check on that how do you how do you know if someone's sea wall is um in disarray um yes sir stuff that was not needed it out add langage there's basic things you see that should one have a cck if you don't have any wees which are now required SE yeah have horal have sneaking around behind the seat and full TI between December and Fe year see how much space the lower portions well and I think that the problem we had with it was that um if they don't want you on their Pro on their property you don't have to allow them on their proper yeah I Kyle would you like to comment on on this conversation so we do have this name ual and it does give a lot of informational like material that I think is beneficial for the resident if if we circulate it just so that they are are knowledgeable of what they may not know is happening to their Seawall I remember it's it's educational yeah when it comes to enforcement I defer to Randy on that because um it becomes like unless we're going to hire somebody who's qualified to make that call based on what they can ins I mean I think it could be done if we brought an engineer out on a boat and they could get close to the seaw wall they wouldn't be on a person's property see that's that's the problem is that we don't have the staff that's qualified to say this has to be fixed and so then it it basic five basic problem that even a sea wall engineer one of those right yeah I I would say I think I think the discourse is just in in the interest of facilitating some some motion forward on this I think the discourse is sort of going past each other that the gentleman from the public is talking about more of Public Service Announcement um guidance providing resources to the public so that um property owners who let's say you have property owners who have relocated from the Midwest to have their Seawall for the first time aren't familiar with that and saying here are resources the City offers as you continue to maintain your own property that's one thing what you folks are concerned with as the legislative body is is regulations and then by extension how that police power is wielded and I and I think the mayor's concerns are are are valid in terms of do we have the means and resources if we're going to regulate this in some way Beyond saying you can't have unsafe structures generally on the property any any restrictions in the Florida building code or otherwise on unsafe structures if you're going to say it's a violation to have X how are you going to police X regardless of what x is if it's parking 8 inches from a curb or the condition of your seaw wall as you consider regulations um and and amending Your Land Development code and I don't think this falls into that category but I would just caution in relative to like virtue signaling type regulations we like we just we're doing this to enhance awareness because that that works fine as a as a philosophical notion until Lord sitting on his back porch and calls Kyle and says hey I see that our code in section 66.7 says this and Kyle says well that's we don't really have the means to enforce it it's just there so people know not to do it it's kind of like a thank you for not smoking sign you don't want that in your code because if you can't administer it then you shouldn't have it um because it creates unreasonable Expectations by the public of their government and then you know unreasonable bir for for government you don't want to put your public work staff your deputies or anybody else in that sort of predicament so I'm not suggesting you shouldn't regulate this particular issue just again a word of advice as we Endeavor on this process and it's subject to uh yes sir that sea wallet fin Foundation that wasn't really sa soil that she [Music] that that's the problem all right something doesn't take care of their what right so how do we protect the people that care somebody's and when you buy them like what any real you about wall INSP that's the problem well and you can't you can't enforce what a realtor does not say you can't control it and if I'm trying to sell a million dooll piece of property last thing I'm going to do is tell them they're going to have to spend $100,000 for a new seaw wall as soon as they move in um I I don't really know if there's a good solution unless we hired somebody and they were they were qualified certified in some way and then still would have to have access to the property that ites you have rece I don't know didn't we just do a manual two years ago for seaw walls well that's the he helped with that but the the manual is only suggested sure yeah it's only this is our recommended process but or this is your recommended process but it's not anything that we currently have a a method of enforcing well we do have in the manual like you're now allow to pain a sea wall you know it has to be in natural state in natural form because you could hide cracks and everything else in place of poxy P but I will point out uh section 107 four which we around previously does require uh that the seaw walls be maintained ACC in accordance with the seawall manual adopted by the council oh really it says no person shall occupy or let another or let to another for occupany any Resident any residential or non-residential property that does not comply with the following requirements and last on the list is the seaw wall manual adopted by the city so um it is referenced at least I'm I'm wondering can failure to maintain a seaw wall be a nuisance it is if it falls in well that's why're I'm looking at page two of 12 which was the definition of nuisance it includes anything which is the suffering are permitting any condition to be or to exist and it either in any way renders any person's insecure in Life or the use of property or essentially interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of life and property or depreciates the value of the property of others so if you don't maintain your seaw wall and you're your neighbor the neighbor property value is going to go down you're not going to enjoy your home with the risk of that again but how is this enforceable I I don't see it right now um even requiring let's just say that that every seaw wall in Bair Beach uh it was required by an ordinance that you had to have your seaw wall inspected every say 20 years or 10 years or something like that I mean is that is that even enforceable is that is that something that that we could do that reference to the seaw wall manual is under the building maintenance section so it's it's similar to any other unsafe building condition um but but how do you prove how do you prove that and that's the problem well yeah I don't know it's similar to the other building issues I would think but yeah it's a good question I mean having weeds in your yard is seems like we ought to be able to say oh I see cracks in the seaw wall that's that's a big problem here's this dumb question do you does your property end at the seaw wall or do you actually have rights like maybe five 10 your property is in the water and so so how far can you go up to know the question you raised earlier I can't go on the property to inspect the seaw wall so how close could I really even get to the seaw wall with my boat to well that's a different story at completely different rules you can take your boat right up to their seaw wall oh you all right right right it's uh rude as hell but yeah you can do it okay yeah there's people that fish they'll pull right up to your dot they'll get right under your boat and they'll be fishing and there's really nothing you can do about it CRA trapping well I didn't know that's why I asked okay um other comments on uh Chapter 30 I I would just ask if uh our attorney could weigh in on that and look is there a way to enforce the condition of a seaw wall absolutely you can enforce the idea that any structure on your property on a property must be maintained in a safe manner consistent with um whether it's the Florida building code if there's some other statutory National Standard U pointing to that my concern comes when you talk about for example sub4 that's been raised relative to your manual is the language in there actually prohibitive or is it aspirational if it says you should do this and you don't do it that's not necessarily a violation and again what is the probative ele like for example if we have in there that you should as the mayor was sort of alluding to that it you must have your Seawall maintain inspected every 20 years what kind of database and record are we maintaining how often are we soliciting are our records consistent such that we can actually prove that that Sewall has not been inspect because we're going to have the burden of when we if we're worryed to take them to a magistrate or local ordinance violation court but yes you can certainly say just in the same way we can a shed a house or any other structure if a structure is not sound and is is presents a a danger by virtue of of um what's the word I'm thinking of uh decomposition isn't the right word but you get what I'm getting at if it's fallen into disrepair just like if we had a house without a roof on it and the window's open if we have have adopted for example subac the um safe and I forget the language there's two Co two different codes um subac and another one that are adopted usually as building maintenance standards for nuisance properties and the like if we have something like that we can enforce that whether the dock is the square peg that fits or the seaw wall is the square peg that fits in that round hole I'd have to look at what those Provisions are to see if there's language in those specific to those kinds of structures and what standards are in place yeah I'm looking at thinking about that and not not a whole bureaucratic system in terms of inspections and all that but just okay you didn't maintain your property right what can we do about it Mr be yes sir so the city has insect SE 22nd Street how many other 16 Street that's because City it's because the original seaw walls were over 70 years old and so many of see around I have I have an original seaw wall got well I'm I'm also having it redone at at the tune of a about 40K how old is it from day one like 64 yeah yeah other comments on this section anybody many after like verify all to say code the inspector has verify I would say that that um that that would be um a big problem I think instead of waiting until the dock is finished maybe there should be a sign off on the polls at soon as they're placed the the the outlying poles that that determ the the shape and size of your dock structure um even then who's the who's who's the guy who's doing that who's gonna survey it again who's who's gonna do that they have to do it the set the PO they do but yes and so and and Kyle you said that they have no way of I would say that's determined by the county and if we put these requirements on them they may op to have us find another inspector something independent of them I don't think we can make them inspect way make sure that that's part of the contract with the need to verify and if they sign L ver well I think in any plans they're be they're swearing to those measurements so if we ever find differently they're held responsible yeah and I can tell you that I've had multiple whenever I was first looking at this I uh I paid an engineering firm uh to come out survey my property come up with a design plan they drew it all up it was beautiful and they were wrong then another company came in and they surveyed it and I got something else and they were wrong and whenever I did it myself I was I was right but my point is is it's subjective it's everyone's opinion as to actually how it really really does work um I think I think really um it's it's more of a self-regulation with the neighbors actually calling it out sort of like what we did with the uh the the the couple that were building there it wasn't it wasn't them it was uh it was the the dock Builder was actually putting it in the channel going under the bridge and they were they were creating a huge Hazard they were following their plan and their plan was wrong or something or maybe they weren't following their plan but um enough citizens were concerned that they called city manager he's called the dock company and they checked again and they admitted oh yeah we've made a big mistake and they had to move everything so there there's partial responsibility of of the neighbors to be watching what's going in yeah the uh the my next door neighbor he's a great guy he had a doc design put it in he said I made it just like yours and he did um well whenever they were ready to start in installing the the boat lift now he has a large straight lot whenever they they were getting ready to install the boat lift and um he asked me what I thought about it and I did some measuring and if they had actually moved forward and installed the boat lift it would have been about one and a half feet from the property line and no one caught it no one caught it so they didn't they didn't install it and now they're stuck with this dock with a cutout for a boat lift that that's and they're just stuck with it so yeah I know all of this is history but my my point is is that uh there's some personal responsibility to make sure that it's done right because you may encounter an issue with your neighbor and um and that's where the real problem happens docs are also addressed in chapter 94 which we'll we'll talk about some more so this is more of the construction part of it um but the reg the location of them and reg other regulations uh we'll have another shot up all right anything else in this section if not then we will move on to chapter 50 yes chapter 50 is streets sidewalks and other public ways and uh to clarify this is not the design of streets and sidewalks and when you have to build them that's covered uh under subdivision and development but um this is more of what can go on in streets and sidewalks and other public ways uh the only comment we had on this was in 50-1 roadway intersection visibility we're just recommending that the site visibility triangle be clarified a little more I think this was something that Kyle mentioned and yeah we noticed as well you could probably uh tighten that up where uh you are specifying what can be done within certain elevations within that uh site uh triangle which is 50-1 B so uh typically uh codes will clarify that you have to keep a clear Zone uh between 2 and a half feet above grade to 10 feet above grade for visibility purposes so that's our only comment is just adding that we've had some minor comments uh throughout but that's probably the only one I think worth discussing in you're in travels Kyle around the city do you see that very often where whether it's bushes or a fence when you come up to a stop sign you're going to make a turn where your view is obstructed it's difficult to see we've we've enforced it on certain Corners yeah where we the side triangle is defined but um if yeah if we could have a clear more concise language to it doesn't have to be on a street corner either it can actually be on a straight A straight uh Drive we've seen where it was just way out in the street blocking someone's view where they can't exit safely from their their own driveway next door and that's going to come up in chapter 94 um where we have Landscaping in the RightWay Landscaping in the front setback and that's an area that really like to tighten up or Define or figure out what we want done because we have a lot of variation throughout the city and what most properties are not in line with what the code actually says yeah correct there's going to be a lot more in 94 on this issue and a lot of other issues I guess as well do you can uh consider 94 to be the biggest I think so yes challenge it will well lot lot yeah lot that's where the most issues will be sure um is this the correct chapter for uh the vertical clearance of the roadway oh for uh Limbs and things like that I think uh I noted that in 94 we did we did find some regulations uh worth uh considering but we could cross reference probably a good idea to to do cross referencing uh if we're gonna add things like that um one second any comments on Mr reers thought no everybody good Mr [Music] ban see so if you're in a c aite is what you're saying if you're in a special unique circumstance where your you and your neighbor would be staring at each other uh then it should have a different a different code yeah well we won't call out any particular address but we'll call out colx yes because we have that kind of exception for a budding up to a public property or Golf Boulevard Causeway different exceptions and rules all right what else that's all we had on this chapter if the council has anything they'd like to discuss anyone no right um that takes care of those four chapters now we're up to General business and I wanted to bring something up to see what the council thought about it um I've been discussing with Mr reefer um what is the benefit of the the fiveyear look back period um and so far I really haven't got any benefit and and I'm going to let Mr reer speak on that uh I'm not recommending that we do away with a look back period but see that uh Treasure Island has no look back period it basically resets every time they they complete a project if you go to Indian Rocks Beach they have a one-year look back period but if you go to Bair Beach we have a five-year look back period this all started whenever a student surveyed us I don't know if everyone was surveyed but I was and I think that okay I think Kyle is actually meeting with with the young man about this particular Rule and why it exist and and what's the benefit what's the drawbacks of of having it is it too long is it should it be shortened should it be done away with what's the benefits uh with FEMA uh Kyle so after you brought it up I looked into our CRS credit and the points that we earn um at our verification which is every five years and the the verification when they do that is when they audit you for everything you're supposed to be doing for EXC what is a CRS a community rating system it's through the national flood insurance program it's a it's an incentive um beyond the uh being part of the national flood insurance program um so there's Baseline rules that everyone has to follow that's kind of the guidelines that uh Mr Mora was bringing up that our federal restrictions to be uh to to participate to be a community that uh residents can get National flood insurance um the subsidized program so the community rating system is kind of like it's a discount system built on top of it um to tighten up um create incentive to have more restriction to benefit the overall program so we are a class six which um it's each tier it goes all the way down to a class one um if you were say a class nine you would get 5% discount on flood insurance since we're class six each class gives you 5% more so we get a 20% discount um so when they do that verification process such is like a five-year audit if you're a class six um they come through and they just check what you're doing they give you the credit the points verify it that um that you are in that class so we did that in 2020 um I went back and talked to our ISO which is like a um independent uh person that works for the state and you know he pulled up our scoring and he you know I talked about this look back period which is also uh known as the cumulative substantial Improvement um so so substantial Improvement goes all way back to um it it's a main rule of being part of the national flood insurance program it's what people have a lot of times called the FEMA 50% role um that is by FEMA guidance it should be per year standard so I don't know what the community that's doing it per project if that's actually in what they're supposed to be doing but it's per year um or per event if you're talking substantial damage and um so if you if you're part of national flood insurance program if uh you have a property um regardless of how much the overall property is worth um taking into account the location and all that what they do is they they want to appraise the value of the actual structure which is what you're insuring for flood insurance um that is done at a cost value with depreciation added in so if you have a house that's built in like 1960 um you know a lot of times they'll depreciate by years of of usable life um and you're doing an appraisal um what that actual structure is worth um but not if if you were to rebuild it like what it's actually worth the materials and how much they degraded and everything so they get that number um and that's the value of your structure and then what the rule is is that if you're going to do any improvements to that structure you can't go the value of that Improvement can't be over 50% of what the value of structure is so the fiveyear look back is instead of it being in one year's time it we have a five-year look back saying within five years of that first Improvement that you had it appraised you can't go over 50% in five years as opposed to just one year it really restricts you yeah so the the value of your home they look at the value of your home from five years ago yeah and that's yeah that starts the math um I I'm still I I don't hear any benefit to having this rule uh one versus five I I don't I don't understand it and is there anything going to change that what is the benefit because I'm gonna I'm gonna explain why I'm asking all these questions um there are a lot of old homes with good bones in this community um obviously uh there are some that uh that live in lower Ling areas like a I always lose my bearings here but um if you head south they're in flood zone and I'm sure that they would love to build up if they could so leave the garage in the danger zone declare your your downstairs non-habitable and build up and now you've got a better home but instead this solution for most people is turning into either sellout so you lose a good neighbor you lose a still a nice home it gets knocked down and you get a mansion back in its place and then also with with a mansion um I'm not going to say it's everyone but we get a lot of part- Tim that that aren't really um it's not the the old charm too that this community was um was built around and so what I'm looking at now is is I'm thinking well why not give these homeowners a chance to actually stay in Belair Beach instead of forcing them to leave because they uh there's no path to fix their home even if you look at the front of a lot of these older homes uh I'm sure there's many homeowners who would love to just be able to put a new face on the front of their home bring it up to a Modern Standard so that they look like a newer style home but it's cost prohibitive because you have this fiveyear lookup so a great example is you buy a house you move into b beach you buy a house the prior owner or The Flipper dumped many thousands of dollars into this home in a very short period of time you move in thinking that you're going to do some things and you can't do squat to your home so you're stuck with something that really you have a completely different vision for than what you got and so um you either sell it or you live with it and and then you're probably not very happy with it and so now you've got to wait five whole years for the clock to reset and that's hoping that nothing breaks because if something breaks and it requires permitting then you you the clock it doesn't really reset but you extend that time period out the the clock moves forward a little bit but you're still looking at five years and normal wear and tear and maintenance on a home uh for some of these homes they're they're not able to to get it done and um I if I if unless there's a benefit I'm not really sure why we're doing this to ourselves um yes I agree with you completely and I thank you for bringing that up because I've encountered the 50% rule on many occasions and I think it really is a detriment to our community in the sense that people that do want to commit and live here can't make even some basic improvements I mean to refit um to Hurricane rated Windows is a major expense uh if you add in a new water heater and oh I got to do a roof repair in the meantime we end up with more derc properties that are just decaying as opposed to people having the ability to maintain their home there is there is an exception so like if say your windows put out um you are allowed to be exempt from that 50% if you're bringing it up to code so you're if so say your window broke and then you buy requirement had to put in a hurricane window you can't do your whole house but you can do you can fix what's broken you can do 25% a year right you're going to replace all the windows I mean without even getting a permit you can I think the county says 25% you oh 25% o means you can do per year but still has to follow yeah because I did mine that yeah yeah but you weren't over you weren't on the edge like the example is say someone did a whole bunch of remodeling sold the house and then you bought it and all a sudden something breaks you can you can repair it like but you can't do your whole roof if you get a leak in your roof which people want to do they want to put a whole new roof on but see that's where you run into some issues with the one year with the fiveyear removal of the fiveyear fix what he just said there uh it would certainly help because most people aren't doing half the value of their home in a single year right um that I'm sure there's projects that are going to happen there's there there is some disadvantage there it's going to bring more traffic in uh to Kyle's office uh and to Aaron handles does Aon handle the permitting right now or no no I do oh you do it all okay so it's definitely going to uh increase the number of permits that would be coming in um I realize that but also we charge for permits so there would be possibly increased Revenue that that could um maybe make make it to where we could afford additional help just for permitting um about tax value well tax value would goes up every time do a project and then if you really want it to go up sell your house and then it just Skyrocket well I just talked to Rick Scott's office last week about that nfip with the discounts and everything like that and it's still in litigation there hasn't been any movement it's be and it's it's a it's a total mess I mean you look at 2.0 it tells you all these discounts you're supposed to get then you say to your underwriter where are they and I don't know if you heard my complaints about this do Council meetings no one can give you an answer and that's why like 14 states are suing the nfip but it's a total mess when they change the rating system it really kind of threw everything out the window because it took the grandfather took the grandfathering out so like you said what's the benefit anymore because regardless if you're going to remodel your house it's below the flood plane you know you're going to pay a lot for insurance if you want to insure it regardless what you put into it so you're going to be paying for it anyways right you're not getting any benefit from before the benefit sort of was like being a good Steward of the system so that you weren't allowing people to put so much money below the flood plane and then screwing the whole system over kind of but I can see that they with the 2.0 and it it changed you know everybody's coming up the full rating and the real people that are saving now are the people who are built up because they're no longer paying for the people that aren't right well and um there's a possibility that a lot of these um that I believe that this rule changing this rule would actually bring some relief to the the southern side of the bridge that for people that that really wanted to fix their home and solve the problem that it's not it's not really a a huge deal when it enters your garage but it's a giant deal whenever it enters your home in your living space just coming over here da walking up the street one neighbor was saying are we GNA do anything about this flooding and all like that because I'm about ready to sell I can't take it any you know and said everything's been on the table we're aggressively looking at thankfully and uh he say well it's it's a real real burden well and I also see that the um the image of b beach I can see it changing rapidly as people choose to sell out and move away because they see no path to fixing their home they can't afford the mansion and they can't afford to fix their or they there's I'm sorry it's not they can't afford to upgrade their home but there's no pathway for them to do that um I think that this would help dramatically and and I I believe that um overall there would we would have more tax revenue we would have happier residents I believe that they would stick around longer uh instead of just cashing out and leaving and uh and I think overall we'd have more beautiful city yeah absolutely so um what I I would ask all of you to do is put some serious thought into it this will come up in 94 right yeah and and it's in if you're looking for it it's it's not even an ordinance it's in definitions at the very beginning of the chapter so read up on it and uh all it is is a word change uh or two words instead of five years it's one year uh would be the change and and that's it it's fixed and if it becomes problematic well um we can cross that bridge when the time comes comes but right now I see no benefit whatsoever to what we're doing great I'd like to go back and kind of listen to the look at the minutes around surrounding when they actually adopted it because I I to my knowledge they never got credit or the city's never gotten credit for that so I don't know what the mindset was when they I I asked show me the city's credit to the underwriter and they sent me to three different agencies the last agency was uh some little Island no one could speak English and that was the national flood review or something it was a it was a total joke it it's tough to get a full understanding risk rating 2.0 um the one thing when I was at conference that they assured because it comes up you know we communities Representatives communities are asking why are we even doing the CRS program because you're looking at how you know all these scales and like how and they're like are you know are we even getting the discount but they this I mean they assure us that we'll be we'll be paying more without that discount I don't know exactly how well but that's what I'm show it to me in writing like if I'm if you're underwriting the policy it should say here's their discount it doesn't I'm four feet above flood level well I'm should I should get another 20% there or that that oh it's in there no it's not in there right yep it's ongoing issue yeah all right do we have any other comments in general business yes sir um Randy I'm G to try to get your pay raise if you can pull rabbit out of your hat here uh it was I was it's under 94 but it's a tower issue that I think we're gonna talk about that tonight or we can we can do a a a a quick conversation on it but I don't want to I don't want to stay here all night over it because we're going to be discussing it anyway but uh I think there's nothing that can be done about the one that happened however I believe that language and our code would at least cause um uh for for anyone else that wants to do this it would prevent them from putting it in the setback and and that's what happened because it's considered to be a utility that right it's it's actually not in the setback at all but what we determined is our definition of mechanical equipment it would meet that definition if they encroach the setb up to four feet what is the it it's a tower am missed so it actually is not he's out of his setback he's out of the setback and the wind rting and everything that's what the county assured me that they met everything that was required and and it does look like they put them through um you know separate engineering for that um just visualizing like every other house haven't wanted that would really look good in it's it's not the same setback that we've designated for things like generators it's actually actually outside of outside okay so um I I don't think we have anything I I just don't I don't I don't see it everyone's looked at it I I appreciate the inquiry and the question you know in the event it wasn't clear the question relative to the existing antenna on the um property that's been the subject of discussion since I was hired in the summer of 2022 I would agree with the mayor's conclusion that that what's done is done in as much as that what I told you or this Council its composition varying over time what I told this Council was the the violation that we prosecuted most directly was the absence of a permit at the time the property owner was representing himself if you will and saying I don't need a permit and if I applied they deny me and we say well you you can't presume that you have to give us the opportunity to review it give us a fair shake and we'll give you one and the gentleman subsequently secured legal counsel um I was I learned admittedly new things about that area of the law that I was not specifically familiar with and we said and my advice to this city was that that attenna had to go through permanent review we could not just say they're banned um we had to Pro determine if it could be accommodated and if anything in our code specifically prevented it during the city's portion of the permitting review manager rler and I conducted a detailed review of our code it did not fall within the setback it did not meet definitions for other elements that may have imposed restrictions and then ultimately it was submitted for permitting review and our request to in turning it over to the county we said we do not wish to Prejudice your analysis however comma our specific concerns relative to this structure are its height it's wind sustainability and similar safety concerns that we would impose on any other structure in our community so as you perform your independent autonomous duties as our building official please ensure that you review these elements they were reviewed as manager reers indicated it was subject to specific additional engineering supplementation that may not ordinarily be required the property owner complied by providing it and in conducting that review whether it be with guidewires or anything else and I'm not suggesting there are any I don't know the particulars because as your City attorney I don't get involved in permitting um but I will tell you that it past permitting and the structure is being erected or um raised and lowered as the permitting allows if it is not consistent with permitting then that is that is an entry point for the city now that said as it relates to that what I would call settled matter um and again remember there's federal preemptions and state preemptions on what we can do relative to these structures and just even as we talk about going forward imposing setback limitations I would suggest to you that there's some case law saying just saying it's in our setback is not enough can you accommodate it can you give it a variance to say okay they're proposing to go you have a restriction of 10 feet proposing to go two feet into that is that so such an imposition on the community that it cannot be um tolerated or is it hey I'm trying to put it in normally you say they can only be in the rear of my property I'm trying to go in the side rear because there's a giant oak tree that I'm not allowed to remove you will have to go through a case by case analysis regardless right so the point is absolutely right that I think I personally as your City attorney would advise you as to that property that's a settled matter I do agree with you as well that we should review our code with the assistance of the planner and my legal review to see are there things we can do better making sure that it is Falls within the definition of whether it's electrical engineering or some other definition that we provide for an antenna shall not be within X feet you know but but may secure a variance subject to ABC criteria those are all options we may have yeah so bottom line is you're saying not interrupt this is grandfather in O I'm not saying it's grandfather because of what a grandfather provision suggests is is something that is a non-conformity prior to the adoption of the code I'm saying that what has been erected is consistent with your code to the extent it is inconsistent with your code it is inconsistent with Provisions we are unable to enforce owing to preemptions and otherwise so I'm not suggesting it's grandfathered I'm actually saying it's in compliance it's gone through permitting and there's nothing for us to do relative to that structure however comma we have the ability to amend our code to be proactive about future situations see where what lessons learned through this process and what legal issues did we identify or planning issues because that's kind of a vend diagram of its own did we identify that we may be able to resolve in the Here and Now such as maybe you you must you must hire a professional company you must have an engineer who is uh who will is willing to what those engineer design guidelines must include must they include wind rating specifications must they include yes a whatever those criteria a through z or one through 100 R and I'm not suggesting we get into 100 criteria but specifying what it is we're looking for there was a lot of having to retroactively figure out what both for the property owner and for the city you know what is it exactly you know when he asked when his counsil when his legal counsel came to us and said I'm prepared to work with you and work with your code show me what applies it's a question that had not been asked yet and so that's something that we can make sure there's a clearer road map where this to come up and in the future and uh just uh giving a different point of view than what we've all heard and and we've thought about uh during this uh this event uh very surprisingly uh the gentleman actually did go to Great Lengths to have a uh a safe Tower is as much as it looks awful to the neighbors and it looks scary uh I think that he went through every possible scenario to make sure that he was it was as safe as could possibly be erected and and and I wish to say is again the you know issue spotter nayay or bad guy often that my legal analysis is given with all sympathy to neighboring Property Owners I'm not suggesting that it is now must be desirable to them just as much as they have private property rights so too does the individual who erected this they are compliant with our code and and at every Point I've always said if a neighbor has property rights concerns they may wish to Avail themselves of their own rights there's also that's a broader discussion we need to have as we talk about some of these Land Development regulations on what is the role of government versus what is my role if I want to whether it's Sue my neighbor or work with my neighbor or find a solution with my neighbor that's that doesn't necessarily mean that local government needs to be a part of of that process right you know some of the concerns raised in in the discourse recently concerned for example the Insurance rating for that property owner and the neighboring property owner city has no role in Insurance relative to private property owners insurance so I don't know what that is but even if it was a problem it's not the city's problem to resolve so you know I I say that with sympathy to all parties involved unfortunately my job as advising this city is one to help you manage your risk but two to often find an imperfect Solution by definition it's still a solution but it's going to leave people unsatisfied and there was no perfect solution that perfectly reconciled that gentleman's private property rights with the with the desire to say I don't wish to see this have this near me or otherwise I I wish I could offer a solution that resolved all those if I did I would probably not be in meetings at nine o'clock at night so no and I and I jumped over and I apologize for the past um doing that because this is a learning job uh and um I apologize like I said to you but I think this is an FCC right and like you just said a private property right and it PR probably the private property right is even more it's it's it's a sacran value in our American system and our stat the thing is I'm not gonna do this am I can I go wct that can I go and erect the tower tomor just like he did in my yard and presently yes and it would look like hell this city would look like hell my in my view right to hold you Mr robt I think the terminology that Frank used earlier regarding the grandfather term once if we go in and change the code and so now we have a more strict defined Code system in our ordinance and Bill Smith goes and and build something um and they say well gosh that other Tower didn't meet anything because they are grandfather Dan based on the pre that's what that would be the distinction they'd be grandfather have to tell you that um if he goes if no matter what we do to our code if the new antenna goes through the same the same uh process it passes it passes the county will sign off on it that's right um because they deem it as safe they deem it is is not a threat and uh we can't create an ordinance and I don't want to get into this that something can't be I think we we can be more strict right you know what I'm saying well that see the loophole that they see a tower and really the antenna the thing that's at the top of the tower is useless without the tower so it's effectively the antenna right the whole structure as a single structure what I'm saying can we make it we cannot have a what I can tell you is we can general height limitations but they cannot be absolute given the preemptions we would still have to consider accommodations and say like if somebody came to us and said for instance and I'm going to use all this terminology wrong I have a UHF signal and in order to get my UHF signal around the surrounding bridge and trees I need to be at 42 feet you have 27 feet as your restriction arbitrary numbers we may have to well considerer that 42 foot request provided it can be done in a manner that otherwise satisfies life health safety requirements if they can do that we may have to pursu it to federal and state preemption say yes Mo no other structure in this town could be in the city could be that high however because of federal preemptions we have to at least give it consideration and if we can find good reason to not give that variance or say or establish they're asking for 42 but we have our own study that says they could do it at 36 but then we're still having a fight about going over that absolutely right really the uh the Saving Grace of of going much higher than what we are right now is the fact that you get so high and now requires wires going to the ground to to keep it upright and it's permanent you can't take it down during a storm so I'd say that what he did was the the best case scenario uh where their safety concerns are taken into consideration and still he's able to to successfully operate his ham radio um and really that's a it's the very best scenario that legally we have is what he did yes I just have one question and then one new topic if I may um and that is um question is has anybody shared with the complaining neighbors the information that we now have yes yes multiple times right away yeah I figured that the cas it wasn't well reive I get well received okay yeah I figured that was the case but I just wanted to be sure because want to Happ mayor reached out to them and everything and you know very nice thank you new topic if I may sure um I understand and was very pleased to hear that we have a new application for board uh council member oh I was going to bring that up you if I take this uh Mr Reaper we currently have three applicants is that right we have two so one of them did not I thought we had he was going to and he did not change his mind okay so um I asked Renee to accept applications until the election because I wanted to know how many we were actually going to need to fill the spots and so if we needed three M well then we we take whatever we've got but if we only need one the last thing that I wanted to do was bring three people in and then have to go through this process again after the election uh so um uh what I would like this Council to do is is after the election is over now we know what the criteria is I would like to bring uh I would like to bring all the candidates in in a a small work session like this where we just interview them but we don't vote okay we meet with them all we ask them all the questions that we want to and then we go home and then we come back at the following council meeting and we elect our new council member or members depending upon how the the election goes um if council is good with that the April council meeting uh yes yes if the council is good with that that well it may it would have to be very quick because the election is the 19th so you would have to you have to bring them in within a week and vote them in I don't know what day the uh the April that's that's a quick around we could do a special you're gonna have a special meeting anyway to swear we swear that her and I in right uh you're you're in there's no election for you yeah I understand it but you swear have towear oh swear you back in yes yeah so that so it doesn't require special meeting we've done this in uh regular meetings that's because I'm sorry the April meeting will be April 1st yeah April April Fool's Day you thought you were in that's not a lot of time to um look at the candidate I mean that's a that's a very short period to jam in okay the election's over let's have a special meeting and now let's uh let's elect a member I think we're okay uh why don't we why don't we have a special meeting after the April meeting why would we have a special meeting so if we have the election and let's assuming it says okay five so we only need one so then at the April 1 council meeting that's when we would vote them I I want to have time to for us to have sort of an informal interview process where we speak to each one of them and and then also give the council time to actually if you want to call them up and ask them questions I think that we should we should do our due diligence and make sure that um that whoever the the fifth or the fifth sixth and seventh members are um that we get the very best hopefully we'll have more uh we'll have more come in but even with two if it turns out to be a five member Council I want to I want to make sure we get the best so if everybody's good with that that's what I would like to do and um and then I guess maybe we'll figure out after the April 1 what day is a good day we can maybe by by the time we have our work session maybe we can have the special meeting just before it bring them in and vote and then now we've our council member and or members and then we go right into a work session everybody good with that yeah okay and um anything else as I'm ready to go home me too uh motion to adjourn motion do I have a second all right uh all in favor I all right let's go home every"
