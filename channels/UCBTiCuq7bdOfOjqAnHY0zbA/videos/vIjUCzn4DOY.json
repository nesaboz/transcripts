presentation of the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office good evening Council on Sergeant Claudia with one of the postman Sheriff's Office police reports are for the month of April there was 716 events in the month of April 799 news responding majority of the calls were directed patrols traffic stops house checks contacts traffic control and illegally parked vehicles or a total of five arrest made in April all misdemeanor charges primarily revolving around minor traffic infractions there were 140 citations or warnings issued which 23 of them work with parking and there were little crashes in the city questions it seems like a salt to work I'm sorry assaults team that just falls under the domestics so they were like the message correct okay thank you all right next we'll have the code enforce technology report good evening Miss weissner City Council Members staff citizens Steve huntke for the record in my monthly code report again we are still doing some investigations as far as permits and unlicensed people who will work within the city a lot of them we have a uh we've been doing a lot with the cleanup around the city our major one which we've been working on for about a year is on 17th street where the house was sold and the home was cleaned up and now they're just waiting for equipment to do some work in there the other thing that we're doing is we're focusing on since hurricane season started with some of the docks within the city limits if I'm not mistaken we already got three letters going out and another three four uh to get the homeowners to repair their docks one that I'm very happy to say it was on Elita that has been going on since December 21st so when you see my report next month you'll see that they finally got a crew out there and they're replacing the dock so other than that I'll stand for any questions that's fine down here uh unpainted we're not paying on a house what about citizens that say have pressure treated lumber untainted you know attached to the front of the house or around the side of the house city manager and also over there into you know assess that but yeah if it's if the woods dilapidated the floor mobile or whatever then yes we've been we could take care of that okay thank you I have a question regarding the docs how are we um monitoring that do we are being used in the sheriff's boat now yes we are um I'm trying to go out at least once a month or so um and again it's it s schedule will change uh this Sunday I'm going to try to go out again because I'll be back out Sunday uh and I'm going to go to one of the Marine units and just again start looking at some of these areas not only with the Docks but seeing if there's any other unscheduled work that's being done to some of these homes this maybe may not be a question for you like if someone pulls a dog permit how long do they have to improve the project and that stands for like full performance too because those seem to be open for I believe it's one year if I'm not mistaken the problem that they're having is getting these come in and do the work um because there's not a lot of Doc companies that people are using out here and the issue is getting somebody to come out and give an estimate and then find it out like we had the one on Omega we found out they weren't even licensed in this County so they had to get their licensing all together before they do that so it is from the time they pull the program I believe they have one year to get the work done yes thank you you're very welcome also just to add that it doesn't leave the homeowner of a greater responsibility so if the doc's under repair we haven't started to come through you know the homeowner's still responsible to know where it's being done so you know again it could easily be removed right all right thank you have a good evening citizens comments questions okay thank you all right I am four is the presentation council members Jeffrey Davidson fire chief you know Suncoast this certain stage uh June 8th and Indian Melody City Hall we are hosting a hurricane and water safety Expo right here and it's going to be from 1 to 6 p.m there will be vendors there's going to be a life jacket giveaway Beach and boating safety information there'll be free barbecue it'll also be a blood drive you know leave if you donate blood you get a 20 gift card and a T-shirt and a wellness checkup and all kinds of things it's going to be a good day good informational session and we expect I anticipating hundreds of people to be here throughout the communities we know it's co-sponsors with Billy REITs as well as Indian Rocks Beach so that's going to be a good day we look forward to seeing you there it's from one to six P.M I wanted to understand I guess it might go again but try not to talk here we go I want to explain to the council and the citizens the EMS services that I have been pursuing for your city and provide you an update on the EMS enhancement that I've requested to the county has its budget season to add an additional EMS unit service still doesn't even if I showed numbers [Music] there you go out of time [Music] so I wanted to provide for you an update on the EMS enhancement that I requested which was to add an additional EMS unit to Service Belair Beach ballet store in the northern end of Indian Rocks Beach so since 2009 the county identified a response time Gap and that is mainly because there is a 5.6 mile gap between Fire Station 27 the mini Rocks Beach and fire station 44 in Clearwater we cannot meet the county response side of me which means you are not getting the services that you deserve the fire department has taken steps to build another fire station that the fire department is paying for with our revenues which will be in the very Northern end of any rocks Basin will be one and a half minute drive time to this location it's going to solve the historical problems that we've had the only thing I was asking the county is to fund the paramedics for the Union which is what they do every resident throughout the county pays 0.8875 Mills to the County EMS fund and that goes to fund paramedics so the fire department is the First Responders they fund one paramedic for a fire truck and the amount of money that has been paid up this is kind of shocking so when I looked at it I put in for this because there's a response sign Gap the solution is adding another drug adding another unit into a station closer to Bellaire Beach and again we're paying for the states and we're asking the county to pay for the person else that request was not even considered it was not given to the accounts Commissioners it was unilaterally decided for whatever reason I've asked three times three weeks in a row for an explanation as to how they these members uh on their own we came up with this decision to not put it in the council the commission member's hands and I'm still waiting on that response so with the 0.8875 males at every single resident pays this area Indian Rock speech is funded for one unit that's engine 27 okay those same areas Miller Bees Miller Shore any Rock speaks ghost residence in 2022 paid 2 million forty three thousand five hundred and six dollars into the EMS fund and we were only funded 689 000 to provide those services right not even one-third of what the citizens paid and there's an identified Gap that needs to be addressed I can tell you 100 I can show you we've had calls and cardiac arrest where we cannot get an ambulance for 40 minutes and that is absolutely unacceptable not in anybody's book especially mine Bellaire Beach alone paid not to the fire department to the County EMS fund Valor beats alone paid one million three hundred and sixty thousand three hundred seventy five dollars last year and you're not getting the services that that you deserve according to Pinellas County 2023 adopted annual operating capital budget the County EMS fund has approximately 66 million dollars in reserves and is projected to have 83.6 million dollars in reserves in fiscal year 28. almost 40 39.8 Reserves 83.6 million dollars and we're asking for one million dollars to fund two paramedics for an ALS transport unit that is desperately needed for this area your residents are paying a County EMS tax and you're not being funded again the residents of this area were funded for one unit have paid in over two million dollars and we were only funded 689 thousand dollars EMS response time compliance is seven minutes and 30 seconds 90 of the time and I can tell you from EMS to this area is only meaning it 80.61 of the time when it comes from all calls not just EMS it's in the 70s trying to fix that okay so a request was made for funding to staff and transport cable Rescue Unit into paramedics to provide the EMS services that are needed into your city and this request was not moved forward by the EMS Authority it was not given to the board of County Commissioners I've asked three times for a written explanation as to why this demonstrated deep was not considered and they still not received an answer so I'm urging you it's budget season I am urging you please contact your County Administration as to why this request was not considered to be moved to the board of County Commissioners your citizens deserve it there's a gap in the system it's been identified for since 2009 however many years that is a lot and this is the solution and the money's there so why is it not happening and this is what I'm facing and I need your help thank you if you have any questions I'd love to answer them for you um [Music] I appreciate the email you sent out so um maybe you are sitting manager republish that email or a website so hope the citizens okay answer um you know I I love some of these uh on the table over there but I'll bring them up I have six copies for you it's the email addresses of the commissioner so you don't have to look them up but this is this is not you know I'm passionate about this this is what I do for a living I'm doing this for 35 years and and this is no joke like if to see where we can't even get an ambulance at times 40 minutes to a cardiac arrest you're not surviving you're not surviving in in 10 minutes right so why are we here and why are our citizens here in this area paying over two million dollars and we're being funded for one unit there's accounting resolution it's a resolution 09-37 that says EMS response zones which there are two here it's ps43 and ps44 which is Beller beats and Bel Air Shores should have an EMS unit in it and that was not even considered and they need your help let's see if you reference the EMS Authority yes [Music] EMS Authority is defined by the laws of Florida that were made in 1980 and mended in 1989 which designates Pinellas County as the EMS Authority which means they have a lot of decision-making power now there is a group officially the authority is the board of County Commissioners but there is a group of a few people that made this decision and there was processes that were supposed to take place it was supposed to go to the EMS advisory Council which is why it's there they're supposed to make recommendations for funding and service levels and the decisions already made and that meeting is not until June 23rd so how does that happen so when I asked for a request I asked please tell me how you came to these decisions I'd like to know your decision Matrix and what you used to establish that this was not worthy of being pushed forward to decision makers a week later I didn't get a response I emailed again oh I'm sorry I was busy I'll get back to you as soon as I can and just Friday which is third time three weeks later friendly reminder I'm waiting on a response you know this is not something that I take lightly uh I'm you know there would be a difference if a service was being paid for and you were getting it right and of course there are some areas that help other areas financially that's the way it goes right but you're paying for a service you have a demonstrated need for a service you can there's nowhere anywhere else in this entire County that there's 5.6 miles between fire stations and you come to the beaches when you're only getting here by Bridge whether we draw bridge or or big bridge or whatever pedestrian traffic and two-lane roads and 30 miles an hour we're not getting anywhere fast there's times where we can't even get to a call because North Boulevard is shut down right there's an accident we need for example and we need other resources that they can't get there without coming a different route or sending different units so we have a geographical mean we definitely have a geographic we are a Barrier Island right and there is a resolution by the county that needs to be considered so yes ma'am [Music] to recommend evening that would be them exactly that would be the Department of Emergency and Safety Services and if you go on the website you'll see exactly the the people in that division who they are yes ma'am yes yes uh the the next uh the actually the budget hearings which are not open for public comment but those are the dates set out June 14 15 16 21 22 and 23 but that's county-wide it hasn't decided what which one of those days is going to be for EMS but I'm absolutely going to be there absolutely and I've set meetings I've had three meetings with County Commissioners already uh and I'm going to continue to follow up but I'm I'm fighting very hard for for the services here for you and for your residents because not only do they deserve it but they're paying for it um encourage residents to do the same thing since anyone in the audience have any questions I'm trying to talk loud I'll bring it back at home that's real quick if you could put together just like a little mini flow chart so you you I'm assuming it's an online form request or is it simply not simply a letter that and that is the request and you send it to group or person if you pay so if you could let us know exact people that are involved I will in that flow about more than happy adults whoever they are that would help I'll actually send you the actual request and then I did a request but then I had supplemental information that I wanted them to consider two other supplements two different types of things that I was putting together to show this is a dire need so I'll get all those things to you you have my email address you can contact me and my phone number's on there as well anytime you call or text me 24 7. I'll answer the phone okay all right thank you all right thank you thank you okay on to item five uh city attorney's report as for City attorney report this is our first and if the last meeting happened just happened to the end of session I've given you a summary and I've since provided you some memoranda on on enactments that specifically impacts you Focus Electric officials and as a community and I continue to work with your city manager on policy will adapt to some of the more right more recent regulatory adoptions one bill we're still watching is Senate Bill 170 it was passed to my knowledge not yet signed by the governor that was the bill that requires us to do an economic impact statements of ordinances and also changes the landscape the legal challenges another similar one is Senate Bill 250 which has a in the follow-up to Hurricane Ian places some land use regulations and restrictions on communities within 100 miles and that's as I understand it as the crow flies from the point of impact for Hurricane Ian which is about 98 of Pinellas County I believe Falls um there might be a slight sliver up by Tarpon but generally speaking again um not yet signed by the governor either that bill makes it so that any land use regulations that are more restrictive may be nullified if they are adopted within two years of the date of uh hurricanese impact and that dates back to September 28 2022 is working back how what is more restricted is not defined fun things we may have done religi or defend against whether here or in other communities otherwise your man your manager and I are quite literally in daily contact on various issues and action items going on in this County and I mean in this community and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have okay thank you my pleasure yes thank you vice mayor starting out with our budget [Music] foreign 19. and uh yeah so we usually have a work session on the third Monday of the month that is our project Workshop s actually this month immediately after the workshop or if you kind of being between the 26th and do we have an agenda started for the next Workshop yes yes I think it what is it five items at this time important stuff work sessions so you could work session yeah yeah so the workshops is okay with that located in the second thing yes okay I'm sorry I couldn't hear you yes Gulf Boulevard underground project and we have locations All Phase One which is south of cosmic Boulevard we have all the locations of equipment figured out except for one which is wanting to have everything set before hiking conduit through the undergrading Consultants of Florida is continuing to ask to try to keep getting moving uh again the stormwater Improvement projects we surveyed the underway by George Avenue and 9th Street recently as they get the screen surveyed they're sending it over to the engineers so together come in and do something else the marina Docker basically went out to be in for the replacement of the pilings and cleaning and wrapping the ones that didn't replace the project will be on one sealed bid and it was another 75 000 if you know how much higher than expected currently we have 52 000 saved for a dock improvements being that such as a chunk of expense I'd like to bring it to the works lesson to discuss some other options it may be the way we never deciding to go or we might want to look at doing more at a later date it would accumulating more money to make sense of where um so I just wanted to just um we just recently got the small amount but close to five thousand dollars back for our [Music] uh [Music] looking nice and wrapped up the uh blog out there brought back to my mind that there's a boardwalk Boardwalk that goes from the Bay Side down to the beach area it's getting in a deteriorated condition my thoughts on it are it's not even necessary to have I would recommend agreement because I don't think it's supposed to replace no one feels not bad there's an observation yeah you know that's still a good condition this one is much older what it does is it locks out um to the sand area and then it steps down but it's concern is it important for the rental place amenities that we have that sure and my gut feeling is no um just because the conditions so I would say no um I could check on that I feel you know you take it out and you still down to the beach really comments about I haven't seen it personally without those people yeah I'd like to hear if there's any feedback from anyone in what they think about it seems to me that if you don't write a prescribed place for people wherever and that there might be additional erosion or a deterioration of the dunes and the mangroves of people are just left to ponder anywhere traffic that that across I'm sorry man just for the record would you mind stating your name and address of course Kim Shaw Elliot one one night street thank you for your comments thank you Society okay um the next council meeting is on July 3rd Monday July 4th Tuesday before the sun Tuesday so that Monday we don't have it everyone's in agreeance thank you um we have a pre-bid meeting yes how many shows and three months okay and only one actually submits a bit yes we had one that submitted it wasn't a sealed it was a sealed estimate for a total of three mile collected all right thanks Kyle I know we're very limited to understand but corned beef picked up this past weekend one of the president's a couple of the president's addressed me about kids or each rate they were offering I don't know I think I've only ever sleep once any way I don't know what your limitations with our personality uh we have a Machinery I mean I guess the biggest waste yeah apparently we drag it we drag it down so it's an annual thing it's in February you can apply electronically to the state um assembly put in for dry annually and storms I have the eight seven rings you I can check with them what's required to up the frequency is about personality yes and now that we don't have very much each it goes pretty quickly so it doesn't start an hour um so yeah let me start with the state of the time now if you're 100 degrees so approximately how long does that tax take okay so like right now I would say a couple hours if I'm back where we've had a nourishment all right just a quick question can we raise the beach we're doing is that correct we start with Bellaire Beach obsession okay okay thank you I just have one item that I wanted to let you know that the Planning and Zoning Board is going to meet on June 14th to review City attorney Mora's draft sign ordinance the sign ordinance yes you're welcome second perfect any discussion citizens comments all in favor all right Dash happily mountain bike this ordinance 23-03 an ordinance of the city council the city of Bellair Beach Florida heading to see Bellaire Beach Comprehensive plan pursuant to the evaluation and Appraisal process of section 163.319 first actions and the amendment process of sections 163.3184 Florida Statutes adopting the goals objectives and policies and Maps as presented here and Below providing for a copy to be kept on file providing for separability providing for the repeal of all ordinances and confirmative and providing for an effective hit this has been the reading ordinance 23-03 on first reading by Doug Bowman thank you second member of Otero motion November Livingstone seconded thank you very much that presentation what do you think can everyone turn off their advice I'm going to try and turn this one on [Music] he's getting the microwave and I'm trying to get speakers together diet hello thank you so good evening it's nice to be here um my name is Linda Fisher I work for forward Pinellas you probably know us best as the countywide agency that coordinates Transportation Planning we also work with land use but wearing another hat we also provide technical assistance to the local governments in particular we do a lot of comprehensive plan updates so that's the Hat I'm wearing today I'm here to help you update your content just as a reminder the purpose of the comprehensive plan is to provide a policy basis for the regulations that the city adopts and the decisions that you make in particular it governs land use Glenn establishes a set of future language categories that establish where different land uses can go in the city and how densely the land can be developed from the state's perspective the purpose of a comprehensive plan is to help regulate the growth of your community but for a stable community like yours for the purpose is really to maintain the quality of life that you have you do need to update your comp plan every seven years to make sure that your policies are still current and to stay up to date with any changes to State months you also have to update the maps and data that support your plan and any terminology or references that change over time and this is also your opportunity to add or update any local policy priorities as you see then and there's a defined process the draft amendments need to be reviewed by your designated local planning agency which in your case is your Planning and Zoning Board your board has done that they held a public hearing on May 8th and voted to recommend that the city council approve the draft that's in front of you and now it's your turn to review the conservative draft dependence the first of two public hearings that you're required to hold for this process if you vote to recruit the Amendments then the next step will be to transmit them to the state for review and I'll talk more about that later in the presentation but first let's take a step back and talk about what's in this draft what would be changing from your current comprehensive plan well the first and most important group of amendments are to address three new state laws that have been passed since you last updated your plan the first is what's called The Parallel flood Act passed in 2015. and it requires you to adopt strategies that address the risks of flooding hurricanes and sea levels in their specific language that you need to adopt so the draft amendments include a number of new objectives and policies to address the new law however year of each community so you've been addressing these issues forever you already do this so it's really just a matter of spelling out what kind of strategies that you are in practice you follow State Coastal Construction codes and postal setback requirements FEMA floodplain management regulations participate in the National flood insurance program and so forth so all I did in this draft was take the things you already do and put it in your in your driving plan another new law that was passed last year is called the private property rights act this law is really largely symbolic it requires you to adopt a new private property rights element in your competitive plan in the statute provided a specific language addressing what people are legally allowed to do with their limits it requires you to respect judicially acknowledged and constitutionally protected private property rights in other words it's acknowledging rights that already exist it's not creating new rights those existing rights state that the government cannot take a person's land and then the property owner has the right to use and control their land but it is subject to state law and local ordinances so and that includes your comprehensive plan and your zoning code so it's also acknowledging your right as a city to practice reasonable land radiation the last of the new laws is one that doesn't have an immediate impact on the city but I included it for due diligence in case it should apply in the future it's called the live local act and it was just signed back in March it allows certain affordable housing developments to override some local comprehensive plan and zoning regulations it only applies to land zone for commercial industrial and mixed use which you don't currently have in the city but I drafted a policy that just acknowledges that the law exists that way if you're if your land visitations could change it should change in the future or if the state law changes in a way to make it apply to the city then you're not in conflict um as noted on the slide I do need to correct on the statutory reference in the policy I inadvertently referenced an identical statute that applies to counties so I just need to update that to the one that governs cities do you have any questions so far about these these three laws so those are the policy amendments that need to be so you're planning and zoning board held a series of meetings between January and may to review the draft plan and I want to commend your board for being very engaged and thoughtful throughout the entire process not every city has that so they were a pleasure to work with they did a technical review of the draft plan and they also voted to make some recommendations to you for updated policy queries highest priority issue that they identified is the high volume of traffic that passes through the city due to higher density Redevelopment and tourism from your neighboring communities well that's not a problem that we can solve for the comprehensive Plan update this is your place to identify actions that you take you could take that might help and that includes things like using the forward Pinellas Forum to work directly with those other local governments in Pinellas County for example you could explore whether there are options for Traffic Control measures or technological or law enforcement that could make it easier for your residents to exit from their local streets Boulevard and it would also be a needs to seek funding to pay for Christmas we also talked about making sure forward Pinellas has accurate data that takes into account that your Rush Hour patterns are different from the mainland yours are different by tourism not nine to five communities and they can't use the same one-size-fits-all approach that we use the board recommends that the city consider designating a specific representative or even a committee to reach out and work report analysts to to work for regressing those issues the next issue that the board identified was the importance of the Bellar Beach Marina your current plan has a policy providing for the potential Redevelopment of the marina with residential uses in the future and the board recommended deleting that policy and replacing it with others that recognize the Marina's importance to the city to declare that um the city desires to keep the marina as a Marina and to prioritize it as much as possible for the enjoyment receiving business so then the last major group of recommended policy editions uh cost savings and additional funding sources through things like seeking grants of state and local transportation funding and even potentially the use of renewable resources looks so now it is the council's decision whether to accept those recommendations or to make any further changes to the draft events if you vote to approve the draft at this first hearing then two things happen next but the document will need to be transmitted to the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity which is the state agency charged with review and compline amendments and copies will need to be sent to a number of other state and Regional agencies and the local governments that are immediately adjacent to you we will all have the option to weigh in my experience is that virtually none of those people will actually weigh in but they have 30 days to do it and then overlap in that same time period Deo has 60 days to review the plan once they are done with their review they will issue what's called an objections recommendations and comments report or report and if they feel that anything that you've proposed doesn't meet state law or needs a technical review then they'll let you know typically we get one or two very minor comments just wanting us to update citations or clarify something so that's usually not not a great deal the city has 180 days to respond to the orc again I don't think it will take that long once you make changes then you hold a second public hearing to officially adopt the updated comprehensive plan it goes back to Deo they have another 45 days to review and unless there is an expensive challenge then it becomes becomes effective as soon as they issue their notice that they found it on time so there is a built-in process where citizens can challenge or con Plan update but I've been doing this for 25 years and I have literally never seen it happen and that is your comprehensive plan of day process if any questions will be happy to answer no thank you okay so we have a motion and a second on the floor are there um any citizens comments citizen have any questions or comments yes [Music] ready yes please council member Banker yes councilmember Livingstone yes councilmember Notaro council member Roberts yes council member stable yes vice mayor Shirley hi I'm moving on to item 11 consideration of

service to this community thank you very much thank you for your home second [Music] any discussion unfortunately yeah very impressive right away okay all in favor all right okay item 13. consideration to approve the adopt-a-part program agreement from the city of Bellaire Beach this is an association with the Bellar Beach Community Foundation and um Mr reefer is going to give a presentation on this but do we have a motion to move forward okay thank you Kyle so this is an agreement to enable the communication programs within the city and um worked out with the lrbh Community Foundation and the agreement allows for businesses churches schools neighborhood uh Civic groups or even just individual items to give back to the community by donating amenities planting plants kind of lays out timetables based on what the individual or group is donating for that program quality adoption ideas programs will be submitted approved by the city so as they come in something the Foundation uh the donations of monetary donations on they also have um it goes through the foundation to enable the donator to kind of taxes the city once said Park is adopted by a group of individuals the city of England such and such during this period of time we continue to talk about responsibilities of the city and responsibilities that the city does as far as mowing trimming of

if they want to maintains they want to stop but the idea is again to just allow the community to help improve Colorado City and we brought this to the park recreation Advisory Board and narrow support of it and uh okay thank you Kyle um Council any questions any resonated questions okay so with no further discussion all in favor all right okay thank you all right I am 14. any unfinished business okay city council comments let's see we'll start with you and just run down the line I just want to thank appreciate your service um last walker is discussing about flood insurance problems and doing insurance and I was put on the flood litigation board I attended my first meeting this past month it was mostly about blood risks getting information out of the surrounding communities that are involved a portion of the search with surges and how it occurred and where it starts I've also been in contact as a 30 percent of Scott's office since late next year 2.0 I was under the impression that Ian was going to impact this area and about taking back this year with the questions which it is not going to fly today that another private shorter [Music] Senator Scott is trying to introduce legislation this month and get more private insurance back into the market our state senators did the same thing last December when insurance was nothing mess the problems really aren't that hard to decide back in 1900 there was a town a little bit West of West Galveston and experiencing cat fighting with the hurricane wiped out the whole town level two years later they built three mile sea wall extended it over the years to 10 miles yeah I see Walters at 15 feet in a bike I'm not saying we need a second for the seated one way we should be investing our money because Ian's being caused the federal government four billion dollars just for that one score so I want to satisfy I said why don't we take that one in investment storm drainage catch basins punks Sea Wolves instead of just pump it out under repair these homes that get washed away every year or whatever like that well I don't know if that would resonate to the taxpayers but we can just keep spending cash foolishly so sailing today I was finally giving information because I've been after this 2.0 just give my constituents your constituents Mr Scott so explanation on where a city discount 20 we received along with somebody submitting an elevation certificate and Jason Gray is the bottom grade of the ground okay so your stream is to generally Jason Gray take a show on your yard dig down you'll find Sam about a foot down okay so that dirt what's in here originally it came in when they built the houses so you got a question like that anyway no one can show me where there's a Jason Gray discount so now I was giving a layer side that was told to fill out a form this is just more I can see why Chief Davidson gets upset um so I can Privacy Act and set for school so I feel like I'm just going back around in this marriage I guess the record is from the presidency but the other thing I wanted to mention was I visited Morgan Park Saturday Memorial Day weekend and Sunday and I know we've got a lot of clap about 11 o'clock thank you thank you nothing for me either but thank you all for coming out and joining us for the meeting tonight and have a good week um thank you"
