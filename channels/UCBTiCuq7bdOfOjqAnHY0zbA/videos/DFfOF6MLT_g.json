    "transcript": "come to order please welcome everyone to the august 2nd regular city council meeting of the city of bellaire beach please join me for the pledge of allegiance yeah council member leslie otero councilmember rita smoke vice mayor dave gaddis here joseph manzo here city manager lee lynn reeves city attorney fred riley and councilmember robin aki was unable to attend okay thank you first item of business is approval of the agenda motion please subscribe a second any discussion any comments from the city back to council all in favor aye opposed passes six euro agenda's approved next comes the citizen commons we have a three-minute presentation by any citizen that would like to address us the procedure for this is as follows one second you come up to the podium here please give your name and residency i will tell you that there should be out there and on that presentation table or a little conduct that is the rules that we operate by um you speak respectfully to the council and we'll just speak respectfully with you that's the basic just of 12 rules there you have three minutes of time unless someone gives you extra time you cannot speak on any item that's on the agenda during this portion if there's something you wish to speak of that's on the agenda i will call for citizen comments at that time and he'd come up and speak at that point okay so if it's on the agenda you'll talk later about it if it's not on the agenda now is the time to speak to the council finally the last thing is don't expect counsel to get a discussion with you we're not permitted under the rules to speak back and forth with you so the most we're going to say to you is thank you i do have the option of referring something of concern to the city manager to the city attorney with that said someone anyone like to speak with council yes sir speak right to the mic about two inches away you'll be fine joshua center street i'm going to be talking about the federal lawsuit so if you're able to recuse themselves about a year ago a council member rita vote put forth the motion to remove june vancouver from the parks airport it didn't have anything to do with her job performance it was in part due to what she said at the bellaire shores council meeting twice this council was warned by the mayor that this was a violation of her first amendment rights the city attorney also warned not to remove her three of the council members who voted to pass this motion are still active which is glenn young swope dave gaddis they ignored this legal advice due to them proving that they're not capable of putting the city's best interest ahead of their own personal attunements and personal open dentists even to the extent of getting the city involved in a six-year lawsuit i call them they do the right thing and they stand down and resign from their position and not cause any reliability to the city thank you thank you for your call now yes good evening my name is jolie rodero and i live on 113 12th street i also have um in case i run over three minutes from my husband p and from lindelof would you hang on one second please on that can i show that's not just the hands please is that correct you're giving your three minutes and yes miss welsh yes patty nine minutes from missouri darrow is roderick on the floor i begin with like our green support judge hollis's statement that due to this some members of this council's behavior the city is now facing a large federal discrimination suit and of which most likely the balliard beach rio has to pay for their defense i would ask that they all resign as well what i'm really going to talk about is a sign that's um being planned for outside and i'm assuming that perhaps maybe i wasn't meaning correctly that you've already had permitting requests done or any kind of studies done because if if it hasn't occurred yet you will need them not only the permitting but you will need environmental studies and you will need traffic impact studies because we've contacted the dot and those are going to be mandatory i would like it that if you have any studies with reference to that sign that i can have a copy of it bella beach belongs to the florida coastal island sanctuaries program that works to protect certain and endangered coastal birds two particular birds the little blue heron and the tri-colored heron they nest right out there on bird island right outside of our city hall and they're threatened and endangered it is part of this floral coastal program to protect these endangered birds the retention pond across the street is also home to local and endangered migrant and migratory birds and it's also our responsibility to protect them we're constantly being told to shut off bright lights to save the sea turtles uh yet bright lights affect all wildlife they affect their flying habits their breeding habits believe city hall is already lit up like the taj mahal every single night and now we will have a colored blinking or rotating bright electric sign in front what is the impact of this sign on traffic slowing stopping to be designed we already have that upside up and down uh the causeway what is the impact on the homeowners that face the causeway what is um most importantly are coastal and dangerous birds how is that damage measured and what is beller beach city going to do about that i'd like to know if in the course of the evening if you have charged a committee to study these topics and the environmental impact on the sign and when they meet so that i can follow up on that i think the true measure of the sun is a potential revenue that the city could see by renting out space on its advertising side and i will request again i request copies of all the studies since i don't know how the city is going to conduct this business i would like to make some suggestions in the event that it continues to go on and go through the sign whether the sign be turned off at night every night like the closing of the beach dates that the colors the brightness the solid versus blinking or the sun be selected to cause the least harm to the birds what is the increased cost of operating this sign is this in the budget has it been accounted for how about the longevity of the sun usually it's about eight years and how will it be disposed adding to landfill and is there again i already asked if there's a sign committee charged with the completion of these studies and if so i'd like to know the members and when they meet thank you thank you before you step away you made several requests for those to be considered public records requests okay then um one second so um i don't i know i'm sure patty wasn't taking notes of this but she can review the tape or the uh or the video later that's fine i appreciate that you for your comments um yeah we're not supposed to interact with the interactive okay i'd like to respond here we'll need permission uh we're not supposed to interact with the residents okay so if you're going to dispense with the rules then we should have done that in the beginning but if you want to make a motion dispense with the rules we'll dispense with the rules yes i'd like to emotion that i respond to that last since this comment what we normally do at a previous meeting we seem to be tightening up the rules just for this one occasion and i'd like to just kind of relax so i can make the commentary i'll second that second debate i'll debate it we don't tighten up or loosen the rules at all for one person the rules of the rules ordnance says you don't interact with residents so if you want and we have at times had an interaction with residents so um if that's what the council votes for then we'll have the interaction with the residents it's not my job to make the words on the fly did i respectfully request the call to questions you know if you wanted to be mayor you should have ran for it i win i won on the mayor you don't know your procedure what happens after you get done talking what's the next spot does anybody know i think debate debate and then after debate what happens anybody just jump right in some comments citizen comments correct the mundo and if i don't let the citizens speak what am i violating the open public meeting rules so we don't hold the question yet but thank you to spare the commentary move on well you want to call the question you've tried that before it didn't work in the past it's not going to work with me i accept your friendly reminder no problem any other council comments well yes i would like to make a comment uh it seems that we just randomly ban the rules whenever we feel like it i think basically you pick your favorites and those are the ones that we comment back and forth with everybody else that you don't agree with they're ignored and uh and chastised so i think if mr gunn would like to respond i'm i'm all in for it and the personal attack rule that you just did saying i pick and choose favorites would that be like you when you pick and choose your motion favor right back at you my friend okay i'll pick favorites the rules the rule says you don't act like a child you get that from a friend the rule says we don't have an interaction every time we've had an interaction the council voted to have that information unless you change the ordinance which you don't have time to do because you're sticking your notes in my lawsuit you wind up having all we have with that said any further council comments everyone heard that his lawsuit oh yeah you took you a city council resolution to figure it out my lawsuit man david michael gaddis i would just like to if [Music] these poor people that sit here until 11 o'clock at night they want to go home and uh make noise i'd love to entertain your thoughts and wishes and desires you're the people that run the city or you know your tax money so i i understand thank you any citizen comments the child is welcome to comment too no just on this motion to uh to open it up for back and forth okay back to council uh i have one more uh which is um i know that everyone feels like i'm trying to stifle them but the truth is is that our mayor which i'm not allowed to address actually moves citizen comments to the end of the night i'm the one who got them back for you it wasn't for me you'd all be here at 11 o'clock so i hope you remember that yes and that stroke of brilliance by david who was a council member at the time the reason why i moved him to the end of the night mr gunn if you're going to keep playing with your fingers go outside and play with yourself and come back when you're done okay mr gaddis it was at the end of the night so that we would have a major action which would have been our immediate point thereafter you moved it to the beginning and our part doesn't come until oh item 17 we're on item two so we're the ones who got penalized by your brilliance i'll call the question all in favor of having a dialogue back and forth with each person who comes up on citizen comments this evening i i unopposed mr gunn you may address miss ridero you are up here right now and you have plenty of time left so mr gunn will now address your comments thank you i just want to address some of the issues you raised about the ginger on sign because i think there's a concern that the city is just leaking into this thing blindly we're going to put a digital electronic sign out there okay so the city manager and his staff is diligently working on some implementation and ordinance guidelines for curving down the road when other people may come forward and say hey i want a digital sign so with respect to the background the city of baylor beach has begun the acquisition process to replace an older monument sign okay the new sign will incorporate electronic panels that provide an efficient and effective means of displaying timely public notifications the displays are highly customizable with respect to color font size brightness screen transition and animation and the message blog time which is how long the message stays on the screen okay in order to balance the public service provided by an electronic display with traffic safety as well as a residential community ambiance of flavor of ballard beach the following guidelines are being distilled and looked in okay because we've done some research and there are gold standards for how progressive communities implement electronic science okay it's not new technology and there's a lot of guidance out there of how people have done it successfully as well as how people have done a good part where we just have uh created new problems okay so with those thoughts in mind further down the road i i anticipate that the city will be talking and working with our planning and zoning committee for future requests for digital signs and the considerations dealing with some of these electronic signs within the city of delaware beach the areas of emphasis with respect to what china science includes some of the following okay i know in the future there was a concern about oh well anybody can just put a digital sign now wherever they want well the gold standard is you tie the placement of digital signs basically to the volume of traffic on roadways so if you if you put some constraints around the volume of traffic on the roadways obviously you don't have the traffic volume on a residential street so that might prohibit you from placing a electronic sign advertising that your house is for sale or you have a garage sale this weekend or something along those lines okay uh there is also some considerations for whether the electronic sign is placed on the person's premise or the business premise or off the premise so again these are a lot of things that we're looking at and trying to understand and be smart about with the implementation of this thing there are guidelines for the setback how far back from the street you have to place this sign and there are also traffic safety impacts okay there are concerns about the hours of operation and one of the factors like he said there are energy consumption costs to this thing and typically those are a little more expensive than a residential home it can be up to you 30 times depending on how bright it is or how how many hours of operation here but so we're being respectful trying to understand that and understand that this thing may not need to be on 24 hours a day there are also concerns about brightness in daylight these gold standard is less than 5 000 nips which is a unit of brightness for these signs if you drive around and look at some of the signs that are out there on commercial properties they are very offensive and never at any time was the goal or the anticipated need meant to be a bright fireworks display sign okay at other times other than daytime the uh the gold standard is less than 250 so you can see that it changes greatly from day to night and of course there's an auto adjust function uh that's basically tied to the ambient lightning so on a cloudy day and certainly not with the size will be a function of zoning or adjacent structures and that's tied to the planning and zoning and any possible groundwork that relay for future zoning restrictions on this thing there are concerns and gold standards about minimum message duration which is this wall time i'm talking about how long should that message be on display on that screen the issue there is if you have too short of dwell time like three to five seconds you're creating a distraction to drivers so what you do is you set a minimum dwell time of like 11 seconds which is the standard for a 35 mile per hour roadway in a view when you come in to view it at 500 feet so i mean this stuff isn't just made up there are standards forcing and stuff and we're looking very seriously at this stuff we're not just going to jump into this thing barney and of course the last thing is uh maximum transition time and you don't want the same too slow or otherwise people will be looking at the side waiting for it to change over and you don't want to have sequential messages you don't want to have screen a tied to screen b because then that's a distraction as well so you limit sequential messages and you you maximize the amount of time that the screen changes display okay so i think what i'm just trying to uh say here is that we what we're doing and we're putting some critical thought to this thing we're not just shotguning and approaching this thing yeah this the display has to have a default setting so if there is a problem with the display or the power outage or some problem with the display it shuts off basically so you don't have a funny message out of the sign blanking flashing and distracting drivers no interactive displays with pedestrians or cars some of these other municipalities are getting so advanced with this stuff as your car drives by the digital sign interacts with with your telephone or your caller to say hey you know hey why don't you stop in and we'll give you a free uh free free stay at the hotel if you come in and register any questions on any of them mr gunn but i beg to differ if you didn't address any of my comments which were particularly about environmental studies or not speaking about environmental studies being done to impact words or the traffic study you haven't done from what i've heard from you any kind of official study you're just following guidelines that are published out there which is great but i don't trust the council since the idea of this sign to begin with was in opposition of all the residents that responded to your survey twice that they didn't want this sign yet you went ahead shotgunning as you said the signed head so since it's coming whether we like it or not it's being rammed down our throats i want to make sure that you do follow all the guidelines that there is an environmental study not just you reading your guidelines just you designing what so-and-so is doing down the street but that the governmental agencies say this will not damage these birds these will not damage will not impact our traffic we know the traffic here is horrific on the weekends and on the set and we don't want any more distractions so all you told me was how the sound works and frankly i don't care how the sound works because i don't want the sign i think it is a crass destruction uh distraction to their city we don't need that sign i think i heard a gentleman in our last your last council meeting and i think he's the gentleman that maybe the company that's going to do the sign from the way he was speaking and i think the primary reason is the uh revenues that advertising and that sign are going to be able to bring well at least it will offset the high cost of running the sign so i thank you for your comments i don't like your comments on your council i think you will sound like high schoolers or middle schoolers figuring back and forth protocol is protocol and you need to follow the rules that's how we are all civil i follow the rules i don't speak longer than i have to right thank you thanks for doing my honest with us mr daryl hang on mr dara i wanted to address your comments i have a right to speak here too at least on this issue i you said it exactly what i was thinking i don't care how many pixels nips and whatever the hell the sign runs with i care about what you just brought up which i was unaware of environmental studies and traffic studies that i not i have not heard one word about in any of the planning of this and why would that be any different i'm going to show later on this letter that i demanded from the florida dep you might remember that beautiful cos were clear-cut to the ground in november by our city manager and he didn't know any better despite the fact that there was a sign on more than 20 foot away from the sixth street uh dunes that sign's been removed i still have a picture of it we like to say we didn't know any better no one told us that was wrong i didn't know i couldn't run that red light well dep does have rules and if you're aware of them then i'm going to refer this to our city attorney and to our city manager for follow-up we have a citizen that has said that there's rules i have i'm aware of no studies that have been done whatsoever so i'd like to know if there have been studies and if they have done if their studies if they've been done and what the results of those studies are so that we don't get any more dep letters telling us we broke more rules and more laws that also goes for the department of traffic uh and there's a highway study that needs to be done i believe that's the county a county road out there so i guess it's the county i don't know you've done more research city manager well we haven't done any studies and i i think she's erin on the on the wrong side personally and uh there's a lot of things you do studies for there was a sign out there that put put out more lumens than this thing does and now you're telling me that this signs bad for the birds yeah we had a sign out there that put out more light than this sign so i i will look into it just to clarify and i'll get you get you an answer and i'll get the console answer we'll bring up the studies and the conversations with guillotine i will send it to you so that you can that's what we spoke to i don't think d.o.t has anything to do with this i have i have one comment also um i have seen online and uh from neighbors that we intend on advertising on this sign um i know everyone on the council and we've met and we have not one time discussed ever advertising just because the salesman brings up that you can do it with this sign does not mean we're going to do it you could very well say we can throw it in the water we're not going to do it so i appreciate uh your honesty and if if you're going to post things online you might as well clarify and say this is my opinion that they're going to advertise instead they're probably going to advertise they that is my opinion and i can't post it any way i like it in your council meeting last month the salesman or the gentleman actually said it because there was um i want to say reluctance a little reluctance from the council and says oh and by the way you can do this and get revenue now based on the way this council has performed i don't put anything past it so if there's a way to make money in that site i'm sure you will find it and we'll both work i appreciate you growing up for wildlife issues and everything like that and i'm all for wildlife but just go right down the street here at night street for years there's been sea ducks that harbor on that beach once it was a protected beach that no now you have the ski-doo cpus whatever you want motorized chris i think they think the bowling pins some of these kids try to you know that's right you have the electric bikes that clear the path they almost hit me i mean i'm a bigger target of course but uh and you know what i've contacted the fwc and i don't want to show what figure figure or finger they gave me here they more or less stayed and i got a reply back tonight about the buoys okay and i've been asking for a meeting with the mayor about our shores and everything like that so the attorney from the fwc contacted me tonight at 5 30 to 5 15 there and said you can file for a variance but you have to be under this statute please click the link click the link it says statute not available government government at its best because i agree with you with reference to the beach in the sense of the buoys are missing and the boat's coming those tweets and the mayor brings up that dep letter and i responded to everyone on that letter last week and crickets came back they're more concerned about a moaning i call it a boeing mismatch that people getting skin cancer on the beach ducks being killed manatees no longer being protected in that certain area they used to always swim in may okay migrating up and migrate down that's okay it's just about being vocal and nonstop thank you thank you folks i want to just give you one up sorry in one second um if somebody says something you agree with or you don't agree with our rules call that the audience has to stay quiet so i you know i hear applause but you know we don't want to have applause and doing stuff like that the rule is we're supposed to just basically sit there as the audience so please let's follow that one sir okay my name is and i live on the bayshore 27th flight right around morgan uh i just come out here just to look forward the lady that was here earlier and i'm 100 with her as far as the uh having a street light and i don't know you all my name but the gentleman over here who give us a wonderful description of what the sign and all the statistics of what this sign is about but yet you use the terminology of destruction destructive keeping it away from being disrupted many many times that only tells me that this sign will be destructive and you're basically trying to fine tune how to make that less destructive it's to me clear understanding that sound will be disrespectful for the libraries so and i'm also supporting work from an environment so that's why i'm here thank you any other citizens like to announce it so john hansen 22nd street i have thought seriously about whether or not to come up here tonight because i didn't know if i could contain myself i'm really livid with it going on the lawsuit the sign i don't think that we've done right and i'm not going to use council members names in general or directly someone at the last council meeting or who won before because i was out of town for the special meeting in the work session but i like the wave i want it just cost the taxpayers five thousand dollars more because that was personal it wasn't in the best interest of the city and yet two surveys were conducted 76 of the people said they didn't want it you didn't listen to we the people that's who you represent that's who you serve the second item that really upset me i didn't make that last meeting because i was preparing to go on vacation i find out somebody on council decided they wanted to look into a new city attorney or for whatever reason review the contract i don't know what was said how it was said calendar whatever i intend to listen to the voice the tape of that meeting i'm shocked i have a great deal of respect for mr riley i have said so on multiple occasions he's given this counsel wise counsel and try to keep you all out of trouble and now he has given his notice and yet you've been served with a federal lawsuit i don't know of a lawyer who would want to touch it with a 20-foot pole in conclusion i concur with the other residents who have also said the same thing those that you named in that suit you need to step down thank you thank you mr hansen i did not mention anybody by name i said thank you i just missed player what's um i was just supposed to bankrupt the comments um well the sign there was a long debate about it they got passed i made comments and i was getting responses four to one against it i agree with you i believe this residents did not want it i would like to knock on everybody's door in this township where they came on his campaign and say give me 40 bucks for the sign because that's what it would cost right i don't think anyone would show well i shouldn't take anymore majority of the residents would never sell that money and for clarification i was not at for last week there was a vote taken but i expressed wholeheartedly i could not hear it and there was no way mr riley that i was voting to have you replace i thought it was for other that was coming forward that they were seeking to entertain i think you've done a marvelous job i got your goals right here the last three months there's not one flying item here that's not reasonable not and anybody works for a living when pay all right i i think mr riley does a marvelous job for us he tells me everything i don't want to hear but that's his job all right all right mean and then you go forward and i i we got a resignation from letter from you today or a couple weeks ago i hope you do not resign from us especially in the budget yes sir um to your three points okay first off with regards to the sign it's it's something it's been voted on unfortunately there are some issues and there might be a possibility if there's something technical issue it might be stopped but it's going to go forward okay and i didn't vote for it and frank banker didn't vote for it and robbing and that's okay we can use names these are this is a vote you own your vote i've said that before you own it if you make it um that's the first thing um i was going to wait until later on but since you brought the topic up with fred riley that was at the work session last time that's why you missed it it wasn't at the regular council meeting and it's available on tape you could hear it the person who made that was the same person who was uh after 22 years of paul marino said we were moving too fast to put his contract out for me it had never been been bid once in 22 years but this had been not even 22 months and there was this great urgent need in that person's opinion to bid this contract they were ready to authorize the city manager that night to go out to bid and i said he couldn't do that he had to bring it to this meeting mr riley listened to the tape he and i spoke afterwards after he listened to that tape he told me what was going to happen and i was just blown away i was blown away that we lost a fine attorney an excellent attorney there was a comment made last time that when we'll bid it out and if fred riley is the best we can do well then we'll keep him you'll never do better than fred riley never this man has given this city umpteen three hours see how many attorneys give free hours see if any of the attorneys that will bid on this job if any attorneys bid on his job give you free hours he's also given expert legal advice and i know i'm an attorney i can speak from authority yes he's told people some things they don't want to hear and then don't follow it sometimes because they know more um fred riley did an excellent job not only did he do an excellent job he did an excellent job about defusing some very difficult situations not just here but on the outside what comes to mind was our city manager ripping out campaign signs last year and a citizen i believe his name was mr alfandullos came to our council meeting uh this man happened to be a partner in a major law firm that specialized in constitutional law and he said i'm not going to sue your city but basically i could have fred riley worked with him to defuse the situation and make sure he never got into another 1983 lawsuit you can thank fred riley for that he did that all himself and there's been other times when he's intervened and stopped really you know potentially dangerous situations legal dangerous situations from becoming dangerous situations he's a fine attorney he's an honest attorney he's a good man i'm gonna miss you it's a loss of great loss to our city a great loss and this mayor will always support you and i'll support you if i'm not the mayor and i will defend you against anybody who wants to give some revisionist history i was here and i know what you said and i know what you did you're an excellent attorney in my book so i share your sentiments mr henson mr donald with respect to the sign that the council voted to acquire that was the original sign design that was brought to this council where you usually went out to look for an electronic sign and that design was unanimous unanimously considered appropriate at the time and the design that we wanted with the wig okay at that time the council when they found out the fun was in excess of 50 000 the council said no we think we could do better than that and we sent the uh the contractor back to the drawing board and they came back with a sign that was twenty thousand dollars cheaper so without be laboring going through any additional cycles on this thing we voted for the original design and it lets reduced costs so you know i recognize that no amount of discourse will change anyone's opinion in here but that was the sign that was unanimously voted for except for the prize originally by the council i respect your first amendment rights as does everybody on this council and thank you very much for bringing those for us thank you listen um i want to agree with what dave said what the mayor said um i was very upset to get the resignation notice he's done a wonderful job for us been very understanding through some difficult times and i don't want to go could you re rescind your resignation yeah i'll second that anybody else no i can count so you know out of seven i can count four and i appreciate the comments everyone's made but i don't see a compelling reason unless you y'all have something else you want to tell me i i mr riley i think important if the councils had full session here with more members i think you would get four votes i think you would get four votes if rob an occupancy well i i'm going to be continue to be hopefully a consummate professional i came into this job it has been very difficult because the as i've said before the council has very different viewpoints and there's been conflict during the time that i've been here and i've done my very best to bridge the conflict the um the way i took the vote that you had at a meeting where i wasn't in attendance was basically a vote showing of no confidence and that's fine you can have a vote of no confidence but if that's what i'm faced with i can count and i really don't have any grand uh desire to go through the procedure of going through an rfp for a position that that i currently have i would hope that each one of the seven of you would recognize that i have done a good job under difficult circumstances but having said all that if you all decide it's time to make a change that's fine there's not going to be hard feelings for me i am a professional i've been a lawyer for almost 35 years and this isn't the first time that i and a client saw things differently and we parted ways and as a professional i will part ways and i will uh wish you the best and i hope you'll do the same for me that's a roundabout answer to your question um but it is you know it has been the thing that deters me from reconsidering anything is the level of conflict on the council and i i don't know that i can fix that i can't i admit it will fix it in two years so i if you all decided it was time to make a change i respect your decision and i will graciously step aside mr riley i have a proposal for you philly's nice making proposal in front of 50 people item eight on the agenda tonight is to offer the council to authorize the city manager to bid for services for an attorney now if your resignation stays we have no choice but to approve that even i would have to vote for that one because our city must have a city attorney however we're going to open that up for discussion and i just heard leslie and taro say something and leslie was one of the people that supported bringing this up to originally bringing this to this discussion but now it seems like there's been a change of opinion i can count too and what i'm leaning is leslie the tarot is on our side here we have leslie we have me i think frank bancard and we have i know robin hockey when she gets back because she voted against you and you belong with me so you may have your four books and i don't want this to be something i'm never going to hold you to something that you don't want to do our city right now needs a competent excellent attorney more than ever we need someone to get and you can see what's going on the council i can't help you i'll do my best to try and help you make the council work together it's going to be a little bit of an effort i think given the situation but we'll try i'll commit to you that i'll do my best what that's worth it'll take six other people to do that um but i'm gonna ask you to reconsider you don't have to make a decision right this moment but item eight is coming up um and at that point i'm gonna ask you to you know what you might want to do i can call a special counsel meeting and wouldn't lose any ground again i can't let the city have no attorney so you're going to have to vote for that but i'd be voting because you're not in the i want you out position the position that's a big difference and i think leslie's also the other attorney up here we have two real attorneys on this council and she recognizes how good you are you all do well i'll make one more comment and that is the unfortunate thing that you this board and every other board in florida has is you can't discuss things unless you're in a public meeting to discuss them so i fully understand why that makes things complex i fully understand you know there may be a difference of opinion and that's that's fine again stress i respect the fact that there are differences of opinion and i will conquer it until item comes up [Music] so that i guess is my answer for now mr riley the baby's crying maybe he wants you here too [Music] anyone else on counseling we have mr hansick sitting here you sure did i think you do okay first off all right mr gunn thank you for your comment i appreciate that about my first amendment rights i'm taking seriously and um yes in conjunction with what just transpired here i followed the strategic plan being built and everything and how that was supposed to be the cornerstone your road map if you will council conduct business for the city if i may because i've seen it different times in the course of time where personal opinion gets in the way of city business and it clouds judgment that's not what you're looking for i have been in elected office not public office but i've been in elected office and one of the things that i was always told don't think about what's good for the short term what's good for the organization what's best for the organization in this case the organization is the city of bellaire beach its citizens that's who you all serve listen to the citizens weigh their input and again seventy percent of the people i understand signs a dead issue but it's like this thumbs your nose as what's in the best interest of the city going forward that's all i ask as a taxpayer citizen and i'm sure these folks out here that's all they ask but the partisanship aside it's we the people thank you thank you mr hansen any other citizens like to address the council yes and it's very very uh lonely toast one question just to first who's going to be the arbiter of the truth that's going to go on this side too do you have a public interpretation of this i'm sorry i i could barely hear your comments mr gray you got to talk right into that [Music] and do you have a public information officer there is no public information officer and the sign is controlled by our city manager many other citizens like to address counsel see now their hands on closest and comments and move to be presentation by the pinellas county sheriff's department sheriff's office i see two sheriff's officers will one of you be making the presentation tonight council in regards to any new items to discuss regarding crime in the city there's nothing new or anything to pass on everything is your city to live in from primary good clarification okay any questions concerns comments sheriff i love it when you bring me a bunch of zeros zero crime zero nothing i mean we had nothing again this is i think two months in a row uh kudos to the men and women on the department excellent job as always excellent job to our citizens who are out there paying attention to what's going on in their neighborhoods because they don't do it alone they have some good help but it doesn't get any better than this so all i can say is thank you and please keep up the wonderful work thank you very much the sheriff walked away did anybody have any questions for him while he was up here okay thank you all right we have uh knight and four's presidential presentation of florida league city's certificate of completion for the leadership academy one to vice mayor dave gaddis the fourth in a series would focus on characteristics to lead to the opportunities and challenges of municipal service so we have that down here presentation too all right so i'm going to present this certificate of completion to vice mayor gaddis complete leadership academy one is run by the florida league of cities we have a certificate for you and it looks like all that also so congratulations okay next four four items are consent agenda i'm gonna read all four of them i'll ask for a motion and we will approve them there's no discussion on a consent agenda item folks so we're just going to pass this fairly quickly consent agenda item number five approval of july 12 2021 city council meeting minutes item six approval of july 19 2021 budget workshop minutes item seven approval of july 17 special city council meeting minutes and eight request well [Music] ima is in consent agenda request authorization for city manager to advertise for legal services i do believe we're going to have some discussion maybe on that and we've already passed the agenda agenda i'm going to have to defer to that city attorney because i i thought that we had with an agent once an agenda's passed you can't move at this point yeah me too but you got a lot more than me so paul um can we move at this at this point i thought once an agenda is approved it can't i mean we're not deleting it we're just moving it off the consent agenda to to thoroughly discuss any item i i don't see why you couldn't do that we're not removing it we're just moving it into the regular business okay i have a motion by leslie tara to move item eight into the regular agenda do you have a second second by frank banker we've discussed it i think we need to have some discussion there so i don't want to move it off the consent and put another record i think we need a discussion um whether it passes or doesn't pass i think we need to discuss this in fairness to mr riley and to the citizens of this city back here anyone else's comments i'll move to the city residence any comments back to council leslie at the last word okay so the what we're voting on now is a simple movement we're not passing anything we're taking item eight off the consent agenda we're gonna move it actually it's gonna be the next item so it's gonna go right to the regular agenda right before item nine so a yes vote moves that um let's do this patty i'm gonna do this i want this done by uh by voice but not my voice vote by um one poll okay council member banker yes council member gun name council member ontario yes councilmember [Music] vice mayor gavis mayor manson uh i so because we're missing robin hockey we're deadlocked at three threes of motion fads so i'll call this consent agenda with item eight in it um request authorization for the city manager to advertise for legal services and this would allow him to the explanation of this conceit consensus at a budget workshop to advertise and request for proposals just note that consensus was five to two and one of the persons who voted five was didn't hear what he was voting on so it was really four to three probably okay um motion to approve the consent agenda in its totality again i'm going to ask that this be done in a voice uh in a uh an appalled vote so what we're doing i'll call this question properly i'll re-read it i'm 5 six seven eight approval uh five approval of the july 12 2021 city council meeting minutes uh item six approval of july 19 2021 budget workshop minutes item seven approval of july 19 2021 special city council meeting minutes and item eight request authorization for the city manager to advertise for legal services for the city attorney yes vote passes all of them no vote kills it madam clerk council member banker no councilmember gunn hi councilmember no tarot no council members quote i absolutely now so it's three to three guess what consent agenda is not approved we will not have any further discussion on how to make those so that will come up with a special meeting if we need to do it we're without a city attorney folks in two weeks is it two weeks mr riley two weeks right we have left 19 19 we're without a city attorney regular agenda parking uh item nine regular agenda park and recreation board event approval this is for council approval of the events that have been proposed by the board funding is in the approved budget i thought i saw the parks board chairperson here is she still here yes would you like to speak with us before we do this no i mean if you have any questions i think we will yeah i know i will um so why don't you come up first let me get a motion dave gaddis second okay second reader dave uh nope let's hear it okay just give us your information for the record and then um whatever you wish just tell us regarding the proposal and then we'll go with council questions and citizen questions i'm not sure if you want me to read this or i mean i everyone okay so everyone's received a copy of it hopefully they've reviewed it if you want to just hit us with the highlights and any information that you couldn't put on there that maybe you want to extrapolate on or you know anything that you think we need to know before everybody has if it may not be any questions but am i a few so okay yeah okay no problem um so we have three events that we're looking at towards the end of the year that we're asking you to vote on one is jazz in the park which is set uh saturday september 25th from five to eight so we're just trying to keep them i just from bringing this up over the last couple of months we just tried to cover everybody's points like we wanted to make sure it was a bellar beach private party residence only we wanted to keep it simple it's just low-key not about no vendors just um relax and listen to some music sit outside enjoy the weather and get to know some of our neighbors that we don't know so we try to keep it simple with the budget and if you have any questions about anything on there you guys have questions about parking and we provided the schematics on like where things would be but because there's so little you know there was just maybe two or three things on each map the second event would be basically like a pet and house halloween costume parade for the kids and i know there's a lot of dogs in this community so it's just a morning event a simple parade and then a contest and we had some nice prizes for first second and third place because i know i've seen these um before and people go to a lot of trouble and they spend a lot of money for some of these costumes so we wanted to make sure that they were you know if they really want first place that they you know was appreciative of their price and then the third one is just a super simple holiday social tree lighting on monday december 6th from five to six before council meetings so we figured people would be here and just a little holiday cheer i put out a bid for some christmas carolers and just we would have some you know whatever cookies and hot depending on the weather so i mean i'd be happy to answer any questions that you have they pretty much have all the information in the packet that was provided i don't really have any questions but i did want to thank you for this report that's what i've been asking for for a very long time it was very detailed very organized and i really appreciated it so thank you very much and um i was at the last event participated in it as leave most of the people up on this council um and i i saw the spin i read the spin and then i i'm sorry what i don't know what you meant here the last the the last well the big event that we have here is jazz in the park and it's analogous to the festival that we had um first i wasn't at it so i'm not familiar with anything i was so that's why i'll give you some information there was no problem with outsiders attending this we had a handful of people that attended um i believe um one or two people actually commented from indian rocks what a wonderful time they had in our city they got to see it chance that they didn't really normally get there was no overflow streets were not crowded with people in fact the only people that parked on the streets were the vendors um it was far from there was no street that was full of people in fact the uh city-wise garage sale causes one hell of a mess on our streets this causes no mess on the street so i don't know that we have to be exclusionary and i say that for a reason okay um let's let me finish then you're having a chance to speak okay um because i have to vote on this right now and it's not sitting well with me and i'll tell you why it's not sitting well with me we fight with other cities that are exclusionary that tell us we can't go on their white sand and we can't put our our chair where they don't want it to be and here we are saying you can't come to our park on a sunday or a saturday listen to some jazz music i mean this isn't the clearwater jazz festival this is a small local thing which i hope that will get nice attendance with our citizens but it doesn't bother me if someone from dollar shore or indian rocks or clearwater comes and visits arabic city and i'll tell you why i visit their cities i go to largo for the period for their tree lighting i went to uh to indian shores for their memorial day picnic i was invited by their mayor but it was a beautiful event it was open to everybody you had to pay if you were an outsider um but you're able to go and all the other cities host us they don't say go home and i have a real problem putting my name into something where we're gonna tell people go home and that's my first question is how are you gonna police this that's my favorite you can answer them all at once i'm just gonna give it to you then turn the floor back to you so first is how we're gonna police this when you're really gonna send somebody home if they're you know from indian rocks i don't like that that's the first thing um in order no let me finish and then you can you'll have the floor back okay i'm going to get all my points out and then i'll turn it back over to you um this event is not self-funding last time we did the uh we did the festival the big a big concern of the council was we set aside a budget for it but the budget was to be used in the event that the sponsorship and the sales and other things that we did didn't cover the amount of the festival well not only did that parks board cover it they made 1700 worth of profit which they turned over to the city manager and then they did other events like the halloween parade and stuff in charge of that so i when i look at this i mean the only thing i see that there's a vendor there's an italian ice vendor you're not even getting revenue from that so the question would be is sponsorship opportunities and or vendor opportunities to try and make this thing i mean this is two thousand two hundred and seventy five dollars for this festival and there's really no offset to it so it's really just the city dipping into his pocket to do it and again i don't have a problem if we tried and said well we only got a thousand dollars of vendors or of sponsorship people who sponsored last time they just outright gameless contributions and i don't see that in here so that was my second question and um it's not self-funding yeah that was it that was everything so basically that it's not self-funding and how you're going to exclude people um if you could convince me that you know it's not going to be a scene because the last thing i need is some nice family coming over the bridge saying oh wow there's some music in the park we want to go and listen and then we have a big to-do and the sheriff's telling to go home and we put the sheriff in a bad place i don't like that so i'll turn it back over to you and i'm coming back to council then okay just yeah um okay so for the first being exclusionary i was only listening to the comments that were made earlier in the year and i believe that you yourself like mentioned id people which we would never do i'm more than happy to have people from anywhere that walk over the bridge we would never exclude anybody but it seemed to be such a concern of people that were coming to me saying we're concerned about parking we're concerned about you know um just they're being crowding about like blocking like an entryway and so we need a parking somatic so i was only answering what was requested of us we would never turn anybody away and then as far as the fundraising we voted because you mentioned that a couple of months ago we voted as a board there are basically four of us and just pulling what's on this paper off is going to be a challenge but we can do it but as far as like fundraising and like getting lots of vendors out here it just wasn't it just wasn't possible so if we were going to do a fundraising event because we've already been approved this budget we would do it for a charity or we would try to raise money for something for a cause we wouldn't try to raise money to offset this so if you if you don't want to have these we're not married to them we don't i mean i don't think there's one minute of sleep if these things don't happen it's not to like prove a point i wasn't at any of the past events i didn't really even know what i walked into i was just trying to do something good and fun and like joy like i don't i don't i've met four people that are sitting here so if you really don't want to happen i don't mind but we're willing to do the work and we're willing to like do this and these are so small and we said because we're new and we've never done anything like this before we wanted to start small so we would be successful if if we like get out over our skis and have all these avengers and all these people like what we just couldn't do it so we voted as a board and this was what we came up with if you don't want to do it we're fine with it like we're happy with what we're doing we feel like we're bringing good things like as far as like you know different activities people can um attend and different things that they can buy like other beach t-shirts and you know beach towels and stuff like that so it's up to you you guys can vote i'm not going to fight about it it's completely up to you so hopefully that it does um and no one's trying to tell you can't do it i'm just my job is you know i heard a lot last time i heard him it had to be self-funded it had to be the greatest event since woodstock i just saw that so i mean just so you don't want to pray when we try to stay out of the fray and i feel like i'm being pushed into yes that's not what i'm trying to do i want to know what the opportunities were for funding and you answered the question i have one other suggestion to you um this is something probably nobody ever thought about but i did uh it's september 25th sun sets at 7 21 and you have this going to eight o'clock so i don't believe we have lighting back there you might want to start this one hour early from four to seven and this way you'll have everybody leaving in the light and they'll see what they're doing as opposed to being in the dark just a suggestion councilman i think you're doing a great job and it's going to be hard to live up to the expectations that were set by the last event however as far as the uh the problem with people coming in from the outside i would never expect anyone to turn someone away coming over that bridge or walking off the beach and enjoying our event i think what they were trying to say is don't advertise don't call people from neighboring cities and and turn it into a giant festival basically festivals like that of that proportion are designed to draw e-commerce or not e-commerce but commerce into a community that actually has businesses they have they want people to come for that reason we don't have that therefore i don't mind it being small i think it's a great thing i prefer the intima bill our beach setting where we uh we get to know people whenever the crowds are large you just can't do that so i think you're right on track yep it's going to cost a little bit of money it's not a whole lot and i'm sure that now that the word is out there probably will be some donations coming in that may help us at that cost so a great job and i'm very very organized i love the report love the map i can tell a lot of work went into this i also listened to about half of the meeting recorded and i was very impressed with the entire team thank you very much i think you're spot on i think the professional tank would start small baby steps and build on that you were given a budget you're working within the budget and there was never any uh exclusionary thing he we thought that in order to keep it small we just managed that through marketing and uh i think you're spot on my hope is to move forward and go forward i think you've done an excellent job right frank you got to get that mic real close to you i think you've done an excellent job love drives and everything isn't just some old stick work and then what i don't believe government should be dabbling into entertainment and the taxpayers expect because not all taxpayers will be entertained or involved in this uh as mr gaddis says you know when you see the big signs like in here off beach beachfest that is because they have businesses okay and those businesses are putting up the funds and everything like that i think government should stay out and entertain people no disrespect no but like i said we're not married to these events if you guys don't want them it's just less for work for us like we're fine with it but we're more than happy to do it if you guys would like us to do it i mean it's just um it's totally fine you've given me the first comments i was just going to say that you know the third priority in the strategic plan is community and this this festival is basically an opportunity to bring residents to better beach together meet your neighbors and build a little camaraderie and uh community cohesion so yeah the entertainment part is the vehicle but the real poverty and purpose council commons citizens there are no citizen comments back to council dave i want to call this question question so what i'm going to do is i'm going to call it one at a time it's not going to be three or zero so it's going to go one at a time we'll do a voice vote on each of these um first is to approve september 25th 2021 jazz in the park festival all in favor all right opposed no no so we have four to two opposed our bank guard and zone october 30th 2021 pets and pals halloween costume and parade custom parade and contest 10 a.m to 12 p.m all in favor post december 6 2021 holiday social and tree lighting from 5 to 6 p.m all in favor opposed six to one bank opposed i'm sorry five to one i'm very close okay so all three events are authorized and please give consideration to changing that timeout whenever all right for a lot safer thank you and thank you to the committee for the hard work before we get into the next discussion at 7 12 you're going for an hour almost 15 does anyone need a break well we'll need a break we'll move on item 10 authorize the city manager proceed with providing code enforcement services internally description is to provide in-house code enforcement for cost savings with more code enforcement hours motion was made by the city manager first any motion absolutely leslie terrell makes the motion secret against you get to talk first um i think this makes perfect sense for years we had our own court enforcement officer rather than paying the sheriffs to do it and i think it makes sense to do it this way financially and logistically and would this be the removal of the deputy altogether or are we still going to use the deputy quarter time wouldn't be used at all it's it's uh how code enforcement is done by the sheriff uh it's how many other hours we want to assign to them so so we would take the sheriff completely out of the equation right the problem i have with that is when you have an active sheriff deputy on the street and you have a public public employee doing code enforcement active deputies knocks on the door i'm starting to use like short term rounds when the door starts asking questions okay probably gonna get a lot of lies all right and then can we say this is an official investigation if you lie to me it's now becoming felony our code enforcement officer doesn't have that authority i would think that we should keep the deputy on some type of a retainer to do certain things like that um our code enforcement person can always you know the grass cuttings and other things and contractors not to buy you by the law or whatever like that use our in-house people on that but to take away that official capacity of an officer of the law i think we just put ourselves in a bad situation um i'd like to ask a question okay and then i saw glenn's hands ahead lynn do you know if uh if the deputy actually went through and memorized our our code no he he did not we that's part of my uh concern that we have this partial issue with not knowing all the codes he's the deputy sheriff that's what he is he's not he's not a trained code enforcement officer he was a retired deputy and i don't have anything against danny who is our current deputy the fact of the matter is i'm looking at it from the bigger picture if you want to keep the sheriff that's fine with me but what i want the council to do is realize it's going to probably cost you another 15 or 20 thousand dollars in code enforcement because we need if we're going to use the sheriff's code enforcement we need to use it in more hours okay right now he gets 12 8 you know depending on what we need for but a lot of things get missed i'm going to give you an example of something that happened today last week he sent an email in to to have grass notice sent out okay because it was too high today he sends an email and says well we need to do a notice of abatement because it's 36 inches high this is what the email says to me i'm sitting here saying wait a minute how did the grass grow from seven inches to 36 inches in a week well that tells me that we didn't pay attention to it and i went and looked at the lightness probably more like 18 or 20 inches but as far as short-term rentals that's an iffy subject i mean we've had complaints from the property owners that the sheriff is harassing them so they're kind of helping me hear about the short-term earnings i will tell you that and we have caught up the example on 8th street there's two of them we've had two hearings for that house and we're investigating possibly a third so but you know so to me at this point if you want to leave the sheriff then what i'm going to ask you to do in the budget is increase the budget to a half-time person which will cost us about fifty three thousand dollars and why couldn't we use both i think it conflicts it because it creates a conflict between who's doing what we're still doing all the administration anyway so the sheriff isn't doing the administration does mr dashen say you know did he read the whole code no he said no so he's saying dan okay this is what you're going to do dan these are the codes we want you to enforce the ones that we believe that we're going to get snuggered on all right and we get our in-house person the easy ones the grass roar or whatever but uh the ones that we need an officer of the law we should have that ability and as i heard people in council say when it comes to spending money we got the money and i don't want to spend any money okay but i think this is money well spent but i don't think splitting it up is a good idea i i really don't i think you either have to do it this way or this way and i don't have a problem with either way you know i actually discussed it with danny i've discussed it with the sheriff's office and and they will say that they need more hours so if that's what the consulate chooses to do uh if we do 20 hours a week it'll cost us about 53 000 a year for coke plus we're still spending money because the administrative person who is laura still has to do all the letters the sheriff doesn't do anything with that they don't they don't touch any of the administrator so she's going to be taxed with more work she's doing that now yeah yeah but now she'll be going field well that's why i asked for a part-time person in the office that's that's what's exactly causes it's a wash with the current situation so if it's a wash then why would we want to get rid of the sheriff's account it's a it's a worship you don't have the sheriff's department is what i'm telling you it's a warship and cost wise yeah i'm just saying you're going to be bringing on somebody for a time correct and that's right that'll be it'll it'll be a wash because we're going to use that part-time person to fill it for laura internally okay and then laura will go out in the field so the the cost difference in code enforcement is a is a war currently now if you want to leave the sheriff then we just need to appreciate what i'm saying is we're going to use two civilians when we're giving up a deputy or an officer it just doesn't make any sense lynn are you where are you doing hell's moving hang on one second glenn dunn has the floor next to me please get my a little corporate history on this thing several councils back we moved to go to a sheriff's office because we felt we needed some reporting reluctantly was undertaken because there were some current concerns about training and that sort of thing the city manager has been monitoring the situation and you know training was a consideration for the same and the results just didn't come around this time [Music] the guy who manages this thing tactically he was a city manager he said he can do a more effective job more efficiently cost neutral if we go with his proposal we always have a sheriff's deputy on pawn within biller beach and he can be tasked with code enforcement is that is that my understanding well he could be you know if we have an issue that we need the code enforcement to deal with it yes he can be cast so so i guess my point is we're covering the sheriff's office so we're going to call the sheriff mr diamond no not to go check the grass and police of grass that should be the tactical supervisor's job i'm not going to micromanage this guy that's what i'm doing he says he can do it more effectively and more efficiently you can't do it more efficiently there's not supposed to be a crosstalk and i appreciate the debate but let's have mr khan has the floor come back to you mr vancouver go ahead glenn and lastly the thing is is with the change in the florida statutes where you cannot call in anonymously it's going to put more strain on the code important system so you need to have somebody out there who is well first well trained and it's going to take one of our people to do that who knows the code right now that's that's laura so you you make a good point you don't don't want to interrupt you but uh with this new law and i advise all you people out there to tell your friends and neighbors call your counsel person when you have a complaint and make them belly up to the bar and file the complaint with the city so you can stay in the office just a real quick question uh city manager reeves how many times is this year knocked on a rental property and they'll be answered because the man is standing there in the uniform with the sheriff's vehicle oh that that happens regularly and we do get a lot of complaints about that that we're sending a sheriff's deputy and uh they can you know we we just had one recently that um complained that uh he didn't want the sheriff's deputy on his property you know that house actually and and i think uh you may get a little more information from the sheriff's deputy maybe sometimes but you know i've dealt with the short-term runs myself on various occasions and i got i've gotten more information out of the people who are there than the sheriff's deputy has in the past and i i think uh it's just the individual sometimes how do you handle it that's really where i think it is but like i said all i'm asking is if if you want to leave it as it is all i'm asking you to do is increase the budget so i can save the sheriff you've got 20 hours a week i'd like to say a few words cause i've been watching this for the last two years and i've been told i can't talk about it i was told that by danny doherty who's been telling me what's been going on y'all aren't going to like some of the stuff i have to say and don't bother to call it point of order because every piece of this is a fact a fact from a deputy remember we are support blue in this city okay let's talk about deputy doherty number one he was invited personally by me tonight i don't see him here sheriff you hear me please tell sheriff goldberry how disappointed i am in him not for the patrol that you did here that was perfect your superiors would not let deputy doherty come here tonight and speak for himself they told him he could not come to this meeting not in uniform not as a civilian does 1983 mean anything to the sheriff it should you just deprived that man of his opportunity to speak to this council deputy doherty offered to do ride-alongs with every one of us so that we could see what he goes through and i don't place blind allegiance into mr reeves or anyone else as ronald reagan said trust but verify i'll trust but i'll verify what you tell me and let's verify some of that stuff you get you just told people here you don't get information from the sheriff's office well this is something that's near and dear to my heart because i serve on the emergency board all the pinellas county and i'm in the process of trying to get us a new cad system that's computer assisted dispatch that puts all the information about a call at not only the sheriff's disposal but in the future we hope that it'll put it at fire and ambulance that's what we're trying to do what i'm holding here are cad reports laura mataloni could never do this this is in the sheriff's system okay every time danny doherty hits a building or or a house in this town there's a record of it i'll give you one example i'm not going to say the place trash in roadway remove trash in northbound lanes of building woolworth placed it in the dumpster in city hall golf boulevard in 20th every time he goes someplace this is in the cad system why is that important you can search upon it if there's any criminal activity or if there's a pattern of any problems in that house the sheriff can use it for law enforcement that's a benefit that the sheriff gives us that we'll never get going inside that's number one frank banker's talking about having a uniformed officer one of the reasons that we did this was that we would have we only have one person at any given moment in belarus beach and that's all we need small city and it's working great so far this gives us a second person there have been multiple opportunities where danny doherty answered a call while he was doing code he was the responding officer and lynn reeves yelled at him for doing it he saved the person it was a hot call it was an assault he was the first responder he was only a block or two away he heard it he responded he also hit the pause button on his timer of the time that he gives us in bellar beach he finished the hot call put himself at risk because he's a darn good officer and he answered that call and then he came back and he gave us more time than his shift his shift has been progressively cut down over time one of the reasons why we went to an outside code enforcement officer is that our internal code enforcement officer doesn't work weekends well guess what bad people bad bad boys and girls when are you going to put that new roof on or put that new door in that you don't want code to see let me give you an opportunity saturday sunday yeah that would be the right answer and that's exactly what they did as for having the uh well we're saying that he doesn't know the the code memorized i challenge anybody to memorize our code you know it's illegal to have a lawn chair in your front yard for more than 24 hours go don't see any cities that have that one okay yeah the baby even knows that's wrong okay nobody knows that and nobody's going to be enforcing that we have some laws that i just shake my head out and go why did we put this here okay it's a beach community it's not a condo association so maybe he doesn't know everyone but he knows the main ones when he first came on i met him and i said danny i had a lot of complaints about the past it was when i went around door to door i would like frank banker i went door-to-door that was my number one complaint uneven code enforcement lack of code enforcement retaliatory code enforcement city manager will pull my campaign sign like he did he leaves other people's in interesting maybe he wasn't a big supporter of me that was all over the city with stuff like that people were driven out of this city before they ever completed their house that's verified the person lived on harbor drive they got so fed up beller beach they're like we don't want to live here i haven't had a complaint yet about danny doherty not a complaint yet and i've told this story many times before there was a house on the corner by me it was tremendously overgrown for years years so you wonder just what our code people were doing all of them okay and i watched danny i didn't hear him but i watched him from my window deal with a fairly difficult owner and that house if you go there today looks beautiful it's not going to be on the cover of better homes and gardens or anything it is a nice looking house it fits in well danny did it without threats without summonses without hauling people into court kenny doherty also folks he told me this story again he told me not to tell this stuff so i had to sit by when he first came here somebody had a pile of debris he was catching all kinds of flak from city hall here danny and his daughter on their own time and picked up this elderly person's debris and took it to the dump and no good deed ever goes unpunished he got to the bridge and it blew out of the back of his truck and he had to pick it all up off the road okay that's danny doherty folks let me tell you something else danny dardy just did i'm not gonna mention the lady's name although i know it and i think it's a public record at this point you know you've all seen that that uh commercial help i've fallen and i can't get up right well that happened in bellar beach woman's family called no one's seen her for four days relatives didn't know where she was danny did on patrol the house didn't look right to him he isn't paying attention maybe he doesn't know every species of weed but he knew something was wrong with that house the other officer said that we can't go in danny's like this is actually every circumstances were going in finally they tried to handle on the door they opened up the door because it was wide open and there was the lady having fallen couldn't get up for almost four days she was near death danny doherty deserves our highest reward folks we lose our city attorney in one night and now we're going to lose our law enforcement code officer wrong and that's not all mr reeves i've heard about the treatment he's received in city hall from you and laura and it's disgusting you complained that i created a hospital work environment with you he described your environment as toxic you don't even gentry they don't even say good morning to this man they got the nerve to go and take pictures with the police and say we support blue well that's how they treat them when they're not on camera folks his time has been progressively cut from 14 hours to eight hours he doesn't work weekends anymore in fact he was told never to work without liberty's being present why does he not know what he's doing why don't you go pick up the telephone and call one of my counterparts mayor mary beth henderson of reddington they use danny doherty they're happier than clam with him he seems to know their code now for all the people who are analytical and numbers people i'd like to see the comparison of how many things that danny has found in this city and and hits which is this versus what laura's head i don't see much of a difference the code reports look the same to me i drive around the city it looks very nice yes we occasionally get an individual that creates a problem and is taken care of and it's done without problems it's done without threats of law enforcement then without being heavy-handed i had to laugh when mr reeves said that danny was complaining about a short-term rental i got one of those telephone calls and guess what i got a complaint about mr reeves one time on a short-term rental he was here on a sunday and my board bell's got him you know what i said man you can't have a short-term rental i support the city manager on that instead of faulting danny dougherty without even knowing what he did how about supporting blue that's what we're supposed to stand for right in terms of the money well if we can spend five thousand dollars for a wave sign don't tell me about the money we've used money here for when we want to use money we just spent four thousand three four thousand dollars for public relations events how about safety and security it's supposed to be our number one thing in our strategic plan danny doherty is getting another bad deal from the city and i don't like it i don't like the way he's been treated i don't like what i hear i don't like the way this is being supervised i don't like anything about this he's an excellent sheriff he's a highly skilled sheriff this guy was an instructor for the swat team he's no lightweight he's smart and he has the right temperament he's an excellent sheriff he's an excellent code officer there is an option to do both other cities do it i'm friends with a co-officer in a big city and i'm not going to say what city that is because i don't want that person to be harassed but you can split it and there's also another county authors code services so we don't have to use laura inside but if we are going to do laura inside the code maybe everybody forgot this little tidbit but i didn't forget it but we gave laura the inside job i'm sorry but she came inside because she used to be full-time code when she came inside mr reeves gave her a 6 000 raise well if she's going to go outside for 40 percent my accounting in me tells me you get 2400 back you don't get a 6 000 raise and you'll bet to do your own your old job i don't support this at all and if we are going to support it then let's get the money back when we need to claw it back because she's not doing the job that we gave her two years ago she's doing a different job right now i have nothing but complaints about laura nothing and i've heard her personality the other day i heard a telephone call june called headquarters sounded like there was a funeral going on here the way that phone was answered it was embarrassing so quite frankly i don't support this and if we get all kinds of complaints it's coming back to this council because somebody said but stops with me that same post and told me i don't manage the city manager you can't have it both ways you vote for this you own your vote i get code complaints we'll come back here and we'll deal with them as a council i'm disgusted and embarrassed and sheriff when you tell sheriff gold dairy that i was upset that danny wasn't allowed to be here also tell him that the mayor apologizes for the treatment that deputy dougherty got in bellar [Music] beach i would just like to qualify mr banker's statement about anonymous calls call your council member uh from experiences on the council that's not necessarily true in light of sunshine and public records laws i have seen people come back and do a public records request asking for specific names so i guess what i'm saying is there is no home of silence that comes down and gives you 100 anonymous details you're always subject and the council members are subject to public records requests thank you come on mr john as long as there's a record you're right right mr guns right as long as there's a public record you're right i'm on sixth street beach just about every day monday through friday come see me there's no record city council on the other comments before i open up to the citizens citizens sir please talk right into that microphone okay i i do have the experience now so perfect we're still learning here okay so again my name is i'm a little red for bay shore um so i actually had a experience with the co-enforcer danny's his name not myself but heard it through the neighbor next door the experience that we that my neighbor had which was passed on to me um it was much more human much more friendly dealing with the officer than the lady that who does the uh so i'm just out here to tell the council the members that we're here to support uh our existing court enforcement okay thank you mr hansek john is at 22nd street for what it's worth i concur with the previous speaker keep the deputy spend money in different places for different things we can afford the uh extra money i believe to keep deputy doherty on staff as he was originally supposed to be not as it's been modified i like the idea of having him on staff as an extra law enforcement based on what you've described so i encourage council to keep him as code enforcement thank you thank you mr hansek yes ma'am hi my name is laurie i live on bayshore sitting next to my husband i've had good experiences with officer doherty i find them to be professional i've had i find to be very good in neutralizing situations we have had issues with neighbors fences things like that i think he has a lot of good qualities um in our community that benefit our community with his approach to how he handles things i have called over here a couple different times and dealt with different people who answered the phone and i have to concur that the the demeanor and the lack of information is noticeable we live here now full time since 2014. we wonder how simple six we were visiting [Music] so anyways you'll see more meetings and um i vote for keeping him on and if that that makes a difference thank you thank you yes jim vancouver 7th street bellerin beach i've had a couple opportunities to speak to the deputy doherty and and in speaking to him i i've heard many times he's told me that he's backed up other deputies while he was on duty now let's think about this he cuts off the time clock for bella beach to make that happen he goes on the sheriff's time clock with no added expense to this city so we have a back and and with the uh i spoke to him also about the lady that had fallen and it was very disheartening to find out that this city the neighbors didn't even know that this lady had health issues and or took the time but we had an officer who paid attention paid attention in our community to know once there's an issue okay he care and it's about about him picking up that that was not only deputy doherty but i want you to know that his daughter that helped him is also a sheriff deputy so they both did that off the cloth of the goodness of their heart and that's what the sheriff is all about and work with people that's what we're supposed to be about helping each other be in a community and i don't see that happening with laura when we went around campaigning for the mayor we heard nothing but complaint after complaint after complaint some people weren't even given enough time to respond to the notice that they were given to comply because they just moved in they had no idea that these these things had existed so so i say we we need to keep this deputy not only that he has said time and time again that he is willing to work nights and weekends when do we have a lot more problems nights weekends so why would we not do that especially since our current code officer does not want to do that coupled with the fact again she was given six thousand dollars more to go into the office that was the deal so if she's coming back to the street we should get that money back thank you thank you any other citizen comments there being now i'm coming back to council council leslie last word before he called the question just want to look at frank and then leslie had last words known three items reports a couple colleagues said you know this is a great way to get involved know your community i haven't heard one person out there saying you get rid of him so we'll see how this vote goes whether we listen to you right now and i'm just going to say i had to endure 115 days of horns beeping outside my window because people supposedly support blue some people were right on this council who supported blue they supported blue with financial contributions and they held signs i'm gonna lie watching that vote too and so is that young lady with the camera go ahead leslie the last word i think it makes sense like i said um financially logistically to bring it back in-house all right so here i'm calling the question at this point item 10 to authorize the city manager to proceed with providing code enforcement services internally madam clerk i'm going to ask that this role be called yes councilmember doterra yes council member slope yes vice mayor davis no mayor manzo no so motion fails danny will stay on and i'll be here i'd like to ask one question as i told you earlier it doesn't matter to me either way but i think we need to increase the budget for 20 hours we have a budget session coming up make your proposal i want to talk with you about um better utilizing the sheriff's time that we have for these uh events because we have the sheriff directing traffic and that's not what i had in mind so let's talk about cost savings areas and what we can do that's a budget session but i don't see why a few thousand if that's our priority should be a problem here okay so i'll i'll make the adjustment and bring it to you yes please and mr reeves mr dardy and i are friends so i'm just going to leave it at that okay he'll tell me what's happening well it's a mission here okay i don't appreciate your negative comments about me uh you treat this guy like garbage and i'm sick of it well you don't hear both sides of the story no i don't but i hear his i'll go we support blue in my house we're done with this discussion item 11 ordinance 21-05 an ordinance of the city council of the city of bel air beach florida providing for an amendment to section 22-33 b16 of the city code ordinances providing for incorporation of recitals providing for approval of amendment to section 22-33 b-16 of the city

planning board when they did the code review so this is the process we've been doing bringing forward a couple each month to move those recommendations forward and note that there's the curve inserts there's i think that's what we're talking about with the blocking of the curves and valley curves um and i think there's a and i want to just check with these with the city attorney that there is a i know there's a provision for ada accessibility that was our biggest concern about that we don't obviously want the curbs blocked because it restricts water is that are you happy with that for ada purposes that's sufficient um i'm the author of that language um resources related to the ada and that that is the specific language that's used so it's consistent with the ada uh guidelines that i reviewed thank you friend that was the only concern that i had anyone else on council who moved to the citizens any comment on this ordinance back to council do you have any last words oh i'm all

10-77-7 of the city code ordinances providing for a copy to be kept on file providing for several ability providing for the repeal of all ordinances in conflict here with and providing for an effective date the description is to modify the legal standards relating to building related to buildings and building regulation first motion [Music] another changes that the planning board did recommended and we reviewed those four months ago roughly and we're just bringing the updated ordinances to you a couple of times mr council i have a question for you mr city manager at first i thought we changed this because i had a question when we had it in a work session but then i went back and looked at the the code and it actually says this so i'm going to read it call it one sentence that's two sentences we'll put it in context and then you can tell me what's meant by it because i this is existing now and then the new one will incorporate that so 10-35 sanitary facilities yes it's glamorous being there bellar beach we're talking about sanitary facilities a portable sanitary facility shall be supplied to a new construction site within the city after the initial grading has been completed and before the foundation work has begun we're cool such portable sanitary facilities shall be maintained at the site in an inconspicuous location to be specified in the site plan until after the hookup of interior sanitary facilities so my question is since i've built my own house and seen plenty of others being built typically they are not able to place them any further than curbside so what exactly is an inconspicuous location and is every house that's ever been built here in violation of this ordinance because i really don't want to revise it and still have it vague well what was brought up about this by the code review board was the fact that porta potties sometimes aren't set back in the lot a little bit uh they're end up in the curve they end up in the roadways so that's what the code or the code review committee was trying to change a little bit to try to get the contractors to maybe put some shielding in front of him uh or you know as an example uh i'll use a house that's being built on boulevard they have a fence around it so their portal bodies is probably inside but that that's what the concept was and that's what i thought and then we run into problems with having fencing in your front yard which is also illegal um and i mean not during construction you can have a fence you can have a fence it's just like a boulevard somebody wants to i guess here's my point if we want to fence it then let's say we want him fenced i don't care my house is built it really doesn't matter to me i think it's ridiculous because quite frankly it's hard enough for them to pump the darn stuff out of this without having more hazards to go around but if it's so important that we have a fence around it that make the person build a fence it's a small expense to pay when you're building a house with that said i i have no idea what inconspicuous meant i think if i pulled 10 people we get 10 different things it's really hard when you clear cut a lot to have anything inconspicuous it's a flat lot of sand and they can't really put it in the back because they won't go off road with their heavy trucks and then they got to pump the stuff out and they don't want to go in the back and pump it out so all i'm saying is as long as we're revising this now can we make it something that people could understand and if we want fencing then say fencing and if we wanted to if we want people to use their best effort conspicuous then say that but this is the way i read this right now i wouldn't know what to do and i tell you the port of john guy just drops it in your front door so i mean we're just using the words that the they wanted it shielded that's what they really wanted and this this came directly from the planning board report let's say that and how would we like to shield an offense uh gold uh bars i mean what would be like i think i think this is giving the contractor the flexibility to work with his surroundings and i see no reason at all to make it very specific i think it's it's plain as day inconspicuous or shielded location don't make it such a big eyesore you know well as an attorney of course yes see when we're passing law folks people up here don't want to deal with an attorney but you will down the road anyway okay so as an attorney you read it for void for vagueness yolie rodera that radero is not in her head she's also an attorney and a professor at that so this is vague i don't know what inconspicuous means it means something to lynn reeves it means something to lord it means something to the code god if he has 10 people so if you want it shielded say you want it shielded that's simple inconspicuous it means something to everybody to inconspicuous to me may mean like what lynn just said i don't want it dropped in the curve you know hard to disagree with that okay but inconspicuous i gotta hide behind a tree in my backyard and now my neighbor's gonna smell it and you know what leave it at the front curb it's only a couple of months i got pictures of people in this room who built houses had their port of john right at the front we did it too that's where they dropped them so i don't know you know we have 25 foot setback and you can't have anything in it so i don't know how you can make it inconspicuous unless you happen to have some palm trees that are small i don't know how you're going to do that if you want to shield it just say you want it shielded that's simple shielding it is an option according to this independent or shielded okay but i don't know i just don't understand what inconspicuous means sorry has it been an issue am i changing it right has it been an issue with what well i mean the wording it could speakings have been in the ordinance we've had a few complaints about porta potties uh most recently on 15th street probably the most so you know and i understand to some degree but porta potties are part of construction that's that's the life of construction you know uh it's not like you have a restroom it's not an outhouse a construction site is a construction site let's deal with it by exception rather than start you delete all the codes to withstand the screen or supreme court cases that's what we're doing this is a a motion to redo the code so if we're going to redo it do it right instead of doing it wrong i don't know that's just a legal thought make your laws right not wrong yes sir guys i probably use the portable reported john more than anybody in this room so the facts the fact here is you only have about a 15 foot honey dipper hose you put it too far away you can't clean it out all right then you really get the spell i mean you think red tide's bad right so it should be as close to an area where the truck can pull up wow and the other thing i have a big problem with is the second page here uh 6 p.m to 7 a.m frank they can't hear you i'm sorry there you go i got to learn how to use this six on that heart 6 pm to 7 am a lot of people have told me they would like that 7am to move to 8am okay especially on the weekends in the construction business if it says 7am you get guys pulling up at 6 30 in the morning yakking drinking coffee out in front of the construction site it's a lot better to have necking at 7 30. frank i'll agree with you and it's not just the acting they back up they've got the automatic beepers on the back where they're beeping coming down the block you know and not everybody gets up some people i see a person here who works evenings and and is sleeping at that time of the day so you know definitely not something that's that's desirable here we could move it an error just to clarify all that was added to this was inconspicuous was evidently already there or i said that yeah i said that i just didn't know what inconspicuous meant anyway mr banker's point he's talking about hours he has a problem with the hours the hours of on saturday is that what you said all right i haven't i have a problem with i'm doing pretty good here i i have a problem 7 a.m anytime especially on saturdays i think it should be 8 a.m across the board 8-6 an hour yeah i'll disagree with that and the reason why is because at 8 am many people in our neighborhoods are going to work you've got big trucks heavy machinery uh hopefully they're all moved in by 8 o'clock otherwise you're going to be fighting with them to get out as they're trying to get in so i'm okay with seven well you're only going to fight with them on the initial day that they start up and those most contractors will drop their equipment off the night before so plus the backup alarms and everything like that as the mayor says uh yeah they go on cancel any other comments nope you can't do that i'll run the meeting but thank you citizens mr han succeed had i followed mr gunn i would have been breaking the law i don't want to break the law that's why we paid the big bucks i do get the big bucks and thank you i appreciate the bonus too john hansen 22nd street i can appreciate what the committee tried to do but let's face reality porta potties are part of construction [Music] and like who's mentioned it momentarily you put that thing too far off of the street and they can't pump it out it ain't broke don't fix it speaking about the time though i have something that maybe the city needs to take a look at and i know this from personal experience several years ago after we bought our house we were over here for a weekend working on it and unfortunately the transformer right there on our property blew in august notified duke best they could do is get somebody out there you know um next morning this was saturday night they showed up sunday morning they started working before seven o'clock some schmuck and i mean some schmuck on 23rd called the sheriff on 23rd on the other side of the north side they had power so we had to wait until after 8 o'clock there needs to be an exception in our code if you will for emergencies and i've bring out something else okay for simple reasons and it's obvious i have a diagnosis that requires me to use oxygen at night that machine goes down i can still breathe okay don't get me wrong but if it's for an extended period of time i might be sol so you need to do something with the code for emergency use i mean it doesn't give duke isn't going to make exceptions but there are other people who have medical conditions that need that power 24 7. but back to this thing it ain't broke don't fix it mr hansen just as a piece of information the way the rule is written it does say uh you know it gives the hours six to seven weekends except for the holidays and then it says accept in case of urgent necessity to protect public health and safety and then only with authorization from the city manager or his or her designate so um yeah by then it'd still be seven o'clock and you still won't have power so um you know again city manager and i will speak in his defense is usually available at pretty pretty crazy hours sometimes and i've seen him work on the weekends um doing certain things particularly with short-term rental but you know he's available every morning at seven o'clock or on a sunday or a saturday i mean i don't know i doubt it i doubt any of us would be on every day so nor is it required so maybe that's a problem maybe this thing isn't ready for you know prime time i mean if we're going to look at these ordinances like i said you know let's make them right get it right we're not going to revise them again hopefully anytime soon but thank you just i want to let you know there was an emergency thing but you got to go to congress to get an authorization think like i said i think it was early on you know coming over on weekends and it just happened to be within a couple months of purchasing the house but like i said [Music] and we didn't know at the time you had to go through the city manager tell the power company or tell the deputy it's okay which still doesn't make a whole lot of sense but thank you sir but thank you other citizens comments come back to council no final comments call the question please yeah if we're going to call the question it actually has to be voted obviously i was ready to do that anyway because nobody made any comments but if you'd like you'll go through the protocol to call the question you sure you want to do this because i'm just going to do it anyway nobody was making any comments you have to draw it it was good for you go to the expert if you call the question i need to get a second we need to have a majority wait i think it's debatable i have to check my cheat sheet or we can just say nothing [Music] perfect decides on that we have the last word question certainly 2106 an ordinance of the city council of the city of baylor beach florida providing for amendments in section 10-210-32b1 10-32 b4 10-35-10-37 10-38 and to 10-77-7 of the city code ordinances providing for incorporation of

september unfinished business do we have any there is none city attorney fred riley yes it is your time i would ask the city council to give me the flexibility to propose a way forward and let me explain it fully i've been sitting here thinking very diligently about what would be the most appropriate thing so with your authority i'll explain what i think you should do this is your time as city manager as a city uh attorney we don't even need to give permission does anybody have any objections you have the floor okay i'll say several things that are they're factually based this evening three of the council members asked me to reconsider three of the council members um voted in favor of uh and those three that asked me to reconsider did not vote for um going forward with the rfp process so three of you did so it obviously is a standoff the council woman robin aki is not here and i i think it would be inappropriate for me to uh guess what she her view on this would be um and i'm not going to project what her view may be but the as i said earlier the difficult thing for the city council is you'll have to discuss things in public so as we've seen tonight that is a messy process at times the thing that i will suggest to you is the best way forward is to do two things one is to normally at mid-month you have your work session and to have a special meeting where you consider whether you want to go forward with the rfp process and if that special meeting in an ideal world all seven of the council members would be here and you'd either you one way or another would decide to go with that or not so i again stress that i have been a lawyer a long time i've parted ways with clients and i am going to be professional about what i do and that's not going to stop i may not like some things that i'm going to be professional about having said that the reason that i picked note or august 19th was that was 30 days my contract required me to give you 30 days notice if you all had decided to go ahead tonight with the rfp process then you have a pretty defined timeline as to when you would be able to bring somebody new on okay um without being able to go forward with the rfp you don't have a defined timeline so the second part of my proposal is that i will move the resignation date to app the day after your first meeting in september and that way you have a an attorney available to get you to the tuesday or the first meeting in september is september 6 i'm sure that's the holiday okay so september 8th i would suggest i move the date to september 9th and at the workshop if y'all decide to go forward with the rfp process then you know i i don't know what i'll decide although i probably do know but that that to me is fair it gives you all the ability to have an attorney and i last thing i want to do for for any client or is leave them high and dry and not able to do things in the interim so that's my proposal two things one schedule your workshop and but also schedule a special meeting to address the rfp issue and because you have to do something and also um i will if you'll agree to this then tomorrow else an email following up and uh changing my resignation date to september 9th and that way everything's covered i think that's a very realistic and reasonable proposal that's more than fair it's more than fair given what's happened here you didn't have to do that well i left one thing out this is an easy yes or no uh type of decision and it doesn't really shouldn't require any great um so just hey i it to me to me it's a very fair thing and it does what really should be done i mean there's two two attorneys on the the council and the two attorneys know as well as i do you have it's a florida attorney you have an obligation to do what's in your the best interest of your client and you're obligated to put that ahead of even your own interest and that's what i'm trying to do mr ruiz when is our um we haven't scheduled it yet for a work session what were you thinking the 16th of august it's the 16th uh yeah we discussed that we're going to do the sign ordinance that night right and uh there'll be some comments about the budget a little bit not a whole lot because we've pretty much been through it uh we will have the uh well that'll be something i'll speak about it in my return i'm going to pull for a little ability over here we're going to swoop we're going to have on the 16th david yes i am glenn frank banker i can make myself i don't i don't agree with any of this i think this uh i i appreciate him giving us until september i don't know if i would be that kind harder i think we should have an emergency council meeting this week robert's in town i don't know where where she is but i mean if if the majority of council wants us to go without a city attorney and put this whole city at risk let i'm with you i can call it for any night we want i have that authority that's why i was polling to make sure we get i really want seven council members here and then you own your vote with you i want people to own that but i i don't want it mr riley has given us he didn't have to do this really thank you um but we owe him yes no and quite frankly if we don't if he doesn't have that support then we need to get mr reeves moving on this thing we can't put him behind the eight quality but we do need at that point to get a city attorney so we have to have a city attorney one way or the other i'll call a city meeting for tomorrow but ramanaki is not here she's a vital part of this i know you don't want to speculate but she was one of the people who voted against putting this rfp out so you know fox news network can project that she might be on your side i want to make sure all seven people are here and have a voice i also want to make sure citizens have a chance to have their voices heard so i'll pick any night you want i'm pretty much available this entire month with the exception of the time that i'm at they leave a city's convention other than that i can't do anything do i get an opportunity um august 16th works for me is before the whole resignation that goes into effect and so i don't know why that would be a big concern to wait till that night and land just real quick if i can ask you a question the florida league of cities would supply and determine if it came down to that is that correct uh knowing what the fred had submitted i've already contacted three firms and uh i have proposals from them to fill in as interim city attorneys till the rp's done which typically was what would happen if the attorney left before the rfp frank i'd like to move it quicker but i think the 16th we seem to have consensus does anyone know if robinaki is available that night can anyone find out besides one of the council people even though that's not a sunshine law mayor yes can you yeah i don't know how quickly i wouldn't answer but okay so here's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna use my authority the 16th before we're gonna have a work session 16 at six o'clock because that wasn't one of those budget ones that's on a weird time no no no we do the special meeting first okay so special meeting will be six o'clock six teams right now i if again i want perfect attendance then i don't be right back where we are now and we've accomplished nothing and we'll follow it up with the work session okay so that's an authorized meeting at this point okay and if you find out differently and patty if you will poll the council it's not a sunshine violation to ask other council members but i'd rather no council member have to count you know contact another council member okay it's just simply are you available or you're not for whatever day 16th is a good day it looks like okay mr riley are you available that day yes yes i am okay i'd like you to be here and the kid is still crying because you right all right anything else mr eye thank you city at the manager meeting you asked me to verify the contract cancellation for uh esg i did that in our contract it says seven days notice fred and i reviewed it and i've already sent the letter notice out and actually today i got the card back that they received so we're good moving forward with that uh the generator pricing we're waiting on that and we'll discuss that at the worst session and the sign orders and that's other things you have you have the code report and things of that nature but that's all i had okay and i've alluded to it before i we did get a letter from the florida department of epa because i know there's a lot of citizen concern about the what happened out in november out of the dunes that's not going to happen anymore they've been very clear about what the rules are and city manager now has this information i hope it will get integrated somehow into our procedure or regulations book i don't think we need to make an ordinance out of this but i think at least you know you would have it in regulation so that if you know you're out on a vacation or something that the dpw people and everybody else will know what the procedure is and that procedure is a simple one it can only be done in the winter months the seedlings have to drop off the uh the um sea oats and you can't cut them lower than 18 inches and you have to leave this was interesting i learned something you have to leave the clippings there that's right so if we're doing that to clean the junk out that maybe isn't the best thing because we're going to leave the jump there so no you you pick the junk out of it right then you have different junk you can have co2 but the co stay there because it's like a fertilizer so that's it okay um there is something else mr uh reeves you know what this is and i'm not going to bring it out in public session you and i had a meeting on this and we were going to meet with mr riley you know what i'm talking about right our conversation on the what yeah about two weeks ago right so just just keeping it on the radar that is something we should follow up on okay i'll see where it froze oh rush but well september a little bit of a brush you know okay okay at least until nine o'clock yeah until nine hours right it could be it i'll i'm not gonna die um i could do a telephone call too it doesn't matter i mean like just to see it's more just to decide where to begin i mean there was a lot of issues with that that's a ball acts there before we bring it up to the citizens and let's see where we're at with issues on this okay uh city clerk nothing city council comments uh let me start started frank banker uh just what i spoke about earlier today about the fwc and the buoys i um i guess i'll contact you city manager and mr riley i there is no official form to put a variance together but she just has to comply with a statute that doesn't exist so i'll email you tomorrow morning so with that i'll entertain a motion to return ty uh and we have a second and all in favor aye one opposed good night everyone 8 22 are off you"
