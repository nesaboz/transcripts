    "transcript": "good evening everyone welcome to the monday august 16th special counsel uh special workstation work session of the city of del oro beach [Music] pledge um to the eye of the united states of america and to the republic for which stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice here councilmember frank banker here councilmember glenn gunn council member leslie otero councilmember rita swope here vice mayor dave gaddis your mayor joseph banzo city manager lynn reeves city attorney fred riley here and for the record please let it be known that uh councilmember all right item number one is something that i put on the discussion section pdf63 addressing the city council and this is the discussion of the city code ordinance in section 263 um this is a discussion we are following roberts over but there's a little bit more back and forth and not quite as formal so for the folks of the audience you typically as part of a work session we do not have oil on citizen input i'm going to ask if the council would entertain citizen input we always have anyone talking to that there's no objections that we'll have citizen input on it so at some point we'll ask for comments we're not voting on anything tonight the best it'll do is the consensus the rules of the state of florida doesn't allow us to vote on anything in the work session this is more we don't get a chance to speak with each other on the outside under the law this is our chance to speak with each other but it has to be done in front of the citizens so the item that we have here is the um in our code ordinances right now the way it stands section 2-63 says that the presidential officer or on request of the city attorney shall rule not order any discussion by the city council of matters that are the subject of any current or prospective litigation and i've got a problem with this really since this brought to my attention by fred riley and it's coming to play a few times recently we're not going to discuss the lawsuits here we're going to discuss this wall and this will actually um create some problems city manager fred riley and myself had a brief discussion of this the other day and fred reilly actually did a proposed news section one of the problems that we have with this is that it conflicts with the state law the state law allows us to have sunshine meetings in the event that there's a lawsuit we're allowed to not sound like shadings or out of the sunshine we actually would go into the conference room or dismiss the folks that are in this room and have a meeting to discuss strategy or settlement possibilities with regards to the lawsuit now of course you don't have to do that in the public you shouldn't do that in the public the government has allowed us to do that privately you have to bring the court reporter in when that happens we have to record what's happening and at the conclusion of the lawsuit that becomes our settlement that becomes public information okay right now if we read this string we can't do it the problem is we all did this a couple months ago okay so i guess everybody on counselor in the city has an issue we did it but i don't know that our law the way it stands is legal right now and that's the discussion i've had with us the other problem that it gives us right now is that when you have a proposed lawsuit or notice of lawsuit state of florida says when you're going to sue the city you must give a six-month advance notice to the city and our city charter also says that you must give events notice to the city right now the city manager will get that or i will get that letter the city manager gets that letter that's it we're not allowed to discuss it so we're losing the opportunity to possibly settle maybe a nuisance suit or some suit that shouldn't ever get brought to court early because we're not allowed to talk about it and the problem with talking about it is obviously we want to be careful as city council members not to say something that's going to hurt the city's position but by the same token we're hurting our own position and literally forcing every single lawsuit to basically go to a trial and go to actually be fired i'll give you an example this is totally hypothetical somebody falls they break their leg there's no question about it you want to get rid of the lawsuit right now we've got to stand there's nothing we can do about that or maybe the insurance company might settle it but us as a council can't come back and say let's press this thing and get rid of it we also stopped some this is a real situation the suit was just recently settled but we have a slip and pull at oregon park and the letter of lawsuit was very very detailed and um there was all kinds of stuff in there about drainage and stuff like this and i could talk to the city manager a little bit about it but we couldn't talk in public about it and you're allowed to make remedial measures even during lawsuits it can't be used against you so we don't have a chance to counsel so this is an attempt to try and fix this law a little bit and make it a little bit better mr ali i want to just go to you and now open it up to the council for the discussion but i know you will you know you help write this thing and get some proposals and talk about it a bit so i'll turn it over to you and we'll go to council discussion yeah i'd like to address comments or questions to our city attorney are we in line with the current section 2 yes d3 with our state section 2-63-d is the provision the provision as it's written now addresses perspective and current litigation and technically you could make the argument that the current or the existing city code provision is slightly inconsistent with state law because state law 768.28 subsection 8 provides for a shade meeting and the you could argue that the current city code does not uh consider or does not acknowledge that that's possible so that that's an argument i i would say it is inconsistent in the past you've had a shade meeting you had one recently regarding a personal injury case so if you were going to make a change then the change would be to acknowledge that there is a shame meeting allowed under 768.28 subsection 8. yeah but when the city's being sued and it's turned over to our insurance company they should be the ones you know directing this and controlling [Music] that's you have insurance and if it's at that type of claim then they would be handling the claim and typically what happens is they do an initial assessment of the claim and if the claim is has enough merit they will from an insurance standpoint they would appoint claims council to defend the city in that action what the the current code does not take into account is there may be a situation and i'm i'm making a hypothetical if the uh city was owed uh 500 from a vendor who uh overcharged and the city was trying to re coop the 500 then if the vendor refused to pay it back then at some point you'd have to consider whether the city council was going to authorize a case to pursue the 500 being refunded to the city that is not really allowed under the current council the city manager could certainly have that discussion with city attorney but it would be something that would according to your current code would be out of order under the current rules so back when we were addressed in a bind against people that had ordinances we were outlining whether our city note and ordinance here you know what you're saying because it was discussed during the meeting at that point that here's the amount we pulled up and here's the amount we will aim so basically we've been you know in this room all along to the way i'm understanding this conversation oh i don't the the state law authorizes you to do what you did in having that shade meeting and that that has a very strict um protocol that you have to follow and that that protocol was was followed that this is a for a perspective in the fut this is a code change is the way that the mayor has brought it forward and it's something that he he's thinking that in going forward in the future that city council should consider a code change of the city trying to get some money back on contract is one that the insurance company will come in i'll give you another one um i'm not going to use an actual example i'll make this one up let's say our city council decided that we built up one morning and we decided we're going to ban bicycles in the city no more bicycles that's abstergon now somebody says you know what your law is unconstitutional okay or i've got a problem with that law the insurance company can't settle that case and the reason why the insurance companies can't settle our cases because we as the council are the only people who are going to be able to repeal that wall or change that wall now they may be able to settle the damages they may be able to under our present policy withdrawal legal fees they may not pay for you to defend that law but in terms of doing it they cannot tell our council you have to repeal that law so there's an example where our council needs to be able to meet to be able to discuss it to hash it out because people say you know what you don't want the embarrassment of being known as that city that banned bicycles so we don't want to [Music] you know go down that road let's just repeal the law or maybe we'll monetize on sundays or something you know that's what we can do and if we don't have that ability to talk about this and that we're not going to understand meeting really you know what we do threaten the lawsuit not on appreciated media at that point in time by making the changes that we propose here it allows us to discuss that and head off what could be very expensive and or embarrassing so it's for our benefit and what will only be done with the warning that you as city attorney will provide us which essentially is we're talking about open mics it's all being recorded it's all public that's what you said now you can go out and press conference in the parking lot if you want and talk to the media and do whatever we want but while there is some control in a limited public forum here we can watch what the city council says or just give a reminder to the city council for what's what they say and that's what i believe has that been circulated to everybody okay i can't pull up my email so i can't can't read it the thing that i wrote today that and for the record i did this was a 29 minute task and i am not charging the city for it because i told lynn and mayor manzo last week that i would write it so you had something specific in front of you and i'm not charged for it and i'm okay with that so don't ever bring that one up again um what i said is that the city council the current rule will remain accepted the council um may discuss litigation in accordance with section 768 point 280 paren eight for the statute so that that's providing that you you hold the discussion consistent with the shade meeting and then the second sentence is the city council may discuss prospective litigation provided that the city attorney first advised the city council concerning admission against interests and other legal safeguards so there may be times if i'm sitting here someday that will not be the case but whoever is the city attorney will inevitably say you have to be concerned about admissions against interest and you have to be concerned about other potential things that could be said and give you some safeguards it largely depends on what what kind of situation you're going to be discussing so to me that that's a good uh revision and it's something that i think you could consider nothing i totally agree with this proposed new subsection 263d i think it covers all the bases that we need to cover and i would suggest that we put this on the september meetings and then it provides your perspective i have a question i saw revealed the last statement that you are working on a attending resolution with this would this change allow that resolution to be legal well i'm going to choose my words carefully um that the resolution that was i was asked to prepare i prepared i ran the resolution through the ethical rule that i have to apply and i recommended that the resolution you would consider so that's a very clinical explanation of what i did and i think it was absolutely sound because the resolution would have conflicted with the in my opinion with the current city code revision would that code happen to have been section 2-63 deep yes sir thank you let's say something about that hopefully because care um that was my resolution i stand by that resolution but i will get a chance to make that resolution of the way this is what it is further i leave myself and see man to have this and this was a compromise for me so for those of you who think i'm tough with nails because [Music] elected official from speaking out in a public forum and we allow the citizens to speak on that same issue and when the reason that's given this declaration against interest is essentially to save the city liability i don't think that's a compelling state of interest that justifies the abridgement of an elected official speech if i wanted to i wanted to make this [Music] um [Music] [Music] because if we keep this up folks things will change in march but several laws might be on the outside look at these movies so [Music] [Music] i'm not taking any action on that motion but frankly and that resolution will work i appreciate it i said i'm forgetting about it so coming up together yeah the shade meeting discussions makes a lot of sense i have no questions or calls a discussion in public though i do have some reluctance because all the values against interest i mean that's initially that was what all that was for it seems like experience with some of the other stuff going on that's as they wanted to keep receiving is disgusting so again shave me has a that's a no-brainer that makes a lot of sense to me and that brings us in the line fine but again the most conservative response in a situation with people like this would be you don't have any discussion over the department if it's a value have [Music] the most conservative way of doing it is exactly what you said the problem with doing the shame meeting is it has to be current litigation it cannot be we got a letter that's threatening litigation and the case has to actually be filed it's not this lawsuit in a court or it could be an administrative proceeding but the proceeding has to be ongoing and active that's the requirement of state law so if you were going to choose the most conservative way of modifying 2-63-d you wouldn't add the second sentence you'd stop with the first i'll add one more comment in discussing this with mayor and lynn one of the things that i stressed was make make the if you're going to revise it make it consistent so it's consistent with the florida statute that that is what you're doing you're making a thousand percent clear with relation to the florida statute i did not go into the much more complicated aspect of the constitutional law issues i'm not dismissing them i'm not diminishing them at all but those are things although i consider stuff like that you have a far more accessible way of doing it that still achieves the same result so that that was one of the things i uh discussed in our conversation before we got to this point i also discussed it from the standpoint of y'all's procedure in the past has been discussed changes to the code if they're going to be initiated by the city council discuss them at a workshop and start out at the city council meeting so that was another thing we talked about that's that's what we have done just something for the council to think about is and you can look at other councils as our model as our large stake um for have to be very careful anytime you're telling an elected official that they can't say something particularly in a forum like this where we permit free speech providing you to the rules now what are our rules our rules are rules of you know you can't come up here and start swearing [Music] what you want to say here as long as you say it appropriately the problem that you know if you get into this discussion if you start chipping away at what those city officials can say i think you're going to run into a problem at least from my perspective i can see that becoming a problem i think this works and it allows you to cover both things of shape meaning allows you to cover existing litigation and the an informal discussion or a work session discussion or a council discussion allows you to cover any threatened litigation may be headed off before it becomes other i think we all will heed the warning of the city attorney saying watch what you say particularly you know let's say accidentally i'm walking out tonight and i knock somebody over in the hallway by accident they're suing us okay i know i better watch what i say about the axe but i mean we get sometimes into a situation you know in some of the other week was just asking if we had money set aside in the budget we're not discussing the case folks okay so we we have certain things that we need to know whether we're budgeted for somebody that those are peripheral discussions we start getting into the nitty-gritty now i i don't think we should be doing that in the open and people one other thought um you don't have to ever speak on this stuff if you don't feel comfortable you know the city attorney is going to say [Music] speak but be careful you know if you think you might say something you don't want to don't say anything no one forces anyone to talk to you so that's up to you if you wish to feel it but if you do it be careful with what you said don't go to the city okay i like it just the way it is on top of it we have other comments is that are you satisfied what deploy it is [Music] [Music] that we can move this to the next uh session for the uh change the next council section well i don't know i can't take a vote but not not there anybody close to moving this out we'll put it on the next session for uh authority vision just the way it is okay so uh september and then october thank you folks all right here's an older book good number two discussion of proposed ordinance 2102 amending chapter 86 signs of the city code of ordinances revisions this is the revision of the signpost regarding signs mr riley gave us a very detailed red line covering i think just about every comment that was made last time and this is the discussion through i know he's actually inserted in there where we're going to have this question if you'd like i can just take it from page one and we go through it because there is you know spots where we have to discuss it i'll say in general mr riley it's i think it's fine okay the only questions i'm gonna have are gonna be about some of the distances because we have different sign distances for different signs [Music] this is an incredibly detailed sign proposal and i'm not saying someone's not going to try and challenge it but i think we've done everything we can here to pretty much explain why we're doing what we're doing and you know the logic behind it and what makes sense so we'll go from the top down page one incidental to the land building or use and then a little eye signs be accessory and incidental to their respective land building structure or use what's the difference between the last line and page one of the top line on page two you know what i'm talking about you got here so you're not in the actual you're not in the actual um code provisions you're in the [Music] and then number two seems to reiterate some of that and questions why is it doing that that's why i'm struggling to track you yeah don't worry about it no i mean you know what you're gonna like i mean you get my copy if you wanna talk to you listen um i think i'm not sure why it's duplicated there might be a reason but i don't see it now anybody else hey well we've got page two in point two and say from page one two stage three queen you came on page three anybody page four again another slicing typo in section f um home to over 1560 people and we changed it on page two to be one thousand six point five five i didn't trip people against the comprehensive plan i assume you've got them exactly from the comprehensive plan correct all the items that you added everybody's good still 8. these definitions are really good they're very comprehensive were these from another sign ordinance or the combination from other cities or a combination of other cities and there are several of the terms that are defined elsewhere in the city code did you do the artwork i didn't do the artwork okay eight nine ten any questions on those page eleven day twelve thirteen i did do the artwork on twelve you did that that's good 13 for good 14. i have to say when i looked at that artwork i was thinking something else on first quick glance on what it says for a good car that's great page 15 16 17 18. 19 20. we do have some comment here um very good putting that the city council under uh 86-632 it says um the city council should debate the appropriate site and sign up for construction sign for the rm district so that's for perhaps at this point and i guess i'll just bring it up now because i saw this i mean it comes up on the next page but we have temporary signs we have this isn't the size but it's placed it's 15 feet from the road and on page 23rd free we have political signs that like nine feet from the road so i'm just not sure why all the difference and maybe there's reasons behind him i'm just not sure why he did it almost makes it a code nightmare i don't know how the city manager feels like that but it seems to me to be pretty difficult to remember all of that stuff so i don't want to take one and simply with the size and then we kind of go with two by threes or three by fives or whatever so it doesn't matter much to me i don't own a construction company but you know those guys do like to use a particular sign but they shouldn't be any bigger than a politician's sign or someone else that's what i feel are you asking a question no i'm just i'm kind of asking the question statements there are some differences with design placements and science size i just think that my initial objection we did the review was why does a guy building a house get more to say than the guy running for office you know you should have the same size really so that's just my two cents is i don't know if there's any official rule on it but it just seems fair that you know again i say you know so and so construction i mean we're running the city we should have can get our message out the underpinning of the whole thing is that this this is a residential community you don't have commercial this is not a commercial corridor like us 19 where you have all sorts of signs for businesses and the underpinning of what i tried to do in revising this is to put the aesthetics of the community it is the paramount standard that you're trying to achieve so a lot of the stuff especially the front end of the ordinance is oriented towards uh making clear what is the basis for you to do the actual regulation that you're doing so this this whole issue and i think this will be most of the things you all want to debate is you you have to decide as a city council what what is the appropriate parameters that you should put in for to achieve the aesthetics of the community that you're you have here and that's that's up to you to decide you know i'll just use an extreme example you're not going to say the sign has to be you know three inches by three inches because that wouldn't be much of a sign nobody's ever seen it but you you also don't want to to go to the other end of the spectrum where the the sign is 100 feet by 100 feet uh that doesn't fit either so you're somewhere in between and that's where you all to decide for political on page 25 we made the political sign two foot by three foot now everyone here has run and put out signs i don't think anybody's gonna have much of a problem with that some people have gone bigger not people on this council but some um referendums and other individuals who have run for some of the higher offices have put some of these fairly nice size signs out there which are bigger than this um i don't have a problem with 2x3 i think it's i mean i knew never found the three by five either so i mean you just have to pick it as a council there's no right or wrong but i think whatever we pick we're kind of it's my feeling this is typically made now whatever you limit a politician to you limit the construction of that to the cool guy now a cool guy should have more rights than you know no one general rights in the next steps and certainly not more than political employees well i think i think it's a good idea for [Music] ease to make it all unified like the the amount of um distance from the um curve or whatever should all be the same that way i think that would make it a lot less confusing l is a political side is it a construction side okay that one's 15. my bottom is nine let me get my ruler i just think if they're all the same that would make it easier for code and then i agree maybe you should just make a one uniform height that way nobody has a huge gregarious sign phenol mitchella versus so i'm just saying just keep it uniform that way just makes this easier to enforce you know what like some of the signs the bigger you know when you're building a big house they'll put up usually so-and-so construction that's like a by five maybe or a how big are they they're bigger than the average size so what are they usually doing yeah they're they're probably three by five they're not using four by sixes or three by sixes because they're more of a construction site so a lot of these are more versatile than they are and you still have to here's what i'm thinking if you really can help us out as a realtor okay three by five does that pretty much cover the maximums that everybody wants to go i mean you don't have to do a three by five you're as a pilot if you're running and you want to do those little yard signs you're two by three it's all you want you're good you don't have to go three by five we'll let you go three by five i think it covers most of the real estate science i think club is most of the construction sites i've seen bigger but in our city it's up to this council pick a number i mean you could say three by six i mean whatever we want though that everybody pretty much gets the same sign then nobody gets bigger nobody gets smaller three by five seems like that you should be able to get your message on that i don't mind but the only question i would want you to think about is we allow somebody to have an open house and right now they use the small two by three signs you really want a bunch of three by five or something so i think you have to differentiate a little bit because you don't want that what if every street had open house you've got three by five signs going down we have something special for open analysis too right do we have a special 50 or special they can put they can put currently they can put a sign at the end of the street you still keep your regular real estate side you don't have to go back pulling [Music] up to a 3x5 for you i don't think you can use two i'd like to see the signs all one size um a guy comes in and cuts your tree down and wants to put a sign up it advertises business i don't know i don't like signs at all i asked mr riley a while ago you're doing this is there a way we can make people that have a sign established in there you are for more than two weeks have a permit like if uh if i want to put a sign in my yard i only went there for two weeks it's fine but some of these signs they sit in the yards they rot i know there's verbage in there for you know you can't read them and everything like that but if you're gonna have a sign in your yard for more than two weeks it gets a little bit tiresome or whatever get a permit if we need to put permanent language in there i believe the free speech and every month you apply for a new permanent thing keeps the neighborhood a little bit cleaner too well i'll segregate out political signs political signs you have a time period when you can start in the time period when it ends so it's a defined period of time and the the other ones you as it as it's written now you don't have a defined time period it is simply you know what you're typically looking at is a house for sale that type of sign their i i'm i'm not that receptive to the the permitting the answer to it is can you do it yeah i think you you could do it but i i would be a little bit wary about doing it that way i mean aesthetically you you can define a not to exceed area and that that to me is a really good um restriction to reign things in to keep in mind the aesthetics but i i'm so sometimes just sticks with me that the putting that kind of limitation would i think give you some real problems at some point if it's something you want me to to look at further well i don't know i you would have enough support from this council to have a like i said you get your message out how long does it take to get the message out just like a political sign why is it only a certain amount of time well because political signs are the expression of your first amendment rights and those are why can't i put out on a run for whatever leave it in my yard forever you know i mean get could have you have people with you know signs for somebody running for 2024 the person hasn't even declared 2024 for president they're all over the street right you know and i support that person by the way but i'm not going to put assignment from yard for a 2024 election and i'm just frankly i think you know that's where we were trying to say how what can you do in terms of when you cut this thing because you know you can keep your your country center in your yard too i mean it just they don't that's quite cool i mean that's that's my point i mean it just trashes up into you i think you cover that here i mean i think you've covered it as best you can i think i've covered it too but if y'all have something that you want to look at further this is a time to to raise it and consider it if this council feels a permit might be a benefit design ordinance i think you should look at it doesn't it [Music] let's say we did a code inspection and the total officer comes out and inspects [Music] that makes sense but if we're just using it i understand the reason i understand exactly what you're shooting for but i just think that from constitutional and people are saying you know even though it's five dollars a year i would say oh here's my five they'll say you don't have to pay you do this it's our property well like my problem i'd start from a different angle i'm not talking angles i'm just saying different perspective if you're looking at a sign where somebody's trying to sell their house if it sells within the first week then and the con the deal closes then the signs removed and it may be replaced with a sold by sign for a very short period of time but practically the sign's not going to be there forever but if somebody puts a sign in their yard and the house does not sell then two weeks from now or a month from now they're still going to want passwords by to see that their house is for sale and that's you know to me that's practically a good thing that they can continue to use them i'll pick another category a construction sign there's some of these construction companies there and puts up the sign that they're building this home that's typically going to be for my guess would be less than six months no two years okay well it could be up to two years but you know i mean it's two years i hope it's a very extravagant home but you know practically to me you need to take into account the what the citizens are trying to do with putting the sign there in the first place and what purpose is it and is it a reasonable purpose that they're trying to achieve and i i would say if the signs there because they're trying to sell their house that that's you know i would suggest to you i would be careful about restricting too sharply their ability to sell their home i was talking about just signs in general i understand i understand where you're coming well the good thing is because you don't have commercial you're not getting the clutter that goes with commercial signs if you were having commercial commercial corridor you'd have to have a whole you know set of provisions related to the commercial signs because those are typically the electric signs the blinking signs the you know video signs all that stuff you're not dealing with that's fine because we're moving forward folks this is 12 feet that was what was in this originally again i i'm just asking for some consistency but they don't all have to be the same because we don't want to do that but we have to decide we need to let them know what to put in here so right now temporary signs say on 92 they shall not exceed 12 square feet so that's a four by three um i could look at that i just could ask the same thing when we get the political threat that's the only thing you know but are we all good with that so the 4x3 that includes any construction type signs i'm not sure we have construction separately i think that's yes and temporary size you know non-political okay so whenever someone's when someone buys property and then they work out a deal with a contractor generally the contractor comes in with a nice shiny sign that's showing off the home that they're about to build and letting the neighbors know that hey this guy's actually doing something with this empty lot or this old house i see a need for that sign to be larger but i don't see the sun a need for a 24 square foot political sign i i think i think there should be some differentiation between those uh also going back to the pert meting i think that those types of signs the instruction signs basically they should be given a certain amount of time in our code that's covered with the approved permitting for that work being done so you're issued a permit you're issued a permit sign or a signed permit and it's only good for so long and that way they get their message across hey we're getting a new roof hey we're building a new house and then it times out it goes away the only thing that i i caution the only reservations i have on that is that who is going to be issuing these permits and and maintaining them it sounds like a lot of overhead for the city to keep up with all the signs because construction is going on all over all over the city constantly on every street so how mr reeves how would you manage that i don't the current staff you couldn't manage that it's you know we uh we have a pre-permit process for you know construction they're getting a roof they come in you know a pre-permit and then they take it to the county but to try to manage it on every single sign and i recollect that there is something in the code already but i'm kind of trying to look here but about the length of time as an example somebody gets a new roof there's a limit you know there's something here right in fact it says that the sign shall be removed immediately upon conclusion of construction or in the case of the subdivision if you don't have the signs shall be removed properly for themselves i think these are a little bit different those are little tiny signs and they're temporary they kind of remind me of the whenever the lawns are sprayed for insects things like that i'm talking about the ones that are going to be there for a while i'm wondering if really the code officer as he's riding around whenever he sees one of these types of signs maybe it's not in our best interest that he just marks a date on it or a day whenever well if it's construction of a new home that home construction by our road says 18 months six months so technically that sign could be there 24 months if it's a new one and you know it's going to be on the ground blown into the water well down the street well i would say most of them try to keep those up because they want the advertisement now you're talking about the house on 25th street where there's no construction sign that's under the magistrates rule now of course [Music] that is two plus years but it's very fine but most of the contractors when we go to do their co all that stuff is gone you know they would try to get it out of theirs because they want their ceo what you're saying is that's not really a major target the bigger things are getting the you know the little signs of the yard because the project can be over uh i'll give you an example there's one on gulf boulevard the roof's on everything's done the sign was still there when you build these bigger houses your debt based main construction there's like way more than one sign over here and they're way bigger than you know everybody puts a fancy sign then smaller guys you know the guy who steals the papers you may just have a little campaign sign a little two by three but some of the other ones the specialty guys they get a number of signs out there and it becomes like a billboard almost i don't it doesn't bother me it really doesn't i mean the only point i guess i would give them with the online date is that i just think that i'm really proud that there's a new house going up and i'm glad that it's helping our values and making the city beautiful but whatever we let the construction guy do i think you have to at least let a political person have that same right i don't think political people are going to put up 100 you know six foot ten foot signs because i don't know you're gonna need a lot of funding if you're gonna do that but um i just i just it just doesn't sit with me right that the construction better the chance to say you know his message in a bigger form than a political person you know that's probably one of the more sacred speech rights that's right that's why why don't we just compromise instead of 12 square feet make 15 and that'll be a 3x5 which should be enough to be able to for construction i mean frank you can say if that's good enough for construction and then more than adequate for political and just make it uniform i'm just thinking to make it easier for code that way they don't have to think about all the dimensions if you look up at the ceiling above me where that light is and if you took those two squares and another two squares and then there's two cut off squares going by b that's like a three by five or four by five that's that's a that's a pretty big sign so yeah i mean i think that covers it that'll take care of your construction guide i mean if you want to print up all of the signs that big an election have fun you don't get a lot of contributors it hasn't been a problem either i mean people have just done it even though we have a restriction on smaller signs so we really haven't bothered people um three by five eight robin beat up to 15 feet threat so that would be three by far fifteen feet total [Music] anything else on 20. 121 we have the same thing with the sign with the size i guess it's the same number right right that should be the same number one i would say no so 15 it is sprint spread the placement here and i'll ask this to the city manager maybe i don't know why so so down here on the bottom of 21 you have temporary signs should be placed not less than 15 feet from the edge of the street and now the public by the way or eastman okay that's fine then if you go two pages later page 23 for open house signs and classes of five you know i think they're nine the other nine is there like and then you know so like is there a reason why we have the different things for different signs oh and then political signs of 25 are seven and a half ticket looks like so i'm just wondering why if there's a good reason well they say they would need to one be out of the right way so that that should be the first parameter and then beyond that it's what what do you what do you want i agree with the right way is there a reason why one is better than the other or they'll consider could these all be the same or they have to be different just trying to keep it simple one of the things we talked about is complexity of our code here we have a 29-page site where the sign ordinance you know there's a lot i think keeping them out of the right way but the right ways change all over the city and so as an example in bellevue state's island they got a big broadway what we did on the election and i think we did this with your pretty much approval was says seven and a half feet he stepped seven enough feedback from from uh valley code and you stepped aside three four three it was three cases that took care of it now i think technically you might be in the right way but like you said you can go around the city and take up every sign that you do that because if you put it too far back you won't even see them but yet go on too close that you block people's line of sight for traffic i mean i think seven eight feet nine feet off the curb line and it's good but that's just from my personal experience so i don't you know your city manager you tell us what the right line of sight should be should be we'll standardize it as we should or if you want to leave them all different we can leave them all differently let me just get some clarity but seven and a half feet is what we've always used for political science okay you know even though the runaway may be different but technically they're supposed to be and i think if you do that you're not blocking anyone's line of sight down the street right you know by time you're seven and a half nine feet in you're not the problem is of course you know that you know you may place them properly but a landscaper worker will come along because he's got the lawn and then he just he doesn't know so he just sticks it back i mean that's one of those things that i know we have to bring in here we can actually pick up the sign but if we i would urge our code person to just reposition it you know because chances are it's just somebody put it in the wrong spot i would say again for simplicity make it all uniform so if you want to do i mean seven and a half feet kind of decimal points are kind of silly on this i mean make it eight feet maybe ten whatever you decide would just make it all the same but definitely out of the right way so what would you say the longest right away was like 10 14 or 15 to a few years [Music] and honestly i think if it was like my neighbor had a bush that was common blocking and i told them and they cut it down so um i think in that situation my neighbor would move the sign out of her by the way but i'm assuming so it doesn't bother me i would say just make it standard not half just whole numbers whatever is eight feet reasonable everybody once plus [Music] or thinking from the sidewalk back right i think we used her down there what are we doing okay all right this is sorry though yeah yeah there's some sidewalks five feet two feet you need to change this i don't think this is going to get not loaded on because you make it nine so if you go back tonight or tomorrow and you say you know that really should be nine or does anybody have an objection if we give them a two or two to play with here so we're recommending eight if it comes in at nine we're not bringing this back to session so we'll hold on a little bit with that [Music] that's page 20. 21. you have a comment in here about how you got this language um this is the supreme court language this is fine i mean as far as i'm concerned it's perfect this is the best way to define something that would be an offensive type of sun and i don't think you need to go any further than that you're on page 22 22 now sorry yeah there was nothing else covered we covered the standardization with 2021. unless anybody had anything else you know 22 fred had comments about how he came up with what an offensive sign harmful to minors and this is a hornet's nest but i think you can find with this this is the supreme court language and th this is what's like this it's still supreme court language or getting interesting not legal unless somebody has something better okay anybody fred we have another comment on it too it says the city council should debate the parameters for temporary signs for events and provide direction not sure what what you're looking for from us well this is a point you raised [Music] about shouldn't we be doing something related to signs for events and uh for for events like a birthday party for instance so i would say still do the 15 and hopefully the birthday party won't last that one day [Music] you know that's fine um the only thing i think where i was questioning this is the temporary sign that comes up were oh i just want to make a statement it's not an event that's going on the battle it's just the statement you know um whatever you know i love my chihuahua robin's favorite okay i love my chilola it's a temporary thing it's not a balance i really love my chihuahua i want to put it out there i'm going to put a picture of a chihuahua okay so how long do we let that stay out there you know i mean we let it stay out forever you know i guess that's where best came in and he had the right to do it i think he had the right to do it and actually people have cutouts in their yard of sea creatures and things like that so i mean well help me out here i don't know well it's subsection two is one of the this this goes to a lot of the changes if it was an existing thing of the code i didn't change it unless i felt it was necessary so i think that's been the rule that you've been working with and there's a need to change it and give me some direction on how you want to change it if it's there's not a need then don't bother with it i could come up with all sorts of hypotheticals about it but you're you're giving people some flexibility and you know people may want to put up the i love a certain kind of dog sign now over here we have six square feet per residence assistant on page 22 even one because that's what you asked us on the next page is the debate the sign size that's rl and then we have 24 therapy on all other districts page 23 for the capital science for the sizes on number two it's saying for specific special one-time event says sale of property construction and progress election or grand opening so isn't that kind of what we already did so i would say just keep it consistent because if we change this number then it may conflict with the previous 15 right i'm reading this right so i would say just 15 across the board across the board so there's no confusion council [Music] 22 23 for you [Music] yes just so you see um this is where then it's gonna really get the last word but three roman numeral i uh two small group in the world too we have nine feet on that one so if you're talking eight feet nine feet whatever you pleasure it doesn't matter i don't think the bus but you should probably keep that standard but you'll pick it when and but you know 89 feet is probably what we were all thinking um there's no other comments in 23 we moved to 24. franklin comment on 24 and he said subjection death provides a reasonable procedure for removal on all the temporary sides i think i feel it does not everybody else's [Music] good okay 25 this is where we get to the bottom we have a temporary political signs you have two by three so we're gonna go three by five to keep it consistent correct all right robin said yes anybody else i have one issue here be free we find the candidate if the homeowner doesn't take out the sign a political sign i mean what are you going to do like somebody just hangs on to your side and sticks it out there i just think we should just prompt the state and sign and not worry about the three dollar client because the candidate has a limit to how much they can do you know if i give you a campaign sign or somebody gives you a campaign site you don't give it back to me or you hide it and stick it out there three weeks later i mean that's not my fault you know you go around the city you pick up all your signs but if somebody sticks around your garage you know do you really need to find them when this this is old language i think yeah just take the darn sign if you see it after the election's over [Music] you want to scratch i don't it to see any purpose of it we we have for the realtor signs if we pick them up and bring them in right have the real term there is a fee for that right but the political ones i mean we're gonna get final trump and probably gonna pick up the sign and you know well maybe we should still all right so we'll scratch that turn and we'll [Music] the period will stay there but the failure pretty much anything but the political signs i can understand i think we got more of a lawsuit with 29 pages now than we did when we had with six or eight i mean i would be my three-year-old granddaughter always put stickers on me i'd be afraid to walk out this door and say okay i'm in violation [Music] i just think this is just out of control i think i mean it's a lot but if it covers any loopholes that could potentially lead to litigation on board i did notice on page 21a going back to permitted temporary signs the second to the last line says within 48 hours after the culmination of the event it says sale election close of business special event should we get take out elections since that would typically be a political sign it should be under political science section yes frank your point i mean i think you're right this is fun we have [Music] that covered his roof they were visible probably from you know um i mean if i'm that person's neighbor i'm going like what the hell and it wasn't a sign it was like a banner attached to the roof it was like okay guess what it was my guy okay that he was supporting you know that's what maybe that would be my guy next time it doesn't matter who this guy is you know it's like wow you know we pride ourselves on keeping this community so good and then you know and by the way it was perfectly within the rules of building it you know i mean because we didn't really cover it i know this country has to cover everything and for tremendous amount of work but i mean if you don't specify it then you're gonna get like challenge after challenge you know so that's why like i commend you i pray to my god that you break the heart and hearts of this council and get the city moving i commend you mr gaddis tonight i mean i don't want to be the thorn here but i just got to speak my mind i mean that's it i mean like i said you put a ton of work in this and i i think it's great it's just totally confusing you're an attorney leslie shane what's he talking about i understand i just don't think the average i'll say let it come out of debate we're only one page away or two pages away from finishing this thing but they come out of committee bring it up if this gets shot down because we think it's too complex and we're gonna have to go back and tear it down but you know you tear it down and it won't curl so you know you can turn thread loose with a red marker on it and see what he can cut out of it but i don't know that does it you know so i think it would be helpful and and i hate to ask fred to have to spend more time on this and cost the city money but i think it would be beneficial for all of us to see a copy that's what he thinks is complete is missing all the comments all the red all the yellow so we can go through and read it without distractions because it's overwhelming completely overwhelming there's there's some of us crystal clear some other places are like okay what what's going on here and i think in that format uh it'll be easier to digest just like it is in need of code and then we go from there that's a great suggestion i agree with that can we get through this though so we can give them all the comments that we have at least on this channel no no no no i'm just saying no no no no we are three pages away from giving him all the comments that we have we'll basically put this on another quick session and then it will come up for next month's works session um [Music] actually you can get that clean copy out now the problem is we don't really want to be debating this in a public section you know because if anybody has changes let's say dave looks and says you know it's good but let's get rid of some of these definitions there's too many okay we can't do that when we put this out we have to pass it or reject it so i'm going to say just we're so close to finishing this finish this up give him our comments let him do that comment like dave said basically clean it up send it back to us and we'll see you all here in september and if you like it then it'll be october november and we'll finally pass this on next time that work for everyone yeah i agree i think the comments are necessary because this is to me like a rough draft ready for approval and then once we get approval you can clean it and then i just think we're getting comments i'm just saying okay i've already got a copy like this i want to see a clean copy so that i can just read there as the citizens are going to see it i think we're good with that so let's wrap up the next couple pages right then just basically clean it up let's have it you can have it before that session if you're you know but if you have it ready for whatever we're doing on one session that's fine okay um i think on paper on page 25 so basically it's 16 feet when they just said we're scratching this thing with a civil penalty anybody have any issues on 26 27 [Music] 28 29 i just have to agree with frank here [Music] has gotten so descriptive i think you're endangering running into more loopholes i single lawyer out there is going to try to find a loophole in this thing and you're almost going to have to do that in search to be able to find certain things during my research for electronic science i looked at a lot of assigned audiences from various [Music] [Music] remember correctly last year where do we have our challenge we have two people and one council says come in one guy was pretty understanding with us he is right he was a big-time attorney who was like you know i could sue the city but i really don't want him and we have a couple people challenging us on this thing but probably all these stuff that's on our clothes and it was worked out yeah i mean something's worked out and the same manager handled it without having a 30-page document you have to refer to you know the citizens so i'm going to be so lucky next time and that's well i mean i guess my point is just that you if you try and write a bullet-proof organs to protect against every challenge i mean eventually this thick city i mean [Music] this will take out the layman people that don't have the constitutional law background to be able to nitpick this this may avoid a few people from going ahead if they see this and like that's kind of detailed never mind as opposed to two pages as they like oh well even i as a late person can read into this so i just think this is more of a a roadblock it's not a concrete wall to block but it's definitely something a speed bump along the way so i think something definitely needs to be done because another thing is we with that one case yes we worked it out he was very but we also kind of suspended our sign ornaments and didn't have any rules so it was kind of a free-for-all so every time somebody comes up and challenges we can't suspend our ordinance until we fix it so we had two questions in how many years and during the period we suspended the sign ordinance what happened i mean it wasn't dodge city out there from my recollection of the events i mean i didn't see billboards going up in residential areas i didn't see you know flashing signs on 22nd street or at least whatever i mean are we trying to solve a problem that doesn't really exist but i'm just throwing [Music] that you can say is optional or maybe it will be cut there's one more discussion of this thing and we have some time to do it and if it's too unwieldy then fine we'll play it but if we reject this after still no sign ordinance being forced and we've got to go back to the throwing ball all over again so we were working on this for a while you know but if you have a list of your suggestions obviously if you see someone say you really don't need this then make an option you know you pull it out i tried to change as little as possible believe it or not i also looked at other cities and looked at the ways in which they put in material that's at the front end of the whole code scheme and the object of doing that was to lay a foundation that would be defensible in court so that you could say we as a city made every conceivable and reasonable effort to explain what the basis of was for the standards that were putting in place and that i know took up a lot of room i mean for me for me i you know the amount of space is is not really the value in the relevance but what it counts is the legal standards so the legal standards i i tried to put in based on the feedback that i got from the city council my my hope with this is that if you do enact this as it is it's basically written that if you ever have a challenge you will be able to in court say look at this from these provisions we did everything we could to lay a foundation for the standards that we put in place and the standards that you put in place are consistent with our desire to have an aesthetic community that's not cluttered up with a whole bunch of signs that's that's the argument that i think you need to be able to make it all balanced all i'm going to end with then is how much time have we put into this one orders how many council sessions how many work how many nano hours how many billable hours have we put into this thing to withstand the supreme court challenge that may or may never come and to to a more priority thing we have spent hours discussing this thing over and over again and we are about to go into the budget session and we look like we will we will spend a fraction of the time on our actual budget which is realistically hundreds of thousands of dollars and instead we're wrapped around the axle on a supreme court challenge that may or may never come so i'll leave with that let's put him in [Music] so you know what there's the thing done is proactive lawyering which is to avoid the lawsuit and it's and there's it needs to be pharmaceuticals to keep you out of the lawsuit you don't want to win the supreme court but taking all we should pass the signals any other comments on that i didn't ask for citizens is there any citizen comments i'll close it then item three his budget workshop to review fiscal we pretty much went through the budget there was a couple of things that uh we went back and changed and then there was a question about the generator and uh i provided you a copy of the quote we got from a sabbat power system so we at the last works or last meeting we decided or the constant decide to keep the code enforcement in-house our united house contracted that will increase the code enforcement budget by about thirteen or fourteen thousand dollars give or take we set it up for 20 hours a week totals 52 000 decrease the staff cost of 39 620 and we increased the audio visual the that came in at uh six thousand dollars more than what we had already put in the uh budget we put 30 it came in at 36. so that those are the real changes in the budget there's 600 more insurance in the marina fund and today i got the insurance bill for next year and we've got about a 4100 increase in that so i'll have to increase that i guess the last question is what do you want to do with the generator do you want to move it forward that would increase the budget by about 160 000 for next year if you want to go and purchase it in next year's budget currently we're using two hundred and twenty [Music] six thousand dollars of reserve so that would increase that to uh 160 [Music] [Music] i just was two hours going through this with the league of cities but um i saw uh an email ironically on the same day i was in the course we're gonna get like half of that i know right up front coming up real soon so is we figuring that into our budget i know it's these are a lot of different things so well really for us the only thing it's for is really stormwater that's the only because what the money is supposed to be used for broadband i don't think the as a broadband problem rural area storm water is the predominant thing that we can use it for so that can help us with our projects the state told me last week right after i sent her right before i set that email out to kind of give you an update because our number increased from seven 678 thousand to eight hundred and two thousand so the first uh number we're going to get 400 1 000 but it's going to have to be focused for us i think on stormwater projects which will help us because there's a stormwater project in next year's budget capital budget and that's part of this reserve we'll take back so we're going to benefit from that when we're going to get that money at this point i don't have a firm date they said they were going to send us the agreement they told me if i didn't receive it by today to send them an email i sent him an email because it did not come in and i've reached out to a couple of the other communities they haven't got their agreement yet either so if you have difficulty dealing with these people one of the benefits of attending this thing was those people were at this stuff i've got numbers i've got emails if necessary um the cities has this too legal cities actually has an advisor for this so if anybody's kind of giving you the run around what you need we can get that money because there's people who are that's all they're doing is getting that money for people so uh no i have the contacts and they they have you know when i sent them an email typically they respond back so i haven't got any issues with that at this point really you can't really as an example if the money comes in before september 30 and technically it's in this year's budget the current year budget uh if it doesn't come until after october 1st then we're going to have to go back and amend this budget and that money is not set up in this budget okay until till i knew we had it there's there's no and realistically everything i understand about it we can put the money and stick in the bank and draw pennies on interest but we can do that because it's it's actually cash there are reports that we're going to have to make to uh the state have to spend it but we have to especially have to spend it i think it's 2026 is the ultimate date of spending the expenditure 24 24 yeah yeah for but the first i'm sorry i know i was right it's period of performance you have to include like december 31st 2026 2026. oh maybe they've changed it but what they sent us was 24. just so you know i mean i think you're pretty much right with what you said in terms of infrastructure that's probably where it's going to lie here what they recommended is that we include our citizens in any discussions before we spend this money just to give you something probably most of this doesn't apply to our city okay but um this is a legacy slide they're to send it out to us but respond to negative economic impacts including assistance to households small businesses and non-profits aids impacting industries you can even give incentives to people for vaccines and stuff like that premium credit workers performing essential work provisioning government services the extent of reduction in collective revenues and then make necessary infrastructure investments water soar or broadband so and that this is just a summary slide apparently there's like a website that has all the information right you know there's a lot of stuff that that we might be able to do or we'll probably wind up guessing well i mean that's what we've been trying to do is get the infrastructure cleaned up for the city and this amount of money could take care of probably three three years of projects so uh but we'll get an agreement and once we get that agreement we'll have to get it signed and then we'll go forward with got the agreement today i read the whole thing this afternoon and it's very it's what you'd expect from the federal government it's you know very detailed the parameters of what you can use it for two pages one of the principal things i know because i know in cities likely to use it for this as water sewer and broadband infrastructure and then there's also the 2026 is the correct end date of it and the the thing that i would expect based on having read the document is you you'll probably get it before the end of the week and then if you you should approve it by resolution in september and my expectation would be you you in all likelihood will not receive the funds uh right away i i'm sure you would not get until october and you're only going to get half the funds anyway right the second half will come a year later so that's that's really what i would expect i don't think you're going to get any more but i know we do have to approve it i might have to sign here the council has to approve it and then i sign it perhaps there's a document that has to be signed in city this is a question that came up today and i specifically told them based on what i read in the agreement you should do it as a formal resolution so you have a resolution that you can handle them to show them you did this through through the proper process it has to be uh 200 000 i just i just can't live with that it's too much money you know i i understand it maybe that's what it costs to generate you know how to generate for this entire building i guess my question is that we really need it for the whole building you know if we were in a position where we're going to be without power for a period of time you know can we somehow work you know the office is the key here um and keep that running but do we have to have i mean we're going to use this let's say it's a cooling station or a rest station for people who didn't have it that that makes sense to me but if this is if we just have a you know air conditioning a hall that we're not in i mean we can hold in a tragedy and a horrible thing we could hold a council meeting on a pile of rubble if we had to so i mean i don't know that we need to have this all lit up the beautiful you know when the other citizens are you know maybe without power for weeks on end so and i think dave wrote up last time about other generator companies and stuff i saw that number and like yikes that's that's just the chunk of change and if we could maybe just do a piece of it it just doesn't seem necessary to me that we have to do this at this point and for something that really doesn't happen very often you know maybe it doesn't happen at all is this about this this is about the same cost as what our five-year plan was yeah it is okay so i i think it wasn't the suggestion wasn't to just jump on it immediately or i thought it was to advance it to a two-year plan so we just followed half of one year and then next year that way we've got it much faster but the purpose of the entire building is so for the people that are on this side of the bridge and they are without power and can't go anywhere this is a safe haven for them because it's a large room we've got the hallways it serves as an emergency shelter i see no reason why i couldn't and that's why it's imperative to to keep the building powered up and as far as the offices go well uh people are going to be here someone's going to have to if if people are here i'm sure that somebody on this council and the staff are going to be in this building during the crisis is that we were last time okay so so i'm the power for keeping the whole building hot you know energized um but if it doesn't seem if everyone else is uh thinking that's too much for one year um i hate let's space it out and get it done faster because we are sitting on a pile of cash that's reserved specifically for a disaster and what disaster are we going to what are we going to do with that money if disaster occurs we're going to clean up our streets and repair government facilities right right so um i don't know it just seems to me like it's a no-brainer if that's what we're reserving the money for um one year two years i don't want to wait five the it was a whole gaggle of people over there that were upset about the sign and they specifically called out why haven't you bought a generator why aren't you keeping this this building open uh during emergencies they've spoken i listened and uh and i think i think it should happen you know i'd agree with that and i think you're right on that but history last time we didn't keep this building this building had power steve mark for a bunch of people that didn't have power single citizens on the other side of town i believe he brought him to this building and they were turned away and we had air conditioning here and this room was open and they could have cooled here this is not a shelter okay and they and it wasn't loose and i remember when we were facing the last hurricane i remember looking at that sun and i said to the city manager i said if this happens again you can put up to 140 people in here and i agree and if we're going to do that and count me totally behind this generator okay this isn't a shelter i don't think it's it's watertight safe that we can use it as an actual escape shelter you've got to get off the island but after you get back on the island you'll find that your power is not going to come on for two weeks like what happened last time um that if we have to have air conditioning here we're lucky enough generator then during the day we could set up chairs and people can come here and cool down instead of staying in their country house so if we can do that you want my vote how many uh did you go out for bids on this well this is uh i believe this one's off a state contract so we would still have to go out to bid but this is a good starting point and i was estimating by the time we bought it five years from now it would cost us somewhere in this range they did tell us that the the wire costs that went up dramatically and that's by the increase because the cost we got a year and a half ago was like two hundred and ten thousand dollars so it's went up 25 000 in that short time for it i agree with both sides of this thing and i think the way you cut the cornea here is you need to come up with a needs assessment we need to go into our disaster emergency plan and what are the expectations in the event of emergency how many people are you going to sleep over here what kind of food preparation do you have what electronics needs do you have i'm not quite sure that it goes to just power i she needs wisdom there but i think it's incumbent upon us to come up with a needs assessment of state what is it we're really planning to do with this building in the event of an emergency what are the expectations and what services are we going to provide and what power are we going to need if you look at any ship any airplane they all have essential or emergency buses on them so that you know you can start a little shedding power requirements and you're down to just the essential lights you have the essential heat or the cooling you need and central electronics and i think we need to start thinking about in those kinds of turns rather than just hey let's flip the switch and turn on the lights in the air conditioning well we wouldn't stay here anyway we would uh the emergency myself and the staff would go our first place is uh saint jerome's catholic church that's that's where we have our eoc at it's it's best expected to be further it's the in indian rocks uh is it bad because patty you know responding then we move further inland too but that that's how we operate right now we would leave the island just like we did last time and then come back when you know they let us back up of course i came came back in the last time that morning after the hurricane so staff comes back to do evaluation and then the sheriff finally left people back on the island i think it was like five o'clock and i fired but we were here you know since seven o'clock in the morning and we pushed some things out of the streets and uh uh of course they had to get our glove slide pulls off the bridge but uh you know i don't understand a little bit but you know you've got the events leading up to the event you've got the event and then you've got the post events and the cover kind of stuff and so while people may be coming home they may be coming home to know power or whatever and how long is that going to last and then maybe what kind of services or assistance might we provide from a community center so i'm happy to take this offline and try to come up with some scenarios and some different alternatives going to your point i think it's an excellent one i think we do have that plan because now you've got me thinking about it yeah it's great then we're open but you could conceivably have 1500 people in this city and we hold 140 so what are we going to do you can't have people lining up and then they're going to say you know what's the parameters how long do i get to stay i want you know do i get an hour two hours so i mean to your point i do think that this all works hand-in-hand what are we going to do what's the expectation and if the expectation is we're going to use this then sure i think it makes all the sense in the world and power the whole thing up and this becomes something that instead of the city sees us spending two hundred thousand dollars to maybe keep an office going the office is vital don't get me wrong you know that's the nerve center if we're putting the city back together but we're spending two hundred thousand dollars we're also willing to say for the citizens of thousand you don't have power you're gonna be able to come in there cool down even if it's for a couple hours you know to me talking to citizen hearing that can't really match it whenever that last one came through uh it was it was whenever i was in the process of buying my home that i have now and uh we were temporarily housed in a condo during the transition period power went out it was out for a week and it was hot and there was no way to cook most people didn't have gas in their their condos and the safe haven for everyone was that they would take a break get out of the heat walk over to the community center where three gentlemen had brought in generators kept them running and they had cook stove they had a refrigerator they had basically all the necessities that that were needed uh to help people to give them some belief and i see no reason at all why we shouldn't we should be able to offer that as uh as a service to the community that we love so much anyone could disagree with that and i mean your point we had power because we happen to be off the main um the gulf route so i came back at 4 30 my power was on i think at 7 30. none of my neighbors except for one of my next day was had it we ran extension courts from our house across the street into their house so they could run fans at least just to pull off and stuff do a little bit have a little bit of light having one light i went without it in hurricane sandy for two weeks having no life two weeks in a row they really get yeah um so yeah i mean what they've just said if you come in here for two hours that's great but of course when that puts a burden on you on top of yeah you gotta get the city back together so you don't have an unlimited staff you've got five people so i i'm gonna claim we need to kind of think this through as to what we want to do and how it's gonna be run because you don't want you know a thousand people banging on your door saying i want you so but you know there is an overarching consideration here that is and we've heard from the residents that this is a priority so i think we need to be thinking in terms of stepping up the acquisition of an emergency generator in here we can size it appropriately and do that but i think we need to start budgeting money and he's been doing that so at this point i think the consensus is getting done within this budget cycle in the next budget cycle so if that's the case then we would need to increase this budget cycle based on this number because right now that's what i'd probably use uh is we'll have with what's in the current budget right now we'll have 80 000 so we would probably need to increase in 40 more thousand this year or let me say in budget year 21-22 and then the next year if we wanted to buy it that year the budget for that year would be 120 000 at this point before we're going to consensus [Music] [Music] i think that really does give us the all you know we can set money aside but when we actually go out to purchase it but if we go with the existing number and plan it over two years that gives us time to figure out the right size for this and you money in the budget and if we decide 200 000 is the right number we're on track board if we decide it's less we've already got money in the bank ready to right so if we want to split it over two years i'd recommend that we add another 40 to this year's current budget that would mean we'd set aside 80 and we'll then next fiscal year which is 22 23 we would either plan to buy spend the rest or set aside the rest of the money to buy the generator in that year or we've already had the money there and you're not gonna you're not gonna be dipping into the economic issue because uncle sam's giving you 400 000 plus dollars so we're i mean we should have the money to do pretty much what we need to get done this year and now so if you're going to do it it seems to me this is where you're you're not going to miss it that's what i'm saying well technically you know if we want to move our budget forward down yeah yeah so in the in the current budget that we proposed we are going to pull money from the reserves because we don't have any money from them right so with the intent to backfill the emergency so what we do then is i'll add an additional 40 so our reserve amount would be about 270. yes you put that in here two years ago something like that junior square 7th street um a couple things we had talked before about buying power sistering up with other cities and buying through them these bigger cities have we tried that what did you say about it through other cities so say the county contracts and we could hop on one of their contracts and purchase them have we tried that and if there's yes if there's a state contract and and i'm not positive but this there is my recollection but that's a couple years three four years ago there was a state contract for generac generators in the state so or if another cities purchase the generator typically you can piggyback off of them if it's light to light so we're going to research that and the second thing is i caution you to see because working with emergency management has like i have in the past we cannot say this is an emergency shelter not unless you classify under the state so we are not as it stands down we are not a shelter we can make this a cooling area but i caution us as to how we label it i think we need to do our homework on that before we make any statements um for this city's sake on that also you talk about cooking i mean we don't have the cooking facilities here so if we don't address that and whatever mr khan is going to research i think that could be come up in a problem the other thing i recommend is if you've got a new cooling station just doing the hours that city employees are here that way it's monitored but anytime we do an emergency shelter you have to have some kind of medical stuff here police they're already stretched then i and we're not certified i don't think anybody's looking for the designation as an emergence of shelter we're just looking to provide comfort and relief services that's what i understand mr gaddis had said that originally and so i just want to make sure that we title it in the correct manner there's a hurricane you need to leave the island the bridge yeah we might talk about using this yes it would be more of a cooling station no one's going to stay overnight that's not the way and that's probably what it should say in the mornings after the fact i don't think there is any warning at this time well no he's going to he's going to try to put together some more and so i'm just bringing that up mr glennis it was it this was never even meant to be a shelter and i don't think that's what the discussion was i think it was more these are these are all hypotheticals that i'm trying to find good uses for our money and to provide a service to the citizens i think we're all in the same way [Music] i'm not sure what they would do for us but there's always incentives to add more gas appliances they like that kind of stuff so they have incentives for this they have incentives for hot water heaters and gas lines and everything else so there may be some type of incentive for generators i don't know no there's not there's not there i got a free upgrade i want to meet her yeah that's that's what you get they pay you know they charge you for taking the line we've already got that we've always taken care of that we have a tankless water heater here so uh but there's no okay they they give you a breakdown what the generators would cost the labor because it just seems awful high to me 225 000 it's uh i can tell you from previous experience in another city where i put in three of these generators this is the price is not even the one 210 for the 150 kw was not bad so heck for your house japan but they didn't you just get one it was about 15 grand maybe closer to 20. it's it's a big deal you could buy a cummins uh 150 800 800 amp i think for around forty thousand dollars generally now you gotta hook it up of course you know what i'm saying right now switch the wiring and that's that's not gonna run up 160 000 the most expensive uh portion of it was the plumbing and then running the electrical through a heavy conduit and the the wire itself was beyond cheap yeah it isn't because you're doing six and four days hard we're talking 150 kilowatt where mine was 22. so it's it's quite a bit larger i i don't know if this is accurate pricing or not but like it says we have to go out anyway some consensus to move forward on the generator the budget right okay [Music] i think we're ready for next presentation is the real one actually part of the citizen's first approval right all right at least september 8th is the first uh budget hearing at this point i'm still recommending to leaving the military as it is you've got an opportunity to do a few additional things in the city and i think that's uh it's costing me uh i think i've calculated its cost in the average resident about 70 a year i'm saying average for total tax yeah okay [Music] i thought that was our tax increase the tax increase is that's based on value increase which was 7.6 this year so that's where we're at do you have anything else on the budget nope you'll get a in the next package you'll get the memo for the first budget hearing it'll talk about the changes and setting the millage rate second budget hearing is on the 20th of september third monday 505. so we can go to the 505 club afterwards we'll come to the work session afterwards but that will be two resolutions passed and other than frank i think everybody's been through that before okay that's all i have you have any general business [Music] one thing i will tell you we got our preliminary crs verification visit rating and we maintain the six which is a good thing uh because i was concerned that we did change some things we don't have streams here but we're able to get some extra points joining the public information group at the county and uh kudos to barbie for participating in that because we needed a resident and he volunteered and kyle did a heck of a job and created maps for me and doing some other things so i think it was a good effort and we ended up previously we had 2042 points and the new one we have 2170 points so so that's a good thing and that takes effect for five years you just have to do verification each year remember the meeting is september can't be on the tuesday night well uh can't be on tuesday because this uh county commission meets just so you know we have a paid records request that has been made i'm trying to attempt to answer it and i can't do it because they're not specific so i need to see if i need to tell me what we can do because he has to answer the other half of it so um other than that um second all in favor all right"
