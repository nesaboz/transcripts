    "transcript": "i got the last no i'm sorry the agenda for today oh yeah yeah i left her with agent okay okay perfect okay so um i'd like to call to order the parks and recreation board meeting for wednesday april 14th our city of bellar beach so i don't know if any of you know but our secretary rick resigned about a week after our last meeting so the first thing that we need to do before i guess we do anything is i guess every april we vote on board members so chair vice chair and secretary and when i came in to volunteer i believe it was november like i guess it just blew up i really didn't know a whole lot about it but it was george rick and i and he literally sat here and said we can't proceed with the meeting until we vote on these positions um and like obviously i need a secretary to take notes today rick's not here and we need to vote in a new one so we're going to do that before we approve the agenda or the last one because i need someone to like follow up on that and then before we vote on anything i just kind of want to explain the different positions i know you see kind of what you see in the meetings but just you know if you have any questions i'm just going to give a brief outline of each one so if you're the chairperson of this committee you obviously run the meetings and you put together the meeting notes and i i mean i guess it's different for anyone that runs it but you if you're the chairperson you kind of decide what the agenda is kind of where you want to leave the meeting um like i met with lynn reeves you know i probably talked to patty two or three times a week you know i've been talking to kyle because of the t-shirts and stuff so i at least a couple times a week i'm talking to or in the building with somebody here and then just follow up for different things that you're doing or signing things and then up to your discretion you can do reports at every single city council meeting if you choose or you can do the quarterly board report where you just kind of fill everybody in on what's going on what we're working on like what they need to vote on or approve etc and then the vice chair position would basically be like say i woke up today and i wasn't feeling well and i couldn't come to the meeting but it was already um a public notice you know i can't call and say or the chair can't call and say i cancel this meeting i don't feel good the vice chair would then have to run the meeting like so everybody has the meeting notes the vice chair would just therefore take over the chairperson's full responsibilities for either that week that month that day however long the chairperson was at and then the secretary lynn provides like um an outline uh so basically our notes are kind of bullet pointed so you kind of say you know george um first this motion and nicole seconded it and it passed you know five to one or six to one or however many people are here you basically just keep an account of what our meeting was like and then you take it home you type it up and you email it to patty so you can't just hand over your handwritten notes from the meeting because a lot of times i guess you can't read them and she's like you know they need to be typed up and sent to me and usually you have two weeks to do it she doesn't expect it right away she just needs it in time to um get everything together and then put this together for us to approve and sign at the following meeting so does that make sense oh and then for the different positions hey hello did you finish your meeting early yes okay so you can hand you have your handy dandy recorder i think i'm i'm recording now so okay but whatever um oh and so as far as positions go you can um nominate yourself you can nominate someone else and then we just vote you know on each position so does anybody have any questions or any thoughts or any nominations they'd like to make and honestly like say if i nominate george for vice chair again and george doesn't want it then he has the right to say no i'm you know i'm stepping back i don't want to take this responsibility for the next year or whatever so you do have that option if someone else nominates you and obviously if you don't want it you don't nominate yourself so meetings are set by the chairs yes or three times a month it is whatever it is so the only reason i'm saying that i don't feel like a champion yes well that and the fact that i will tell you because most of you don't come to the city council meetings and obviously due to certain affiliations the mayor who is the most vocal when i speak when i give our board presentations was very much in favor of how the last council or chairperson ran this council so according to him he want well the last person did a report every month the you know the last person did this the last person did that so i'm just telling you like if you if you if nicole becomes chair and you decide we're going to meet once a year i guess you're not in the meetings you just have to do a quarter of the board report and say we haven't met so i obviously like the once a month meetings i would like them shorter than they have been but sometimes i didn't feel like that was completely in my control um like you know obviously you know we had the discussion the one meaning that like you know we're gonna get better at cutting people off but when it's just us we decide how long the meeting lasts if people are gonna talk i'm not going to cut you off you're part of the board but just know the meeting is going to go longer so um but yeah that's absolutely a fact you can do it however you want to do it and you set the agenda and you set the schedule you are currently chair i am currently chair and she would currently like to stay character i didn't say that if someone else really wants the job because like i said what i'm saying is would you like to stay or are you trying to get this position up um you know what if someone wants to try it i wouldn't mind like nominating them but like we obviously don't get to talk outside of this room so i don't know where the interest level lies um if you were nominated would you accept it it would depend on if someone else was interested in the position okay so um i guess we can start with does anyone want to nominate themselves for any of the positions that are open yeah i i would just like to say this is really hard for me to get here because of my work and i can't really take on any more work i get it so that's absolutely nobody else will do it i would take advice from your your right-hand man but not your position vice chair yep last year but only if there's absolutely everybody thrown in the towel and you are taking a chair okay what does that make yeah that makes sense okay if you want to do it i would vote you as vice chair and would you like to um okay okay i would like to nominate nora to be vice chair i do have a second second second elbows in favor maybe in case you're ever sick i would like to nominate nicole to be secretary i second that everybody in favor do you want to do it yeah okay i don't know well you don't have to write paragraphs anymore i mean is everybody okay with that yes we're good okay so um we're doing bullet points now we're not doing paragraphs so literally there's a template okay so um now i can call to order the meeting today um secretary will you do roll call please oh i have that for number one i know george but i usually call to order the meeting and we do real call and then i approve the agenda i've always done it in that order yeah you absolutely have to put on the new positions okay so um number one um order of agenda can i have approval on the agenda do i have emotion sure yeah okay so the agenda for today is approved and then item number two is the approval of minutes from the last meeting march 16th do i have a motion to approve the minutes from the last meeting ma'am second all those in favor approved so full approval on number one and two so um yes just put what we need all right i think i get a first question first okay and second georgia okay got it you're doing great secretary i love it and ask as many questions as you want it's yeah and you're learning and we'll it's totally fine um so agenda item number three citizen comments we don't have anybody in here so we're gonna pass on that one maybe that's a citizen comment you wanna answer it and see what this is okay so um agenda item number four the um ballard beach we love our city donation program um so i'm going to turn this over to nora because i know she was trying to reach out to the beller beach garden club to see if we can kind of piggyback on there not for profit a lot of ladies too um and it turns out they no longer have their uh 501c3 they got rid of it and that's why they donated the benches and other things is because they wanted to wipe their hands clean of it um did they say why did they give you feedback she kind of said that they were it had run its course they opened it up they raised a lot of money they said with it and then they ended up just not wanting to manage it any longer so every year you have to file it's paperwork it's time you know and she said they ended up donating these benches for that reason a couple of tables a dance floor here or something she mentioned because of the money they had in the fund yes and then they donated the rest of the botanical gardens they just wanted to end it and so they emptied it out so they no longer have it it doesn't exist so that led me down a rabbit hole trying to figure out how we could open up our own and i know that you kind of mentioned that they don't want this under the parks board and rec maine right we would have to create a new name but we could all be members we can all be members it has so i looked into florida and it looks like it's a 600 feet however you could do this easy 1023 for possibly 250 dollars it's time it's estimated to be about 20 hours worth of filing work so yeah the application process takes for you to enter into every other everything that they need about 20 hours since estimated so i'm willing to do this i would do this with an account though i just don't know if bellar beach wants to throw the funds there for it well it's two-sided so like lynn gave me the application and i don't remember it being i mean it was pretty he said you have to do the bylaws so maybe that's what takes so long is the bylaws of the non for profit but the application was probably six pages long and it didn't look that detailed uh i can put it in your mailbox if you want to take a look at it i'm gonna pull it down too so there's just two ways of going about it um and i'd rather speak to an accountant that really knows because it's kind of ever changing the laws on it but i think it's going to be either 600 or 250 if you can get the easy process the easy process with the one it's not easy i guess but that's what it said on the website but it's about 20 hours um yeah estimate total prep time it's going to be between those two things but we're definitely going to need either a lawyer an accountant or something can we use the city attorney for this i imagine so why not because i think it has to be not affiliated with the city i mean yeah okay but i can see it [Music] i don't understand it either because like when i was doing the initial research and i was looking online at other cities that do it it was literally listed through the city you know tax write-off like donations if you want to do all the things that we talked about doing um so i'm i'm not exactly clear on why we can't do it and lynn hasn't been in our meeting for a couple of months um so i don't know maybe it's something you can take back and ask him i mean i feel like we're kind of dragging this thing out and i didn't realize it was 20 hours of paperwork and that's what i just recently read because i was like you know what i'm just going to start this and see what it kind of looks like and then i just read that portion and i was like and maybe that's an exaggeration on one part i think if you're really gonna pry into like all these bylaws and things i think for five templates and i'd be able to keep a channel i don't think you're gonna get that kind of time you know i agree i highly doubt that's accurate it seems very uh i can see like a separate checking account and separate funds and it's a very clear cut and dry black and white there's no mixing things and it gets a little bit on how much you're estimated to gain is it for public use is there any gain from it so i don't know if like let's say you were doing bricks a memorial let's just say and you know just put in your name is that considered a game to me or is that really for public use is it just bench that's public use or is walking you know on a pathway considered for public some of those things you don't even need this non-profit tax code you can just do it on your own but i think maybe if i could just have like 10 or 15 minutes with going into the city's lawyer that they could just really quickly knock these questions out well like even if you just email him like you put your your like your questions on um where do i start what question just can we open up the non-profit like what would it take i mean it kind of one question leads to another question oh you want a conversation i think it would be a five-minute conversation versus about 15 emails going back and forth to each other it's not that i mind the writing it's just that i think if we could communicate it'd be like he could just quickly say what are you really trying to do and i can say we're not quite sure how big this is going to be how big our donations today are going to be but let's just start it low and estimate that we're going to be under 50 000 per year we're probably going to be in the small business i highly doubt it's going to go anywhere near those numbers but you know one of our risks of opening it up what yearly maintenance do i really have for this and is this something that your average joe can do do i need an accountant or is it a lawyer sufficient or is this i'm on my own so these would technically be my questions but i feel like that's a lot to digest and be written down to coherently did the garden club say when they dissolve theirs like was it five years ago or two years ago or i think these benches were here when i moved here four years ago years ago i don't ask so it's been a while she said it's been a while yeah well they gave us the benches maybe almost two years ago how many like about two years ago oh okay two years um with the planters they started with i think two benches and then they gave us another i mean they probably wanted to dissolve it because they were just not fundraising she said they weren't fundraising anymore the money was just sitting there and no one wanted to manage it so they kind of did i mean we're not looking to fundraise either we're looking to like do like you know example with kelly like she wanted to donate you know for like you know with her business as a donation from her business like the the dog poop like dispensers in the parks say you know three parks or whatever you know i'm just making stuff up but like and then her you know donated by and then i guess it's for public use the dog just like the benches are for public use so i think you're up loud too up to like 300 dollars for my quick google search without even having a non-profit tax code as long as it's for public use and for your city again things in account i have an accountant sort of the list that he put together for us there were some lower end things but there were some higher end things too like more than three hundred dollars so see i thought we were doing it for fundraising i thought it was for possibly building a gazebo or whatever it might be or artwork or whatever comes up you know yeah i thought it was going to be bigger but not huge just i guess it's the same thing i just wasn't looking at it as fundraising it would be more like if like say tim and i wanted to donate money for a gazebo but we didn't want to donate 50 000. we only wanted and i'm totally making this up we only wanted to donate half so like we would donate 25 000 and george would donate the other 25 000 and both of our names would go like maybe a brick on this side of the gazebo and a brick on this you know donated by the ortel family and the lavender family so like i guess i didn't look that at that as fundraising because like they donate the money they get the tax right off the gazebo is built and there's really no money left over it's just paying for the gazebo paying for specifically what you pick to donate so that's why i didn't look at it as like like fundraising we were just looking for a segway for it to be a tax write-off as opposed to you donating it and not getting like any you know like you would if you donated it to a different charity if that makes sense so i guess it's just the way you're looking for that the reason why we're doing this is for tax purposes so people have like a slight bit of incentive to donate like yeah it's nice to have your name on a brick but if you can get you know a tax write-off for that that would be you know it's just like benches can have little plaques on them yeah there's lots of things that you can do down the road i'm sure it's not going to just start pouring in and there's going to be monuments all over you know no no that's why this is so slow i have not been rushing this at all because it's just going to be like a drip like it's going to be of interest we're not going to solicit people it will be on the website if they find it or if they hear about it word of mouth or they hear about it at a council meeting or something like that but it's not going to be like this big fundraising thing where we're out knocking on doors trying to get people to donate uh you know a gazebo to the city because we need one and then they get a text right off in a plaque like it's not a soliciting thing at least in my mind it wasn't but it's going to take money to open this up and i think it should be tied to the parks and rec or something like that we can't die it's just not allowed once tell us what but it's just not done that way i've never seen it okay so i don't know if you saw cities you know appeared that way if you could provide them with any second people research you need people that are motivated to do it and want to do it it's not worth the money to if it's like 600 and you have to file and pay fees because that's the other thing if you have to pay fees to file the paperwork every year and we're not raising money then we don't have any money to pay for the and it's not a big deal that's 20 bucks yearly but you would have to file the paperwork yearly i just don't know if that's if there's a fee like an llc if you file it every year you have to pay the fees every year so i didn't know if there were fees involved yearly or just it was in a setup so yeah and linus said more than once and so is kyle for whatever reason it can't be we can all be on it it has to have a separate name and it has to be non-affiliated with the city okay but we can't use our budget today correct i'm assuming no after the last council meeting i'm definitely [Music] but after last meeting wouldn't it be a guest to use these funds for bringing in money from elsewhere and not using those funds for things like this kind of look at it that way it's true maybe that would be a maybe okay let me see if i can constantly figure out how this is what it really would fall down to i don't mind paperwork i don't um i'll make some phone calls does anybody else have any comments or input or suggestions i just don't want this to be a bunch of work for us and it doesn't end up going anywhere like if it's only in theory a very nice idea and then it doesn't like materialize into anything i think it's a good opportunity to have i think if it's really 250 600 and there's an opportunity there and it's not like year it's that i mean that's not the yearly that's a one time you know somewhere down the road someone might very easily a lot of websites said stop turning around there's probably already a non-profit that's already doing what you're doing and you save yourself the time and just don't you know through them but i i still think it's a good idea to explore but it would definitely i think the city would have to work over the fees at minimum you know yeah absolutely okay so you know i plan on presenting again even though it's not the quarterly board report at the next council meeting so i will definitely bring this up and get the thoughts i mean that's like the perfect time if you want to get questions answered that would be approved right there yeah is during yeah i mean i'm just saying especially if you're asking if your budget can pay for this so we could say this is what we've been researching and this is what we're interested in doing we're wondering if we could get some feedback from the council or the city attorney and um yeah it was definitely something i wanted to talk about because again like i don't want to put a ton of work into it like i would never have you fill out all the paperwork and even start the process until we present it to council yeah because that's too much work to have them go now what [Music] but some of the stuff we don't have budgeted and it's and then that's how it's kind of like a fundraiser so like if someone in the city wants to donate and then that same money can be used for something else that the city would need say like a sign out front or some way to communicate to our residents then they can use the money for that there's always people that want to also uh promote themselves real estate agents things of this sort so dog counseling yeah i'm constantly walking outside and i would certainly breathe every black you know that there was and so that's kind of it's advertising and george honestly i got the idea because at the end of the year i was like oh i was looking at our text donations for the year and i'm like okay i'm not even to what i was last year so i wrote a 2 000 check to the florida english bulldog rescue like i could have very easily done the same thing if bellaire beach had a program i could have donated two thousand dollars to something on the list that he put together and it would have been the same difference to me that's what they'll ask yes no it's a very good point we feel strong and we want to do this it was great for our community but i totally get it i understand do you have like do you have wording in mind that you would want us to use when we present it's a very good point um and i think like what between what nora said and just the fact that like you know it gives residents an opportunity to either um advertise their business or as a memorial to you know their parents who lived here for 40 years and or you know so we could have just two or three examples of situations where someone might want to donate just pulls in money i think that's a good idea so examples okay so what i'll do is i will put together a couple of like i'll like i'll put together like a cheat sheet like i was going to present it to the city and i'll do some bullet points and then i'll have patty email it out to all of you and if you have any suggestions or feedback just send it back to her and she'll send it to me because you know that's the only way we can communicate without meeting nine times unfortunately so um it's not like i can go to nora's house and sit there and talk and put it together it's i'll just do it that way and then all of you can give me your feedback and then we'll put together something brief and detailed enough where it would answer like their questions if it didn't cost any money it's like no harm no foul but because it costs money they absolutely need to know why we would want to do it i think we should find out exactly what it's going to cost let me let me try to talk to somebody and find out and then we can at least give them because i mean not that it's a lot of money but it's a range i think also um looking into other another non-profit that we could work with such like i'm not sure but backing up to donating um there's a realtor that was in my networking group that if you're driving down west bay you'll see this section of the garden was donated by darlene sheets if we figure out how darlene donated and bought that you know she had a little plaque there you know maybe it's right down the street so why can't we look into whatever that non-profit is i don't know i see what you're saying i'm just wondering i just want i i wonder if i did some research and asked darlene how did she get her plaque and then work backwards maybe i can give you a couple of answers because i've never done donated before i don't know who i wonder if the city of belleville has and i ordered the team but i'm guessing they don't want it um they do a lot of events they do a ton a lot of like chili cocoas i don't know they have a car show this weekend they're like what four times bigger than us though yeah yeah so they're funds and they have commercial businesses it's a little bit different but they do they should have a template that we should be able to dumb down like to not dumb down as in but like size wise but perhaps they would be interested in sharing right some kind of benefit working their way well you know okay so they have their meetings here and i would say three or four months ago lynn said oh so-and-so and bel-air does this i'll call and ask him questions and it never so i don't know if the guy didn't call her back do you remember yeah okay and it never materialized into anything that i heard he just gave me the application because i mean cities do have sponsorship programs but they're not the same thing they're completely managed by the city and i don't think right off their confirmations usually businesses live in the city that want to promote their name they make a sponsorship program that's not quite the same because you're not achieving your goal of a good tax right now right oh yeah but like the guy that was talking about they have an organization over there entire bellaire that raises a lot of money so yeah i guess i'll follow up with them and find out okay i appreciate that because that's a good contact too as far as how things are done so you want to contact the garden club to find that out so and you did talk to their garden club i spoke with their heart who gave me our garden club information i spoke to linda there and over there yeah took care of 14 dogs oh boy sorry continuously that's crazy all right well then we're just gonna um keep working on it so if i find out any information i can't contact you directly i have to go through padding you need to go okay yeah okay so um item number five so the activity calendar like you know the items that we have on there are kind of plugging along some are doing better than others like i honestly feel like the walks and stuff like that unless you get on the phone and call people and rally a group it just doesn't happen so you know that is what it is it's like if people show up great if they don't they don't um i think the the paddleboard yoga is going pretty well she switched your classes around a little bit for april and may like to adjust to what happened in the earlier months but she said they're going well the lessons are only once a month the yoga on the beach as far as i know is going well the tuesday thursday saturday um so nicole because it was kind of the only way we had to advertise this unless someone went on the bellar beach city website was kind of going on the bellerin beach facebook residence page and she probably posted three or four times hey there's a yoga class or the painting class or whatever it was and then so she posted the april calendar and it was taken down by an administrator within an hour or something like that so now we really have no way to advertise that i know of and i have no idea why we were taken off of that because we weren't taken down the previous four times so if there was something that was like you know how like an extra neighbor you're not allowed to advertise your own restaurant you're not allowed to advertise your own business but someone can give you a good like hey this restaurant's great or hey this is the best dog babysitter i've ever had in my life you know so someone can give you a referral on nextdoor but you're not allowed to say hey this is my business this is what i do this is what i charge so like my thought was it might be a legality thing but they didn't knock us off the first four times but they definitely knocked us off this last time and we don't know why so like we're trying to figure that out like so nicole has an answer yeah so i like reached out so she told me that like post again she's like i will take it down like so sorry and like oh good um that's great this is the beginning of the month like the first week of the month and then she'll just like put up a reminder like hey don't forget to like check this website whatever like just for people to actually see it um so yeah i kind of like so she just because it didn't say city of bellar beach activity schedule yeah like it didn't say like oh you know this is like something that like the city it looks like an individual yeah like trying to make money think about the power thing yeah me less than 30 years old i had no idea what that entailed so it was like oh it has like more information people can like like get more info about it instead of like asking me and then i thought maybe that flag so i was like okay i'll just post the schedule and keep it like clean just be like please check the website for additional details yeah so yeah because when she was posting before like on the little calendar that i had made and it you know she was getting people dinging her back like left and right with questions which i don't want her to have to feel especially when the answer is right there on the bottom and they're just not reading it like you know she's working like i it shouldn't be like you know the q a all day hey what time what do i need to bring do i need money where it says flat out it's ten dollars a class or whatever it is so she was worse she she was trying to do more details it just needed a little tweaking yeah so i'll just perfectly get like i'll repost and so like it'll be like beginning of the month and then like chosen that are like reminder and then for anything that's like probably like a bigger event then i'll you know let them know prior to posting but they don't take it down like double the work like just hey i'm going to post this like be prepared because like people are seeing it like i can see like how many people actually see it even if they just skip by it like it's there like there's something that will like catch their attention so oh good that's great news continue like like i'll write it down like i'll continue like that's fine okay by the way that painting sunset when's that rescheduled too you know i texted him and he never got back to me still up in the air it's still kind of up in the air i didn't pay for it so i'm i'm i'm looking forward to it okay yeah yeah and he did say one person did and i think what the problem is i literally have to say if the class is on the 10th you have to sign up and pay by the first because a lot of people were waiting till the day of but if he doesn't have 12 people he's cancelling it so 12 people unless they sign up at 8 in the morning it's going to get cancelled so that was kind of a lesson learned on logistics yeah i think and the information is there they can see it but if not you know it's just one of those things that know the information if they want to call us and then we'll just call them yeah got you i think between because yeah you're feeling all phone calls about this is yeah i just like them like this and they weren't really calling you they were just like messaging back messaging yes and then like they'll ask and then and then so then if the if the document or whatever the schedule changes you don't have to worry about changing the name yeah yeah so you're not changing it in two different places or you know yeah i pretty much sent her exactly what i sent patty so like if they looked at either place they were looking at the same the same document i was hoping that would kind of like yeah but i'm saying like if you give it the padding and put it on our website then you don't have to take that same document and upload it somewhere else just give the link back to those things yeah so you change one thing it changes yeah yeah like it just highlighted basically like hey on tuesdays this is what's happening so it's like more clear um but it lasted like 10 minutes so i i didn't get any traction i don't know like if people liked it they seen i don't know so i don't really post and then just make sure that it's like once a month like being in a month do a follow-up like in the middle and then if there's any special events or anything just like post those individually like think like the painting and like you can add the blood drive for me yeah like that yeah um and the painting may 14th is the blood drive and then i think too um like the link to the stand up paddle board was on there so they could go on which is great because if you sign up and then like this past sunday was the weather was hoarded you know then she'll you should know it's canceled but she will literally like have your information respond back to you and say hey there's no class today hopefully i'll see you next sunday or tuesday or whatever so okay perfect so at least we have that unhappy that's that works out great um so i wanted to ask you guys as far as like surveying the parks like i feel like we did that like more than three months ago remember we how we each took two or three parks and we looked for good bad ugly like suggestions or december yeah so i'm kind of thinking it's time we do it again like you know i don't know if every quarter is too much every six months what are you guys thinking on time frame like i don't think once a year is enough what kyle what are your thoughts on this i see your facial expressions i don't know what you if you're surveying the same things and we took care of a lot after the last survey just from maintenance that way i don't know what would change in three months just in case anything's come up or if there's anything like a broken bench or do you think like the maintenance people picked that so they should be picking it up yeah okay so you don't think we need to do it again i think it quarterly is a little bit much but i mean because we're going out there and when we maintain the parks we're supposed to be looking at noticing things that are broken you know it'd be more um you know like what improvements could be made like one thing we still have to do is we gotta do something to the floor in the oregon park bathrooms um and that's just a matter of time yeah uh but i mean it's really it's your it's your call you know no no i mean i want that's why i wanted to bring it up for discussion i don't want to do it too often and i don't want to be like neglectful like it's like a hey we're not you know because but any time if you see something that you think needs a and i think we are not driving across the ranch and going up to the northern part so for me it was a quick you know 15 20 minutes of my life so i have no problem going again yeah whatever time you want to it was i'm at the 6th street park in the 12th street park three times a week and what do you want to know those are going to be mine yeah and it doesn't have to be official if you want just let me know it's good to know that we can shoot him an email i think that's great i think that's a great thing like you know let's try i guess to broaden our neighborhood horizons and if we see anything like island all right okay so i think we should do it again for sure okay how about like twice a year like every six months so that would be i'll check the exact date but like let's just say we'll dig them up next month and then do the presentations the following month and then start the six months after that does everybody go with that and if you know if you only want to do one or if you don't want to do it like like a lot of us are in the parks like i've been going with my son like all the way down gulf like to morgan park and back so we're hitting kind of the ones up there i don't come over here a lot so like you know it to me it forced me out of my my parks that i go to all the time like having that little assignment so it was good for me even if the park needed nothing and i just came back and said hey this one looks great i kind of liked it too huh i kind of liked it too yeah no i liked it and um yeah it forced me out of my comfort zone and it like i guess you know um did i have you on the email that said somebody because i know like it's bella beaches but we don't really do anything with it i call it cylinder part because it always smells like wheat but they burned the um they burned the picnic table oh yeah didn't i send you that yeah someone bought a new picnic table and they put it out there already yeah so i'm assuming someone bought a new picnic table that goes there every weekend put it on their boat and took it out there because i saw someone sitting on it when we went by it last on saturday where you know like behind like if you're sitting on my back porch and you're staring at that island oh i noticed that there was a picnic bench but they set it on fire everyone set it on fire so party island i call it stoner island do you call it party island yeah i've been there once it's a city's island but we have no way it's ours yeah that's not indian rocks beaches it's right behind my house i'll go check out that park we're talking about the park the one where people go back drinking and boating on every weekend closer to harbor drive i see what you're saying those houses that kind of stick out but like where it's literally right behind yeah yeah that's sweet that someone bought a new one was there yeah it was very nice i thought so they could put their name on it and get a taxi [Laughter] because it's so close to my sister's house that i'm speaking to uh one of her neighbors i go behind party island i'm like is it always and she goes we can hear them all the jet skiers pull up there i mean there's and smaller you can hear them and smell them i just assumed it was in a rock speech and i'm still"
