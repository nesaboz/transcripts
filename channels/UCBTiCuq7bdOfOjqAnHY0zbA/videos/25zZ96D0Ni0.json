    "transcript": "or six o'clock um august 27 2020 um normally i would ask patty to take the role i'll take it no problem thank you uh charlotte d malay she's not here yet online captain zabel is not going to be here tonight uh kathleen klazer i know you're here unmute yourself here sorry robbery spurge here tony gatliff here dave gaddis here and leslie you're here okay okay thank you um first thing is the approval of the august 13th meeting minutes any motions to change motions for approval look good to me i'll make a motion to prove it a second up charlotte's there discussion okay all in favor of approving hi hi hi anybody opposed okay so we move on um this being our last committee meeting before we present our report to the um to the city council i want to thank everybody for all the all the stuff you've done i love the the report that um rob i think you wrote yes it looks really good is everyone has everyone had a chance to go through all of the stuff we've gotten in various pieces of email any any questions or comments on the bellar beach communications ad hoc committee report to the city council suggested changes i had uh questions uh did everyone get a chance to read the little blurb about lowering your expectations on on metrics is this the one that said a realistic approach to communication metrics was that what it said at the time okay yes that sound reasonable i i and i think it did i mean i'm just looking dave was that the um the document you sent yeah it was uh it was a word document and uh it wasn't it wasn't all the different services i know that was a big a big cluster a mess but um basically this document called a realistic approach to communication metrics in bel air beach uh and above it and uh it starts with item c on the deliverables yeah that's what i used to pull into the report did i capture it all properly or did i leave something out um okay so am i looking at the latest what i'm looking at is what uh what's attached and it showed where uh it was to be written by me uh but i haven't seen it where it was compiled this was this was item four in the basic in the report right dave yes okay yeah lynn said i what i did was um when i got all of the all of your stuff i pulled it into the appropriate spots into the report and then lynn sent that out yesterday yeah so you should have gotten a copy an updated copy version two of it i think was dated the 25th when i did it where i took all the all that you had provided and pulled it into the thing so it was hoping that i i did that correctly and also what lin sent out yesterday uh i took the report and created some summary slides that if we want to use those to present to the council you know what i say it now for some reason that thing was in my junk folder but now i've got it i'm taking it personal well it came from lynn so i don't take it first i mean i thought that this um realistic approach to communication metrics that they put through what should go into item number four on the report to the city council that was how i interpreted that is that where you intended that to go david uh yes and that's that's where i put it i put it there in paragraph four oh yeah i'm i'm looking at it now yeah first on stage five yeah i'd try to change it but i'd screw up my entire system and i'd be out of this meeting but and then as i dave as i pulled that in i just um and you'll see them in red if you look at that document i had a a couple of recommended modifications nothing big just kind of happy to glad all right think you um with whatever modifications we're going to put into the the metrics to determine how successful we were that goes in there and then this report that goes to the city council looks wonderful the only the issue that seems to be open now is the postcard unquote whether it's a postcard whether it's a letter that we send out that we fold in three you know and send it out it's looking more like it's bigger than a postcard and how we re refer to residents property owners community so what i did is i took um there were a few different ideas on how to do it okay and um so instead of trying to merge them into one i went ahead and tried to um set up each one the way that they thought that it should it should read and my thought is um why not present all the options to this to the council let the council decide um you know what what they wanted to look like you know because there are a couple of different ideas it all boils down to roughly the same the same thing just some different thoughts on on either how to refer to the community or or residents or owners or and just defining um what we're trying to do a little bit better for them and um hopefully hopefully i i was successful is this something you sent out in a revised yeah postcard sent it out um yeah i sent it into in the into patty and lynn got it and um i believe that lynn then attached it to that email that was went out did he tap to the email yesterday i'm looking was that the one where we got four different versions of the same thing yes i'm sorry no that is that is uh correct and uh and and i'm not sure if the pdfs if they when they were sent out to you but i named them like rob you know or kathleen or charlotte you know um so we could identify um you know um whose version for lack of a better word it would it would be but yeah so rather i think it'd be difficult for us to try to you know if we try to compile all those into one that that what used to be a postcard turn it into a letter will turn into a two-page document so i think more than likely the council is just going to look at all the examples and go yes i like this idea and then hand it right back to lynn that would be my guess does that sound about right lynn yeah i have all the different versions in publisher lin so i can forward that to you if that helps whoever you know works with your stuff because i'm sure it needs to be refined because i'm not the pub publisher expert the good news is is no matter which one they pick they all uh achieve the same goal i think so yeah i'm looking at the um the draft report to the communications committee it's on page 338 send a letter postcard to every resident slash property owner because some people don't not everybody lives here yeah and not everybody that's a resident is an owner so yeah i think we kind of covered that uh before that we need to um notify everybody and who is that young man that's kyle he he's our community services director and and he's he's in charge of this meeting not me she's got a new wig on okay so maybe we present um several options of the the various postcard letter formats to the city council and go yeah you pick one right the only thing that we do need to add to that we need to add a notation that any any information that's given on this form is subject to public records because that that is important for them you know to know that if they're giving us this information then it becomes a public record and anyone can get it okay okay there is there is room for a line or two without moving too many things around right yeah yeah and i'm reading this um 3a and the in the report going possible formats and examples for this letter are at attachment three and so we've got you know several different versions of you know how they wanted to find residents property owners whatever so we can throw several of all well several or all of the examples that we've put forth along with as lynn just mentioned the disclaimer i guess saying his public records um yeah and i can yeah and i can add that uh to the bottom without it affecting the body of the rest of them uh the rest of the thing and i'll get that to land okay sounds good hey lynn when you get a chance so if you can email the exact verbiage you want on there i will i will like i said we have several different versions of you know how we're going to refer to people so we can send give those all to city council and saying yeah how you want community residents property owners whatever you want to call them okay what else were there any other changes to the um base report that you wanted me to make i got the two leslie you just said in paragraph 3a resident slash property owner yeah and then the last sentence uh potential formats and examples are at attachment three yes yep um and we'll have to change all those potential formats examples to include the disclaimer the public records thing right and just just in 3b the comment about the uh elections office our our really doesn't pertain to this it's the because the property owners are there and then we've got the base mailing addresses so somehow we're going to have to separate out the ones that don't live here out of the tax collector but the supervisor election stuff really has nothing to do with it can you modify that as to who we get the information from yeah it's the it's the uh pinellas county property appraiser that's who it comes from so not the tax collector or the supervisor of elections right okay i thought there were two sources that we discussed about and merging them that's why i thought well it's part of the part of the thing the the supervisor elections they would have to be a resident well for us we don't know uh if we're going to mail to the residences which we will do and then we're going to have to separate the people that don't live here with you know out if if the address in the tax appraiser is not belair beach then we'll have to send a separate mailing to them and some of those homes may end up getting two because if we mail it just as a generic to the residents which we would do to every address and we've got that list already set up then there's a possibility they could end up with two of them because uh they're also they have a mailing address that's somewhere else for their taxes right but they live in the house they might live in the house you know and uh yeah the tax bill goes elsewhere yeah so those people will get a duplicate but we've got all the addresses for the city so uh we'll send to that and another little bit of an issue is uh the condos because a good majority of them are rental properties and you know they don't live there they live somewhere else so that person if they live somewhere else you're talking the owner yeah okay but but if there's somebody in the condo that lives there full time and is a resident as opposed to somebody who's just running it for the winter you know what i mean yeah yeah see see as an example i'm going to use a condo that i know is pretty much short-term you know weekly rentals all the time uh 2800 gulf boulevard it's got like seven units in it well the owners aren't in any of them they're all rental properties and you know we know that for a fact but those people that you know if they even get mail there i don't know but it'll uh we'll we'll have to work that out with the people that actually own it to live somewhere else they might live in tampa they might so then when we get that uh their address from the appraisers yes the appraiser will show that right the legal description the uh uh address of the property as well as the mailing address for the tax bill right right but somebody's staying in that unit may not even be a resident you know correct yeah they're like a short term that would be what would be the downside of besides just the extra cost of sending no no i'm not saying i'm just trying to explain that uh we're probably not we're probably not going to get a response from a person that right rents for a week a couple days okay the bad i would say the bad news is that we do get a response if they're there for a week and they get the mail and it says resident and they go shoot i'm filling this thing out i have no stake in this you know what i mean well i i don't think that's an issue because we will go back with a duplication that's the benefit of getting getting these that information about where they live uh because then that will tell us and if we get two for the same address then we can go to the property appraiser and say this is from the owner this is from some guy that rented it that's right here for a couple days so we will work that out whether they're there for two weeks or a month or a year even those that are there that have an annual lease it's no different right all right i think you did a great great job here rob yeah i do and dave all that stuff i mean this is uh you guys spent some time on it and tony now that i know you're a publisher guy we'll be bringing it yeah what what are you published honey i i publish postcards um so dave have you had a chance to look at uh paragraph four did i accurately capture what you wanted in there i'm sorry i'm gonna have to kill my video i don't know what's going on here my bandwidth is terrible today um was that question for me yes i was wondering if you had deliverables i just scanned through it and it looks good and uh yeah thanks for correcting my uh grammatic failures believe me when uh when mr gates put spell check and grammar check into microsoft word he saved me all kinds of party anything else on the base report that we want to change no i think it looks great we just need to merge a couple things in there okay okay i saw that you you left a placeholder for the system uh for whenever we go back and uh and then we start having the meetings uh in city hall and um and so far and um what i've found is that there's no perfect system that's within our price range uh also uh that system no matter what requires two people to operate it you have to have the meeting moderator uh which is uh what what uh kyle is doing for us today and then you have the camera operator even with uh with a an affordable camera system like uh what i purchased or not well i actually did purchase the system for uh for uh where i work at uh we discovered that as lynn said it only has a limited range that it can it can capture however the microphone is incredible on the system so if we just wanted to show the entire the entire front of the room and rely on the microphones it's still a win uh and you would you would capture you wouldn't have close-ups like what we have now but you would capture the entire meeting room uh and and everyone that's speaking uh and as far as the the audio i think the audio of that logitech system is probably the the most superior audio capture i've ever seen it allows you to stack up to seven microphones so even though everyone would not have a dedicated microphone you you daisy chain them and and the end one would probably be at the guest podium so that no matter what you're always picking up everyone that's speaking uh either at the podium or on the uh in the council seating also that same microphone array can be moved around you're just limited to the length of cable and uh so we've got a giant horseshoe in our meeting room of tables and it probably equals about maybe 45 feet of coverage uh if you line up everybody end to end and we've tested it in a few of these meetings and it works perfectly it's just that you can't get the camera to to capture everybody simultaneously so you know it does a decent job but uh the the work around for that would be possibly to have a second camera but that uh that also makes things a little more difficult so if you want to go fully automated i still recommend the logitech system and then that would only require the mod one person to moderate the meeting for call-in um citizen comments so do we want to leave then that recommendation in the report on paragraph 3i where it talks about purchasing this some kind of updated system yeah if you want to take that section completely out we've had this conversation uh with the council uh several times and they have all the literature on that system uh i think i think basically what they need is they need a uh a trial run to see how it actually works and uh and and then they could determine that that's about a six thousand dollar system it just goes up from there so um you know if if you want what if we want to make it to where we can have the regular council venue but everyone is heard and seen up close you either have to uh you probably are going to have to have somebody to actually operate the camera if you want up close shots of people as a group it'll be fun so i'm sure that after the presentation we'll have the conversation about do we actually want to go forward with with you know a nice video system i was just looking at the um the draft report on page four we end up with f g h and then we go back to g h i at the bottom of page four it goes back to g and then we do h i again you see what i'm looking at on page four of the communications attack committee report to city council we have to publicize and encourage the city's residents to sign up and get alert pinellas then hold town hall meetings that's g and that's h and g is draft yep i see you see what i'm saying yep easy fix so i j k right but we want now based on what dave said do we want to delete paragraph k what would become paragraph k about purchasing the updated audio visual system it sounds like that's what i would think so and you would also take out attachment six entirely right how about consider and update naughty i don't know we would love to have it we just i i just haven't found one that's that's in the belair beach uh price range because we're such a small town and we have such a limited budget take out the purchase and updated audio visual system totally i think it's something that will come up anyway uh if if we included in this report uh i i just don't have the system that that i would that i would stand behind at this time how about consider an updated audio visual system that would be fine i would still take out attachment six entirely okay so that was the information about potential audio visual systems is in attachment five well it should be six but i agree with dave if you say consider like you said purchasing we just scratched that whole piece about there's information in the attachment especially since the council already has it okay okay got it anything else comments kathleen you're very quiet that's a good thing charlotte oh it came together really well yeah well okay i think you know well um did you get a chance to see how when i i pulled that the information about the uh constant contact and click send and a couple other things tips for facebook how i pulled that into the attachments that come out okay it looked great basically that information was taken right from web pages yeah and uh and they'll they'll get the point okay okay and then um if we're good with all that did anybody get a chance to look i don't even know if when you present this to the council you want to have a few slides to show them up on the screens dave you can kind of tell us does that work or not i've been there when in the chamber when they've had some presentations like that and it seemed to make it a little bit better um well as far as the uh external systems a lot of that has already been discussed because of the updates that we've given them periodically leslie would give an update and then we would discuss it in a work session so most of those external systems they're they're uh i would say that they're aware of probably wouldn't be a bad idea just to give the same slides that the presenter is going to use so that uh they can follow along i would think particularly the recommended communication strategy spreadsheet i mean that's a that's a perfect slide yeah i mean bear in mind it's going to be another virtual meeting yeah oh that's right okay so there's there's nothing to put on a tv you're right okay so forget that you're using zoom for that right yes yes that's actually i think pushing pushing those slides you can do that on zoom can't you yes yeah makes it actually easier to see uh than it would in the council chamber okay i mean they'll they'll have this very large packet in their um council agenda packet um what what they're going to care about is the overview that's that's that's probably all they're going to want to hear and discuss and then they'll take this package they'll take this pack and digest it later so yeah okay so i think if you created something with with just some bullet points from the the report just did that and then tell them you know they can read further into it i i think that would simplify it yeah that's what i tried to do with that that slide thing that you sent out to everybody yesterday this is the one that uh is the report uh let's see it's got it's called the um chac report presentation yeah it's just a it's a hamming if you take out the intro slide and the one that says questions at the end it's it's just a handful of slides to kind of summarize the report that's what i was looking at that's what i believe that they all they need okay i will take a look at that um i go out to everyone you not get a charlotte either did i no i i got all the other updates with the updates and the letters and stuff but i don't have a presentation from yesterday it's the sixth attachment cach report presentation oh yeah scroll down i've got it yeah okay we'll put that together and um get this to um lynn to patty everybody for a final blessing and with the changes and we will the council meeting on the seventh eighth night whatever it is ninth okay i guess this is going to be virtually right yes yes it will be virtual so here's my recommendations um uh rob's gonna make the changes uh it's it doesn't look like it's a whole lot by the way great job rob this is awesome um i i'm thinking that unless there's just something uh terrible uh that comes out in the final version we should just be able to read it and and accept that this is what it is if anyone finds anything that they wholeheartedly disagree with and they feel like it's a showstopper well then they need to contact flynn and schedule one more meeting and at this time i don't see a need to do that i believe that what we have is is pretty much complete but what's everyone else's thoughts on this i i totally agree yep i do too i agree and i'm holding um next thursday at six o'clock open just in case somebody does see something that we we need to get back together other than a typo or something that's good okay okay so well i i hope you don't have to do that because the packet stuff has to be in by wednesday so so is patty coming back monday monday okay i'm trying to think this is not yet labor day it's a week away yeah okay so we got everything to paddy uh put it all together send it out to have for everybody's blessing you know other than a typo or something and we'll go with it does that work yep yep i'll make these fixes uh this evening and send them to lynn and patty for distribution yeah and we'll se i'll send it out tomorrow if i get it from rob okay thank you lynn if you can send me that verbiage yes i'll do that too tonight then i can knock it out tonight also okay yeah and then all you'll have to do is attach the um those multiple examples of the letter right to attachment three i'll just leave attachment three right here see it that yeah and change it to attached our possible examples as opposed to here's what we're sending yep yeah okay anything else good we agree upon a uh we agree upon the date uh if if we have to meet should we go ahead and pick a date now we're we're saying we're not going to but in the event that we do we've already decided on the potential date someone said they can't do thursday next wednesday does that work please sit ahead wednesday do we need to make a tuesday yeah tuesday okay
