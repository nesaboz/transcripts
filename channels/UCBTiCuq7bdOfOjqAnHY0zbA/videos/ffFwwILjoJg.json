    "transcript": "my apologies for being late patty was kind enough to print out the handout for me and the the purpose of this is to um cover some of the things that are relevant to city council members serving in the primary things for the public records law and the sunshine law i when i've done this before i have always started with what to me is the most fundamental thing i know you're an attorney so a lot of this is remedial stuff for you but um the to me the fundamental things that you need to be aware of as a city charter provisions and the city charter provisions are akin to the city's constitution and the constitution is the foundational document this for the the us government is the city charter is a fundamental foundational document for this city's government and i always want to to make it clear that the charter sets forth just like the constitution the separation of powers and the separation of powers and city government you want another chair likes that one keeps going down lynn likes that one but here yeah you take that one out here just move this from here yeah i can't see [Applause] not much better the separation of powers and city government is that the their this is the manager uh commission style government and there's not a strong mayor i'll say that very clearly in some cities in florida there is a strong mayor former government this is this one is not that the power legislative power resides in the the city council and that's made up of seven people and as you know you're three of the seven and the um city each each of the city council members has equal authority the only difference is the mayor has or the vice mayor of the vice mayor's conducting the meeting has um each of them have the authority to conduct the meeting but their votes the same as anyone else's have they always been the chair of the meeting the mayor yes the mayor is elected by the citizens in some cities i i'm the city attorney for haines city under their system that the city commissioners select the mayor yeah that's what i was wondering here because it wasn't i know you can under robert school you can always remove the chair but it's only for one meet well um come to that in a minute about robert's rules because that's that's very relevant here in bel air beach but the um the council makes the it's like a board of directors makes the big decisions and then delegates to the city manager to do the day-to-day administration and implement the big decisions the city manager has authority over certain things and the one of the best examples is the employees and the city manager makes decisions concerning the employees the the city council members do not get to to delegate to the city manager what to do about an employee that's that's the province of the city manager and the just like in the constitution there are tensions between the branches of government and the tensions are by design and the tensions at times result in conflict and that's that's simply the you know the federal constitution state constitution and here the conflicts are going to be present and it's part of the checks and balances and the checks and balances are always uh appropriate in in u.s government so there there will be times where the council conflicts with the city manager and the city manager conflicts with them but it you know hopefully most of the time that will be peacefully resolved but it's i say that because it sometimes people go into the doing the the legislative job with the council job and wonder why there's so much conflict well there simply is and a lot of it's by design and it a lot of times could go smoother than it actually does but you know that's what you're you have to do i always refer to roles and i'll now go to you know there's three three officers that the charter creates one is the city manager second city clerk and the third is city attorney and each of those roles just like the council's roles as by definitions in the charter and the charter provisions specific things that you have each of those roles has the authority to do and what should happen and i will say having worked with lynn and patty for the last year and a half what should happen is that the the city manager the city clerk and the city attorney respect the boundaries of their role and they do what is within the the parameters of their role i will tell you in my opinion uh city manager city clerk and i have done that and you know there's times that it's tempting to go outside your role but you shouldn't because you you're supposed to do a certain job there's a tendency at times and this is not unique to bel air beach this happens in the city city happens periodically is that the city council members want to go outside their role as the city over there it's commissioned the city commissioners want to you know delegate to the city manager they should do a b or c and that they're not supposed to be doing that so i i'm a big person on doing your role because to me that is exceptionally important and one of the things that i'm i will be willing to do just so that to new people know i'm i'm willing to say no that's not my role although i will give you some feedback concerning whatever issue it is but i i don't want to undercut the city clerk i don't want to undercut the city manager i want them to operate within their role and them their their fulfill their responsibility and i respect that and i would say most of the time the everybody here at times it's it's chaotic but like anywhere else but people generally comply with their role so there have been times when people have gone outside their role and i would say that's where we have the real conflict that's just me telling you honestly i want to tell you something about me because i don't know either of you that well [Music] rita's heard it all before when when i interviewed for the job but i'll tell you a few things about me that i think are relevant in some sense and will help you understand me just a little better i've been an attorney in florida for almost 35 years i'm licensed here dc california i'm also an english solicitor which is transactional lawyer in england not that this part i always have trouble talking about because we don't do very well in sports but i went to purdue for college cumberland for law school and masters from london school of economics in england i have been the city attorney here for a year and a half city attorney for haines city for nine years i was the code enforcement attorney in haines city for a long time ago for 12 years i was the assistant city attorney in haines city for i think four or five years so i've had a lot of background in city government a lot of my other clients are typically people that have something going on in the united kingdom and i at times that is a lot more of my work than others it just depends on how trade is going with the uk so anyways i um have done this a long time having done it a long time i you know you'll certainly have a lot of experiences with it and my objective going into the meetings with the city commission or city council is to have them make sound decisions that's that's what i go into every meeting trying to do and my job is not to make the sound decision that joel's job my job is to help the work with the staff to present things to you not in the way that i think you should do it in the way to so that you have all the cards on the table and you can make the most sound decision and that's the stuff within your role to do and i i try to well i do respect that um i want things to be done ethically i want things to be done in accordance with the law and the i will tell you just again so you understand where i'm coming from the the default thing for me is to start with what is the legal standard because most the time people don't start with that people start with the other end of the equation they start with what do i want the result to be that is not my approach at all i start with identifying the legal standard and that is the starting point and then you know i mean you're again i'll lessly refer to you plenty of times you're an attorney you you know where you have to start and you know that it you even if you start with the statute or the city code provision there may be an administrative ruling there may be a case that's relevant there may be a federal law or state law that supersedes what you're doing and all of a sudden what should be a relatively um simple issue you have to look at a whole bunch of different things um one of the things i frequently do is in in florida there's there's a government at times doesn't have uh good websites but one of the websites that i use all the time and it actually is really good is the florida attorney general's site because i frequently look up things there and if i it's something i don't know that much about i start there because you oftentimes get references to all the resources you need to address a certain issue i'm starting with the legal standards and very important starting place in addition to that there's a lot of things that relate to ethical issues and those there's resources available to address them and to me that's in city government that that ends up being actually a very prominent part of the the decision-making process because there's you know florida like anywhere else has a certain code of ethics that elected officials are obligated to follow and it's in the one citation is 112.313 i would encourage you to read that whole section 112.3 and that is um contains a lot of the ethical standards and that whole chapter 112 has has quite a few um i'll make a quick comment although i'll probably say something more about it later with with ethical issues there's a lot of ways that you can approach it and i will tell you the way that i approach it the there are times where there are vexing ethical questions and what i've encountered with people in in government both here and and elsewhere is they want to split hairs and i'm not one for splitting hairs there's a concept in federal tax law called this the safe harbor and in the safe harbor you you know if you are in that harbor there's not much chance that you're going to get into trouble i tend to gravitate towards if there's a safe harbor figure out what it is and then stay there and be there okay i have related that concept to an elected official and they said that's great but a safe harbor means you're not out on the open water and you're not out taking risk and i said that's fine yeah i agree with you the ship is not out at sea and that means you you can't see some exotic places but if going to exotic places uh results in you wrecking on a reef somewhere then when when you're wrecked on the reef you'll be wishing that you would stay to the safe harbor so the the thing i will again go back to peop people want to split hairs i brought this just for the show-and-tell portion and i'll pass it around this is a government in the sunshine manual and this book gets bigger every year and if you thumb through it you will see it is absolutely chock-full of citations and cases and every year there are more citations and cases but this is one of the most useful books you can consult and it's online i don't i don't even use the print version i use the i getting to the point where everything i do i i do via my computer just because it's easier for me but there's all this stuff in here and it's organized very well if you look at the the tight or the table of contents they have you know quite an extensive list of topics and the each of the topics addresses what the legal standard is and then it addresses the up-to-date site case law and citations or administrative rules or whatever they are that that are relevant to the um this is the one call i gotta take my dad hello hey i'm in a meeting can i give you a call back okay that's fine that's fun okay that's good no i will not i don't know when i'll be there okay thanks um of course what did i say last you were uh emphasizing the sunshine yeah going online instead of well originally i guess you'd have to purchase the online version no no no no it's available to the uh attorney general's office okay to that website but it's extremely helpful uh patty and i use it i would say every week um when things come up it covers the same stuff we're going to cover today actually some of the stuff is in here i'm going i took from the sunshine manual but it's a to me a tremendous resource it changes you know over time and the um one thing i will say because you know patty and i and lynn have dealt with this the last year and a half there's a lot of stuff in there that is um covered and there are some things that there simply hasn't been a case yet so i i would like to think up some wild exotic example but there's um you know there are times that although the law covers a lot there's there simply hasn't been a case where a judge has ruled yet on a certain aspect of the sunshine law for instance and someday they they will probably rule on that you know unique situation but it there's it doesn't answer every question although it answers i would say 90 of the questions so it's it's again a really good resource the the public records law in florida is a statutory law both of the things we're going to talk about today are statutory and then there's of course all the case law but the the public records law is a um it's a swiss cheese type wall where there's all these exceptions to it and in in the the exceptions and the exemptions i last time i checked there's a the first amendment foundation has a website and i want to say there was 1053 different exceptions in florida law to the public records basic policy and you know that becomes a a daunting effort to look at something that has a thousand over a thousand exceptions to it and you know with some of the stuff that patty has to do with public records you know it the basic policy is straightforward but they're over over the years and and every year they add new exceptions to it and new clarifications and and that's that's the evolutionary process i i will say with with the law one of the concepts that i i truly believe and i i think it's been worn out over and over again is that the law is always lagging behind technology and uh that's always the way it's going to be there's very seldom where the law is actually parallel to what technology allows you to do so there was a time you know 25 years ago where we didn't really use email we didn't use websites i mean that was now 25 years ago coming into existence and you you didn't have the law 25 years ago really didn't address situations that we now address today every single day and over that 25-year period the legislature has had to almost every year and i would say every year made changes to the public records law because of technology which not only includes email but cell phones text messages etc so um you know the there's we when we get into some of the public records stuff you will you know just see how i mean it's it's like a fractured fracturing a piece of ice you start with the place where you hit and it just goes like that and there's all these different tangents that you have to to take into account and nowadays the um like text messages and cell phones is that's that's a really evolving topic um what you say on facebook and next door [Music] i'm sorry i wanted to make sure i was allowed to take this off because she has hers on i'm like aren't we supposed to have these ones no you don't have to yeah okay i don't mean to interrupt you through this yeah me too sure about five six weeks ago so i'm i'm in the clear now thankfully but anyways that that's another to me very important concept about what what we do in government because the you know there comes a point where and this is just an easy thing um with public records i mean are you engaging in a not public record sunshine law if the two of you are commenting on next door about a topic that is conceivably going to come before the the city council in the future and you know you say um i think it would be good if the city or i think it would be good if we did a and you liked it and that's all you did does that mean you've had a public meeting in violation of the sunshine law and that seems like to me a relatively innocent thing but arguably you've just violated the sunshine law by you liking it so there's so under the sunshine law the public meeting it doesn't have a have to have a quorum we're gonna talk about it because i know she's taping this because it's a public meeting but there's not a quorum here councilman well let me get into that yeah well let me do we'll we'll talk about public records first and then believe me we'll get into your report yeah this isn't a a council meeting it's a presentation i understand but i mean it's still considered a public meet yes because there are two there's at least two city council members here and we're discussing things that someday may very well come before the city council and to make it a comply with the law it has to be noticed and it has to be a record made of what was discussed and both things have been done you had to put this in the paper no we don't put our maids in the paper we just put them on the website we do what the law requires no i mean the notice of it yeah no we don't put notices in it uh two citizens showed up and wanted to sit in and listen to it that's they would be welcome to do that and you know yeah i don't have a problem with that either or but um what really constitutes a public meeting is what the question is and you're saying i go on facebook and i like her comment even though it's not on the agenda anything could come up on the agenda you know in the future so well i use the word arguable arguably that's a public meeting and the the thing that you you have to keep in mind is that there will be in i mean this this is a small community uh because it's a small community a lot of the people know each other not everybody but there are times where um people excuse the analogies but they're waiting in the shadows to pounce somebody's doing something wrong and you know i would what i'm telling you or will tell you is don't give them the opportunity i understand it's just ironic that the federal government doesn't follow all these standards because you get a party whip saying vote for this and i'll give you this yeah but we have a little community has to the whole florida legislature it doesn't work out right that's what i'm saying yeah yeah i mean they they do things the same way the federal great legislature does and you know unfortunately you're saddled with the rules so you have to comply with them and my my job is to help make sure you do and um i i will tell you and i would say this now with with these type of questions if you're ever in doubt then my job is to help make sure that you understand what the law is the legal standard and help make sure you you don't make a uh violate the law or violate an ethical cannon and that that's what i'm supposed to do that's why i have a job um and and i'm the best time for me to help you is before the misstep is made okay and you know there there's a lot of things that you know you all deal with that and rita can come out if she wants but you know when you first start doing this job the learning curve is like that i mean you you go from being a private citizen to now having to make decisions and having to make them at times with you know little notice and you have to incorporate a lot of uh things into the decisions you make and you know most i will tell you my experience most people are afraid of violating the law they don't want to do that they don't want to do it for a variety of reasons one their moral compass two they they don't want to get in trouble um three they're you know they're they want to do things the right way and you know they're at times scared to death of am i going to do something that's a violation of the law i'll add a few more i mean you're a real estate agent it would be devastating to you if you had a bunch of ethics charges against you and you don't need that and because of you know you there's many reasons but that's one of them you try to stay within the parameters and on the straight and narrow and not have those type of situations i mean i i've dealt with i you know in my job i i don't want ethic ethics violations that that is horrible for me to deal with i i make a very conscious attempt to not ever have any and at times it's difficult because of the situations you're put in but that's why i again will say starting point is the legal requirement or the legal standard and the ethical standard okay i i will tell you now and um you you will be put in some awkward awkward positions and don't be surprised when it happens and it probably will happen sooner than later so the the thing for you to do is resign yourself to the fact that's going to happen and be be ready when it does happen you should the light should go off in your mind fred reilly said what is the legal standard and what is the ethical standard and that's what i should concentrate on right out of the box and there there have to be there should be times where the best thing you can do is step back and say wait a minute i'm not sure whether i should be going forward with this conversation or this act i need to make sure i'm on safe ground and i'm in the safe order okay one thing i was going to say to you leslie is i i thought about it since you came on board um you know i've worked for a year and a half with a lawyer being the mayor and now i'm going to work with two lawyers on the city council so um you know i'm on my i thought i was on my toes before but i'll certainly be on my toes now but i look forward to working with um i would like to make a comment sure and that's true there will be two attorneys on there but yet neither one of them are supposed to express their legal opinion that's up to our city attorney correct well they and they'll i thought they couldn't express their legal opinion yeah i don't know so it's because of the background they have i'm i'm not it's not going to hurt my ego if one of them says i i thought about this situation and here's my take on it that's not going to bother me what would bother me is one of them goes beyond some something like that and they try to advise the council that this is what the council should do and you shouldn't respect the opinion of the city attorney on this topic i mean if they do that then i i will respectfully disagree with them i've done that already with mayor manzo i mean he's there been a few times um i didn't see it the way he did and i i told him that in a private conversation i've told him that in a public conversation and i will do that um again with with him or wesley or anybody else if there's a reason i mean this isn't a discussion about me but i i will tell you very clearly if i say to say something there's always a reason it's not it's not i pick something out of blue and what i also feel very strongly about is if there's a reason i i think you should or shouldn't do something i will also tell you why and occasionally i will say my vibe tells me there's you should be very careful at this point and i need to look into something further because i don't know everything that's in that book and i've done that too i will continue to do it in the future but i'm not deter getting uh you know wesley piping up and saying she has a a view on a legal topic she should have a view um just like each of you should have a view and i will be receptive to hearing it although there's going to be times that i will say this this is what i think you should do i need you to do a b and c and here's why you have a question under the floor bar standard though if uh i hold a license to practice law in florida any view i have is at a legal view when it's a public meeting staying with her comment you know yeah i mean that's happened before and i my tendency is to let the city council members discuss things in the manner that they choose to discuss them you had mentioned earlier the roberts rules of order i'll say something about that now the roberts rules of order can be applied strictly and they can if they're applied strictly then they can uh quell the discussion and at times i mean you know not everybody i i know the these the audience members don't know the robert's rules of order like the back their hand most people don't i will tell you i mean i i have a basic understanding of them but i don't know all the arcane rules and there's there's a lot of there's a lot of arcane rules in roberts robert's rules of order but the the thing that should happen in my opinion although at times it doesn't happen the way i would let it unfold is the roberts rules are applied in a strict manner and it's to deter people from discussing things my personal opinion is the city council members if they have a something that they want to discuss they should be given an opportunity to discuss it and it should be a free-flowing discussion and you of course want to keep the personal attacks out of it and the you know recriminations and things like that but you know you all should be able to talk amongst yourselves this is the only time in a public meeting when you can talk among yourselves about city business so i you know personally think it should be a free-flowing discussion because the other than the mayor being in charge of the meeting each of you have a equal voice and each of you should have the opportunity to explain your viewpoint on topics that come before the city council that's what should happen um i'd just like to ask for some clarification just so i know myself um but let's just say that you get a point of order and you don't think it was founded so is can you come back within robert's rules and say you object and does it go back to the council to vote on whether that was a legitimate point of order or not i think so okay now let me kind of change that question a little bit if you give a uh point of order on the person presiding over the meeting whether that be the mayor vice mayor whoever is presiding over it and they just can just you know discard it and continue with their conversation does wouldn't that go back to the city council whether that point of order is you know legitimate and he that conversation should be stopped i'm confused on you know the because if you get one on the person presiding the meeting then they can just shut you down and go right on but when you get one you're supposed to shut up and and just set them are are you reading it staying with her are you trying to remove the chair because you won't recognize your point of order so you're trying to i don't know sure i mean i'm just saying i'm not trying to but no but if you're presiding over the meeting and i give you a point of order and you just say well that's not your reason or your point of order isn't good and you just keep right on going but under under robert she say three times point of order if he keeps denying the point of order can she say motion to remove the chair temporarily remove the chair and say leslie i i nominate leslie as a temporary chairperson that may be in there yeah see that that's what i'm confused that is you know oh it shuts down some people but then somebody else if they get one they they're not shut down so i'm confused and here it talks about point of orders and appealing a decision of the chair for on a point of order and an incidental motion and i'm looking at page seven of the robert's rules award hold on hold on i gotta find seven no and there there are times and you'll recognize this as soon as i say it there are times that you need a little top a little space to explain what your your point is and there no i mean i'm just telling you what i've seen here and elsewhere at times people barely get out a sentence and they're the the chair whoever that is is trying to shut it down well and that that happens and i again say from my personal perspective you have to give people space to make their point i mean especially with the citizens i mean you all go through training so you're in a better position to discuss things and you i mean in your case you've been a city council member for a long time so of you and you you're better now at explaining your point and in trouble you have an opportunity to do it yeah you just you need to be given an opportunity to do it and at times and i'll say this with the citizens they they say things in a disjointed and artful manner because they're not used to presenting stuff in public and you know you have to give people space in order to make their point so you know i i personally am for very forgiving because i think it's it's essential that you give people the opportunity to say stuff but is the customary standard in under the second on if it falls under sunshine it's the three-minute rule for citizens to speak yes well that's not under the sunshine law that's a policy decision that the city commission typically puts in place i mean i think that's very intimidating when you have a clock run and you're up there trying to express your thoughts like you just said the citizens are sometimes nervous this is the first time they always are yeah and now you got a clock in front of you it's like a game show almost you know well yeah i and i'll use hane city as an example i mean there's times i sit there they they have the three-minute rule i sit there and i'm trying exceptionally hard to even understand what they're talking about and at times they're two-thirds of the way through before i finally understand what they're really talking about because everything's so disjointed they're not used to making a presentation right and that doesn't mean they're not making a good point just means it took me two minutes to figure out what point they're trying to make maybe it's me i hold that out as a possibility too but you know you have to give people some space here in this this city the time that i've been here it's been run in a rigid manner and i i've commented on that because it at times i would say it's been too rigid i think that's a fair couple of run out of time in these meetings to speak and you know well the citizens speaking for three minutes is one thing the council members i again said i keep saying need to have space you all need to have space to discuss things i really want to answer your point a little bit better if you get a point of order that my response to that would be i would like to explain why i'm i'm stating what i'm stating i'd like i'd like to be given the opportunity to explain my perspective on this would you would it i don't think it's asking too much to give me the opportunity to explain it i mean what what happens here and i i don't want to you know fear off into something too deeply but what happens here is if if you say a word that's interpreted as being a an attack then the you know hammer comes down and you at times you you've got to give people room and i again will say an underscore the discussion among council members about things uh y'all are equals talking to another equal and that's the way it should be done there have been times over the course of the last year and a half where it's been a very um tense and acrimonious at times discussion and as much as i wish that weren't the case sometimes that's going to be the case because people are passionate about their views and they have a different point of perspective that's going to happen it's understandable hopefully at the end of the day the seven of you make the best decision as you can for the sake of the city that's what should be the result that sometimes may not be so um let me get into a little bit of the public records law and that's in chapter 119 i included the definition of public records and then i included 119.07 which is the principal statute one of the things i will tell you when when i write emails to people i don't typically i mean you you can cut and paste things so it's not like i'm typing out three pages worth of stuff ever because i don't i what i want to do and i do this all the time is i want if i'm referencing a statue i oftentimes will put the whole statute in and although sometimes they're 15 pages long but i'll put the statute in the email and then highlight the relevant parts so you don't have to read the whole 15 pages unless you want to i mean i i'm one for disclosure and part of my job is is to disclose what the relevant things are to you and also give you what to me is the most relevant aspect of things but the the short version of what is on pages one through of four is that if it's a public record under florida law then you're obligated to provide a copy of it and you are also if there's an exception or an exemption that applies then you may not be obligated to provide it or you re you have to redact it and there's i will tell you the first year i was here i spent a tremendous amount of time and patty did too with public records requests and public records requests or i i won't say this in a public meeting well during a public meeting i'll say it this way if if you knew what you were doing you could bring a small city to its knees and a small city with public records requests and people some people have tried to do that okay i think it's extremely uh questionable say it that way and uh but there there are people around the state that have done that trying to think of the case that i always want to use as an example there was this i believe it was city of lakeland there was a public records request made and they didn't handle it exactly right and it ended up you know with the city of lakeland paying 150 000 plus in uh settlement because they they technically didn't handle something properly and i mean that was a case from a couple years ago um and it was it wasn't any you know great thing it wasn't like a conspiracy to to not provide stuff but it at times what starts as a minor issue can mushroom into something much much worse what patty has done and i've helped her whenever i've been asked to is we we try to provide the public records to do it in a timely manner and to um you know be an open book with transparency which is what the law contemplates so that people can understand the what their government is doing there are some things that are off off limits and i'll pick give you a couple examples this is now exceptions um the security plan for this building is not a public record because that is what somebody that's planning terrorism wants to see the the name and social security number of a minor child who's the victim of a sexual assault is not going to be a public record because that victim doesn't need to be exposed to certain things the the address i'm pretty sure of the city manager and the chief of police is not a public record because you know they deserve a little bit of peace and quiet and to not have criminals come to their house to kill them so there's you know things like that that those are just a couple random examples of exceptions if when a public records request comes in a public records request can be an anonymous request and the question is not who is this and what do they want this for the question is is this a public record and i'll start use this i generated this i emailed it to patty and she printed it out if somebody wants this and they want everything to do with this there's only three pieces there's this document there's my email to patty the email back where she said thanks i'll print it out for you and so we have it this morning so there's three things that are tied to this right now if one of us sends it out further that's public record um [Music] i will tell you from my standpoint something about email because email is the way that everybody communicates nowadays and then i also want to say something to you about text messages but my my way of writing emails is and i advise you to do the same is i only address business stuff in my email i do not say how was your weekend i didn't ask about the bucks game i don't propose we meet on friday afternoon at this bar to have happy hour i don't ever include any of that i mean you you've read my emails for quite a while and so if you i never do that it's not because i'm not interested in what you're doing in your personal life it's because i know that's a public record and the way i have always done it is it's strictly business it's to the point and anything that's personal is not included okay and the reason i do that is is very clear i don't ever have to go back to my emails and redact anything never i mean i in in any given year there's only a time or two where i ever ever put something in an email that i'd even have to think about redacting and if it if it is it's it's a related to a ongoing litigation case okay but that's what i would recommend you all to do because you you know anything you do that's related to city government is a public record and you have to when when i the other thing i do is when i write it i expect that tomorrow it will be on the front page of the newspaper and you know there's there's nothing that i ever write that i'm tomorrow i'm going to wish damn i wish wish i hadn't said that um i every time write it knowing that it could be on the paper front page of paper and at some point i'll have to have to redact it or it's up to some page some point that it'll be asked to be a public record and part of the reason i'm saying it that way is that if you ever had to go back and look through um you know 500 emails that you wrote and uh make sure there's nothing in there that needs to be redacted that is a time-consuming effort and you know you will not be very pleased spending the time to do that so what can be deleted and what can't i mean well don't deletes not a deletes a dirty word um redact is the appropriate word well i'm just saying we get a lot of emails like from the florida league of cities and all like that can we delete those or uh i'm assuming you're talking about out of our city email yes i mean i get i never delete any of them they're all still there there's like 2500 of them but it's nothing to do with bellar beaches city business so to speak i just don't honestly i don't even open them it'll be like from somebody giving you an update on something you know like outside like public health or something florida studies every week yeah yeah so but i don't even open those and when i get emails from this city um obviously it's from either patty lynn you know or actually it's from all three of you sometimes but i never respond to any of them ever i will read them and then if i want to give like patty let's say is asking is anybody going to attend to the meetings i mean i go probably to the extreme but i'm not breaking any rules so i'll call patty say yeah i'm going to be there but i don't respond i hit never hit reply to all and i don't send like i'm not going to send leslie any email frank any emails and out you know at all i just i stopped you know yeah leslie and i used to be friends who used to before she became city council and we would i don't do any of that with her anymore same thing with frank i'm not going to do that kind of stuff so and i know public records are huge that's why i never replied nor do i send one out on my personal email about business to like even patty and if i do send it out i'll copy doritos will put city of bellar beach and so that way it becomes a public record i don't have to worry about keeping any documents or redacted anything so that's how i approach well you you raise another good point um the fact that the three of you are friends you can still be friends when you're together you just can't talk about city business and that means nothing right like because i don't but i'm just saying i'm not going to talk about anything with you know planning and zoning or board of adjustments or park and wreck stuff or you know none of that because i don't talk about any of that stuff outside of city council once they're on council but um i just i'm very very cautious and sometimes to the extreme because you're doing this you describe the same thing i just described which is i i take a very guarded approach because i i don't want to spend hours looking back over 500 emails i mean i it's me as completely unproductive time it would be for you too okay when you're if the three of you are together at a cocktail party then you know you can talk about the tampa bay buccaneers you can talk about the you know the art show that's coming up you can talk about uh the weather but you know when it comes to there's we have to approve the budget and boy there's a lot of stuff that i i think we have our priorities askew that's that's the stuff you can't talk about i'll make an observation though if you're at a cocktail party and the three of you are standing there and you're talking about the tampa bay buccaneers there will be people at the party that will say i saw them together and the three of them were talking and they're they're violating the sunshine law yeah and regardless of what you what you're talking about and that's just the reality you have to be prepared for that three of us are at the party talking about the buccaneers citizen comes up and wants to discuss the budget i want to let you just say we can't discuss it for you well you can talk with the citizens i can talk with you one-on-one but i'm about to do other i even go that far like after a meeting if somebody's talking to me a citizen and i'm walking out the door and there's another council member there i'll just automatically i say this listen i'll see you later have a great evening and i walk away i mean i'm i'm not going to finish the conversation i was in if it was about city business with that citizen as soon as i see the account i'm out here see you and i leave i mean you could take that as a rude no because i will call them the next day or that evening and say you know i couldn't do that i mean i have done that before i've called and said it wasn't trying to be rude to you but so and so was tenure and they certainly understand because you know most of our citizens are pretty bright on that kind of stuff for sure i think well the the party example's a good one because you're talking about the tampa bay buccaneers but i'm just telling you there will be somebody there that is you know intently watching and uh you just have to be ready and that's that's part of what life is now that you're a city council member and you have just have to be careful and if if you're ever questioned on it you say you know look the city attorney seared this into my mind and we were not discussing city business we were discussing the tampa bay buccaneers or an event at ruth eckerd hall and you know i'm sorry to disappoint you but that's what we were doing and i i would be very uh i i wouldn't let it go by i'd say something yeah because she's doing it she's been a dear friend ever since i moved in and it's like years like it's been a half hour and the driver was just discussing you know in life now i say hi frank and i run in the house the fact that your dear friends and your family knows each other and you interact and have you know cookouts and dinners that shouldn't change just because you're a city council member you just have to be mindful of how the city works and this this is not unique to bel air beach i deal with it all the time in haines city too and i just do yeah and you will and you just have to you know the purpose of us talking about this stuff is partially for me to say enough things so that when you're in those situations a light bulb goes off and you do what you you've already learned how to do i'm sure you've done the same thing so you just have to be prepared yep because i don't do that i'm not having a conversation with either one of them about any city business nor anybody i'll say hi how are you doing bye whoa well i'll tell you another thing about about me at times it's like i feel like i'm the fourth grade teacher and somebody comes up to me well you know rita and mayor manzo are talking up on the diets after the meeting it's a hypothetical okay good thank and you know that somebody's coming up and i'm my response to that is uh both of them know what the sunshine law is and i'm not the whole monitor and they're they're two adults i'm i'm not going up to two adults that know what the standard is and gonna yell at them or even worse i'm not gonna yell at them from across the room don't violate the sunshine law your two adults having a conversation and i will will assume that you are not violating the law because you know what it is okay maybe my assumptions wrong but i'm i'm not the hall monitor okay and i i if i'm standing there and and two council members are in front of me and they start talking then at that point i will say hold on guys you you really can't be having the discussion about that aspect because it's it's veering off into sunshine law you're you're better you need to talk about the table of eight buccaneers well and that the sunshine law um to my understanding i want to make sure i'm clear on this it not only covers what is on the current agenda but what could be potentially on the future agenda does it also include what could uh what was on the past agendas because it may reoccur i mean i'm just trying to make sure yes so anything other than the bucks you may you may revisit things and periodically you know you're going to revisit yes so this the you know safer course of actions not not to do it that's what my city business then it should be discussed at a city council met the meeting in in compliance with the sunshine law here's a question three of us are not i'm talking about the buccaneers but we want to talk about ordinances in another town is that legal is it another uh ordinance that you're going to consider for bel air beach no just just what another town has enacted or is proposing something that's not even on our agenda or could be on our agenda well it could be yeah and now you're it's a good question and don't ever think i'm giving you a smart ass answer i'm that are really relevant and probably have happened you know well it has but now now you're getting into splitting hairs okay and like i just that's why there's cords because of the hair splitters yeah yeah and that's what i'm asking i mean can i talk to her can i talk to the mayor about you know did you hear what those jerks over in such and such a town did yeah i'm talking about not talking about the citizens i'm talking about the commission or the councils of the events okay okay so i'm gonna throw in there what i do and like i said sometimes i go to the extreme and i'm cool with that but i would not discuss those with another city council member because what if whatever that is lands back into our council's lab to like reach out and handle or try to help handle something or if it's been on our agenda in the past and let's say there's been conversations between those two commun communities regarding that and it could land back you know for some resolution maybe back on city of belarus's plate so i don't do it because then you discuss that whatever it is right so i mean i go to extremes like i mean i'm just going to say let's say indian shores has an ordinance that you know beller beach is not fond of so i'm not going to discuss that with any city council members on beller beach because what if indian shores in bella beach come together to try to discuss that so later or have in the past am i making sense you're you're making perfect sense but you're talking about things hypothetically yeah never i am okay okay well actually questions happen yeah yeah but sure yeah a hypothetical situation could turn into a real situation i'll answer it the same way i basically did a minute ago and you you made the point if it's something that the city council here may consider in the future then you should leave it alone you shouldn't veer off and discuss it because it's just too easy for somebody to say you're violating the sunshine law i'm trying to think of something that you know it's go well oh this is a good one this is easy if if you're talking about an income tax the you know florida doesn't have an income tax never will with constitutional prohibition against it but u.s government federal government has it you can talk about that because there's you have no authority under the law to ever put in an income tax in nowhere beach okay so that that's one it's an area of uh government but it's not one that you're ever going to be able to to do so that that's a topic that y'all could discuss uh quite a bit and there's no no risk in it but the the other cities ordinance or the other cities code uh conceivably you you at some point would do something that would have uh as a council you you may uh if there's a dispute then you're going to be engaged or responding to a dispute and it's also i mean this happens all the time one city passes an ordinance and it's a really great idea and other cities do the same thing because they want to employ that or implement the same great idea so i just you know you have to be careful and i again say and there's some stuff you'll probably sit there and think why why is the guy keep saying the same thing over and over again well it's because i want to emphasize it because i've we've dealt with it over and over and over again if you're standing there and there's the two of you are talking or the three of you are talking then fully understand there's people watching and they're going to assert that you are violating the sunshine law and with with social media social media has been extremely challenging for local government there's too much stuff that that becomes the runaway train and you know i'll comment on that in a minute but it's you know if it appears on social media it can take on a life of its own and you know all of a sudden everybody in town knows that one person thinks you violated the sunshine law and they can make some uh ill-advised stupid observation put it on facebook and next thing you know everybody that that's the reality to everybody or perception which is not reality that you have to deal with the perception yeah i stay off of social media as far as any business this business do you want to say something no i said i stay off at social media as far as city business because uh i i only use social media for a few personal things and to prove my profession but nothing about any of this i don't hit like on anybody's comments i don't comment on anybody's comments nothing so you're you are choosing an absolute safe harbor i i will tell you then this this is just the world we live in um i have the first amendment right to voice my opinion but i i seldom voice my opinion about anything on social media because we're we live in a climate now where if i make one misstep on something i get fired from the two city attorney jobs i have so the safer thing for me is don't comment on anything just like you rita i mean i i facebook i've always kept is is a way to keep in contact with people that normally i wouldn't even run into and over the years i've lost track of but now i have you know it's interesting to see what they're up to in life but i i don't put it's a shame because there have been times i thought i lived an interesting life but i don't put it on facebook because i can't i'm not i'm not gonna deal with that and it's but social media can be a real challenge that i'll go back to the the law keeping up with the technology that that is one of the principal areas that we have to be concerned about and there's now starting to be some cases where people have filed ethics charges based on what local government officials said on facebook so anyways i should have started with the sunshine law but instead of the public records i'll make a few more comments about the public records law i i'd ask that this this handout some of it's kind of boring and dry but i would ask that after today you take the time and read through it because i think if you do you'll have a much better understanding the i'll make a couple more comments about then we'll talk further about sunshine ball the what's the downside of not complying with the public records law the downside is somebody will file an ethics complaint against you and if conceivably you could get fined okay i have in my career have handled cases for nobody from this city nobody from hayden city but i've handled cases for people that had ethics complaints against them at the state level and have had commission on elections complaints against them at the state level and i want to comment a little bit about those and kind of both of those to me are kind of the same type of thing there's to to have integrity in government there's a readily available way to make a complaint okay if somebody wants to do it they can go online fill out an online form and make a complaint based on ethics or election um the if you do that there you know it's not a anonymous um process you you have to have the uh conviction to put your name otherwise it won't be addressed although you somebody could write a anonymous letter that's happened but the the process if somebody makes a complaint i don't know if any if y'all are familiar with it but if somebody makes an ethics complaint the initial process is it's taken seriously if if somebody knows what they're doing which oftentimes is not the case but somebody makes a complaint then the first step in the complaint process is to determine whether there's probable cause or not which you know is a fundamental thing up until that point it's it's a confidential issue and if they determine that it's there is probable cause for them to look into it further then it becomes a public issue and once they determine probable cause of course you you have when the the complaint comes in you you're notified at some point and you have the uh ability to contest whether the charge is valid or not and you have the ability to mount a defense that's what i've done in the cases i am talking about which i'm only talking about in a generic way the my experience has been when people make the complaint they really don't make a very good complaint but they um you know make it nonetheless the the defense of the com the complaint immediately is you know you focus on what the legal standard is and i if you leave here remembering one thing i said remember i said start with the legal stand legal and ethical standards that that is the one paramount thing i want you to remember today but the um you know the whole complaint will revolve around whether or not you violated the legal standard and you know they have investigators and they investigate and you know you may or may not there are times that people have done technical violations of things in technical i'll say it was inadvertent they didn't intend to violate anything they actually in many cases did stuff to mitigate it but technically they violated it i had a a person that was a city commissioner they were in a professional services firm and they technically violated the law they did it in a way that was the most innocent way you could ever do it but you know at the end of the day they got a slap on the wrist and a fine but it certainly appeared in the paper that this person that was a partner in a professional services firm you know violated the law the ethics law and that of course doesn't do well for them i don't mean to pick on you rita yeah you're looking right at me dude you're looking right at me dude yeah well but i'm saying here here's my example with you i mean again you're a real estate uh agent broker no he's an agent broker so basically my broker would like on my listings would own the listing i don't own that listing well but you know you're a real estate professional and the last thing you need is a bunch of chatter in the newspaper or on front door or back door or whatever it's called and about you know how you violated the ethics law that that's not good for you and that's one of the reasons every the examples you give i think are good really good examples because you're very conscious of things and you're also trying to make sure nobody has any basis to to assert stuff so i i couldn't agree more with what you've said in this this meeting to about what you're doing assertively to make sure you don't have a problem that's great so yes ma'am to whom would a citizen make a complaint attorney general's office well if it's ethics it would be to the the florida commission on ethics okay just curious and legal would go into general it was a criminal violation that would go to the state's attorney but if it's a sunshine law or something that's typically going to be an ethics violation commission okay um i talked about email i'm going to say a few more things about this and then we gotta move on um text messages okay text messages a lot of people it's it's in vogue to do text messages i occasionally get somebody asked me a legal question in a text message and i respond that's something we would have to discuss in a conventional conversation the only way the only reason i use text messages is to confirm you know you you said you'd be there at noon and are you still on for noon my answer is yes okay i don't discuss substantive things in text messages i would encourage you not to with anybody to discuss things in a text message and the reason being what is 164 characters you can't put nuance into 164 characters okay and government things you you have to frame it in the proper way and you know you you just have such a small space to frame anything i i'm just telling you don't don't work don't use text messaging for conducting city business because it is a public record okay and again this this is like redacting 500 pages of stuff if somebody wanted all my text messages for that related to city business i you know i'm sure it's not that hard but you'd have to download them i don't know how to do that i'd have to find somebody that knew how to do that and i'd have to you know download them all and then i'd have to go through to make sure to redact it the easier thing for me is i don't conduct any business over text messages just don't so i don't have to fuss with it but people insist on doing stuff like that if citizens contact you via text messages about city business then my responses would be very short this this is a better topic to discuss in a a personal conversation or telephone call okay and a personal conversation one-on-one or a telephone call between you and a citizen is not uh there's no record created and you absolutely have the right to do that you don't have to make a record of it i mean you you're responsible responding to a citizen who wanted to talk to you about something that's you're never there's not no restriction on you doing that okay [Music] i will tell you and patty i think will agree with me the there have been times we've dealt with very substantial public records requests and i'll use myself as an example if somebody said i want all fred riley's emails or the city manager's emails for the last two years okay well if it's me or lynn or patty that's thousands and thousands of emails okay and the the question that the city clerk often ask is to clarify is is that do you really want all that and if it's a um extravagant request then there there's stuff in the statute for the city to charge for an extravagant expense so for instance if they wanted all linds emails from 2020 the person making the request thinks it's as easy as lynn hitting a button and they all go to one spot and nothing else has to happen and somebody should be able to hand you a flash drive with all this stuff on it it's not that easy it it requires somebody to to do those things it requires somebody to redact them and to make and keep a direct copy of what they're providing and you know at times we go back and and the city can charge for that the statute allows that you can charge for compiling these records right do we have a set fee you know adherences you can charge it to 15 cents if you don't have a set fee most most towns since i've been here the city put in place a policy that relates to public records what is it 25 cents a page or we use the florida statute didn't we yeah yeah but there's a lot a lot of stuff in there so i would ask that you you give them a copy of that policy i'll send it to you but could counsel up that above the florida it's the way i'm reading this is if you don't have a set that you can only charge up to 15 cents but you could charge you could pay could you pass an ordinance at 25 cents a page you can't pass an ordinance that would make it onerous for somebody to get the records that would be because most states a lot of states are 25 cents now yeah the the thing just so you understand what we try to do when these and i'll use the word crazy there have been times we've gotten crazy requests although a crazy request is legitimate if the citizen is asking for it because if it's a public record you're simply obligated i'm using crazy in the context of they they start out asking for this extremely wide definition of records and what we do which is allowable under florida law is see if they really want all that or whether they're looking for something that's a lot more focused and and i'm i'll use an example from haynes city i i got a request long ago where a a group wanted the internal investigation files from the police department for you know i don't know five year period and you know any police department always has they have dedicated people that's all they do is do internal investigations well you know this was a a box a big box of records and i mean it was you know thousands and thousands of pages of records because it's all police related it somebody had to go somebody that knew what they were doing too had to go through every one of the pages to make sure there wasn't information that should be redacted like a victim's a minor victim's name okay and you know the the people that were asking for this [Music] again doesn't matter what purpose they're asking it doesn't matter who was asking but they were asking for such a monumental thing under the law we responded and said if this is what you're asking for then if we need a deposit of x number dollars and i it may have been a thousand dollars um in order to we'll process this we we project that based on your request there will be a y number of documents and it will take a staff member you know z number of hours to go through and redacted and based on the the law and our policy it us doing this task and providing the public records will cost you know thirty five hundred dollars if you want to proceed we need x number of dollars is a deposit and when you do that then suddenly people start thinking well maybe that's not what i really want and they narrow their their scope and they you know what they really want is something related to uh it all now bounced back to here what they're really looking for is the emails sent from lynn reeves to fred riley related to topic a that's really what they're looking for is in florida or township is it a reasonable time or is there a definition of days that a public request has to be made or answered like the document has to be provided yes if you walked into this room and looked at this document and said i want a copy of it i can't it can't take me a week to get it to you i can walk in there make a copy with patty's permission and hand you that copy and that's reasonable so it's it's so there is no statute saying no there is a statue you have to do it stuff within a reasonable period of time because the federal government is reasonable time and it could take years well yeah we're we're not the federal government i understand that it's the same wording and you can say well patty is busy she just got sick she can't copy it there's nobody in need there's lots of ways you can we i know by the the work that we've done the effort is made to be responsive to people sure and that's the way it should be but you can also if it's political and that you can really burn the person you don't know that me that you personally don't know me that well it doesn't matter if it's political it's yeah i i just dealt with a lot with me the city clerk it is what what are what is the documents that are being requested and what do we have to do to respond in a timely manner to the request that's my calculation i'm not going to change my the way i look at it i don't think she's going to change the way she looks at it there have been times where it's been complicated and i'll give you an example um a request is made it's an anonymous request and the anonymous request is for this extremely broad thing and you're you're trying to uh respond to an anonymous request and you're trying to explain to somebody who you don't even know how to contact them um how you know this this request is so wide and you know how how can we narrow this and that has been um you know just telling you the truth that's been complicated at times there's no good faith requirement for the request it doesn't have to be okay it's you know i that that goes to it the the starting point is if they ask for a public record it's one is the document is it a public record okay if it is then the motivation does not is not relevant under florida law if it's a public record then you're obligated to provide it to them with the caveat that you have to do the redactions to take into account all the exemptions okay that's the lawyer and me asking if there's a good faith requirement yeah at times i'm sure some of the things if you want to be lawyerly about it they may not be a good faith yeah i mean but that's not for me to decide not for her to decide i mean i'm again i know what we've done and again i'm not just thinking about bel air beach i've had the same things happen in haines city and they happen everywhere they you know people at times it's used as a tool when at times it uses a weapon i mean i jus i'm just telling you flat out i i'll go to an example i've dealt with that and i kind of alluded to it earlier there was a time where people were asking for records and they were they were simply setting up lawsuits to shake cities down for for stuff that's all that's all they were doing and this was a money-making venture and they would get a they would typically target smaller cities because that the the people in smaller cities except for this one are not that well versed in this stuff and they're they're asking things in a way that it's easy to make the misstep and then you can file a lawsuit and you know that's they're just people that do stuff like that there's this is this is not the topic at hand but i i know this because i went through it there there was people lawyers in south florida that were doing 88 compliance cases based on the city's websites okay and they were doing these adas of federal law so they were in federal court and they were doing this is this is great i gotta explain it so it makes you understand the gravity of it they're in fort lauderdale and they're looking at the website of a city in the panhandle that they've never been to okay and it's 200 miles away they the only thing they know is it's on the map and they ask or went to the website and the website is you know arguably not ada compliant because the website shows a map but it doesn't show up on an ada reader is a map it shows up as you know something they can't figure out and that that's the basis for somebody saying you know i'm i was trying to access information and it's not ada compliant and you know thus i'm going to i filed a federal lawsuit against the city and but we can solve it for fifteen thousand dollars and people were doing that um i heard last time i was really paying attention to this stuff they they found a new target and i i just you know nothing against lawyers although at times i'm sick of them too um and i mean that but these these guys were filing lawsuits against mom-and-pop gas stations okay and because the mom-and-pop gas station had the new gas pumps that have the screen where they run the commercial where you're standing next to it filling your tank with gas and they have a 30 second commercial about something yet it wasn't closed captioned okay and they filed ada lawsuits against these people for you know 15 or 20 grand and you know even though it was a private business they're still obligated to comply with the ada and you know i mean that that's what they were doing i mean and and the mom-and-pop gas station you know they're probably pretty narrow profit margin and you know now they're they're facing that kind of stupid lawsuit so anyways the story has a happy ending one of these guys that that did this that i mean they had 300 lawsuits in federal court at a time that's that's the gravity of what they were doing but that all the lawsuits were the same they're 50 page complaints and they're you know they assert all these things but there is one guy and i read with glee although i don't read much with glee but i did this time that the guy was filing these lawsuits his client had no connection to the city other than finding the website on the internet and the the attorney was just did absolutely uh dishonest things to the point he violated all sorts of florida bar rules and then one federal judge wrote just a scathing order sanctioning this guy i doubt he's even an attorney anymore because he he just got talked about being taken to the woodshed and he should have been i mean he's using the court to shake people down it's legalized extortion but anyways i i digress into another example but that stuff happens here too we you and i have not dealt with it but i've dealt with it a couple of times in in city where people were trying to use the public records law to fleece the city for the ada to fleece the city we've had both there so anyway what we ultimately tried to do is make sure that we comply with the law we do it in a timely manner and that people get access to the information they're entitled to see under the law so um do you have any questions about public records law and my reporting comment on that is i'm confident there will come a day where you do have questions and i said this earlier but i'll say it again i'm in a better position to help you if in advance and you know i'm a phone call away i know rita you've i don't know that you call me very many times you're reluctant to call me but i um there's there's no problem i i've i know i've said this to you at least once or twice if there's ever a time you want to call me and you want to say fred i want to ask a few questions but i i really would prefer if you don't charge the city for it my answer will be that's fine i won't i will tell you now i won't and i will not so that was a guy i've spoken to you two or three times which would not have happened if the situation would have been different but i've always said right off the bat it's gonna be charged to the citizens because if so talk really fast because we need to get this time i've said that to you a couple we gotta go really fast get this done yeah i mean you're trying to be blindfolded mindful of things you always have been and that's fine i'm just just telling you because you're new there there are times i mean if and i i'll say this is just a quick comment um when i interviewed for this position i told the city [Music] commit council as a whole how i do my billings my billings are extremely detailed i say who i talked to what it was about and with with a caveat and how much time it took to the minute that's the way i've always done it seldom do i get asked about my bill because it's all there okay i also frequently put in time entries where i don't have any time even though i spent time on it and there's time times i put in time entries where it took two hours but it really in my it was you know you leslie will understand this better than anybody there's times you should be able to find something but it takes three times as long to find it as as you really thought it would take i mean that happens frequently it's not my research skills are bad it's just the times you have to poke around to find the right thing but they're frequently i put in if it you know an hour and 15 minutes but i put actual time spent two hours so i want you to know i spent more more time on it um well can can any council person call you um and ask a question because i'll tell you one thing i'm retired i get two pensions every month i'm beginning three but i i wouldn't want to work well i'm doing this for free but i wouldn't want to work for free at your age all right oh there is it there is always about bringing us age how old do you think i am 35. i'm just saying you have a job to do it you did this job sure not for gratis i mean you did it you know you represent us i wouldn't expect you to work for free is what i'm saying so i don't appreciate you saying that well i wouldn't i mean if i was in your chair i wouldn't want to work for free what i'm saying no i really don't yeah i mean uh but what i'm saying is can any council member call you and is there a limit on council you know how much time we can spend with you or whatever well i'll answer your question but i'm going to answer it in a somewhat different manner okay i encourage any of the council members if they have a question to call me and i will talk to them about it if it's something that uh i mean and i'll pick the easiest thing if if you have a question about whether you voting on a specific uh item that's going to be on the agenda whether that would be a conflict of interest because of this situation that absolutely you should call and you and i should talk about it and i will you know do what i always do what's this legal standard what's the situation and it's important that you and i have that discussion because if there is a conflict of interest there's a procedure for you to refrain from participating in the discussion and for you to refrain from voting and that's perfectly legal well like monday i asked you a question when we're getting pictures you know and i don't expect that to be done for free you know what i'm saying but it's it's a question that was raised by some of the citizens so well i haven't answered for yet so well yeah but what i'm saying is at the end of this yeah but that shouldn't be done for free well yeah yeah here here's what i would ask you to do uh look at my bill and you'll soon enough see i only seen one and it's it's very idolized okay well i'm telling you and i'm telling you flat out and i've said this to the other four members if there's ever a time you want to talk to me and you'd ask that i'm not or sometimes i volunteer it you know then i you know if it's something i need to spend five hours on i'm not gonna do that uh spend five hours and you know simply throw it into that i don't get to pay for that i can't do stuff like that but i mean within reason i've always been willing to answer questions and talk to people about stuff and and i will continue to do that so don't be deterred from calling me if and and i use the the uh conflict of interesting because this is a small community and it's it's certainly understandable there will be conflicts of interest and you you need to make sure you handle it properly because if you don't then you're in jeopardy of a ethics charge so don't don't be deterred but you know uh the the city uh charter is to have most of these stuff come through the city manager because somebody needs to direct how things were done there was a time where the the you know question was whether the mayor was authorized to direct me to do stuff and the city council decided they they want things to run through the city manager and you know the mayor and i talk periodically that's no secret but i um you know other i talked i've always talked to other city council members and you know it's i i can't and that this is the way i was going to answer the question a minute ago i can't do my job fully unless i have a uh free-flowing discussion with my client you guys are my clients and i i need to be able to communicate with my client if there comes a point where it's so rigid that i i can't even have a conversation with my client then i won't want to be the attorney anymore that's that's putting too much uh that that's restricting me too much and i my request is of anybody just don't abuse it okay and i i don't expect it will be so if you have a question uh please call me and we'll handle it accordingly um i had stopped with it's inevitable there will be public records requests that will involve you so be prepared and we will handle them in an appropriate manner patty is very well versed in it and the request typically starts with her and if it's something that she needs some perspective from me on she contacts me or lynn at times the three of us discuss stuff that you know we do try to handle things in the appropriate manner and do it in a timely manner as well the the sunshine law we've we've talked quite a bit about that i wanted again to give you the the statutes at least a part of it i mean this is public records law is you know a whole chapter 119 and it's extensive and if you look through through this booklet this booklet is basically broken into public records law and um sunshine law and it's it's got that much stuff in it so if you ever have a tough night sleeping this is the book to pick up if you want to toggle your mind before you finally fall asleep um i've said a lot of things about the the sunshine law i'll kind of give a very quick recap and then uh hit a couple more points the recap is if there's a meeting of two city council meeting members or more then it's obligated to be done in accordance with the public or the sunshine law okay sunshine law is also used as a a tool it's also used as a weapon so both of these things fall in to the same category you can get in real trouble with this because of the you know if you you if you don't confine your discussions about city business to the council chambers then you know you you're in my opinion courting trouble except there's no problem with you as a city council member being approached by another citizen and or talking to another citizen in or the group the lows or at the beach or whatever that's that's fine you're being responsive to your constituents okay one of the things that if you delve into that very far you would find there's a whole bunch of stuff about conduits okay so you can't go to um i'll use rita i know well now you literally don't already set back i'll use you are you married yeah now go ahead and use me because well i met your husband yeah my husband and frank are obviously friends as well as you guys yeah i'll use reno rita's married i met your husband seems like a nice enough guy okay what you can't do is go to rita's husband and say i'm thinking of voting yes on this topic um and with the full expectation that now he will go tell rita that and you'll subvert the sunshine law by using him as a conduit can't you can't do that okay so that wasn't a bad example was it no and it's just like let's just flip it i would never go to your wife and say i'm doing such and such because she says something you she becomes a conduit and we're all in trouble but but steve and i talk a lot and sometimes we talk about stuff in the city which is perfectly legit right yeah because he's a citizen too yeah he's a voter well you know how i would handle that i would say to steve um i can talk to you about this but i can't uh i have to do it with the understanding that i'm talking to you as a private citizen and i can't uh say something to you that will then be relayed to rita councilwoman smoke said that on election eve to me we've laid it all out you know the do's and don'ts but before he was voted in i mean yeah yeah actually before the election was finalized i said here's what you need to don't talk to me i'll weigh that no no no but we had that conversation with the dudes and don'ts before any but votes were cast yep but and steve and i always kept it but we're frankly and that's fine but here let me use this example because it's a good one you have every right to talk to seed because he's a citizen of the city okay he has a legitimate concern and he's voicing it to you if you preface any response by saying um i'm happy to discuss this with you as a citizen but you you were i'm telling you in advance you you cannot communicate this what i'm going to say to your wife because she's a city council member and i mean that then if if you and steve are talking to the party you just said what i suggested and later on it comes up you know you were using steve as a conduit you get to say i absolutely was not i clearly stated before i responded and i got his his acknowledgement that he would not be a conduit and i he's a citizen and i talked to a citizen i didn't do anything wrong now if steve uh doesn't do what he committed to doing then you know there's there's a problem and you know i mean there's some some people i even if they say yes i will keep it myself i wouldn't believe them and i would that would govern he tells you that he does hey sunday or new dreams uh steve and i were both out there up to her knees picking up side blankety blankets okay but we were two citizens and i was a councilman you know but there was nothing about her or me or you know i should probably clear up something since this is a public record they were picking up sod that was floating down the street because when the street was repaired the guys just like fresh saw him i didn't want people thinking they were running over and taking people i could see that going a whole different direction floating on my property and my side floated on there yeah well i'm just conduit you have to be careful about um a lot of the the stuff with sunshine law is any anytime you're going to be in the company of other elected officials you you need to be careful and again uh go back to pers for to perspective perspective and the fact that it you know it will be i mean i i this is a stupid example i'm making up but i bet it's not too far from reality is if the two of you or all three of you were standing out here well i'll put you out front you're standing out front then you know a citizen comes in they see the three of you talking and they take a picture and then it's on next door and you know they're holding on you know an illegal sunshine law meeting and you know before you know it the whole town was commenting on you know these horrible people they elected and all y'all were out there saying that isn't this one of the most beautiful days of the year so far that was all that was said and everybody agreed had nothing to do with city business but it's on next door so just be be careful and you know a lot of stuff you that this is the purpose of this was not to um give you my philosophy on everything but this is i will i've tried to filter some of that stuff in i will tell you my philosophy on this type of stuff you can preempt people and one of the best tools you have is you consciously pre-empt people and it's something i do is in legal work all the time is i i don't give them the ability to to go to where they're going they're going to go you just outmaneuver them and it out maneuver doesn't mean you're doing anything illegal it means you are addressing the situation in advance so that's what i would encourage you to do do you have any ish questions about sunshine lol okay throughout this i've said things related to how to protect yourself against ethical complaints i don't need to rehash that i wanted to tell you about one pending case that the city has there's a personal injury case that's handled or that is the plaintiff's name is clinically narrow that as you can imagine the city has insurance and i want to comment about that a little bit um city has insurance for the city-owned property like anybody would and if there's a slip and fall or if there's a injury that happens on city property that that's an insurance claim and the city has insurance council that defends the city if there's an auto accident with a city vehicle and a city employee then that's covered by auto insurance and we have claims council for that if there's a civil rights type complaint then the city has insurance for that and that would go to claims council and the claims council would defend it there are some situations where i would be the uh you know council in a lawsuit but in my tenure so far we we haven't had one of those situations yet so so there's one outstanding personal injury i think there's just one yeah what's that retained too since it's slip and full on city property here yes okay and those those are periodically you're going to get those and in haines city i think we have i mean city has 283 employees and they have you know auto accidents they have they have a bunch of parks and they you know slip and fall injury auto accidents things like that so there there's ongoing cases there all the time here you don't have as many option of available options for people to slip and fall but they they happen here like they do anywhere else some of them have merit some of them don't council have the ultimate decision to seek to settle or fight it right well they do the same thing every time that any insurance council will do they assess whether it's a valid claim and then it's they determine what you know if it's a claim that has merit then you you know how do you settle the case in the most appropriate way and they periodically will seek direction on what to do if if the claims council ever says i think you should settle this case for and i'm just picking a number out of the sky for twenty thousand dollars because that would be at least our cost to defend it and you you as a city refuse say no we want to go you know take it all the way um and then you end up getting a judgment against you for a hundred thousand dollars then the insurance will only pay 20 and you'll be stuck with 80. so just man i'm slightly confused from your comments and your question and the reason why i'm confused is this is how i thought it worked as the city if we get a letter of intent to see all this start from the very beginning if you get a letter of intent to sue then it shuts down all conversations within the city council and all of that on that because now it goes to the border league of cities and then let's say that person takes it from an intent to sue to an actual lawsuit the lawsuit still goes to the florida league of cities and then their claims adjuster and stop define whether they're going to settle not the city council of bel air beach we don't sit there and say we're going to fight that right or that we're going to accept that either way do we isn't it florida league is city's responsibility and we just don't mention it don't talk about it because it's an ongoing thing so we can't talk about anymore it shuts us down the moment well if it's ever been if a lawsuit's ever been filed there's an exception to the sunshine law and you can have they call it a shade there's there are times where there we may need to have a shade meeting where we're talking about the expenses and of a case and the settlement options available and that that is a shape meeting is done in a very structured manner it has to have a court reporter and after the litigation has been completed then the record of the transcript is a public record but the conversation in the shade meeting is very focused and it's only about litigation expenses and settlement options so can i soon what she's saying is that borderline cities can preempt the city council for making a decision well i wouldn't say that the the over the last i don't understand that i mean the the litigation on that you know what i'm saying they're suing us i thought we had full control of what you're saying telling our insurance company no we're not going to settle we're going to fight it we're going to list the 80 000 if we lose well we have not in my time here we haven't had one of those type of situations yet but getting back to what she's saying with the board of league of cities council be able to override us i want to see okay i think the florida legacies is the insurer i mean that's right why they're in it and their insurance council doesn't so they're the under right of all our policies yes basically there are i'm not sure about auto i don't know yeah i've never had to deal with an auto claim in the time i've been here that's a question okay then i understand that and then we could still tell them no we're not gonna yeah we're not gonna it's not referring to them as the league of cities we're going to them as an insurance company we're going to our underwriters simply saying we're not going to sit here yeah but let me tell you and i have one specifically in mind that i i know has happened since i've been here there was a claim and it was um it went to the insurance company and it ultimately was settled for 5 000 okay and lynn authorized the the resolution of the case for five thousand dollars i i think in all likelihood i don't know but i my guess is he you know made sure everybody was comfortable with that but it's also i mean it he has a certain amount that he can make a decision on and i think that was likely within the amount and it was you know i mean a lot of the claims as we all know they start out this is a gazillion dollar claim and they end up settling them for five thousand dollars and because it's not a gazillion dollar claim and the merits of the case are not there but that's you know plaintiff's lawyer always sorts out without stuff but it's it's handled in a a structured manner and if if it exceeds lynn's ability to uh authorize it to be resolved then ultimately it would have to come to the city council for some sort of decision and that's what a shade meeting is all about okay my i guess this will be my closing type comment and because this goes to everything we talked about today my my job is over the years has become more and more risk management and in a way that's not what i always had in mind but i i've realized that that is what my job is in some ways my job is how does do i do things to help the city uh one make sound decisions a city council but how do we also do things that keeps the city out of litigation and that's what i try to do i will tell you i mean i haven't worked with youtube for a while or much leslie and i've talked several different times but you know i i try to be an open book about things i i don't like to get caught up in the intrigue and the conspiracy and all that stuff all i want to do is do my job and serve the interest of my clients and that's what i'm focused on but i i don't want um there are times the city you know has exposure and how do you find ways to mitigate the exposure and how do you find ways to to prevent us the city being in a position where um you know you have potential liability and that that's what i'm oriented towards how do we do that and how do i specifically do it on the things that i have some involvement with so that's what i'm trying to do and i'm you know y'all y'all's role is different i'll go bounce back the rules your role actually your role is to do everything i just said and to make decisions that are in the interest of the citizens of the city and that's you know i'm confident that's what you will do so i have one final question that i would like a little bit of clarification on i'm going back to shade meetings for a moment um who runs the shade meeting is well i got a couple questions who runs the shade meeting and what if a person you do what if a person like let's say myself isn't comfortable being in the shade meeting because i like all my conversations with the council and everybody to be public recorded on video because that way i can say it's all right there and on the shape meeting i could i lose that right to have it's not going to be recorded in a video but it's going to be you have to have a court reporter there and a court reporter is going to make a verbatim transcript of everything that's said in that meeting so you're protected in that state from that standpoint because i would never want you know walk out of a shade meeting and then people say well this was said by her and then be like i have no proof nobody should be walking out and saying anything about what was was discussed in the shade meeting because it's a confidential discussion can you have executive sessions on those or it's called an executive session there's there's a statute that defines the parameters and believe me i'm in haines city i've done this numerous times you you follow the procedure to the t and i i will insist on that when that when we ever get to that point we will do it believe me in strict conformity with what the statute requires i'll set it all up and if there's an attorney from the uh insurance company i will in all likelihood start the meeting save the parameters and then he will talk about the merits of where we are and that sort of thing but it it's announced it's we you have to convene the shade meeting or the executive session um using them synonymously you have to start that in an open public meeting and then you have to conclude it in an open public meeting and then we come in we when it started the council members would come in here and in here would be me court reporter attorney from the insurer seven council members and the city manager that's it nobody else is allowed okay but does a council member um have a right to say that they don't want to attend it i mean because i'm sorry i want all my conversations recorded i'm very uncomfortable with that because i know it's recorded what you're saying but that doesn't come out so much later and if you know somebody files paperwork on me i want to get them to be able to pull public records and have every conversation they would have no basis to file like complaint against what you said in an executive session that was done in accordance with the law and i again assure you it will be if you choose not to come that's up to you okay i would encourage you to come though because your voice is important just like the other things i hope we don't have any time me too i mean in haines city in nine years i think we've had three she doesn't come and then there's a boat and it's a tie where you go then well man back to the drawing holder we'll leave that conundrum for the day it happens well thank you very much for everything today does anybody have any questions okay the eccentric bottles in there for you i hope y'all like the way i do this because yeah you're very conversational and you learn a lot and you know this is again saying the learning curve is is steep and this this is stuff you have to know so that you know you you a lot of what i'm say have said is for the purpose of you at a later date remembering we talked about this this is something i need to look at further or i need to get legal advice on it and that's that's what should happen um i know we just recently were notified but it was before the election uh on our ethics training that was due so do we have to retake it with new people in or just the new people take that the ethics course right do you mean like if you weren't up for election no i mean like right now i just took my ethics because you have to do like once a year right so i just took it now are they going to send out a new one because we have um new people where everybody has to take it again or just now it's individual what have you when did you take it let me ask you um what was it in february february march before before the election so will i be notified when to take it okay you can take it online yes and there's some places you can take it for free in some places you can they charge you if you get if you choose one that you know you get charged city will reimburse you but yeah but you'll provide us the link or okay okay okay well that that's it and then if there's ever a question please get a hold of me and i'm happy to help presentations"
