    "transcript": "foreign are we recording yes sorry thank you good evening everyone it is July 24th 2023 and the city council work session for the city of Bellaire Beach will now come to order uh let's rise and do the Pledge of Allegiance pledge allegiance the United States of America because Patty would you please call the roller council member Belinda Livingstone here council member Leslie Notaro here council member Lloyd Roberts president council member Mike Sable here vice mayor Jody Shirley here mayor Dave Gattis here city manager Kyle leefler City attorney Randy Moore president and council member Frank Banker was unable to attend thank you very much Patty we have it looks like we have six uh genuine agenda items tonight uh however due to recent events especially on social media uh a lot of confusion disinformation uh concerning the uh the whole proposal of possibly purchasing a boat city manager reefler has uh has asked me to add an agenda item so he can further uh present his case as to uh what he plans on doing with this boat and uh the size the cost things like that so we're gonna we're gonna amend the agenda to be item zero for uh for a discussion of the boat purchase and and I would like to start right off with with that item uh so uh that being said I'm going to hand the floor over to city manager reefler thank you mayor um I'd just like to go back over uh the timeline of events would be uh proposal of the boat and go over some of the some of the facts and uses and um just cover all the information where it's at right now so uh the the first bit of Workshop was on June 19th um if that budget Workshop it was recommended that we looking to studying a savings program for a boat and uh the reason behind that was to have the ability to address the inshore issues uh that would have come up periodically with the city so after that budget Workshop I uh did some research and um found some existing government contracts and realized that for our use in a shallower inshore environment it seemed that the rib rib boat um would be the ideal boat that most other agencies tend to use for their purposes and that stands for a rigid inflatable boat um Mr reefer could I get you to speak a little closer to the microphones and then um so anyways uh so I I actually wrote the name GSA I'm tracked uh for a 21 foot um that contract that uses an example for the budget planning purposes the uh the contract was for about 81 000 for the for that boat and it was valid until 2028. um so in preparation for the second budget Workshop I put in the savings program for the boat um and put it on a five-year timeline at twenty thousand dollars per year that's more than what the contract was I just put it in for some legal room um not knowing exactly when we plan to purchase the boat uh at the second budget Workshop it was discussed to looking to a possible faster timeline to purchase the boat as opposed to five years um we kind of some were on Broadway purchased so he in the next by the year um it kind of arrived there to keeping it over two years saving program uh we'll do some further research since the last uh budget Workshop I discovered that further respects of that GSA contract um for a similar vote right now of the MSR um if we were to go out to bid um I talked to vendors they they could offer a lower price and we're looking more in like the 70 thousands um for that vote so the acquisition of what allow the city uh to perform and dress uh maintenance issues in the Intracoastal Waterway um Clearwater Harbor the one of the out of this program or whatever um one of the major components of our maintenance that we we struggle to get to is the stormwater outfalls we may change 46 outfalls throughout the city currently 14 of them have the check check valves um right now we're on a monthly program to get to each one of those check valves and clean them out uh we struggle staff struggles getting access to Roosevelt's mainly because we have to cross over private property to which of the valves so uh depending on when you're talking about the tides um you know for the opportune time to get in the water drop a lot over sea wall uh we have to get in contact with these residents to get permission um rather than just go on their property um Lewis would enable us to get to these hostiles in a lot quicker fashion it was last budget year um I purchased a small John Boat which is um it was about six hundred dollars we've been using that as a Last Resort when we can't get on the private property get to the island Falls it's not exactly the best but it it provides us an option um because we have only a saltwater trolling motor to use to get um to these alphas and you know you have to travel a decent distance from uh from the way you can actually put the boat in and that's only a battery powered motor so um increasing accessibility and also we have several um yeah that do not have which I found them they they have oyster Barnacle building up in them um typically by the time you know we need the jet clone jetpack the valves they've already we've already seen backup um it's happened a lot on Bayshore Drive so it would be a lot easier than getting around and doing our inspections and keeping up with the limit valves need to be cleaned um as opposed to just waiting for just the signs of problems uh next week's issue uh the boat would help us enable any of us uh to address is the boonies um we have currently we only maintain 16 uh breeds that we put in on the beach side and then we have roughly 10 on the Clearwater Harbor Side [Music] um from Thailand which is down to the Anchor but oftentimes the the buoys experience issues before um you need to replace the whole components like the the uh lying down and the angular system a lot of times I don't know if it's um vessels that are colliding with these buoys but they they break down and they have trouble staying buoyant um currently on the Clearwater Hardware side we'll put in seven and we're and it was less than a year ago on his last fall I think we got him in and they're already experiencing issues and a lot of times but if you have just an issue with with a buoy itself that's that's something that we could just pull up and switch out before the actual anchor line goes um another uh maintenance issue that we're facing right now is the signage for the slow speed zones on the pilings those exist predominantly on the south side of the city but I purchased eight new uh list signs to be replaced um it was a request of residents who live on the water what I told them was that I would replace these signs the last time I replaced the signs um it was actually a resident who asked the application and offered they took me out on their boat to do that um I told the president who was making who was losing the request that I would purchase the signs I wrote them when we had them but I stopped to coordinate a time with somebody with a vote to get up and change them out [Music] um and the useful that would be the dark and sea level inspections the docks um and lifts are frequently failing throughout the city and by the time we're made aware of them it's usually been at least a month and there's other there's debris in the water um this is something you know especially with the docks that we could keep up with by um you know visible signs of uh you know falling apart being poorly maintained before they get to the point where you know we get a some high winds or wave action to to push them over the limit um I don't know where the sea Wells who have had since sea loss but I think in concert meetings three to four years ago we actually had a seawall on Bayshore we've rolling this collapse um you know part of that backyard just went in the water I mean you know that's not a good thing uh I'm sure upon inspection there were very obvious signs that that Seawall was going to fail um the idea would be for uh staff to Menards or just I'm not saying that we would have an engineer on them but he would be able to identify audience signs of of concerns with seawalls to be able to take pictures and relay that to the city engineer their opinions um another thing we could do with the better would be the uh South Island um which is clear back there um from City Hall it attracts a lot of people on the weekends that has a accumulated tables chairs and a lot of garbage um there's been fires out there from what are people I don't know if they're cooking or if it did it on purpose but we've actually had a table start on fire on the island and there's also uh you've seen the American flag and some other flags from time to time in some sort of hard to describe makeshift flagpole they've erected on the island um every once in a while that you know American flag is great but we do get political Flags out there I tried to address it one time it didn't come back um but it was not easy to do um I got myself pretty wet in the process of trying to hop off the uh Japanese boat to get to the island take the flag down um that's something that I think everywhere we could consider actually because it is I've just actually putting up a real cycle and flying an American flag and you know and keeping what belongs out there there and what doesn't out off the island um another thing would be that um like I said when the docks fail sometimes it's uh contractors not doing what they're supposed to we've had you know 20 plus foot pilings floating around the water uh people see them immediately call us concern that it's complied with their boat or their Dock and our answer is well we really don't have a way to address that you know if they if it comes in um to an internet panel area which we had last winter um we can get close enough to get in the water and actually tow it over and hoist it out but again it's it's difficult and we've had trees that were down and off bridges that were just we didn't have any means of pulling those out of the water um we get out there on the beach side and you know pick up all the fish that are on the beach it's not only the beach where those fish wash up they wash Up all In Between the uh Clearwater Harbor channels and uh they don't come right up within reach they kind of just float around and smell and people tell us that they're out there and again not much we can do we try to reach them with with skin nuts but if we had a boat that we could you can also take it out and provide a quicker cleanup for the residents um it's a something degree that's out there we've had people hit uh sunken concrete family sort of Shoals and and they've lost or lower units on their on their Motors um if in the very least we can load paintings we could mark them uh so that there was uh something to show that there was a hazard but we also would be able to pick a pump out that we would probably jet them deeper into the wall into the bed of the the underwater so it doesn't it's not as easy as much of an obstacle um and then it's come up from time to time we have these narrative vessels um we you know anchored out there um the sheriff um does their best at reporting stickering them uh but we also could monitor that so we could have a little share in trying to keep derelict vessels that are not inevitable and just floating around like the sailboat that came loose and floated into the bridge tried to stop that before it happens um the corrupt performs usage in my mind would be two bi-weekly patrols per month to address these issues but it would be those would be routine and then there would be maintenance projects um depending on whether we're working on buoys or um calling stormwater valves around Falls I have done some research into the boat club and around all options that was brought up at the last budget Workshop um just to run through some things for the um is it the uh not like trying to remember the USI boat club um freedom freedom yes there is a startup we um the program where we would probably be interested in is the Monday through Friday program um the startup fee would be 3 000 and the fee on a monthly basis would be 349 and that would um you can have a boat from as early as 7 A.M to Sunset depending on the time of year um just it's roughly about a 20 minute drive from here I did look through the models available at the closest club which is at the Clearwater Marina um and they do not have the grip models that we're proposing to buy um so in even the bottom of the and the the Hall of the boats it wouldn't really be as uh usable in in the waters that we'd have to navigate through but I mean it is an option to consider and um the other thing I believe um we'd have to consider possible damages for using it for maintenance purposes and I'm going to do some research on the Clearwater Harbor we currently have 350 watersound homes on the Clearwater Harborside and that makes up of our single-family homes roughly about 45 percent the taxable value of a single-family homes um on the water make up about 63 percent of the total taxable um value of single-family homes they they make up about 44 of the total City taxable value and of the total homestead tax value homes um the water sometimes actually make up 64 so it is almost half the uh single family moves half the population you might say that is um living underwater if you count just as just the homes or not the Condominiums but most of the Condominiums are not homesteaded properties so it is interesting that that those waterfront homes do make up a significant portion of the taxable value that comes into the city the this uh Coastline of the Clearwater the Total Core science city is about 7.5 miles and the Clearwater Harbor makes up 6.65 of those miles in our beachfront is about 0.85 and just to put that in comparison we have about 7.25 miles in city streets that we maintain and I believe 2.8 miles of pipe for our stormwater utility um another interesting thing is if you just prepare the [Music] um the distance we invest in a re-budget a savings plan for fifty thousand dollars for our tractor for our beach rake we primarily primarily use it to rake the beach and that's usually about four to five times a year um and again the beach front um makes up 0.5 miles we have a lot a lot of intercostal Coastline that we are also responsible for and I just wanted to kind of fill those numbers out there just for you know comparison thank you very much uh very uh detailed information um Council uh let's start with uh Leslie nataro I'm all for purchasing a boat for the city I think it it makes sense to deal with the property in the intercoastal and the beach and the Waterfront there Lloyd Roberts um I'm also in favor I think sometimes it's difficult to always cost justify an asset acquisition sometimes there's just work that needs to be done and the cost of the equipment or asset to do that work is not always going to be a scenario where you say by buying that piece of equipment we save this much money I think I don't think Kyle would come forward with this request if he felt like this is an asset we were going to purchase and it's just going to sit somewhere and not be used so I'm I'm comfortable and confident that that Kyle is comfortable and confident that it's going to be used to better the city and I'm in favor of it Miss Livingstone I only really appreciate all of the information that you've provided us today I saw the um posts and appreciate the time that you took to explain the reasoning behind that I support you 100 and you gave a very valid information thank you Mike Sable um great question um this will be the trailer boat and store here on our site yeah so we primarily shared um except we were using it we were planning on using the following day for whatever project we may use the uh slip one at the marina not rarely but yes it's uh most of the things that we've seen here large expenditures have all been concerning flood prevention safety um our beaches and support of our taxpayers and frankly the spell is needed we need to maintain our Avenues to prevent flooding we need to provide for the safety of not all those on the beach Beth Arizona Harbor uh this is Neil and it's extremely well Justified thank you very much it's a lot of detailed work and it really what every requirement as to why we need this I'm definitely in favor of obtaining the boat vice mayor Shirley so I agree I'm very much in favor of it I think I initiated the savings and then I came back to you Kyle and said I don't think we should save this over the next five years I think we should buy it this budget cycle especially after um having conversation with some residents and so forth I have been one of the residents that has um lent my boat to the city on a couple of occasions we've talked about for many many years how we can't maintain the waterways we can't maintain the things that we need to do we are on a Barrier Island and we have to maintain those Waterfront areas and so many times there's the reason City can't do anything because they don't have a vessel to take care of the problem the um I've been involved in removing Dead Sea Life with my vessel calling out the Clearwater Aquarium letting them use it I've let the city use it we've been very involved in trying to keep our Canal clean and safe because we don't have the no wake zone uh signs are missing things like that a lot of the no wave signs that are missing on the south end would be beneficial because the manatee just love to pile up out here the you know there's a lot of things that are outside of Resident needs that are also just Wildlife needs that we're not doing anything about because we don't have a vessel we've spent a lot of money on infrastructure but we're not able to maintain it all and without this vessel you can't do that um I'm sorry if there are residents they don't don't understand the concept of what we're trying to do here but I would invite any Resident to phone me if they have any questions because I will walk them through the reason we need this we've spent a lot of time over the last 10 or 15 years trying to take take care of deferred maintenance on infrastructure and we don't want to end back up with that same problem we started with when we started this storm water project so I am in total support you have my support on the on purchasing the vessel sooner rather than later thank you very much I'd like to thank the city manager for uh shedding some light on this topic uh he actually bought some items to my attention that I was not even aware of whenever I was trying to think of what would we do how would we use this boat um if you take all of the benefits that that uh that the entire city receives by having a boat to help maintain uh our drainage the check valves uh the red tide issue because we all hate whenever that happens um looking at at the eyesore boats if you remove all of those things and say this is only for boaters this is only for people that live on the waterfront well everyone in the city needs to realize that approximately half of the people that live in this community are voters we are a boating community we do have water pump property not everyone does but we all benefit from it we have a boat ramp right down the street that anyone can use and I see many of our residents using that boat ramp so it's not just Waterfront people so just removing all of the benefits that help maintain our city and and just assuming that oh yeah this is just for boaters just for Waterfront people well it's still half of the city and we owe it to whether you're half One Way half the other if you live in condos if you if you live on the beach whatever it is we owe it to the city to maintain and take care of all aspects of this city and I'm sorry that it doesn't openly appear to benefit everyone in this community but I am 100 behind your decision uh to ask for this and I will support you all the way all right do we have any other comments or questions for the city manager concerning this topic do we need any special vote to go forward I mean we've already added it I just wanted to go on public record uh and and and get more of the story than just what's being bled out on a social media uh which is a lot of it is incorrect it's disinformation and it's confusing our citizens so uh you get any questions please direct everyone to come listen to this recording all right absolutely all right thank you very much thank you okay now we're going to get right back on track with item number one uh which is discussion of consideration to reduce the city council from Seven members and five members I placed it on the agenda uh you'll notice that I also included a page of data which shows the uh uh populations and the number of council members or Commissioners uh that are on all of the uh these cities or communities uh in Pinellas County as well as the uh the the Pinellas uh Board of County Commissioners um you'll notice that we really stand out uh for having seven council members uh they're overall it's seven there's uh four I'm sorry four seven member councils and there's one nine member the nine member uh is the city of Saint Petersburg they have over a quarter million residents um you look at the smallest above us that's the city of Seminole they have seven and they're at nearly 20 000 citizens um I I bring this to your attention because uh number one we're now having to face this full Financial disclosure report and I I know that some people are are not going to have any interest in running again I'm very proud of this Council and and I think that uh this is this is a great group of people and I appreciate all of your hard work but I also understand why you may not want to run again um whenever you're in some sort of uh some form of government and you're not having to answer questions to your next door neighbor um because uh you're discussing matters that they have little concern about it's probably not as big of a deal so the people in Tallahassee can make rules like this and it really has no impact on them because they were already doing it whenever you get down on the municipal level uh we're a little more of an intimate environment you know your neighbors but you don't know all your neighbors business and this is just another tool I believe to to disenfranchise us from wanting to participate in municipal government so I the last thing that I would ever want is for us to have or this community to have a council that elected seven members because they didn't have a choice because there were seven people out there and that was the that at any given time right now it's four or three depending upon which election you may have one good candidate you like and there's three more and you don't know anything about them but you have no choice you have to vote for them and that's the last thing that I would ever want for our community I only want what's best for our community that means we need enough candidates to where we actually have a real election instead of just there you go there's your there's the four people that stepped up I hope they do us right um I I believe that our community deserves a choice um so um by eliminating two council members that's going to tighten it up a little bit and I believe that it will uh overall it will streamline the meetings we won't get caught up in in uh sometimes needless discussions where people are just wasting our time I think that we can reach a consensus easier I think it's easier to have a conversation and reach a consensus whenever it's a smaller group no not everybody's always going to agree but whenever you look at all of these communities all over Pinellas County they all seem to agree with me that five members is way better to work with than seven or nine on on a small scale such as our city is so that's why I'm proposing that we um that that we seriously consider uh reducing the number of council members and uh and now I will open up the floor for discussion uh Lord I'd like to hear your your opinion on that thank you um I agree 100 um I've tried to Think Through why I could support seven over five and I cannot think of any legitimate reasons to do so all the reasons you express just about by making the most sense in addition to these numbers that you provided I think it's I think it's a no-brainer I think all four of the issues that you brought up it'll be interesting Randy so that I kind of view this as a blank piece of paper that we're starting with so we said okay we are talking about and discussing these various options so at the end of tonight however we have felt as a group this blank piece of paper is not going to be populated then the next question is and I think Randy's going to be involved with this you know how do we move from where we are now to this I'm sure there's a very valid answer and and process we can go through to make that happen so that'll be the neat part I think at the end of the day but uh I'm definitely for it thank you Leslie I think I'm for it yes compared to these other cities we're not that big that we need seven council members may I ask what um what made you change your mind I think looking at the other so I was surprised at how many of the cities have only five members very surprised at that okay any other comments yep all right Miss Livingstone I'm in agreement with fine that's it that's it given the data um I was in agreement prior because we're in such a small city um I think five is a good number but given the data it speaks for itself so Mike Sable um I got to tell you I came out this like a devil's advocate first of all is but I'm going to look at the whole line here I was one of the people on the charter that said yeah we've got to have the term limits but it can't be intransient about that I wanted I thought every single thing so look how can I justify seven how can I justify that the term one that's the election Cycles everything I I couldn't and that was kind of the indicator of these are solid proposals I mean going down from one yeah I agree down to five members places Us in cities basically from us to much larger cities I agree moving to four years for the uh terms I agree with the term limits from two to three and foremost aligning the election Cycles David nailed it here I mean a total agreement with it you put it Forward really can precisely and frankly we have to deal with changing infrastructure of what tallahassee's doing we have to maintain home rule and you've piloted us in a way that we could still maintain home rule yet still have vibrant elections a Vibrant Community so we're all done I agree with you thank you vice mayor Shirley well since Mike just moved the meeting along on the topics um no I am definitely in support of reducing the number of members on Council I don't I don't know how we ended up with seven and you know I think it's one of those things you start the process and then it just becomes habit and you never consider changing it so with the facts you provided I don't I can't justify a reason for us having more members we have so few citizens that are willing to step up and it's always a struggle to get people to fill those seats no need to have extra scenes if we don't need them and I don't see the need for it thank you very much I've already already made my points on it um I I tell you before obviously there's there's four uh core points bullet points on this discussion really they're all tied together but before I go to Mr Mora for uh for his take on all of this uh what I would like to do is is go ahead and take each one of these one at a time so if you don't mind let's stay just on track and and uh some of them actually go hand in hand but uh based upon what I heard from Mr Moore we had a conversation about it these are going to have to be on a ballot separately if they if we actually have citizen support and decide to to actually take this to an election so let's uh let's move on to item number two and that's discussion of consideration of extending uh council member terms from three to four years Again by me and my reasoning for this I think all of you have heard it over and over about how we have very little clout in the county we we have friends in the county but as far as having long-term relationships um uh it it just uh we we need more time uh not only that but this this one is actually uh kind of a spin-off of the of item four which is uh to align the elections and it's the only way you can do it you can't align the elections without doing the four years but um uh I think that three years is is uh if we have good candidates three years is not enough time for good candidates uh I would I would give anything to have this Council as is uh for a total of four years but we know it doesn't work that way but just think about how much progress we've made and uh and and how well we're able to get along we're at we have civil conversations and even whenever we strongly disagree we're able to work through it and and reach a consensus so that uh whenever uh our regular meeting occurs where we vote together even though we you know occasionally we'll have one that's uh you know one or two that's one way or the other for the most part we already know how we're voting whenever we get there and that's the way a good council is supposed to work uh so uh that being said uh let's uh move right on over I'm going to go this way this time let's start with vice mayor Shirley so we're discussing extending the term from three years to four years correct I am supported that okay Mike Sable I am in support that this living Stone and support Miss Notaro yes Mr Roberts I am as well I mean and you already talked about the link between two and four because obviously if you have three years it's an odd number you can't combine that with the even numbers of the midterm and the general so it's the only way to do both of those makes sense all right thank you very much and we'll just move right on over to item number three which is uh this one's a little tougher uh it's discussing uh increasing term limits from two terms to three terms again this goes right back to building those relationships um I've seen that there's it's kind of scattered all over the place there's two year terms three year terms four-year terms uh but because of uh where we're trying to go I think that we still run into issues by the time you get let's just say on The Big C or or you get on the Suncoast League of cities and you start representing yourself uh if you're in usually you're going to be in your second term I think the city is is pretty much learned let's not let's not elect a mayor without learning who that person is so the first term you're here you're building relationships in the community the second term you go out and you're you're on these mayor councils and you're representing our city uh on a bigger scale and now you start building relationships there well that third term is what's missing from actually getting the job done to where you can uh now you have pull in the community and and uh you you have people that are more willing to work with you because now they know you and they uh uh they they have they have respect for you and they're in the same boat you are there we're all trying to accomplish something and and the way you do that is you have great relationships so I'm going to start on this living Stone this time on item number three I'm in agreement a woman of few words Mike Sable okay I drew directions just about well a few of us were on um accused of using this as a stepping stone to County to state to Federal elections and it can be flying from the truth what this does is it enables the sitting Council and mayor to actively work to protect the citizens by working locally none of us fear of running for State Council nothing we just want to protect the community and this is really the best way and again I told you I only wanted the two year and I'm voted for that that with the changing conditions I now believe that this is the best way to adequately and proactively and protect our citizens and through with their cause you know like I said The Big C went to the county so again we're all done I'm definitely in favor of this thank you Mr zabel vice mayor Shirley this one I'm not in favor of because it can give someone a 12-year span on Council which is what we were hoping to get away with by um putting the term limit in place so if we extend the term from three to four years then it just puts someone in that seat too long in my opinion so I would not be in support of it all right I will withhold my comment but I will come back to you I understand why you're asking but I just anyway Mr Roberts I'm an agreement and and obviously even though we're saying we want to increase it to three terms in this case ideally three four-year terms the individuals still have to run for election because they still have to be voted back in so if they're not doing a good job I would like to believe that the citizens of our city would take care of that issue that's just my opinion on it there was a time in the city when no one stepped up to run for those open seats so I'll just uh yeah and your comment to miss Livingstone I'm sure you know her husband which is why I do know a few words I hope he's not listening he is I'm sure yeah Leslie um I agree with pleasure about increasing the length of the terms and increasing the term limits together at the same time you know I go for forever the other but not both all right thank you uh and uh so my justification for this is uh is twofold um obviously um extending the term from two to three I think that that's a requirement to continue building the relationships outside of our community I know that for a while we actually were just sort of here and really didn't have we didn't have much of a relationship I'm not saying we didn't have relationships but um I even today as hard as I'm trying there's many times where I feel like I'm just beating my head against the wall and and but someone who's been in an additional term is serving their second term as mayor they actually seem to to get more of a voice they get more cool with the county and uh the County Commissioners are it seems to me they're more willing to listen to them uh and and ahead of myself however where I am quite the Barking Dog at times and very annoying and I think they're all starting to figure that out um so being forthcoming yes you're right this would take us from uh a total possible possible total uh from six years in office to a total of 12. it's all possible again I'm worried about the number of candidates that we have if we were staying at a seven Council uh and opened the door for 12 years I would I would be very worried but I think that by reducing um you you take away some and then you give some and I think that in my opinion it would be the best mix for our community but um if it uh actually makes it to an election uh I guess the citizens will decide one way or the other and that's why uh Randy said that these would need to be separate issues Mr Roberts yes so you know that I do understand the direction you're coming from so what if as Dave said if we go from seven to five so the elections um every two years would be three people and then two people if we go to the five correct so gosh I'd like to believe if let's say we go with a three-person election and there's somebody in there that's not doing the job properly that we could find the city would have at least one person or two people that would step up you know at that point you know I think that was proven the last election did that happen so um but I hear what you're saying if nobody else was running and the city felt like the current candidates that were running again for their second or third term I just can't imagine them sitting by the wayside and just letting that happen I hope so that's that's my thought on it but I understand what what you're saying there but that could actually happen with just um two terms thank you Mr Roberts any other comments or questions okay so uh right now we are at a four to two um any other comments that you would like to make vice mayor Shirley okay Leslie the others okay all right uh so now let's move on to the last one which is uh item number four lining or election Cycles with the general and midterm elections um going back to what I said about uh sometimes you don't get a lot of a love from the county I did reach out to the Board of Elections I sent a nice email requesting what would be our savings what would be the process uh what what would happen uh what would be the benefits or the pros and cons of switching to being aligned with the uh General and midterm elections and unfortunately I got crickets but I I know for a fact we've been told in the past that uh there's uh savings I don't know how much it is but it's a because they're already running an election that goes to everyone in the county uh it's much cheaper just to tag along on a big uh a big set of ballots rather than the smaller ones I did look at the the election dates and how many communities are aligned with us and it's it's sizable but I think overall we would have a better turnout because everyone votes for the president and if if it's heated it doesn't go well and uh the midterms are all around everybody still goes to the polls and they vote so I think that we're going to have the best turnout if we align on elections uh with a general and midterms and uh and then that goes back to the uh the four years it would just simply simplify things for us uh so uh I'm open to comments I'll just uh anyone raise your hand if you'd like to speak on that one this sort of becomes a shall I say a debt issue if we don't go from the three years to four years right that's right it's out of the question if you don't uh change to four years yeah I I think it absolutely makes sense my only question would be logistically as an example so we have in March an election coming up correct okay so changing the charter we would have to have these items during that election correct that election or a following election again we're we're opening the discussion and having a debate on it and uh uh and then I would still encourage everyone if we decided to move forward on any one or all four of these items to uh to reach out to your constituents and see how they feel about it so far I've had a very positive feedback concerning this uh uh this matter they see the writing on the wall with what Tallahassee is doing to us and they think that we'll be able to defend ourselves better if we continue moving in this direction so just just following that process then so in March that election would take place for how many of us four or three I guess three this next one is three is three so three individuals would be elected and they would be elected for a three-year term um there I'm gonna let Randy yeah start addressing it we sort of we sort of touched on it it's not an easy path but it's doable yeah that's what I'm hoping yeah all wonderful questions um a few challenges to note in the process you're talking about four separate ballot measures at least at this stage these four um assuming let's say you I don't know that we've reached consensus as the last one yet but let's say we we get there as there has been on the other Street what I would do procedurally is put together an ordinance calling for the special calling for the election and it would State whether it was at the you know I don't know that we'd be on a timeline for a November election yet if there's um you know if there's one to be had we would likely be on the March cycle which gives us more time to figure out how it's all going to work out but ordinarily when you do a resolution or when you do a proposed Charter amended as ballot language you do an Evidence calling for that um for that especially for that issue election and then you do a separate equivalency resolution setting for it the actual battle language which has to be limited to something like 75 words or so um and uh and then from there we also have the remnants that says okay and it's been approved and so be it the language that in Acts it the challenge that you have here when you talk about the four of these is for some of you you're like well I I like the idea of one and two or one and three we don't know what the voters will do ultimately any Charter amendment has to be put to the electorate the electorate can take one and not the other and then we'll have to adapt accordingly um provided that we don't make these things you know conditional and so you know for example remember you're talking about changing to seven to four we may have ballot language that suggests changing our seven to five but changing seven to five and other such necessary revisions to affect this change so we fix the core and element we're not going to put a specific thing just for the Quorum number but so that it all is is consistent so a lot of your questions run depend on what the what the electorate does and ultimately moving forward how we excuse me how we very particularly say okay does that mean we have to make this operate so these two seats that's the details that we'll have to figure out as we get closer to determining precisely the ballot language um and its function so I'm not in a position to sit here I do want to alert the concerns of any um view in public or casually observing members of the public that the consensus at this work session is simply to move in the direction of putting a measure to the voters the charter cannot be changed to work session it has not changed tonight I know you folks have sometimes had to deal with an understanding on the Civics process I want to make very clear that all you're agreeing to is to have things put before you for your later review to affect these proposals for the voters to vote on and that's what we're discussing tonight as far as the specifics on what every single measure would say I'm waiting to get some guidance from you and I think we're there now on which ones are approved and which ones aren't but then what is their interplay and how to what um in the if then statements do we need to put in this to make this make sense yeah does anyone have any questions for Mr Mora so let's say and and I hate to use um scenarios that are fictitious so let's say John Doe runs for uh uh a Council seat in March and at the same time all four of these items that are affecting our Charter also on the ballot and they're all approved so let's make that assumption so then the general election happens in November just your your gut feel with those um those same three people because in this case it would be three that we just elected John Doe Bill Smith and Don Johnson they're all in now in my glad to see Dawn good as praise yeah that's right so now November comes up would that make the most sense for all three of those people to run again to be tied into the new Charter guidelines it's a good question I think the the more narrow part of your question is what is the effective date of these changes and I think that's part of what we would need to resolve as we look at these does it make sense much in the same way that you have a charter provision that says the you folks are available to vote on a raise but it shall not take effect until two cycles after right we can say and as you look at the language here and you can see what year it was that they started to make this change to um you know seven members on these terms because they have on three year term times because in the three-year terms provision section 2.02 they start laying out these terms will begin in 2012. these terms will begin in 2013 By 2015 everybody's on the same schedule so clearly in the last 15 years roughly your community has already done a version of this yeah and so the effective data element is going to depend in large part on what you folks decide to do and we'll have to look at what does make sense if we do we might have to have the ballot language is not going to lay out chapter and verse the decision true of what happens okay we may have to have you know if this measure is approved this cycle if this measures of this cycle I'm not sure I have to look at how we would do that gambling this isn't something communities do all the time if it gives you any comfort I'll say it's very impression of you to be looking at some of this and a lot not on this legislative session but in my last legislative session one of the preemption bills was to force all municipalities to move to the November cycle I mean there was a lot of resistance because of how different communities have you know evolved and keep their their process going but those kinds of discussions are being had and it's proven to evaluate if that's something your community wants to do proactively but how we make that work it's one of those the devils in the details and I'm not in a position right now to tell you if somebody's elected in March how they would do that we would look at things like well who's who is the next step to cycle off we tier it that way there's a whole series of ways to do it and that's not where we're at yet but it's a very good question it really just gets down to effective dates of what we of the actions taken okay thank you so it would be like shall we beginning in 2015 transition the council to a router let's say explain to it right now beginning 2027 shallow the council transition to a five-member body or something like that and that we make that kind of thing clear and uh just to add on uh what Mr Moore just stated or or a total uh or just said uh is that it could very well be that uh the last Council on the seven member Council they may sure uh they they make their term may be a little bit longer than what it would originally have been or it could be that on whichever cycle it is that it falls on they could be a little bit shorter but it would be something that uh that the council would have to agree upon uh because we'd have to write an ordinance to actually be able to address this so it's a it's a single-use ordinance that once uh the transition is made it would be accepted by all that okay maybe instead of three years uh you're three and a half years or something like that or maybe you're two and a half years just to make everything line up with these General and and uh midterms okay all right any other questions or comments no all right um obviously we still have some uh some some things to discuss and uh and determine what you know where we would like to go but before we do that I highly recommend that uh you do you go out and you speak to the public and uh and get their tape and see uh where they stand uh are we wasting our time is this something that will never pass or is this something that uh most everyone will agree agree upon mayor before we move on and perhaps I'm jumping the gun here I don't believe I I got Clarity on the individual members positions on the fourth proposal for aligning with the midterm Cycles I may have just missed the member Siemens but I think we were just answering if we had if we had I think everyone's in agreeance but we were just answering if we had okay a question it helps all the questions I just wasn't sure if that was indicative of us I think for the most part that um we really unique on the increasing term limits from two to three right and uh and and I totally understand why uh but what I'm hoping is that uh if once they uh once everyone goes out and they speak to the community uh we get a little a little more opinion and we see if we're still on the same page next month whenever we have the next work session understood thank you everybody okay with that that's interesting okay great my last question given the posture of you okay there's a general uh industry to move further but we're going to you know talk to our constituents and see as a function of action items for me should I start preparing documents ordinances Etc or should I hold off for now with an understanding that that's a likely Direction but let me ask if you're just thinking about it is that learnable I don't I don't do that yeah um if I lose a whole night sleep maybe I'm talking about if you actually want me to put keystroke to computer pen to paper um Rhett that's give us a little more time we think we're there but we're not sure I just I wasn't I I think for the most part of the council is uh is on board with this okay um what I'll I'll just ask the council what are you what is everyone I think we should move forward with ordinances given the amount of time some council members have remaining um and it's something that's high on the priority list to move forward so I think we should move forward so we're not wasting time and that gives us more time to say this is what it looks like we don't like this we do like that so I have no problem doing it I just want to make sure I'm not doing work that you don't want you okay well in that case uh uh what may be what what might not be a bad idea is beyond what we've we've written right here um maybe some sort of a uh a pathway how do we get from here to where we'd like to go to uh something not I don't want you to spend a lot of money on it but something brief that we can actually show uh show the community hey this is kind of where we're going right here and uh and what's your thoughts I think that that would be very helpful I can I can do that I can do a sort of a white paper summary of it the mirrors you run out of one thing will have to be mindful of as we get to a ballot measure is the city's inability to advocate for the results of that um ballot Just as a friendly reminder as the statutes have changed in advocacy um for official City circulation we could say purely factual this is the ballot language this is what it would do but I just want to make sure because we do have some newer members not everybody may be aware of that you know now this is where I'm a little uh a little confused are we allowed to actually once we come to an agreement as a council is that where it stops with trying to come communicate to the community or are we allowed individually are we allowed to go out and speak to our neighbors and say this is what we're thinking about is it as long as we're not on City time in other words in this meeting or we're in City Hall uh is is that are we pretty much free to speak as we'd like individually generally speaking yes would I prefer just because it's been a moment since I've seen the review the electioneering statute um I was very familiar once it was adopted in 2022 I want to revisit it on what that looks like I can tell where electioneering Communications are you know Divine by Statute it goes into limiting what that looks like and can't I just want to make sure I will provide you folks supplemental guidance on where that line is I think that will be a critical part of this process as well all right I appreciate it Mr Roberts you had a comment or a question just a quickie on page 202 of the document that um Randy provided for us where it says discussion of increasing term limits from two terms to three terms that highlighted area at the bottom I've actually read this before and the same thought always comes up I think based on the language I know the answer but I just wanted to clarify it so as council members including the mayor shall be prohibited from holding office for more than two consecutive terms without any additional language there that kind of tells me if somebody could go to consecutive take a break come back to too consecutive is that what the intent was yeah it actually was it's harder yeah it was right and the reason why that came up was that um we you're you're forced to take a year off right and the next election you could now get on the odd cycle if you wanted to come back okay okay but you you're required to at least take one year off and then the citizens decide whether you they want you back or not correct okay that makes sense for instance any other questions or comments no all right Mr Moore I appreciate all your help and uh Council I appreciate uh you giving me time to uh to run through this all right now we are on to item number five which is discussion of Marina rental policies this is placed on the agenda by council member zabel uh Mr Xavier you have the floor okay thank you um my task basically was response to the mayor Rusty's the mayor's outline regarding three easy three uh size zones you know basically large medium small um and factor that into working a waiting list for the marina that could address individual boats in those areas trying to balance fairly the interest of um resident owners uh non-resident owners residents Etc trying to try and balance it throughout the community um I set this out about a month ago I haven't any updates uh to this I just want to know if you have any updates I mean I'm free for updates you want changes Etc foreign I would be willing to uh to just let you go through it's it's not a very long policy and uh I I it's uh relatively early I have no problem with you just going line for line right through it and explaining uh uh what the changes are and uh and if we have any questions on each one absolutely um obviously really the first one is David issue if I can do those are purely uh administrative um what we wanted to do was provide a procedure to address the Marine Iranian list and how to do this fairly background slips west of 90 to 19th hoop and links from 24 to 50. and that provided the basis for the three zones the large medium and small now the procedures um with the city and these are my updates we're splitting the waiting list into three separate zooms and they're determined by the slip size a person Desiring a slip and make the decision as to which zone that fits and places themselves on the list that allows you if you own you can say I want the 19 foot boat slip so I put my name there I can't put it on the smaller or large I just got it on a medium there but it also I don't know is the pressure to go it might be really small there's the rifle so I want to watch okay because later on we'll address those are going to go you have so much time to put a boat put it into the slope if you've been accepted now you can't move from one zone to the other once you're in that slot large medium or small you stay there that allows others to population say medium and small we don't want one person taking up three slots that could be a little bit wasteful of the time and it works against other citizens that are just like you again trying to be balanced now the list here the B if you're renting a slope of the city you have to fill out the main wait list form obviously the risk form is not under arrest but the detail of the road obviously your address phone number contact information whether or not you have about what size is the boat what size of slip are you going to be requesting again Richard at least very large mean and small are you intending to place yourself in now like today we'll have uh we're going to see on page two by December 31st we're going to aggressively you know confirmation of Interest we want to make sure that this list is current and upgraded we want to make sure that we're going to send you a lot of state and you're still interested you still want that large you know if you maybe change your mind well if you remove everything from that that risk you haven't gotten yet yet maybe move it up to another station you're going to be at the bottoms but now you change your mind you're going to go to the bottom of the following list it allows people not to be bypassed now we get into a little bit of the detail here you have to and when I addressed it before about you put your name on the list without having to move you're holding by signing over to documents that you are able to obtain a compliant vote where the 90 bills of accepting the offer of a slip so they run I get the phone call I had placed myself on the smaller wrist thinking that's all I'm going to get everything [Music] my aunts died and left me considerable moving money with English no you can't do that you have a you're underneath this for small you can't move around so you're going to have to obtain that vote to fit into that small slope that your name was in well you only have you know one move away and complete the transactional city hall I have a comment on this yes I'll go ahead Mr Roberts I was going to ask the question so what would be the downside of not having to stay at the beginning what size boat you're going to have if you don't have a vote at all because I would take the place of somebody else that might already have a boat and is waiting to move their boat right now into a slip for example if you signed up for the large your name is Alvarez maybe you're number two now and your name came up but you couldn't get that boat well that's unfair to number three so we have to move number three yeah curve off the list because you have decided not to accept that well that's why you really have to narrow just one of those lists down that some people in fact most of the people that'll be on this list will already have votes and that's an assumption I made and try to construct this yeah I'm just thinking yeah I don't own a boat yeah but you've already got your eye on something and you and you uh you contact me and say well we have an opening just based on where I am in the list uh and it's for a slip of this size so therefore you have to have a vote of of this size well you already on the wrist at that you've already picked one of those three what I'm saying if we did if we didn't do that you're not on the listen you got to pick up you got to pick I'm sorry don't if we don't approach it that way of requiring somebody to pick a size if we didn't do that if it's just a list of people that are whatever the order is and then we're giving them the flexibility of choosing a boat uh I mean even if they had a boat already they might even have a small boat but now they're next up on the list and they may say well I got this small boat and your example of the rich ant so now I'm gonna I'm gonna sell that boat and buy a bigger boat because the bigger slip is now available you're not on the big risk only those people on the big so you're forcing you at the beginning to gate yourself into one of those three gates that's my question why are we forcing them in here a little bit uh number one um okay you suddenly change your mind uh because a 40-foot boat is available but you that's not what you planned on and you you actually whenever you put your name on the list you're sort of thinking logically okay well um this is the size boat that I think would be the most practical for me okay but also uh I'm perfectly capable of handling this size boat yeah whereas certainly he realizes there's a 40-foot slip over there that it's coming available and he can just jump over there and get to the front of the line um and so he goes and buys a 40-foot boat that he's this he's not he's not rated and he's uh probably not qualified either okay um you can go all sorts of ways with this with this uh uh conversation uh but I think that you if you're going to lease a slip from Bel Air Beach you probably need to know what it is that you want to put in that slip in advance okay I think that that's I think that that's fair and it also uh create more opportunities for the residents because now we've got three lists instead of just one list but you know everyone's going to have their own opinion uh I just thought that that was uh the most logical way to do it okay yeah and like you mentioned earlier you said you're assuming that most of the citizens already have a boat probably a small percentage of the people that are signing up I'm assuming most of them on that list have a vote yeah and and I will almost challenge you on that I'm not going to challenge you on that but I'm very close and I'll tell you why yeah there are people that don't have votes in Bellar Beach because they have nowhere to put it and they don't want to go down there and put it in the high and dry and so they don't have a boat um but if a slip came open uh then uh they're going to want one really bad yeah maybe hit you right there we already put that into the warning War so sign up for those you don't need a boat yeah I was just making a remark I mean I guess most people on the list have those but yeah you're totally Hitler we just have 90 days but which to put a boat that matches that large medium small into that slow okay and I'm also going to challenge you on the 90 days and the reason why is the bigger the boat the harder it is to find one you can find big boats but to find the one that you want you still got to run a pastor marine surveyor yeah and uh and that's why I was actually okay with the six month uh to give give somebody time if you wanted to buy a boat in Mississippi it's a big deal to get that thing here but sometimes that's where the good boats are at yeah you know instead of just here I'm just saying they accommodate big boats that's up to the council and uh and so I was okay with 180 days just because of the fact that it may take you that long to find one I think even with a little 24 foot fishing boat that we bought um it took us probably four months to actually decide on that boat with the one that we have now we ordered it took a year to get that thing and so um what I would have to do is knowing that I had a boat coming and I had nowhere to put it hope that that it opened up and then put my name on the list and I'm still gambling on the six months uh so so you want to move it to I would say 180 days would be more realistic question can anyone you get to pay rent through 100. yes you would pay rent yeah deposit with this application they're submitted get on the list off the hand I don't know what's on the uh I don't have the oven for me there's not currently so they're not putting any money in they're not putting any skin in the game I think that's a problem no no that's to be on the list if your name comes up and you have signed up for the largest slip that we have well then you have to start paying rent right then and there and you can keep that rent that slip empty while paying rent the whole time for a 280 days but that's the only way see that's the luxury of of being able to have a slip and look for a boat this is my point if you can just add your name to a list all over town because one day you hope to get a boat you're going to add your name to lists all over town and there's no requirement to put a deposit which I know it might be created accounting nightmare but I'm just saying there should be some skin in the game at the application I see what you're saying so put put some cash down just to uh yes okay I'll put that up I'll put that number like that and then yes then once you accept the slip you start painting yeah yeah like I said you pay a rent and it might be the time to put the vote with now you know I know we're trying to make it black and white but I I agree with you if someone doesn't have a boat sometimes it might take a while to get one but it's still we're back to now we've got a slip open sitting empty for six months and you got all the residents that want a boat slip so it creates this appearance as though we have open boat slip so I would just be cautious about playing with that too much um I don't know you know I don't know if you get into a review process if it's a big boat or if it's you know I don't know I'm just saying typically if you have a 20-foot boat you can go down to yeah bring Max and buy a 20 foot vote right exactly it's the bigger ones that are harder it's the bigger ones because they're so expensive right I mean they're all expensive but I'm just saying they're very expensive and it's hard to find the right it's hard to find the right combination yeah I would be on for the uh the deposit however I I would because we're trying to make sure that the marina accommodates our residents I would be all for the deposit provided that it's applied towards the first month's rent oh yeah yeah earlier their application fee you called it application fee well yeah what happens if the person who's next up in line who paid that fee now says never mind we'll give it back to him they don't they don't get it back they don't get that okay whenever they're if they're offered the slip and they opt not to take it then they would not receive their deposit not refundable deposit however you if you sign up for the slip that deposit is going to go towards your first first month or whatever you can pull out prior to being offered to slip and get your deposit once your offers that's it all right I gotta write that down hold on um I think that makes the most sense otherwise you're back to Jody's concern which is they're just going to sign up yeah and the list becomes useless I mean it doesn't get the deposit back and if you're concerned with the length of time maybe um the smaller the vote the less time so maybe 90 days on the smaller ones and 180 or something like that on the large ones yeah it is it's very difficult we uh we shop for a big boat for a while and never could actually Risha consensus in my household okay so uh also some more meaning and might be very large and again I'm using these interchangeably with a large 180 days I would say so I think that that's fair okay as long as you're willing to pay rent and uh the one thing that that I would challenge you on or or suggest is that whatever that size slip is that they're reserving we need to have a default rate which is probably maximum whatever the maximum footage is for that slip if you're going to have it empty for six months that's the way I understood they're going to go Max they're not you're not going to get a different rate to within the small category of anything from one foot to 20 foot it's all 20 foot you're you're it's three separate prices not 20. or incremental by 400 square footage it's three separate prices that's the way I think we were planning the worst case scenario so let's say it's the 90 day right so they've been paying for 90 days their deposit went towards the first month they're paying paying paying paying they still couldn't get the boat so then they get the bad news you're out that's what it that's what it uh that's right what I'm reading into this right that's incentive come to Kyle and you beg and please for the next month I hear the engine is on a container on the water it's coming I don't think there's portions of it at the bottom of the Atlantic right now so we're doing 90 120 180. 90 91.80 what is again 90 for small medium 90 and the large is 180 days I mean obviously we got a this little I gotta redraft this send it back out to you all any changes and then obviously then it goes forward into the account then we start voting on it but I'm trying to get all your inputs right now yes hey delete all over this thing okay let's go into the selections now then now this is what there's going to be some differing viewpoints now Bellar I'm going to give you five minutes and then we'll take a break all right yeah I was gonna say this is getting deep when you get into a yeah we don't want to get too far in the weeds here all right so uh let's take a break let's uh resume Etc you know they're all good yeah this is on both my whole life and Panama this is what I used to do for a living in high speed at night that's a boat with a seal platoon in the back yeah if you win yesterday run across with a microwave all right everyone now 7 30. and uh we're back at the work session and uh uh Mr Sable you have the floor please continue thanks okay maybe some discussion here um again remember I'm trying to look for the front of creating opportunities and fairness and balancing the needs of the various types of uh citizens Bellair Beach residents that have their own home slope are not allowed to register for this list that will not be considered for placement at the marina why because obviously they have access it may be a smaller book than they want but we have to allow other citizens to have access to that Marina and it just seemed kind of unfair I got one of my back and if I registered there now I have two slopes I have I can put two boats or so it doesn't make everybody happy but at the same time it makes everybody unhappy so we're hitting the Mill Road and I say something sure I don't agree with that at all okay and um I'll just use it for instance if you are in the and I'm going to use Dave's lot as an example if you're in an inverted uh you know eye shape yeah a lot then you may not have enough room to have a big boat and if there's a slip open for a 50-foot boat what's the harm if you get on a list I don't I don't see where that matters that that homeowner is paying as much if not more taxes than a home that doesn't have a slip and I think that it should just be across the board available to all homeowners period great thought but again it goes for I guess opportunity um those that do not have their own slip in the back have no soap in the back this is the only possible access to voting and again it was trying to to cross a balance here but um I mean I'm going to go forward with this graph but if you want to I guess common one gets further up for him or changes you know we could address it yeah and there are some Lots in the city where they have a beach behind their house and they can't put a slip in or if they do they have to have a cat walk out to it and creates issues with neighbors and I know of one resident who helps us quite a bit that I know that that's a problem in his backyard and so yeah that unfortunately that argument doesn't work because I said slip if you have a home slip yeah well I'm gonna put a slip he's limited to the size of the boat again no he doesn't have a slip though well he does have a doc out there he does have something out there I don't know how exactly I don't know if it's a beached or what they do but I know it creates um that might be definition time if we get into that but that's what I was trying to go out for you know it's not gonna it's not going to make everybody happy other comments on this particular section but yeah we're going to get into it like yeah just my gut feel and again I'm not a broke person now I have been but it sounds like we're creating a rule that's that's handling citizens differently just because they happen to live on the water that doesn't seem fair that's a good point because we're going to get into differences a little bit later on and then it really is going to get into the weeds so yeah keep that keep that in mind um I said I'm not trying to fight for this I'm trying to like say provide a worldcat here now had no time running household regardless of how many homes the applicant may have you may have three homes you only have one registered at the marina no more than one yeah you get that that's it again can we just please stop and just stay focused on the very first sentence sure uh because uh uh two council members have valid issues with this I'd like to hear what the others have to say Leslie I tend to agree with Jody just because you have a slip behind your house doesn't mean you can't rent one at the marina how about it Belinda um I don't have a slip I have a boat that I don't want I have to use my house I'm sure my husband would love to have a slip I don't know I think it's um I don't think it's fair okay you wanna which way are they feel that it's fair because somebody has it so for instance we can fit a boat in our yard but we can fit a certain size but which we have well if my husband wants to trade in our boat for a larger boat heaven forbid say we did have a slip that prohibits him for trading it in for a different size boat because he wouldn't have access to a slip I see I think it's kind of using myself as an example even I don't live on the water but putting myself in somebody else's shoes that just limits your ability to get a bigger boat if you want one so you are against this first sentence right so what's the thought of I'm assuming that right now that we're going to look at remove at least up to placement at the marina uh from civil assignments or well I'll leave slips assignments are prioritized remove dollar Beach residents have their own home slip are not allowed to register for the list and will not be considered for placement at the marina yes yes hold on I'm also acting secretary here okay so I'm going to delete that cool now at no time or any household regardless of how many homes the applicant may have in Beller Beach have two or more votes registered at the marina so that allows the case where if you have a slip at the house you get in the big boat you're not violating that it's only if you have attempted to have two boats at the Marine Eye correct okay and I think moving forward if anyone has issues with any one of these just speak up otherwise just let them keep moving right along okay I'm keeping liquid okay Marine is a scarce asset this is background we're trying to ensure that all Belair Beach citizens again very distinctive here have the same opportunity uh now priority tree uh I was given two constraints one was size small medium large next was really uh who is allowed to hit this list first of all is resident owners now these are full-time residents that also own their own Bel Air beach home they're voting citizens that own the house that's evidenced and this is a rough take Card voter registration copy of their ownership document you know hey here's my mortgage here's my voted registration yeah now you're Priority One priority to resident non-owners these are you know Runners long term they have a voter registration again these are people that actually vote here I heard comments about well we're shaft but again you know non-residents well you're not a voter here I had to make some stipulation that that's where I came down third non-resident owners these are people that obviously home I got a home in Tampa I live in Charlotte um this is the third they own the home but they were elsewhere somebody that is in that house probably right now um that is frankly they're paying the property taxes I don't think anybody's gonna owners are gonna hand over property tax so and they are active voters in this area so that helped us the turns them into that Resident non-owners and finally non-resident non-owners still last on the priority list we're trying to take care of the voting citizens in the block so you know it's an attempt to try to make that any thoughts I have a question Mr Moore uh looking at the priority tree item one resident owners versus resident non-owners um constitutionally uh do you think that there's a possibility that that rule could be challenged that's a weedy question I would say that does the possibility that that could be challenged come up absolutely um I think that's true of anything especially where you're starting to make distinctions within your own Community further still in this particular context this proposal is contemplating divisions based on those who are registered voters if somebody's unable to be a registered voter for some reason I know that we're in transition on the law and felony convictions and the like um but otherwise that that can lead to challenges I am sensitive to the dynamic that we have in a lot of our Barrier Island communities where it used to be that your resident base made the majority your year-round resident base may have made the majority of your community and that's shifted substantially in a lot of communities especially those unlike here where you have short-term rentals permitted as an industry and I recognize that's not the case here but yes I I do think that there's a potential for a challenge there I haven't specifically analyzed it I've analyzed it for another community in the terms of access to Parts um and saying you can't come in this you know if we have better Beach Park oh you can't come in this park because you're not a resident that never is allowed public parks are long recognized to be Public Access there have been permissible distinctions on resources within parks and saying well these gazebos are reserved for property owners who have paid in um and there's some Authority out of Road Island on that but there is a potential for a challenge yes I would have to get into more with more analysis would there still be the same opportunity for a challenge if it were um a state issued identification such as driver's license or just a an ID issued by the state uh generally that means you're a full-time resident of the State of Florida and that doesn't mean that you're here full time but the majority of the time if that's where your driver's license is at then more than likely you're here more than you are elsewhere would that do you think that that would be possibly challenged less of an issue you know I want to make sure I understand your question you're not saying because obviously student ideas is routinely used to validate the identity of somebody you're saying the eligibility decision tree here would be you would have priority if you had some form of state issued identification from the state of Florida is that what you're saying it shows that you are a resident of Bellaire Beach okay that shows you a resident of Bellaire Beach um I've not specifically analyzed that issue of course communities make divisions all the time I'm just I'm reticent to opine on constitutional law issues this on the fly as I was looking at this primarily from an administrative standpoint and and not that that is something as we look to develop this policy I'd have to look into I'm just not comfortable issuing a blanket statement like that right yeah I'm with you yeah and I'm not comfortable with differentiating between resident owners and Resident non-owners because they all live here can I just say I this is how I look at this one property one slip um I just don't understand the resident non-owner you know of the property owner applies for the slip I don't I think that property owner should should be on the list I don't think and it's up to the property owner not a renter to come and rent a slip if the property property owner wants to be responsible for that slip because Runners come and go you think they're going to be with you for a while and they're not you know things happen um I think it should be limited to you get on the list are you a property owner yes okay you can get on the list you gotta choose your Zone pay a deposit that's it I all of this these different tiers and all of the these complicated um trees just don't it it doesn't make sense to me and if I own a property that I use on the weekends in Bellaire Beach and live in Tampa and I want to get on the slip rental list I should be able to I just don't I'm looking at it from that guy who has a weekend home in Beller Beach it's probably paying a lot more money than any of us sitting around the table in his taxes because it's non-homestead and he has every right to get on that wait list as any one of us do and I it's back to property ownership should be the only criteria it's awesome I mean I've looked at the and I'm playing Devil's Advocate at this point but they're not of ordering this community doesn't matter and I know there's a lot of condos that are you know people live in Tampa and we have a beach front property and they you know if they want to run a slip I don't see the problems only from my limited experience where communities have attempted to make as it relates to access to City resources um where they've attempted to make the distinction between their permanent residents and their property owners regardless of legal challenges that from uh from a community feedback standpoint those those have been some of the more divisive um debates I've seen and again I've not got to the point of legal Challenge and a court opinion on those but I can tell you that those tend to be the more contentious hearings where people start saying I am a property owner I pay more in taxes yes right these are the voters I I think the both of you are really encapsulating a microcosm of a larger dialogue that's being had in our communities and that gets that can get divisive for sure anyway going back to the documents and uh the way I built it I could pull this out I can take the prayer I could take uh paragraph B which is really we just don't even get into the discussion of it well here's the list you already have or going to buy a boat you're willing to place a deposit um should we put one exception in theirs I understand non-resident owners et cetera but if we have and we have this currently a non-resident non-property owner somebody from Tampa that just wants to get a slip we put a Prohibition against that or allow it or or should we and again this is priority listening should we place them above a citizen down here in 9th Street that doesn't have a celeb Etc I think we already decided that non-residents non-property owners are bottom of the list no matter what they I think we weren't even going to take applications for a while is what we talked about okay so I keep that okay now hold on so Jody which one would would you think is more comfortable property owner a non-property owner a resident because property owner period and then you know if you're a property owner yeah you can get on the list I'm not even going to have I'm not even a place that I'm just gonna go to the altitude here's the prohibition so I have a question so if we're using the term property owner and then what about those individuals that rent yeah that's that's I like what Jody said earlier about one application per address that way you leave it up to if it's a home for instance it's between the property owner and the renter but if it's a condo it's an address on its own that person has that right to to do that so that's why I was taking this approach is um this allows condo owners or residents or anything to get this like the old there's just a Prohibition and they're just saying that if you're a non-resident non-owner you can yeah it will put you but it's going to be at the bottom of the list everybody else if you rent if you own but live in Tampa you know all the combinations yeah and and I see I see problems both ways what personally the way that I feel about it and uh I know not everyone's going to agree but there are going to be people who will abuse this they're going to be living in Tampa and they only come here every six months they're gonna have a big boat taking up a slip and it's never going to be used and you're preventing someone who actually wants to use their boat they're going to use it often monthly you know bi-weekly whatever um I will always um I I appreciate everyone who's invested in Bellaire Beach but I will always give preferential treatment to a resident over just somebody who happens to own property here um and that's that's my take on it can I can I ask how often do these slips turn once or twice a year so out of all the slips we get one or two openings we're spending a lot of time on this is it that big of an issue in the grand scheme of the whole city no yeah I've had had comments in the past on why wasn't my I've seen other people get both slopes and where was my name Malik that's kind of how we came to this yes Mr Robertson Belinda brought up a good point which he said earlier and it made me think so let's say I own the house but I have a long-term rental with Jody so she I want to vote because I own the property and I'd like to keep my boat there even though I may not live I don't live there obviously because Joey's living there for five years so five year lease on the house and she wants a boat because she does live there so who gets the boat I think we just said Jody born earlier is like the argument would be I pay more taxes than anybody because I'm paying in Tampa here so therefore the owner is really the one that can do it we can't extend this uh well actually they'd be at the bottom if you're a runner well you're at the bottom with that non-resident non-owner well if you own five homes and you're renting them all out you're paying more taxes in than anyone is but you're also making sure that um someone who lives here is not going to be have access to a slip well the right place that was uh at any time any household regardless of how many homes the applicant may have in Bel Air Beach have two or more boats registered at the marina that was under a I was trying to catch it there yeah and I thought I agree with that because I think we've encountered that situation what we had yeah my feet yeah um Boardwalk let's get through b right quick yeah all right what's your what's your proposal now that you've heard everything oh I'm going to delete the whole section all I'm going to do is put a Prohibition in there basically just saying non-resident non-owners their last on the priority list non-resident what non-resident non-owner okay does everybody agree with that yes well there's no this priorities or just that okay it allows me to fit easier into the rest of the document okay waiting list it's going to note don't apply for size of the vote hold on one second yeah and that's where we're at currently is that right non-resident non-owners currently the resident list um where the distinction is gone is if you get the opportunity to rent a slip if you have a driver's license that has gone on a beach address you get a resident rate you don't you pay at the taxes you pay more okay because we do have non-resident non-owners there currently we do in slips yeah um so back down okay run C waiting list let's go to node Zone apply for size of the boat proposed by the applicant um I'll remove priority status and and then obviously we're going to that list that's going to have the application fee and the rules with the application fee uh we're going to sort by Zone and then I'll just remove that um just list will be sorted by Zone as they occur okay City checks which of the three is located for that zone is consulted slip is offered to the first on the waiting list because you've obviously you've already been paying the you pay the deposit person may decline but if that occurs the name is removed from the waiting list offers inmate to the next on the list and so on until the slip is filled I mean just that makes sense um priority um actually this may be removed I hit priority will be given to run to the slope to the largest size in the lake vote I can safely be accommodating so you know I think we should remove that because that throws away all the the prior page I think that was supposed to be uh stricken yeah yeah perfect um for example you put your name from small you want to go to medium start at the bottom of medium you can't use your number two and medium to go to number two alarms so priority is the time you got on the list that's it uh now the rest of this is already in there about with beam of the boat we don't maintain or assume responsibility um you know obviously like the only thing I added on that section was the city assumes no responsibility for the state and operating condition of the left I just wanted to make sure hey I know just wanted identify that's it current we currently May remove yeah but is subject to inspection I'm updating this okay but it was again but is subject subject to inspection by the city because it's just going to be like looking at all the other docs you need to be notified and it needs to be correct that's that's in our uh agreement hit myself is this something that should be covered by code so I mean you're doing an improvement on a property do we I mean think about just say don't not for tonight I'll just it came up with my thoughts well currently we have an addendum to the agreement if you want to use the lift and you agree that when you leave you no longer rent a slip you remove the lift okay I I just yeah but the only way that we allow it to stay is if you make a private agreement with whoever's coming into the slip that they'd help they take over the ownership of the left okay part of this modification probably should strike that because our current if I'm reading this right this is where you didn't modify the language where it says that uh and and that's one thing I had there was a lot of words that weren't consistent like we call this the less the uh lessee I think is used here and up here we call them someone else something else so we're not using the same word uh for the person running the slip consistently but is that the agreement of the code this is the code the code okay yeah it says FL at least it's a slip with a lift already installed and wishes to use the lift the lessee must maintain the lift and complete working order um and then we added some language if you take it it's not the city's responsibility but probably all that should be stricken if we you're not going to allow them to leave their lift behind and the code that needs to be taken out right yeah I would ask Randy's opinion I'd like to have the agreement reviewed it hasn't been reviewed a long time yeah and it um it would need to be approved by Council because the code says the agreement needs to be approved by Council okay I'll just I'll leave that there but we'll just keep in mind if that's going to go through approval but I'll try to make it clear everybody's changes into this send it out and Kyle remember just the point I guess were okay at the next one okay all right Mr zavel I appreciate you uh working on this and I'm sorry you didn't get past the grammar police like that happens I say that's okay no no no no that's what we expect so it's all good um okay another fun one all right uh so now we are on to item number the sandbag reroute I like that I just uh you know I've said that we're not using it we're we're not using being consistent in what we're calling the lessee we call a licensee a lessee there's just quite a few you might want to look at look for those I have Masters in software engineering not this is an idea this is the code this is exactly no it was prior to your your okay that's it all right moving forward we are now on to item number six discretion of sandbag station proposal uh again this is uh council member zabel you have the floor Roger okay uh the original Professor was trying to move it to the north of the city but we're looking at it and said you know let's place it here you know keep it where it's at but how can we improve Ingress you know getting into it getting out of it and one of the ways and maybe proposed is I took photos is we have a dead end right now they call the sack and instead of filling your same day and kind of getting caught trying to turn around and going back out near the route which potentially blocks traffic Etc we use this potential exit uh it is between two buildings it's between City Hall and that substation I guess from Verizon and there's enough room apparently it's about uh was it I said 23 foot something like that uh width which basically can accommodate a car so if you were to throw up at the station you come to the end of the cul-de-sac take a left you can considerably drive out through that way and then exit out onto um basically the front seat hole go left and then go to your house that eliminates backup traffic problems uh the only thing there needs to be some changes there and they would mean basically we have a place there for cigarette butts a trash can and more importantly there's a bike rack if we could remove that bike rack place it elsewhere we could use that Alleyway only for you know they'll use this during weddings Etc this is only for the sandbags right as an exit route um I think we had enough again distance uh you can see my photos later photos uh where that black car is parked it actually is not a curve it ramps down it's part of the handicapped access so it's just a ramp so you wouldn't be banging your are exiting with sandbags right um and during that procedure obviously a couple of those parking places would yeah blocked off yeah yeah throw some cones out there yeah I think it makes sense what's your thoughts I mean you're saying that's 23 feet wide yes I thought I put it yeah I believe it was say 23 or 12 and a half 12 feet 4 inches that's what it says it's um but it increases once you get past the uh the downspout and the uh the little Cylon right if you want to remove those it gives you 12-4 yeah so a drive the lanes usually what 10 feet is that right Mr engineer uh uh it depends what it is in the city I'm just kidding I don't know Boondocks County freeway no I don't know yeah Parker spots 10. so it gives you room you know including mirrors and stuff even if you bring a truck in there you're probably okay and you also have people back there going you know slow down okay I want you to go here and you know we just have traffic there's someone there's always somebody direct traffic through yeah but I I think it works it seems tight when you look at it but yeah yeah and again the only thing we have to is really remove the bike the trash uh and if you wanted to you could always remove that pile on and redirect the downspout but you're getting 11 6. it's Livingstone are we going to ensure State safety the rest of the time you have these weekend folks that come in they park over at the beach and then they see this open Alleyway they're going to just zip right on through there never mind the fact that we've got kids and families that are playing at pickleball and running around riding their bikes in the parking lot how do we ensure safety because we're removing all of the we're just making it an invitation for folks to ride through there I wouldn't zip on that road uh you're asking for damage because it may look nice and smooth but you're going to have to go kind of slow through there and I believe that's actually a curve to get up it's like that firm right I'm just talking about your average person non-resident she's here to have some fun at the beach isn't thinking Zips through there has had a couple early rather than removing that Bollard I would leave that there and make sure we install them on each corner but then you put them then you install them just like on a bike trail like they have on the bike trails the bollards that are removable so yeah so it goes in a sleeve it's there all the time yeah unless Kyle removes it okay you can do that too but I mean that's a good yeah but I think to protect the building so if we do get the you know one person that can't see and driving a car a little too big you know a guy not myself so it protects the building so we don't have they're gonna hit the pole and that I mean it's a little investment but it makes sense too I think it's more of an investment than you think it is and I'm going to tell you why well Airsoft I'm not I'm not opposed to this idea that I want everyone to be aware of what it is that we're actually wanting to drive on um this is reclaimed water that's reclaimed water and that's sewer okay that's on uh where am I at here uh right there on the back side if you look on the front side in front of it there's more reclaimed water there I don't know what else is under this but I'm afraid that loading cars down with sandbags and driving on this may actually cause damage um also once you've opened that Pandora's Box people are going to try to use it which by the way there's a there's a water main right there and somebody's going to turn in and run over that my point is is there's a lot of Plumbing under this and once you open that Pandora's Box you're going to need some way to block the accesses until you want them to go in there so now we've got we're gonna have to put up some kind of walls or blockades or or uh I can't remember who mentioned the uh the removable Block Orange whatever bollards just things to consider because I the last thing that I would want to do is uh uh create a problem even worse for us for Verizon and they come after us because we uh we ran over something important so uh I think that we would need to do uh more of a study to find out exactly what all is under there would require a site survey I'm also worried about if the county requires any type of if they have any special laws to actually creating an Alleyway if there's setbacks involved um uh and if it requires permitting so just all things that again I'm not against this idea but I just want to make sure everybody's aware that it's not just a let's start driving cars through here and it's going to work because I don't think it will yes um I see a problem come through in their left unto Causeway Boulevard that's not a an easy way to go all the time that I mean that traffic can be terrible to turn left and we're going to get a backup um and I also I was thinking about the Verizon do we need there I'm assuming we need their blessing of some sort if we're going to do this because that goes back to the initial thought that what I was striving for putting the sandbake station at the very North because you're already for the citizens of that street you're blocked because the last storm it was more than a 20 minute wait and moving your way down now you have a basic Street we already say no parking well you're parking people are trying to to slowly evacuate not worry about a hurricane evacuation but should not block that side of the street they have people coming back you're either having trying to get in so you're including a backup on golf get in but now you still got a problem left and right onto golf which is difficult too so we're trying to again there's no optimal solution we're just trying to provide another way to to allow those citizens easy way to egress having those citizens come to fill the sandbags and get out easily and not tie everybody up and you know going back and forth in this cul-de-sac so again I think the best is nobody really loves the idea which means that we're sort of in the middle right now see if we can work out a good way is hey yeah do a site survey you know nothing says we have this it's a proposal I have another question could we set up a secondary sandbag station you know we don't need this that often but in the parking spots over here um so it gives to I mean I don't know how um that I'm speaking completely from ignorance because I didn't participate in helping people stand back or any of that but I'm just going would it make sense to have you know certain addresses go to that addresses go to this one and then that kind of solves some of the problem because it allows half of the residents to go there and have to go here I was going to recommend it again it's like you could have one down here for the South because too often I gotta say this the north is disenfranchised it's always South South well one station up there in the marina parking lot so condo everybody's easy up there you can get in and out regardless I know it's a hurricane evacuation but it's not operative operator it's easy to get in and out people go up there and then South can come in here that way this Street's not over taxed we don't have to use the the rod in between the buildings and it's kind of immediately balanced because now I can easily the north can easily get their bags because they're not fighting the South residents and the South residents can easily get their bags too we just need the only addition is really you have to add another series of fencing up in the marina and against the wall where you're storing all the equipment back or can we just use the parking lot here for so you have two access points I think the left-hand turn on the causeway is the biggest issue I really do especially if we get close to people are beginning to panic and they're wanting to leave I think traffic's going to get pretty heavy and it would it would be a bad scenario if there was an accident and then somebody would say why'd you guys now I I I'm ashamed to say that I had a business to take care of whenever the sandbagging was going on but realistically what was the what was the traffic problem because we have a we have a cul-de-sac here and yeah they're coming in and out of the same street during that time but was it really back up that bad or or was it just a nuisance because there was a lot of traffic it was backup and in which way and that's for me that's it's the backup obviously coming in okay so which way was it backed up and how far backed up more it was backed up to at least golf at least when I joined people after me were actually on golf taking the right into it uh you really couldn't take a left into it we really had to kind of come around and to get into right now that just happened to be the time I came you know because I was a volunteering stacking sandbase but it was back up to there so now you have basically one side of the street cars issued forward and you only have that one exit and that I mean I was trying to move it North because people in that street trying to leave you know you may be trying to back out but now you got all these people kind of in line you really kind of wait it's not critical I know but that was the only drawback okay so currently the sandbag station is on the left side of this street right here is that correct is there room at all on the right side did this one for traffic well what I'm saying is is there room to actually move that that station to the right side now the reason why I'm asking this is not it's not going to solve The World's problems but I think that it would help and the reason why is because it creates more room to stack traffic you they're circling around the cul-de-sac and now they're right there so you've probably added 20 cars of space by just putting it on the opposite side of the street next to the tennis courts and then you're bagging on the way out yeah instead of on the way in I'd have to look at where our property lines are I mean you got the way it retention bond is everything kind of drains that way you gotta notice I mean that was their work in it you have multiple fills it's not you drive up my car is really no what it ended up is car car car car all these families bailing out now the car in the back is being you know there's cars here being filled filled filled people running back and forth as they could fill so if we were to do that now you're kind of doing you're still blocking it again because you're you're not just doing one card at a time it's back back you're just gonna block it no matter what but what I'm saying is you've at least added more footage of allowing the cars to stack up it's it's uh I don't think that that's a you know an end-all uh solution but uh just that alone would probably help a little bit as far as the second uh the second sandbag station up north um where where do we get our sand from and do they have a problem dropping it off in two points no it and what we faced last time was a capacity issue which I think we're always going to have if the storm kept coming towards us it would have got worse yeah um I think we would always no matter if we're facing a serious threat we're going to have a capacity issue I think some cities they have um like a protocol um it gets to a certain point this is what we do and there's definitely a cut off point given the situation um it may be something where we realize that the main sand station and then once we reach a point we're we're backing up and we opened another one and then yeah an overflow yeah don't worry about a fence we just dump the sand there and you just don't understand and really at that point you know you got it my you gotta try to keep monitoring that the residents are using it um you know not taking more than 20 you know but really if you get to happen here Road cross-tracking arrests and I don't think that's everything North and South so you guys station here you got a station up there juice either one yeah either one's attracted early it it happens there's no access problems either way then sure I think everybody's you know ease the traffic and uh uh I I think moving it all in one place or the other is not the best solution some of it up there some of it down here and uh and I think that we've done the best we can for our community wow yes I would agree with that because before last year it will function fine um but we all now forget something that actually comes at us it's a whole different situation that was scarier yeah yeah are you okay with that just adding a second sandbag station and how the hell is that man by the way yeah what would you do for Manpower up there all right here is always welcome the more and I liked your idea last you know Season we talked about getting volunteers on the list yeah that really did help us and volunteers directed the traffic like we just don't have the staff for when it gets that bad the previous side I didn't catch away to volunteer with the people basically they come in and look the parties you'll get your sandbanks first cool that you're gonna help serving that in some cases deliver sandbags maybe just people they they refuse to leave I've been here five thousand years and it's trying to help them out and currently is the uh is the marina and is there a good spot you've got in mind we got we got a room um right you know we got underground material in there now but we could still make it work if we had to it wasn't important to contain the sand uh is there a price tag on any of this I wouldn't go as far as building another container I would just if we're going to open it up we're just going to dump sink it's kind of like here we we had a pile just outside the box before using them you just need those four things okay uh well I think they face good at any other comments Mr Roberts I don't know if you guys have seen the Flex Seal commercials seriously I bought something the guys they show a house and and the house is under three to four feet of water and they and they developed this Flex Seal tape specifically for flooding and they do the bottom of the doors and the side of the doors and the windows and they flooded three to four feet of water completely around the house and not a drop of water came in wow I guarantee you the sandbags that is not going to be the case three to four feet of water around your house your house is flooded in a short time periods yeah it's coming through the sandbags coming in I'm buying Flex Seal this is the sandbags they're they're my rotten gutter the sandbags other than making you feel really good about what you've done um really it's to stop the blowing sideways wind from going under the door and that's about it yeah yeah I'm reinsuring my house we'll see all right any other discussion on the sandbags before we move on to General business 816 I think we've done pretty darn good yeah all right do we have any general business I just over the edge I don't get the changes out to you okay I appreciate it um it wasn't somebody else yeah barbecue"
