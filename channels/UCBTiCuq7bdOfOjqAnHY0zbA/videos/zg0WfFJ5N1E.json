member leslie ontario your acting member here vice mayor david davis mayor joseph manzo city manager lynn reeves here city attorney your salesman here okay thank you very much um first item of business is to approve the agenda do i have a motion promotion which is my frank van gaard second second my dave gaddis discussion i need to move the uh and i've discussed this with patty and we need to move the uh item nine out of the consent agenda there's an error in the minute so we'll move that to nod nine plus will be number nine which is gonna move to the right okay any other changes citizens any changes on favor of approval with the change i mentioned moving the consent agenda hi all right you want to post that's the 7-0 the agenda is approved it's the first time in the business is the citizen comments and uh i'm kyle i'm looking straight at you i understand we have a guest next from the florida league municipal uh insurance just if he's not here so just waiting to be when he is so we're gonna take three out of order but right now we're going to item number two which is citizen comments um i'm gonna keep pointing over here even though it's not here anymore it's right over here the podium uh anyone who wishes to address us they have three minutes please come up state your name and address and then address the council would anyone like to address council i see a handbag here [Music] good evening everyone uh andrea 119th wall street um i somehow made it to the agenda tonight so i feel like i need to speak to it i was campaigning on february 14th i was going around the neighborhoods and placing informational campaign cards and doorways i was approached by a neighbor and he instructed me not to knock on a door so we had a brief discussion i reassured him that i was not knocking on doors i believe it was an elderly neighbor that he didn't want me to disturb after the discussion i moved away from him he then kind of positioned himself in the crossroads so that i either would have had to go through him and around him or engage again which i chose not to do i felt like he was maybe watching me to make sure that i didn't go to that house and i'm a responsible citizen if he asked me not to because i wasn't going to but either way i felt extremely unwelcome and i felt that i really wasn't able to campaign properly that day and that's my concern thank you all so much of confronted by a neighborhood in the same area and he was kind of aggressive in confrontation with us and was very welcoming and was just telling us now he's not going to make it forwards but the same thing said i happen to have a um aggressive dorm film adventure she's not an aggressive adventurer she's just a small 50 pound little black lab mix of some kind and uh i was actually probably about 10 feet away almost towards the other side of the street with the dog she's actually i'm actually in the process of doing making her my hair job for me and so she's not confrontational she's not aggressive or anything like that so he was more confrontational with us and trying to stop us from doing walking and he was not yes so the occurrence first occurrence was on monday and it was on howard and it was a um resident mr lusk he approached andrea and one of the firemen who were out on the street with us campaigning but they never said a word they can't the firemen that have been going out with us are just a second body they're not saying anything anyhow i come back from placing a sign on golf boulevard and i see mr lusk having a conversation with the two of them and it looked kind of heated like he was he was having a heated conversation not them so i pulled over to the side he started to walk back to his house he came back because he saw my car which stands out and he started to approach me and i told him i was not going to speak to him that i felt unsafe around the people that were campaigning for the other side so then he proceeded to go back to his house that was on monday so there was two incidents on monday and the third one was on wednesday with the same gentleman it wasn't until wednesday when we had to file a complaint with the sheriff's department because i thought three incidents was beyond what should have been and i just thought it might progress further so i felt like it was important for us to follow a police report and get it on the record in case something should occur or progress yes that was me they were talking about you all call the police i honestly as a ways to andrea my conversation well i told them point blank i love what they're doing i love volunteering i respect their candidate for volunteering the city for three years and then they asked me about voting and i shared my perspective on the last three years i feel as if they may have walked away wondering yeah why are we campaigning it had nothing to do with blocking or aggressive i actually thanked them they thanked me as it relates to the next gentleman i recognize him i never even talked to him i talked to a council member that came back to our house after knocking on the door 9 am ringing the doorbell they had a big dog and interesting clothing and i mean for the life of me i feel like i was set up for something but i think people in the city know me well enough i think my neighbors know me well enough i'll always step up for a 92 year old woman and say hey i've got a door that's the gist of it you can make it with what you want you file the police report i kind of reply with an email will then reach and i think i'll let that email send so thanks for a couple minutes kyle we still don't have our guests from the league of cities take item three and hold it off kyle he'll just wave your hand to me when he comes in we'll get him at the next opportunity time okay next we have against the bonner here we have our fire chief um good evening everyone jeffrey davidson fire chief for pinellas center coast fire rescue we're probably serving this in delaware beach i want to give you an update on the firing this falls here in the area the last ending february 28th we luckily we only had 63 firing ams calls in downer beach um excluding the downgraded calls we have an average response to your calls up four minutes and 47 seconds which is a pretty good response time we're happy to serve you the accounting standard is seven seven and a half minutes so four minutes to 47 seconds average is a good service to your community i wanted to invite everybody on saturday march 19th at 10am uh we are having our new fire engine will be there we're going to have a washdown ceremony and some refreshments and we'd like to invite the community to come and participate so there's some flyers over there on the counter and we hope to see you there thank you you should hang on one second see if there has any questions here council any questions i don't have a question i just want to commend um people that worked for you one of my neighbors had to go down with one they called me and went over to them you know i stayed out of the way where i realized with their pain and i was very impressed with their um level of knowledge their integrity and the way they treated my neighbor and it was a wonderful experience and nice to see you guys in action so thank you great thank you very much for for the feedback i uh rarely hear um i do hear them but i rarely hear a negative comment about canelo sancho's fire rescue and it's really unbelievable how many people send thank you cards they'll stop by in the station just to say our our men and women grow the extra effort to make sure that your needs are met you know even after the emergency sample just to make sure you have everything that you need so anything that we can do for you all please just let us down commend you and thank you also i mean number one that response time that's absolutely outstanding and i think the citizens need to remember that response time what we have now okay um i'm not i'm not sure i'm at liberty to discuss something you and i have discussed a little while back but um there's forces at work that could possibly change this and how they respond to fires and stuff so when the chief comes in and you read about how the trucks are going to be dispatched where they're being dispatched pay attention to that because i had pleasure of doing fire ops training and i thought i was in good shape and i could barely handle morning what you guys do every day you know 12 hours a day right it's tough work and mine was a simulated thing you're doing the real fire and real smoke it's tough and i will tell you this a minute two minutes needs a lot if you do fire up training you see a video where a room at three minutes is one thing and at five minutes you can't go with the room anymore it looks like hell it's all fun flames and the roof was falling so um seconds mean a lot in a response and you guys are fast men and ladies are fabulous thank you uh also very proud of our department for these that you don't know about one third of our department our service members and veterans including myself so i'm very proud of that department uh the men and women here are here to serve and we're happy to be here in bethlehem so thank you do you hope we have yours if there's any comments from the audience if they do we'll just have you step aside for a second as they ask you anyone want to speak with the chief yes mr hansen right up front here she just yeah just take two giant steps and come back to the mic thank you john hayes at 22nd street i'm questioning for the chief what plans if any does the pinellas suncoast have in working towards an iso one certification and the reason i ask people don't know about it it affects your property insurance [Music] if your fire department is ios iso one certified your premiums go down [Music] that's a good question john so that is one of the things that we are currently working on so um i hate to not look at you when i talk there so john's right so the isos the insurance services organization rating it's anywhere from a one to a 10 x um and basically they come out and they evaluate your fire department but it's not just your quality farm so 40 of your scoring is your water and your water department um 30 is your communications and your radio system um with the sheriff's office dispatch we always get the it's actually 40 points on there so we're going to get the 40 points on there and the rest is is not so much your training and your equipment the number of people that you put on scene how fast you could put them up put them on same uh and the parameters so we strive to put on a fire call the person you don't see in four minutes and the last unit on scene and of the first alarm within eight minutes and you're supposed to do that ninety percent of the time so kind of good that you asked that because one of the things i did want to mention is uh one of the things that we're doing is looking to move our indian rocks beach fire station further north in iraq's beach not into bel air beach but it would be closer and be actually be better response times than the beller beach which is why we're doing that so that's going to be probably a couple year process to do but we have some properties that we're evaluating and how we can do that um and once we get those things settled um we'll look at re-evaluating our iso evaluation and a lot of it has to do with record keeping and training records and inspection records and but mostly is response times and the biggest portion of it is your water system so we're working with the municipalities to make sure the water system is where it needs to be the hydrants have been inspected every five years and the flow testing are done they're marked they're in the computers all those things there's a lot that goes into it so it's a big process but that's probably something we're going to look at on evaluations done about every five years unless you ask for one sooner so we'll probably start that process in another uh year and a half and have it complete in about two and a half years but our number one priority right now is getting that fire station move closer so we can better serve [Music] and you can contact me at any time i'll try to if i don't have an answer i'll definitely find one for you okay i have a question for you i'm sorry i have a question i would iso uh well we currently are an iso rating of four okay and the best rating is a one there's a there's a very small percentage of departments that are actually a one um and like i said before the majority 40 percent of that score is your water department um so we have to make sure we work with not only bel air beach but uh better shores indian rock species indian shores and then an incorporated area so it's a little tougher to coordinate all those things but it is something that we're working on probably um so to get us to a class two it's probably something that we could easily do not say easily but with the work that we do and just documenting the work because that's that's usually where people lose their points under scoring is not that they didn't do the order they just did it documented that they did the work so that's the along are you problem that on to the taxpayers or where is it there's no cost for that house for your eyes of certification no yeah there's no cost and the things that they do the record-keeping is something that the lieutenants and the firefighters and drivers do on a daily basis and it's just making sure that it gets categorized in the right places and we know where to pull that data from so when we have fire calls they actually they don't want to see every fire call they want to see fire alarm and things they just want to see the working fires where you needed the 15 people on scene minimum and how fast you can get there so those are the kind of things that they look for like great questions any other questions for the chief okay thank you welcome here thank you on the 19th wow some people come in yes okay all right so we're gonna go back to number three uh which is a presentation from from the florida league of cities florida municipal insurance trust level two certificate of safety excellence that the city of bel air beach is a certificate for risk management's work 100 for the fmit safety excellence initiative mr representative i'm going to turn it sideways if you guys don't mind as well um first of all i want to apologize for being a little bit late i was at balor bluffs giving them their level one certificate so i had two meetings back to back so it was a little tight on my time um my name is trevor reshte i'm a safety nurse consultant for the florida league cities and i'm representing the fmit which is your insurance provider for the city um in 2019 we developed a process called the safety excellence initiative it's very similar to the iso audit that we were just discussing with the fire department and it's designed to encourage municipalities to create and implement safety management systems for both worker safety and public safety so i want to first of all congratulate the city for being the first city in the entire state of florida to go through the entire process for level one that was in 2020 and then just recently in january of this year uh you guys scored 100 percent on the level two so you're the first city to get level one and now you're the first city to get level two so that is an excellent achievement for for you guys and it's uh honestly it's a great model for other cities that are going through the process currently as well so congratulations here is your certificate level two thank you thank you for doing the program keeping the city set their absolute best and thank you for the recognition i really appreciate it thanks well and well-earned by our staff here kyle and lynn riggs okay i see three sheriffs in the back we're honored to have three on equally two are going to make the presentation but we have pinellas county sheriff's office we have law enforcement code enforcement whoever order you'd like to know well that's weird i can see myself in the computer good evening i'd also like to take this opportunity to let the fire department know that we applaud them every time they leave the scene also started switching with pinellas county sheriff's office i am presenting the stats for january of 2022 under the ucr property in person crimes i am showing one assault which was domestic related i am showing one burglary and four larcenies or thefts however in my research mayor if you remember we discussed last month's meeting the two that occurred that were unlocked doors at the condominiums at the north end of the city there were an additional three or four if i'm not mistaken that were reported after that meeting again unlocked doors and in this one there was a firearm that was stolen so again we cannot stress enough the importance of locking doors however in reading the report it looked like they were visitors from out of town so it's kind of difficult to get that message across to them and of course i'm sure it was an oversight on their part but through the research that's what i found moving along there were it says a total of five people however it was a total of five charges those were warrants the domestic related incident that we just spoke about and a driving under the influence which was also related to the charger while his license was suspended under deputy activity you will see that traffic enforcement leads that category directly followed by direct controls lastly there were there was one crash in the city and that's not including the one that obviously occurred i'm sure everybody's aware of that one that occurred right here at the intersection but the crash itself resulted in belair short and then lastly there were a total of 164 citations and warnings issued of those 134 work warnings 21 were traffic citations five were parking however i don't have the ability to break it down whether or not they were citations or warnings because you handled parking citations in-house and then four were voting and that's all there i um i noticed the january report but uh you know once again yesterday minding our own business and got hollywood movies coming through with high speed chases you guys are doing an incredible job you know safe under some really scary circumstances be a family member right opposite where that guy crashed and grabbed somebody out of the car they were at crabby builds yesterday when that happened um it's just amazing but uh you know we're a sleepy little town generally and they have these high speed car chases it's just getting a little scary it is and unfortunately i wish we could proactively prevent that from happening but sometimes it's reactive and half the time it seems like it doesn't even begin in delaware beach it's just a weird cut through area so sometimes it'll start clear water they'll come through here largo and neurons comments or questions for the sheriff is it a sense anything uh carjacking was that a minor or what was the age unfortunately i can't comment on it and the only reason i can is because i just came on at six o'clock and i just became aware of that through the newsfeed that we get through our internet so if you want i can look into it but based on what i saw i don't believe it was a minor i believe it was a mandela citizens any comments thank you sir thank you very much good evening mr mayor council members staff citizens uh steve klapke for the record just to let you know february uh was a very busy month and code enforcement um again still crack down on the contractors that are not pulling permits or contractors that are not licensed working in pinellas county working very diligently with the building department and the department of licensing we had quite a few more issues with people not pulling permits and i will tell you that again with the good working relationship that we have with the building department and the licensing bureau they are actually really cracking down i will tell you that on a couple occasions when i pulled up to a home where they're doing work first thing was we heard about you here's our permit and that's what we want to see again that's that's for the protection of the citizens of the city and uh again uh no real major incidents to report but uh again we're out there after we'll be uh going after these contractors and some of the other other code violations you know have kind of whittled down there was some citizens that we sent letters to that have uh responded and took care of their incidents so i think last month i had like 12 open cases and i think i'm down to two so other than that it's uh it's been a it's been productive and again i enjoy what i'm doing it's it's hard not to notice the step up in the enforcement on the permit situation so hopefully the word will get out if it doesn't get out need to watch the movie here or the film of this night and i mean you're going to get them i mean it's all over the place it's like every day you're getting people so definitely got to pull the permit if you need and laura for coming up with that new spreadsheet that works out a lot better so you guys can see exactly what we're doing and any incident that i come across i go ahead and log it in there whether it's a parking citation or a permit or whatever the issue is counseling citizens thank you thank you very much for your time the city manager we've gone through a few of the outstanding issues that we're resolving nothing of a great note to bring forward the council there's some resident issues that we're resolving looking at some other contract issues nothing brings forward the council at this point we will meet try to meet that as often as necessary i'm working on i would say probably three different issues anyone have any questions counsel citizens any questions for the city attorney thank you thank you manager yes mayor console this uh i've given you my report in the packet uh just a couple things this is a test operation tonight with the new audio and stuff you know the king south we're still waiting for um the parts to extend the wi-fi over here in this room uh city attorneys uh rfp is going out it's gonna be focused on by nine so it will go out this week and we've got two videos 7th street 163 seawall and boat dock as i mentioned here and the 13th street uh brent did provide me last week with the section 90 code which i mentioned here questions for the city on manager boulevard we know how that's blocked off when we have words can you do you know what's going on or how much longer any idea it's uh it's a sewer issue and then the place of the pipe is started out uh like the street but just they started out doing cross cut uh it's a contractor they haven't given me any time frame when we'll be finished the other day it looked like they were starting to fill it back 16th street senior renovation we spoke last week and uh we you mentioned the 16th and 17th um are those that the is that part of this project or is this something else no this is the c1 16th and 17th street of the stormwater project and we're getting a proposal from dual engineering you know when that'll happen manager our normal engineer had some health issues and he back filled with something else is that all working well sustainable engineering it's working pretty well you know the difference is larry was a one-person show and he would come and a lot of stuff got moved out a lot faster but uh it it might delay a like a house construction uh review it might take a couple weeks now or with larry we we've got comments back so that's the only real course council any other questions from the city manager citizens anybody have a question for the city manager just come to the podium police jim juvederm street um there's two holes that i've seen in the city and i'm just wondering if this is 5g have you noticed them they have a like a total two rusted tubes sitting on holes is that why did you need i don't know if it's been upgraded but that is part of the communication system for the satellites i don't know for a fact that it's 5g the way that it's went since the legislature kind of took away our authority we don't really they can come in and prove wherever they want i know that we cannot we cannot dictate where they put them we can dictate though according to the to the statute that we can dictate how they look the beautification of them you can you can dictate a little bit about landscaping but the whole is not really going to change all right he took it away from the city issue right away corporates and things of that nature sometimes tallahassee says that they don't want the local cities localities to handle something and this is a situation with 5g so um you know very limited as to what we're able to do so you may find a 5g antenna and that's not glyn reeves for the city or the city council it's um and the big cell phone companies yeah like i said they pretty much have a free-for-all equipment whatever they want most doesn't look like it's a single pole sometimes i call it a nice box that's next to them a little actually there's one across the street right here and then it's got like a shriners cap on top of it this is an example yeah that's what it is any other questions for the city manager all right yes [Music] introduce yourselves [Music] no they will modify the sea wall and they'll have to the adjust they ask is they used to be able you could pick somebody up on a boat there there was two steps going down that routed away that disappeared nobody fixed that there was a hinge system so you could you know it's got you lift that up get on a boat to another two steps the steps are out of the way never got replaced the hinge system they put a solid board and they're being forced it that's it are we doing anything with that is anybody aware of that even no we're aware of it actually uh it didn't run away it was hit by a vote where we are the steps are going yeah and they're they're going that the boat has not been uh we have projects for docs that's not the next one the next one is seventh street that we're going is that somewhere on the list if we put it back to the way well we'll replace so you wouldn't go off so you can't use it right it's been out of commission at least a year here and yes now i'm aware of somebody there well as long as somebody's work because i used to use that i can't use it and as far as the ramp down here one of those spheres going in or on whatever we have here there uh right now what is out to bid is the ramp and the seawall there after that's finished then we we're in the process of getting the votes for the nominee no no it would be this report thank you city clerk um [Music] [Music] [Music] comments questions clerk citizens any questions for the city market capable city clerk report thank you patty okay we've gone to the regular agenda we moved 99 off consent into regular uh this is a motion to approve the february 7th 2022 city council meeting minnesota motion please second second by david thomas yes thank you um so i only had one change and patty uh you and i went over this i am prepared if you want to play the audio you need to do that um the last comment on the notes here it said mayor manzo found council member ontario's appointed order ballot it should be not valid and that occurs at 54 minutes and 37 seconds of the audio tape and if this counts wants to hear it i think i can pull it up on my phone i can take my word it was like a pretty exact measurement there so that was it other than that i find it to be absolutely fine um you're gonna go like we have to listen to it too and then you know just to just want me to play it now if you like that good reception here i can play it we don't have to play the whole tape we just need to start by doing [Music] and if you think i said something else then contact me citizen comments so but that change conditional upon patty finding what i found in terms of the mistake in terms of the point of order um we'll vote on the approval of the february 7 2022 city council meeting minutes all in favor to approve say hi anyone opposed seven to zero penny and so they're approved conditionally with that change and you'll contact me if there's a problem okay yes 10. uh consideration of proposed park and recreation board event for april 30th 2022 this is a fly me to the moon frank sinatra rat pack style musical event funding is in the fbi 2021-2022 board budget by the city council first let's start with the motion by playing gun and second nothing by less than the tarot plan okay i think we have sharing hey everyone how are you tammy lavender perfect for chair um so i don't know if you just this event if you want to jazz in the park last fall will be very similarly set up it's just a different music style um we're gonna try to get a pizza truck you know all things italian that night and we're basically using for the budget what we use for the flyers last year because we don't have to mail out flyers this year because we have the sign up front so between the website and the sign i think we'll be able to get the word out and with a few if you guys wanna want us to put this together so if you have any questions i believe you have the detailed budget sheet everything else because i know last year there were lots of issues about the parking and the safety and and it went flawlessly and we were going to follow the exact same plan uh council tell me if you don't mind just staying up there everyone has questions to you and then we'll debate it you can sit down but let's see if anybody has questions for you first while we have you here any questions for tammy frank last year um the jasmine clark how many intended you know sure yeah about a hundred million counters not a fair question out-of-towners mean like someone that wasn't a dollar or a good president um other than like my guest that i invited one person showed up that we were like we weren't sure we didn't ask but you know based on discussions that we've had in the past it was we're not inviting everyone in every neighborhood but if a couple of people show up we're definitely not going to kick them out it's it's i just would never do that so i understand when you put it on the side up front and you got a tractor especially this time the other questions for tammy before we debate um yes i have something when you put it on the side i think yeah we just put a private bill or reach garbage in front of it so that just everybody driving down the street home and gets an open public one and uh yeah there was a few people and the last one that came with other people though that lived here i knows like yes yeah so you know you're great you didn't kick them out but um i think we could probably put that on the side and actually i wouldn't think april 30th by that time the snowbirds are going down so we're not going to have a lot of traffic council any other questions let me thank you for the debate again okay okay thank you now back to the council let me prefer so council's open for comments and debate um i'm on board i think it's a great idea i probably would not want to put that the only private for bellar beach because that seems very unwelcoming and even if that's the five i don't think i should necessarily be advertised it doesn't look good for the city we were like us only so i just think it should be on there if other time people come well then that's just what you do with more than marriage right i i'm hoping to support this since i'm not going to put it i like counseling um and let's sell tickets to it since there's only a hundred people that attended it there's one system under residence even if there's only two dollars we'll take it all right then it's more private just might because she she does a fabulous job beach cleanups and everything else she is a gift to the city so i i commend for forever i'm going to have to agree with both of you um robin i think it's just nasty to say no one else is about to buy it if someone happens to come we got room we're paying one price here so come on down it doesn't really matter it's not like we're going to have this isn't going to be woodstock 100 000 people are going to show we were involved with the original law this was you know the idea of having stuff in the city i think i floated back when or started this uh this council here three years ago and we had some pushback from some citizens and some of the pushback we got was should we be using city money for this so the first event that we ran which was the biggest event that's been run over in decades which was the city festival that city festival was complete completely self-sustaining in fact the city's festival made seventeen hundred dollars after all expenses were paid now what i'm seeing here and budget the way we did this i remember it well on the council we said we didn't know how if we even get a sponsor the first time so what we said was we're going to put money aside in the budget and if needed we'll sponsor it because the last thing we're going to do is tell everyone at the festival and say well you know it's cancelled at the last second so we were able to get sponsors and it it was it was more than self-funding we made money um somehow along the line we went away from that model and now it's like the city's stuff and that's where i have a little bit of a problem okay i love the music for frank sinatra that's what frank sinatra 13 times because i swim in three different states i'll go to this thing i'm sure it'll be wonderful okay and i'll pay five dollars or ten dollars or whatever it's gonna be if that's what they're gonna charge to people but i i don't know to be in the entertainment business here the budget should be the fall back if we can't get sponsors or we don't want to charge a ticket price um because we're just at this time we were giving gift certificates as prizes at the halloween contest that's all coming out of taxpayer money and that's where i have a problem with it not the event they are they're done extremely well the park sport did a great job every single event that i've seen i did i wasn't in jazz but i saw the other one um and it was great but i think this christmas lighting all that stuff was great but i don't think we should use enough city money unless it's back up unless we can't get sponsors and i know you get sponsors for this that's all i want to say right this is an old budget decision so it was made when we created visibility so going back now to try and argue it is probably not worth the time and effort i would think that for next year's budget when we sit down and start thinking about it let's go ahead and analyze a little further at the end of the day if only five people show up in this thing it's gonna cost fifteen hundred dollars and fifty seven fifteen hundred fifty seven right if 200 people show up it's going to cost 15.57 if 500 people show up it's going to cost maybe a little bit more but it's going to be marginal it's 15.57 so i'm with robin that's that's t neighborly about this thing it's it's aimed at residents we're giving back to our residents and uh we can debate this compared to this thing next in the next budget cycle but we've already made this decision let's continue to move forward and i don't really see a problem with funding this this event the last one was excellent everyone was relaxed it was a nice evening and great music and a great time to get to know our neighbors i didn't see i didn't see a lot of people coming in from outside and i think looking back i think one of the reasons why we had the sponsors and brought in all the various vendors was because we were trying to make it more of a area wide of them instead of a baller beach event so i think that if we're smart the way we were the sun the verbage on the side we can let people know it's really for our community but if you happen to be nearby and you do stop and we're not going to turn you away all right that's it open it up to the um citizens know i kind of like the idea of sponsors it may be a little bit too late in the game to do it now but they have encouraged for the next event to try to work on themselves to try to be more financially neutral because i do remember way back when one of the biggest complaints from many council members was about the cost to the city and why should our city tax dollars go on for a festival or a halloween thing so i just want to remind the people that said that that they said that and they may change their mind that's fine i'm just pointing out the the past comments so i would just say just be smart financially going forward i mean if you can find a sponsor i'm sure the pizza truck the encounter nice people would be happy to pay a nominal fee because they made way more money um than they paid so i don't see like you know trying to get somebody out of them so i think that for going forward the next event we should really think about trying to get some sponsorships but it may be too late right now for this one mayor just just to let you know that the partner record is working on a sponsorship package it's not citizens i think it's good for the community okay so what we have in front of us now is considered item number 10 consideration a proposed park and recreation board event for april 30th 2022 we presented a budget 1557 for this it's applied into the moon rat pack style event oh yes smoke is going to get this fast and move forward i'm going to do a voice vote on this all in favor all right 7-0 at 11. consideration of merit pay increase based on annual evaluation criteria for city manager some merit increase based on the city council employee evaluations uh first aid motion okay uh glenda numbers and evaluations are in the package just to correct you that patty had issued some replacement pages i know we got them everybody in the city has also had the opportunity to see the replacement scores and everything yes okay good any other council comments yes i would like to add something i know it was very concerning to a number of people last year during the overviews and stuff that i was in violation of an ethics issue so i just want to let everybody in this community be fully aware as a new year mind is clear that that was not one neither is this i've not only spoke to the ethics commission and being cleared i also have a personal attorney which was each year of the athens board and have been cleared so former city attorney fred riley has cleared me that real estate coordination doesn't need to hurt me but they have cleared my broker there is no violation i just want everybody to know that upfront that i have every legal right to do my responsibilities as the city council member and evaluate the city major and bring him among his school counseling in the comments in the bathroom actually this isn't in the question so i'm going to add this to the question we're talking about a three percent because that's what the numbers show correct everyone on council i say that directly if i didn't say that correctly say something okay so it's a three percent rate so i'm going to pull the question with that and again consideration three percent merit pay increase based on the annual valuation criteria for the city manager that's based upon the evaluations impacting i'm going to do some voice vote all in favor hi anyone post 7-0 congratulations mr roose thank you thank you okay let's do one more time for the city clerk here consideration a merit pay increase on based on annual evaluation criteria for the city clerk this merit increase based on the city council employee evaluations and patty i know he got tables right for your race that worked on this kid and they were perfect for her first emotion [Music] yes leslie um information yes speaking to the microphone it's supposed to be working hi ben is yes i stand by everything that's in the evaluation we're very lucky to have daddy here and again this would be for a three percent uh increased merit increase based upon the table on the scores any other council comments any citizen comments back to council president of tarotna last word okay so this is a consideration of a three percent merit pay increase based on the annual evaluation for penny gentry for this last year and although a voice voting spoke will get that raise all in favor anyone post 7-0 penny congratulations thank you very much thank you we have any unfinished business council members um i am 14. uh no we're not on 14 yet i'm on 13. i'm sorry okay i'll take 14 in order with uh the individuals so item 14 is unfinished business if we have anything extremes i have one thing and i don't i'm not going to make a you're going to know what i'm talking about okay remember we have a meeting about the water and easements okay that's still unfinished so i just want that not to be forgotten about i know fred reilly was working on it there was lots of questions but i don't want anybody to get all excited about it you and i and fred were looking back at the history of florida on that so i just want to make sure it doesn't we almost on the radar no it hasn't actually uh just before fred left we had a discussion with the attorney homeowner's lawyer and uh he found some things that technically what they would have to do based on what fred told me is andy and i talked about a little bit uh they would have to go to fdep to get title to it if they wanted what if vp is going to do you have no idea what they'll do all right i just wanted to you're aware of it and then andrew you're aware of them it's okay thank you so like did anybody else have any unfinished business um i'm a little confused here because 14 is supposed to be council conference yeah we're on unfinished business i don't know why either but we're going to be addressing that momentarily so is that city council business or is that official we'll be addressing it momentarily let me get through 13. we're going to bring 14 up and i'm going to be coming around to everybody on this council um so number 13 anybody else any other unfinished business no that's close now we're going to unplug them 14. odd month we start reverse alphabetically and we start with real um yes i'm actually the one councilmember banker that put that in here um the reason why i did it i just feel like that this city and this council can come to some kind of a middle ground with everybody i mean that way we don't have things that happen like this it's just you need to come to the middle ground other than that i don't have anything else to add about it um i am going to say that i am very excited that this chapter of my life is over and ending and more power to the new people that come in and i'm really looking forward to getting back to what i'm going to call the real world so you know i hope you all enjoy yourselves get out and vote it's coming up hopefully the candidates that have signs out there will get out and clean those up immediately afterwards so the city can look nice that's actually all i have to say so i'm glad my chapter is transparency before the meetings it's really kind of nice to keep your thoughts and minds great job by the staff you've done a great job and if you don't mind i like it too does anybody have any comments on that real class just so we have a little feedback we reported for a minute i think it's working good well getting back to this six page i don't know if it's an email or not that accounts what we have put in but my name is mentioned in here at least 10 times and i think there's a history that needs to be cleared up here you have to follow where i'm going to give the same um uh note to you that i gave to the citizens where they spoke we're not going to speak about any particular campaign we're not going to attack any individuals but you can certainly speak about your actions and what you want to do well i want to enter this it's a little lame thing but i want to enter into the record and i have emails to back up are you adding are you asking that this be entered word for word this is about like i am 14 uh sitting in canada this day about mr lusk this is from um there's a little history here on february 6 last year i was out door-to-door campaigning for myself i met mr lost that day who spoke to me for about 20 minutes about the city primarily about his voting and marina which he has opposed them after my election to council i further received an email from mr lusk which i want to quote you did all the right things to earn the most votes congrats frank last year at our council meeting in october discussing abilities that was stated by a council member because i brought up the issues of movies missing in belarus it was bellerin beach is now under scrutiny of improper marking on our booties a member of council also noted it was sustained by another it is to their understanding and other neighboring talents also are under scrutiny because of my persistence on this matter first i want to clear that misleading statement up on march 3rd last week i attended and spoke to the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission fwc and tampa lied while getting more in depth with that meeting in this report i want to note i was told towns and cities that have buoys and markers marked vital speed no weight are not required to change their building markers because they are grandfathered in because these permits are perpetual the problem here according to fwc our city has to modify the perpetual permit which was granted last year which takes away from the grandfathering laws hence changing the current building language furthermore in october 2021 i received a call from mr lusk about the buildings possibly being changed in belarus beach because i raised issues with fwc i told mr buster i was on vacation with my wife and he said can you give me a few moments mr lusk and i went into a conversation lasted one hour and 44 minutes about him being a voter enjoying the right to anchor his boat near the shoreline and go to his home in the lieutenant personal business i asked mr lusk numerous times as my wife became increasingly angry to give back to mr west that each request was followed by just a few more moments what mr russ said to me that voters should be able to enjoy the ocean and god anywhere they want and those that went to swim should go to lakes i knew my time was being wasted and i told him i needed to get back to my life but noted i would send him documentation recording permits etc i further agreed to meet with him later if you wish to discuss this matter the meeting that maggie mays the following week was another one and three quarter hours long after the first 30 minutes i told mr west just we just had a difference of opinion and you're holding me to actions which occurred a year before a satellite council will be proceeding to get up and leave mr westman said so you're going to lead and not hear me out i said again last week and today it seems it's the same position although our out of courtesy and being a council member i stayed for another hour and a quarter but when two women told us we were disturbing their breakfast i said we needed an endless and wish mr lunch is a good day that then followed by two more phone calls and text messages i further provided mr lust recent boating incidents the swimmers invaders being hit in florida which he replied they are not in bellar beach hopefully these past events clearly illustrated that i have fulfilled my oath in representing the hearing out because stitching but here was spending four hours on one subject not to mention time for research and providing now only mr lutz fabricated falsehoods specifically relating to be still noted in section 14 of the minutes mr west remarks of my door-to-door campaigning with fire personnel in pinellas county on february 16 2022. the time of day was 10 am not 9am as mr mistakenly cites the firemen who were out campaigning for the mayor never showed up showed the campaign until 9 30 a.m because they had a call out at 3am which lengthened their shift the fireman who i was with parked his truck towards the end of howard on the water side of his discus not in front of mr last house as mistakenly cited in the email i wore no hooded sweatshirt ever going door-to-door campaigning and especially not that day the fireman who was out supporting did his did have his shelter dog with him who he takes to the fire cup while i did go to mr musk's house knocked on his door no answer was received and i left the flyer at this door i want to know while i spent an ample amount of time last year at mr west house his home did not resonate to me that it was his home while door-to-door i further knocked him about 700 doors the previous year as well simply i do not hear marvin flash's home while proceeding south of his biscuits i did notice mr lusk waving his arms and hands heavy in the street which i weighed back and continued to endure after completing our door door the fireman and i went back to his vehicle to go to our next destination mr lusk was still in the street when we walked by and was on the phone and said frank i need to talk to you the firemen and i stood and bill continued to talk on the thumb i then said after about one minute what do you want mr lust replied can't you see i'm on the phone and you will have to wait until i'm done i then said good day and proceeded to walk away which followed mr west putting the phone down and saying i was rude for not letting him complete his call mr wrestling said frank a number of elderly residents are scaring the people out on their doors and i'm asking you not to do this i said bill a year ago you were thrilled with door-to-door campaign if anyone does not want to answer they don't and i never spend more than one minute at any home where there is no answer mr was saying frank let me talk he said bill you only wanted to delay my work here have a nice day and we proceeded down the street and got into the department's truck mr lost some notes that i found a police report on february 16th on this matter in those minutes i have not filed any police report on that day or my entire tenure in this city this is implies that he is a spokesman for the elderly and expects others to follow his direction mr lusk is not an elected official of this city if he desires to represent the elderly or anyone else he should seek electoral office finally mr west contacted me by email on january 25 2022 or 22 days earlier from the february 16th issue after i blind copied him and many other residents about a sitting matter regarding beach improvements he replied he did not want to receive further email communications campaign lobby and more communications from me anymore he further claimed my attempt to bring back shade with a rogue attack i responded so no further communication occurs and i don't want to inadvertently send him another please block my email that proceeded by his assistant and contacted me then an ira called for mr lesk who said loudly i don't want any further communications from you and hung up the thought while mr blessed our city four questions in that email who only god would know the answers and not our city matters job or duties he ends his email or a city manager what has happened to our beautiful cities i believe our city is as beautiful as the day i move into is my belief that my first amendment rights and decisions by the supreme court give me a right to campaign door-to-door which i have done for over 40 years the campaign season this campaign season i've spoken to supporters on both sides of the fence not one is irate or an employee it is very detailed mr lust 22 days prior to february 16th unequivocally demanding no further communications to him like me but stood in the street waiting while i am the councilman of the city i will represent all citizens although expecting me to stand in the street until he finished the call legitimate or not is completely disrespectful and in his word rode attempt to delay my business more importantly to waste a fireman's time who has been out since three years and serving this county is disheartened possibly his questions can be answered by looking into a mirror and i have emails and just to follow up on my fwc meeting um when i was talking to them about the building issues uh the chairman actually had to go wall and take me out another gentleman will be their attorney and they said here's the issue you put in for a permit amendment which now has to have the police names change i said it doesn't and he says yes and that's when we got into the perpetual permits of other cities not even being addressed i contacted fwc last year they said they never went to any city on this side of gone okay they had their abilities changed so that was a mistake by this council when he pull it out to the last year i also say so because we invented the permit but we can now have to be changed he said yes i said well i have three emails which i gave their secretaries stating what language do you want on these buoys in may of 2020. each one said idol speed no wait and that goes back to 219 2019. attorney then said oh there's a problem we will take this back to tallahassee and get back i don't expect anything in return but i'm going to keep filing as frankfurter's citizen more appealing that's what happened thank you frank i'm just before with me i just wanted for frank's thing i mean um i didn't test he wasn't wearing a hood because i just looked at my ring whenever i talked to you my right wing bring the deck over balcony so i haven't even seen so he wasn't wearing a hoodie just a sweatshirt so i can confirm that by video when i talk to him and say i wasn't home sorry but thank you um as far as my comments um i don't really have any comments i say good luck to all the candidates um it doesn't matter who you vote for the most important thing about this election is that doesn't matter just vote that's the best thing you can do for yourself your country your city is to vote so i just encourage everybody thank you guys i think that this is our unless we have an emergency meeting this will be our last uh council meeting in this format i don't know who's staying who's uh who's leaving but it's been an honor to serve with each and every one of you and definitely it's been a rewarding three years i've learned much about the city and uh and i've also learned much about each and every one of you i wish all the candidates the best of luck i also would like to encourage everyone if you've not voted please do so and we'll see you on march the 15th thank you frank i want to first address the pack because item 14 that was placed in here i did not file that police report i was home the reason why i was home through a lot of this election was so that these events didn't happen directly with me the reason why firemen were going around with campaign workers so that there was the final struggle final struggle and i'm not going to embarrass the person because that person is here today i'm not even going to say in person sex but there was a person who was screaming it wasn't bill last okay this was different this was a different street and two of my campaign workers saying did you see this did you see that just jump on me no one in this city should have to go through that had i been there i would have gotten my telephone out and recorded it and you don't do that you want a campaign you can knock on doors you can knock on the door right after we get done if you want people have done that but you can't be doing this to me you can't be doing this around the city in terms of whose house you can go to anyone who's campaigning anyone for anything by the way president vice president uh congress whatever put any house you want if a person asks you to leave you have to leave that's it they have no right whatsoever to tell you not to go to someone else's house it's none of their damn business and it happened several times and that's why a report was filed if it happens again more than a report will be a full complaint i'm not going to tolerate it for anybody and that would go if my opponent was going through it i didn't tolerate for him i would never stand for that so i applaud everyone who's campaigned and put their hat in the ring here i'm gonna and dave may not agree on everything but one thing i do agree on um it's been an honor to serve on this is our last meeting unless there's an emergency of this council i think as a whole we may have had issues where we agreed to disagree but i think one thing we can all agree where we leave bellaire beach now three years ago you're in a much better place than where we were three years ago we've helped this city i'm proud of the work i've done i think everybody else on this council should be proud of the work that they did i echo what others have said it's your right to pick your your people who are going to serve you and the election is march 15. so whomever you vote for exercise your vote and exercise it carefully it's been an absolute honor to do this i think i speak for everyone on this council it's been our honor to serve you in this council so with that i'm going to ask for a motion to adjourn so move to second all in favor all right thank you everyone"
