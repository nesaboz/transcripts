Boulevard and that's all the data Mak for you thank you cor Council anyone like to ask cor question yes U yes cor um we're going through our budget right now St increase with the sheriff's budget um I'm trying to figure out because we get a s back from B A Shores and it looks like we I guess they allocate about 1.2 hours a day um for Sheriff duties okay I can't see how that is not more than like 2.5 hours 3 hours would you have any would you have any idea of how much time that I can't speak to I will pass your concern on to Captain liner and I'll have him reach out to to the SC I really appreciate that thank you no problem any other questions or comments for the cor Elsa member Roberts you have any questions or comments okay I'm going to take that as note thank you Corp I appreciate it sir now we're on to the monthly code enforcement report Trump here yes he is helloy how you going good evening I'm Deputy Trump with count Sheriff's Office and I uh assist in helping with your code enforcement uh for the city this year I'm sorry this year this month for the month of June we had 42 entries uh with that um I had various different s um we did seven unpermitted remodels uh seven other enforcements which um include anywhere from garbage not in cans things like that uh all the way up to directly control so it's kind of a an open uh type of category um I conducted four Beach patrols uh five construction nuisances uh we are dealing obviously with the hot weather the rain and everything else we're dealing with a lot more plant overgrowth complaints High Grass complaints things like that so we're trying to address those and talk to the residents about some of their plants kind over growing fences things like that uh and then we had U uh a couple of calls referen just clutter in the yard things being stored in driveways that aren't supposed to be there uh and then one uh boat and Trail complaint that we took care of so it was a a pretty easy month uh but we were pretty busy also any questions thank you Deputy any questions or comments for Deputy Trump no for me thank you thank you one second uh Mr Roberts do you have any questions or comments I do not all right thank you so much deuty thank appreciate you being here yes sir next up we have a presentation from the pel sun fire and rescue District but I do not see a how you doing sir I'm good how you do good uh my name is stoneberg I uh I'm here today Chief Davidson had an emergency u a special meeting with Indian an Indian insur for the district um and he obviously apologize couldn't make it but he sent me instead so hopefully that's a good substitute but um for the month of June uh there were 18 calls into Beller Beller Beach during the month uh includ like a fuel spill gas leavs water rescue a diving incident motor vehicle accidents heat exposures and some other medical calls um and the uh just an update the district has purchased property to better serve B Beach uh the new fire station is going to be anticipated to built within the next 20 months uh the location is at Northern end of Indian Rocks um which allows for 2minute response time in Beach uh we are currently working with the county to provide Staffing um so we can put a unit in the area prior to the station being built to get that moving along faster get a better response um our goal is to provide the highest level of care to our citizens obviously and uh with that if there's any questions be more than happy to answer what I can any questions for the chief Mr Roberts you have any questions no all right if you don't mind would you please mute thank you very much thank you I appreciate your time thank you and and tell Chief David that he's in trouble again St there all right uh next we have an update item number five an update on the causeway and gold Boulevard intersection for pelis County Public Works hello sir please come up and uh announce yourself your uh good evening my name is Tom wasman I'm the division director for Transportation uh for Public Works penel County um I've got our County Traffic engineer here tonight as well Jeff Thompson and our timeing technician ni papadopolis we got a presentation W taking part in it um I want to give you guys just a little bit of brief history on what we've done out of the intersection I'm I'm going to hold you for one second can you speak a little closer to the microphone I'm sorry is that better it's volume turn down I'm sorry is that better much better I wonder I couldn't hear anyone I'm sorry about that let me start over uh my name is Tom was I'm with County Public Works I'm the transportation division director got our County Traffic engineer with me here today Jeff Thompson and I've got our time and technician uh Nick papadis we got a presentation on what we've been doing at the intersection here recently but I want to give a little bit of History before we come up and show you the modeling that we've done um going back to 2014 uh we had a pedestrian study that we did along the entire B Boulevard including City clear water in Rocks Beach and b beach the results of that study is what resulted in the U pedestrian crossings that we have out there including the one that's just north of the intersection um so that dates back about 10 years um 2016 2017 with hurricane Irma the intersection was damaged pretty heavily it used to be a span wire so we've since upgraded that to mass arms it's given us the ability to apply technology at the intersection which we'll show you here as well um in 2020 we were contacted by the city to consider um a study at the intersection looking at complaints that you guys are receiving are relating to us about delays at the intersection primarily southbound and westbound traffic so we hired a consultant did a study which resulted in the configuration of the intersection uh that you see today primarily the change was changing that southbound left turn from a single Lane to the two lanes and uh making some other adjustments and that's how it's been operated since about 2021 um in 2023 February 2023 we were contacted by council member Roberts asked to take another look at the intersection um so we've been doing that since then um in April of this year we had council member Roberts send City U manager out to our facility showed them the modeling that we're going to show you today showed them um the detection devices that we've got at the intersection what type of data that's providing to us and then came up with some recommendations uh that we've been going back and forth with the city so um so that's kind of where we are today and with that I'm going to ask Nick to come up and kind of go through the detection that we have at the intersection the data that is pulling and then modeling that we've done to get to where we are today all right all right thank you hello everyone my name is Nick Pap I'm a traffic sign planing technician I've been working in the county for 9 years now So eventually I moved up to being the timing tech for the county and what we do daily as a team is we monitor intersections we keep an eye on traffic we try to make intersection more efficient we try to identify problems either pedestrian problems or vehicles or illegal Crossings whatever is related to an intersection that can make it U work safer so um my presentation is a little bit different today I'm not going to show you a powerpoint just going to see some data and uh also software regarding um some new AI technology we install the section right down the road here atou give me a second let me share the screen so uh when the request came to uh our group to monitor the intersection it was a good chance to um Implement one of these new devices which not only um does vehicle detex and it also does analysis so it counts pedri it counts Vehicles it tells you things that you cannot see um every day or constantly monitoring an intersection so um the system is called called C's Vision uh hopefully you can see it on the on my screen here and uh we do get a live view of what's going on in the section right now it shows us the vehicles what's uh what's out there and if we click on the camera we get a live feed and it shows us exactly how many vehicles are there um it classifies them by category as a light truck heavy truck a passenger vehicle motorcycle bicycles everything they're pretty powerful devices now and um having the ability to gather all this information um makes it easier for us to analyze all the data and figure out what's going on so right now you can see live feet of the intersection um southbound approach the Westbound and then on the bottom is the the Northbound and every time a vehicle Rolls by we do get like account and a unique sorry a unique number and U that goes into the software and then we can run an analysis and a report to see uh how many vehicles so let's say for instance for today um we're going to do a one hour increment and see what how many vehicles are um moving through this intersection every day and you can see graphs here it tells you how many vehicles are southbound how many use a through Lane how many use the left lane and um for this intersection we mostly concerned about the right now for the southbound left turn and the southbound two so um looking at the data any any day you look at all the data there's more than double Vehicles trying to make a sof on left ter and vehicles trying to make a food uh movement so right now today we have, 1500 Vehicles so far um going through southbound but then you have 3,300 Vehicles going south L which is more than double and uh the reason we need all this information is we want to analyze what will happen if we go to reduce the capacity from two L sou L to a one leg how bad the traic will back up and uh to do that we we take the report from this software and then we enter all this uh the numbers into another software which does modeling so this is the most popular the most powerful software that um all the engineering firms use is called Synchro studio so um right now I'm going to show you the scenario of what is existing at the intersection so right now we have a double left turn lane for southbound and we've been we spend hours monitoring the intersection we do have the CCTV cameras uh let me you real quick like we can monitor from our office constantly this is a live feed actually from another camera U and we can monitor what's going on um am Peak traffic off peak moments PM Peak traffic weekends you know we could turn it around and get an idea what's going on so we could compare the data that we get from the software and we could actually get get a real U time image of what's going on so you know we like to be sure what we uh propos so once we take all that data now we have all the counts we can put it in the software and usually we take the worst case scenario for um every approach so you're going to see some numbers here for southbound 203 vehicles for through 619 for left turn you know westbound westbound is also a pretty heavy movement it's almost the as busy as a southbound and most of the time a little more heavy but um anyway once we put off the data into the software now we go through the simulation and um it shows you what's going on I I will speed it up a little bit so um you can see the um the traffic moving it looks a little bit cartoon view but that's how it works um so right now uh we don't have any significant backups we haven't seen anything um dramatically there's a couple of times that um we experienced the backups to to a special occasion maybe there's an accident or a couple of months ago there was um a sand sculpture um event going on at beach so we experienced a lot more traffic so but on an average date um we don't see right now with dual left turn Lanes a lot of backing up Vehicles into the block into southbound Movement Like passing the the median for the adustment proc and um this left left turn pocket right now all the way back to the medium with separates the The Pedestrian Crossing can roughly fit around 12 Vehicles so 12 vehicles per Lane you could get around 24 without blocking the southbound traffic they can still keep coming um they want through uh now so far even in this Synchro video you don't see any backup everybody's happy you know there's a little bit of a the problem I think is when they merge over here to the left cuz they don't have a lot of room um and they have to start merging so as soon as they make a left turn there's a marking on the ground that tells them you have to merge and it seems like the problem is uh heading east as soon as they make that left ter people try to cut in front of everybody and there's a little bit of confusion uh I have spent U several hours at this intersection observing traffic actually uh in the cabinet real time and uh there are a little bit of U confusion with drivers some are more aggressive some blow the horn but uh other than that you know the backup for the southbound is not there and uh feel free to ask any questions in the meantime if you have something okay I don't mind being I think and I live I live south of this intersection so but the people north of this intersection believe the biggest complaint is what you just said last going eastbound you said you can I think you said you can hold 12 Vehicles going coming from the south two L correct so the this pocket here we call you the pocket but the left turn Lanes from the stop are all the way back to where the medium starts where the the Palm fees are for The Crossing for the you could roughly get because you have 12 Street also there blocking the traffic um there is a marking there that said do not block so some Vehicles block some don't how many how many vehicles can you hold going east before you have to reduce it to one M you know what I'm saying 12 12 right are you're holding 12 total Vehicles you hold 12 vehicles for Lane coming from the north think it would be a different situation because those cars are moving where the ones that are held in the southbound lane are stacked up and they're still and that's what I'm saying so when the late turns they're all getting aggressive to go East right so you have what 24 cars and 12 cars that's the worst case in add we haven't experienced 24 cars at once usually an average is uh 10 to 12 come down this weekend you can experience yeah and and and from J from January 1st till at least Easter every probably I mean I I I I pity the residents at north of the caway I mean I'm starting to see it on my side but I hate to say this but I think they've adapted knowing that they can't get out in certain hours of the day and they just one guy shaking his head he had a scenario doing three hours ago to one time um uh the danger I think that everyone is worried about is going east and these guys are gunning the cars trying to get into that one lane correct I understand that's why we ran a couple of scenarios here we didn't know we do one so U let me stop this one and then we could U run the second one which is a single turn I I can assure you I already know what's going to happen there's going to be more than 12 cars at any given time and you're going to block you're going to block all the traffic so one uh with the existing uh configuration of the intersection um unfortunately it will block the southbound uh through Lane completely because it will back up into the through Lane past the island and that will cause uh ders to be a little more upset do you mind if I ask Mr Roberts if he has a question for you since he's got an ongoing dial Mr Roberts do you have any questions or comments I I can't see you so okay I'm muted now thank you well I guess my first favy would be I think everybody would be an agreement um with the following statement that if you have a single Lane of traffic coming from the North to the South that wants to turn left on the caway that would be more safe than having two lanes turn turnning to the left so so that's get it that's the way it used to be and I agree with everybody that when it was in that format that there were times I don't know how many times but there were times when the traffic coming from Clear Water and your cars wanted to turn left on the causeway they would block the cars want to go out so that's how it was before and the decision was made to change that to two left hand turn Lanes to alleviate that problem and by doing that it's an unknown but man if it ever happens when two cars are turning left and the inside car bumps the outside car and that car jumps the curve and the worst case scenario there there we want to think about what happens so that's why we're talking about this I understand the queing of the vehicles in the two lanes and that has helped the southbound traffic to continue going south through that intersection but if it's at the risk of safety of going through the intersection and turning to the left I'll never be in favor of that so as most of you know I I have brought the attention to the conversations about it I'd like to know if we were to remove that island and create just a single left hand turn lane the cars would Quee in what's now known as that five directional Lane I clearly that would be more safe to the cars turning to the labs and it would also return the blinking left and turn light which allows people to turn left if in fact there's no traffic coming from the south to the north and and they're either there turning to the right or going straight so I think that remov some of those cars from the queue to begin with so that that's my biggest concern it's just the two cars turning left I truly don't believe it's a same situation and I'm concerned if two cars there I don't wor about the cars the speed's fairly slow but if one car gets push the outside Lane gets pushed towards the curve and somebody's there that's going to be a problem would you like to address Mr Robert's questions and comments uh yes sure um thanks for the feedback and for we did run a scenario for um the island moved also it was the next uh slide so give me a second let me the SC for the island move this one does look better but uh it removed is the third taty run which is going going to allow the sou line to move without blocking them and um so this is the third we worked on uh having the the island removed we we can't tell for sure how far back we have to stretch it uh we went all the way back to 15 Street for this simulation but um that was a little bit excessive we could probably make it a little bit shorter but just to see how it works it looks like it's uh it's not blocking traffic um and again the flashing yellow Aro is not always the best solution because um it's kind of like a double-edged sword what happens is U can you pause it right there sure just the way it is thank you all right continue please um the fling a ladder has one U disadvantage if there's a lot of pedestrians and uh usually weekends or early in the morning there's a lot of pesan activity when they push the bun across the road the flashing y out against disabled it's a safety feature that the FD requires it's called P protect so every time there's a in Crossing and they push the button they don't get that flash out they have to wait it goes into what we call a restricted left turn so most of the time you should be okay you talk me about The Pedestrian cross at the island or you talking at no not the island the intersection yeah okay yeah yes at the intersection so every time I can zoom it a little bit so let's say right here there's a pedestrian going north south this flashing will be disabled they will get the the red arrow they're not going to be able to move so most of the time to ke but um typically when there's a lot of pedest activity uh usually it's early in the morning when everybody trying to go to work and that's when it gets disabled so if you get like a couple of cycles of uh pedestrian activity what will happen is this will start to back up also CU they're not going to get that Gap in the north from the Northbound traffic to clear so uh typically you can clear another four or five vehicles it depends on how heavy the Northbound is or how much of the B of A Gap you got but that's one disadvantage of the pl otherwise if there's no traffic northbound you could clear as many as cars as uh you can within that time frame because uh every movement has a specific amount of time and seconds that they can utilize now again that can be adjusted if the third option is to be chosen and also another disadvantage of the single Lane sou down left turn with a long Q is now you need more time vehicles to accelerate so even though you're not blocking southbound traffic you need a little more time to clear more Vehicles because they're going to be 300 ft back at the intersection by the time they make it to the Stop Bar it's almost time to max out and move to the next M so let me ask you a question if you will if you'll move uh move down a little bit so we see higher so you see more Norther so if you look at 12th and 13th how do they get out during a high volume of traffic in this scenario with no Island how are they going to get in the Middle Lane how are they going to make a left right now there's a do not block at the at the intersection these do you think for a minute that they'll follow that I understand but uh we keeping the same set up so so it's up to the drivers to obey the rules just like speed limits the signs are there but nobody obeys them but um we're just trying to simulate in the software I understand and we did notice there's like a parking lot over here like a public parking over here right next to the this Zone here I don't how these people get in during traffic or out um they they wouldn't be able to either there's no way they'd be able to turn into that public parking what everyone would have to do is head north find an empty spot to turn around which would create more problems um I I I would like to make some suggestions if you if you've got time sure um can we pull up the uh presentation the power point that I made I just want to point out some obvious things and then show you what I think May alleviate some of the problems without without doing away with it the second turn L because um what I can say is since you've done the two lanks even though uh we all have identified a possibility for danger I can assure you I have not seen backups like we've seen in the past I've seen where we've had to wait and wait and wait for sometimes as much as 10 minutes to get out on go Boulevard where the back up so bad especially towards the end of the day uh during say spring break or special event you you couldn't get out you couldn't make a left turn because traffic was was uh was backed up so bad uh so uh if you look at look can you see on my screen up there okay so this is what we have today and we already know that that there are definitely some issues okay would you go to the next slide please okay so if you look at at um car number one in the right lane um it's it's about the turn right it's coming off Causeway Boulevard would you hover the arrow over the car number one because it's kind of hard to see all right you see right there yes all right currently the stop line is so close to that intersection that you have your I call them rolling stalkers and they actually stop they slow down and then they look to the left and they try to make that turn Mr Roberts would you mind muting for just a few seconds while I sure I'm sorry no no worries okay so you're rolling through that that intersection you're looking to the left and then you're going to make the right I've seen car after car after car roll over that point where number two is there we go well wrong one what happened he's going to put it through Zoom he didn't have it oh okay all right one one second so I stop sharing there we go okay Mr Roberts can you see this your head yes there we go okay so the car with the number one on it is doing a rolling stop and you can see the car is already already has the wrong angle for that turn I see it over and over and over where cars making the right because they're looking left they don't have enough time to make a a a good decision as they're approaching in to make the right turn so what happens is they drift over into the oncoming traffic and then they have to they have to make a quick course correction um now if we'll go to the next slide please so here's where we are today if you look on the asphalt you can literally see where cars have have left uh rubber on the road showing the directions that they're making uh how they're turning if you look at car number three and position number four this happens over and over and over they're coming through that intersection and they cross and you even showed it in your example your computer picked it up that they cross over that yellow line as they're approaching the intersection and they're doing that so that they don't have to slow down and they feel like that they're able to stay on that inside Lane now if you look at uh number five with a car on it um that one is swinging way out because he's afraid that car number three is going to bash him so he's swinging way out but he's also following the dotted lines on the street that's kind of the angle that we were blessed with whenever this was redone if you look at where he's at right now he's headed straight for that curve these are these are these are it was so easy for me to find this all I did was went to Google Maps and and and grab this picture but it was a great example showing exactly what's going on in our intersection if you look also uh at the the the street you can see there's also places where there's rubber where the car on the bottom turns in so everybody's doing this same thing so obviously we've got we've got some issues and here's what I think may help would you please go to the next slide oh and by the way another another problem before I go to the some what I my proposals is that cars are they they have to sometimes f for themselves because it looks like going to have a they're going to collide uh because this car is angled wrong that car is angled wrong and they're and they're wondering who's going to who's going to do the wrong thing so not only do you have to worry about getting in the appropriate Lane but you have to worry about your neighbor bashing your car next slide please uh go ahead there uh let's see okay so here's my proposal that is to move the stop lines back there's one on gold Boulevard you move that one farther north and you move the one on Causeway further uh further east and while you're at it go ahead and move the U the cross the crosswalks I realized that it would cost some money but I think that it would solve a lot of the problems that we're having right now the reason why is because if you look at the dotted white line that's been painted it's supposed to guide those cars headed south and then turning on the causeway the the radius is too too steep it's too hard of a turn to safely for both cars to do that together so if you go to the next slide you see this is where the the radius is is bigger it's less of a dramatic turn on simply by moving those lines farther away from the intersection um now this may create some other problems such as I I believe you would lose two cars in your left turn legs so instead of 24 cars being able to handle 24 you'd only be able to handle 22 but I believe what I'm hearing is that it's rare we have a full stack uh whenever the light turns red and we're busy it's rare that we have 22 full cars filling up both both turn LS is that right it happens but not very often not very often okay with just just a few times okay but if you look at at the turning radius that's painted there now compared to my uh caveman drawing that I did uh my my radius is is far larger than the one that's it's painted on the street I think that what that would do is that would help make the left turn much safer than what it is today because you're not having to make such a dramatic left um next slide please uh also by moving it back your little uh the guy who likes to do the rolling stop he's not going to be as close to that intersection whenever he has to start thinking am I going to get in trouble for running this traffic light so he's going to have more time to keep looking left before he eases up to the intersection and makes that right turn his his rolling stop uh also I believe that you're going to have less opportunity for crossing that yellow line as you're making the right um so that that's just some observations I've made uh next slide please also um because the crosswalks are now farther out of sight from your right Turners the the no right turn uh signs that I see in Maro would be this would be a perfect home for them if we were to Able if we were able to move these uh lines back so you have one on the uh the Northbound side preventing them from turning right whenever there's a pedestrian and we have one uh on the westbound side preventing them from turning right whenever there's a pedestrian Crossing there next slide please you already did this thank you very much I app appreciate that uh but also can you explain to me what the U what the reasoning is for four lights is it a law is it a require what what is the deal with the two round lights um in the right way yes that's easy that's a a federal requirement you need to have two to life for approach so it's like a safety issue so if one let's say red ball goes out you still have one to back up okay so L perose you need minimum two lights that's everywhere okay so I'm going to tell you what I've observed is that it's confusing to someone headed southbound and I've seen countless cars and you you can probably go and look in your database and you'll see it also that you've had you have people running the traffic light in the middle turn land headed southbound because they think that it's okay seat forward and so I I don't know what the solution is if it's a a federal law maybe we could slide those two closer together or something like that so that there's less confusion U because the arrows are pretty straightforward but unfortunately it looks like one of those green lights I think people are confusing and they don't know if it's if they're allowed to go straight or if they're supposed to turn left or what they're supposed to do and that was that was one that the city manager and I spoke to each other about we knew that there there would probably be an issue with that but it just seems like maybe the spacing of the Gap maybe if we can get them a little closer um they have to be by law they have to be minimum 8 ft apart 8 ft apart so we can double check to see if there is maybe a little legal room okay but because I think there's a also street name sign on the on the arm itself we might not have too much of a room to play okay I can pull it up real quick see uh if there's any wiggle room but usually they have to uh they have to be within the the lane and certain degrees Yeah I can uh I think that that one has what we call illuminated Street G sign so late at night it illuminates the the street name of the road so I I can't tell if yeah they're pretty close to each other so I can't tell if it can go maybe a few inches or maybe a foot but I can't see it being too much U also I forgot to show you all that that you mentioned this software captur um you go into the notifications here's here's an example okay can you see it yes Maxim so the software captures all that that you mentioned everybody's clipping that uh westbound left turn lane when they're making and it's on and on every day that's all we see in vcation most of the it's called wrongway driving it also captures a bit of red light Crossing so people that here we go doing red light uh there's a lot of U instances we have a lot of pedestrians that U um don't push the buttons across the road it captures them as a pedestrian violation right here so sometimes you know you'll see oh this is a motorcycle but yeah most of the wrong way detection that um um you mentioned is uh is captured in this software you'll see all day um anytime you look it's always um these Westbound and we did come up with a a proposal for that uh Mr um Jeff Thompson U prepared the proposal to what we think could uh help the traffic and um let me pull it up on my U computer so one thing we noticed is U the lines on the road are faded and um people are confused they what we call so the skip lines have faded out and they can't keep the vehicles while while they're making the left turn in track so this is a similar scenario to What U we just spoke about a few minutes ago uh maybe we could refresh these uh paintings uh move the Stop Bar a little bit back um there is a marking on the ground here very close to the intersection right now which uh we think um forces the the drivers to start merging a lot quicker than they should uh and we were thinking maybe delete this and um keep the other one Downstream which is uh like um 100 ft not even east of there and um the stop we mention that one um adding our markings now you did mention in the previous uh slideshow a no turn right there that could help but it can also cause backup because now you're you're holding that um westbound left turn movement for the whole amount of time that they're allocated actually that would be to the right so the right turn I mean they would have to stop someone's crossing the street why would we not do that correct but right now um most of the intersections vehicles have to heal the pedestrians so once The Pedestrian clears they could proceed so let's say you have another 15 seconds remaining in that movement clear maybe another five six vehicles but when you restrict the left turn when The Pedestrian is there now you don't clear Anybody Everybody the right turn correct they have to wait for the h split so they're going to lose the whole cycle they have to wait for the next so um it it could um help with pedestrian safety but it's not going to help traffic especially uh on days when the westbound right turn traffic is very heavy and there also pestan activity uh it will cause some backups so it's something to consider also going back to my original question going east I can see four marks okay and coming from the south I can see like seven marks so so that 24 car scenario turning it into that east bound Lan it doesn't fit is what I'm saying and correct they will have the marage right what I'm saying is if you do the M scenario by moving the marks back I don't I don't know if that I'll try anything but does that now accelerate those people even more you know what I'm saying you're more more area accelerate my thoughts were not that my thoughts were more of they were they were going to be able to focus their attention more on merging and less on maneuvering that turn because because this all comes out of human nature I'm sitting in traffic I'm upset I want to go home if I see an oing I'm going to gun the car I got this big machine under me and they're trying to get over the bridge I mean that's just human nature and um I represent the people b beach I really don't care if the people get backed up way to s k because we we have these way apps we have this Google Map if they see a large traffic G maybe they won't come here well excuse me for that if you um are saying you're representing all of b beach you just completely forgot about everybody on the north side of C no no I I mentioned that earlier I said our our residents have more or less adapted that they can get out certain times in the day I need that crystal clear so what do you do if you need something are you just stay home no what I'm saying is if we're making it easier for people to get here it's just going to cause more traffic I think the the purpose was to give them more an easier way out not in going that way across go or across Causeway is to allow people out because if you look you've got two lanes turning South I understand you've got two lanes turning East what I'm saying is the two lanes turning East is compressive from the two lanes turning South we can only fit so much that I thought off of the traffic engineer I wanted to speak to uh your question about going eastbound um when you're going from two lanes to one lane there's a formula and it's based on the the width of the travel Lane and the speed limit uh not so much the capacity um so where the two lanes go to one lane you have over 300 ft between when there's two full Lanes to where there's one lane and U you have that much what's required by the formulas about 250 ft so you have roughly 80 more feet than is what's required to narrow I mean go from two lanes to one lane so um where the mer like Nick was saying where the merge here the first one as you come around from South to East um that's a little too early I don't know if people when they see that they feel like they have to turn right there I haven't seen that when I watched the camera but that could be I I think um a good recommendation to take that out but then add another one pretty much east and west of the first driveway there which is home drive but um that's what this drawing um so I'll just go through some of these other ones your your point about flattening this uh dotted white line well taken um and we were going to also add a a yellow doted line to prevent try help guide the the motorist on the inside left turn lane around this Bend so they don't go into this thing but we would flatten that out too I think that's a good uh good point um so we were going to add the yellow daugh guid line refresh the white doed line guideline which again uh made a good point about making that flatter um refreshing the white skips here uh going eastbound uh eliminating this merge here but keeping this one and then adding another one right here um refreshing the the bike lane and the white Edge line just just while we're out there uh and ensure those are visible um moving the this Dro Lane sign it's it's further west um and it needs to be kind of right in line with for this merge should be really here at the second one so so people aren't uh prematurely trying to merge um the the lane assignment sign up here going south uh it's there but there's there's a way we can maybe make it a little more conspicuous maybe put a um reflect retro reflective uh material on the on the post just to make it stand out a little bit there's other way we can make more conspicuous um and then last but not least the the uh what you had spoke to earlier moving this stff back thank you Mr Roberts do you have any questions any comments we're going to give them just a second and then I'm going to go to council member and let her way in right now I'm un muted can you hear me are are you worth all this trouble I don't know in between there I took some uh line daning with wobble wobble when I get back I can tell you how to do that all right do you have any questions or comments I do so kind of in summary just from my viewpoint OB Le see years ago we had a single left hand ter Lane with the Medan on 13th and Fourth Street 13th and 14th Street then we went to a double left hand turn lane coming off of um and making a left hand turn on the costard which we have now the one scenario we have actually not had physically is the single leftand turn lane on the cway boulevard without a medium now I know you had questions earlier Mr Mayor concerning people coming off 13th and 14th stre and the county has a lot of data which they haven't had a chance to really see regarding how many vehicles they think would typically CE up up into that single Lane it sounded like earlier one of the gentleman said you know he didn't really think it would even go past 13th Street in particular there may be some times when that happens right now I'm guessing there's still challenge if they're coming out of 13th or 12th and 13th Street and they want to make a left hand turn out of their out of their street to head south and maybe either go further south or take the left to get on Causeway they still have a little bit of a challenge with that now even though it does provide them some safety because of the meeting but personally uh I would want to get some more data and information and recommendations from the county if we go to that single Lane they did have some information on that and the vehicles would queue up into that single Lane when the ability to have sometimes make a left hand turn with a bleaking yell I don't feel like there's going to be a lot of times when those cars queue up so the people that live on 12 and 13 would have difficulty coming out of their street and attending to make a left turn so I for one would like to see that happen the county had told me before if we did that and for some particular reason later on we felt but you know what maybe this didn't work as well as we wanted to it's not that difficult for them to go ahead and put back curving to create that Medium like it was before again all leaning to the safety of the two cars trying to make a left hand turn which I don't feel comfortable with thank you Mr Roberts let's go to council member Shaw Elliot well I want to thank both the mayor and the county for all their efforts because I think this has the presentation is a viable solution like the fact that it is preserving both um double lanes for the southbound left South I don't right southbound left hand turns onto the causeway I think that's important to preserve I think it's also important to preserve the double left hand turn Lanes Westbound and going south um it looks as though this solution to back the crosswalks um eliminates the danger of of U basically colliding Vehicles as they're turning to go eastbound as well as hitting the people that are sitting there waiting to go southbound cuz I've been in that situation where I feel like U to turn South black the block I'm line of fire so I think all of that works that sounds really good um I am concerned about ppin traffic so I'm open to any kind of observations that what Howa better preserve pedestrian safety in that as we push the causeway sidewalk back further east which again is a great uh move to trffic mov you then increase the risk that drivers going northbound and turning East will not see anyone in the Des cross so it's a blind curve for them to see anybody in that crosswalk so whatever we could do to improve that safety measure would be great and lastly I I would not favor eliminating the island and under your proposal that wouldn't be necessary but um the island is important I think for several reasons one is aesthetically it's just nice to have it and have some palm trees and some Greenery um but more importantly it's also a safety zone for pedestrians so as you cross um Gul um there's a place where you can being save on that island and I think that's important also so if you could address um how to make it more prominent that someone is sidewalk for those Northbound East terms what we can do with that that would be great thank you council member Shaw Elliot um I'd like to hear from the city manager city manager read for what uh what are your thoughts my thoughts are to follow the County's recommendation I think that um they have all the technology to plug all of the scenarios into their models and uh they do this every day so if we have some other models we'd like to experiment with just to get the data on them I think that's the best course of action thank you Mr Roberts um you uh uh you have conversed more than anyone would you like to have some final words before we before we let each two go home sure uh thank you just very quickly U thank you Mr Mayor um just so everybody knows we do have already two different uh pedestrian Crossings uh in our city that do not have a medum so I know some some people think that all of them do two of them do not and there are some I know NS they've been removing them so I don't think from an aesthetic standpoint um that really really carries a lot of weight and I just want to go on the record because I feel very strongly about this about not continuing continuing to not have the two left hand turn l so I want to make sure that everyone understands I am 100% against that and I pray to God nothing ever happens but it does uh I want people to know that I was not for that when that accident occurred thank you thank you Mr Roberts Mr Mayor yes sir just just for clarifications Mr Thomson did you say how many feet was it you had to get I'm saying when you're going east how many feet did you have we had emerged if if you one Lan with 35 mph and a 12T Lane 42 Lan one Lan about 250 ft 250 ft yeah and we have two RS coming from the south that hold 12 cars each from the north from the well it depends on the size it might be a bigger vehic might be a truck so well approximately my my my software my head an average car is 14.8 ft okay so let's say 15 ft * 12 180 ft you put two feet between each car I'm not a mathematician but I pick up dog poop for the county right you can only put so much poop in one bag right right and this is the problem you're you're trying to merge all these cars and there's not enough room that's it's it's a simple solution I don't know why we're making it so complic thank you and what is your simple solution I think we should go back to where it was I agree with Mr Roberts if someone gets hit there I'm not going to be responsible right and and Miss Al made a good point because when you are making that CR you move it back remember that it was people put that big wall there so now you got even more restriction people aren't looking they see that wall thank you very very much all right gentlemen uh we look forward to hearing your uh uh if you change your opinion or whatever it is that you're planning on doing we would like to know what it what it is before it actually happens just to give us the opportunity to talk about it and um present it to the community at at worst case all right yeah absolutely I appreciate the uh the time tonight I know this took a little bit longer than uh we anticipated but uh just like we've been doing we'll coordinate through Kyle and as we revise our drawings we'll get we wait to from you guys before we appreciate you being here and addressing this U long overdue conversation thank you gentem have a good night all right now we are up to uh item six finally the uh quarterly board reports starting with the board of adjustments Mr Kelly I'll I'll give you a couple couple of minutes to clear clear out before you guys are fighting over the mic yes welcome good evening mayor good evening council members my name is Mike Kelly and I'm the board of adjustment chairman here to report to you about the activity we've had in the last quarter um it the last quarter but they hearing that we had two weeks ago is the only one for 2024 um last year we were overloaded with a bunch of pools a bunch of docks this year it's been kind of quiet and the case that we had was heard in June 13th was a front setback um as opposed to a doct or a pool um other than that we were said to lose one member of the board who resigned our them has resigned from Board of adjustment but it's on your agenda as you know upcoming soon with a candidate for an potential appointment as a new board member to fill our board for sep this board has two auxiliary members um right now we only have one since one of had moved up to a full spot um and the second gentleman has chosen not to go for that particular U full-time appointment as he travels too much he's not here enough so I I hope you see fit to app point the gentleman that's on your agenda later for a fulltime position on our board um there is another hearing coming up August 1st for a situation on Donado Drive um and involves a beach in one of those Coes that um I think there'll be a lot of activity and a lot of residents involved so we look forward to that thank you Mr Kelly uh do we have any questions or comments from the council Mr Roberts do you have any questions I have none thank you all right thank you Mr K appreciate you being here all right do we have anyone from the citizens advisory committee all right I don't have a report no report that's that's quite all right that's quite all right okay since we have no report from the citizens advisory committee uh let's move on to parks and W anyone here from Parks and W tonight that be me okay who do we have can you hear me I can okay I'm Pat Roberts from 102 20th Street chair of parks so last time we were together gave a report um about we were looking for Mir to do a mural on the Morgan Park restro walls so we have obtain a m John comr and he's presented sketches and that is $1,500 per wall it includes the prep work the paint and the sealings and he's ready to begin work at the end of July there should be sketches in your packet and it shows for the Gum Boulevard wall there's a turtle that says welcome to b beach and then there's the bathroom walls which is facing south there's palm trees and for the Oceanside wall it's Dolphins can you see all those yes we can okay at this time we have 2500 remaining in our budget and I understand that that may be adjusted to for the full cost of all walls being completed at one time are there any questions I I have a question was this ever going in front of the council to vote on of courage to to the when I was told it didn't need to be voted and last meeting when I told you about it you said you just wanted to see the sketches before we moved on that's my understanding so where we're at right now they have $2500 um that was allocated for the promotional events that they haven't spent we didn't know exactly what this total price was going to come to so there is money that they typically use for their budget um available but if you're looking at $1500 per wall you're going to need a little more um there is some just talking about repairs for the non departmental budget we've come under this year so there is some money to work with inside of that budget but it would be the council's decision to move forward so we can put it on a as an agenda item you like to officially I'd like to hear each Council member's opinion on on this project yes uh thank you Patty this is Kim aliot um I love the idea of the turtle um I think it it supports the work that a lot of people are doing in terms of saving the turtl mess in our community and so that's a great theme to to put out there um General comment on the Dolphins again love them it's great like the uh sea sea life on the side um just from this particular image you can't really quite tell if the uh right side of the panel is empty or what's going to happen there maybe a little a little blank on that on the um palm trees not a big fan of those just because they look rather commercial um it just looks like something that might come out of a a pre pre-done purchase that you could make for um that kind of image but uh thank you very effort because I think it would be a great addition thank you Mr Roberts you're uh you're sitting there with Patty right now I'd like to hear you weigh in on this also U thank you very much I kind of feel that RIS since I'm on a v so I am definitely in favor of it yeah I think they had I know the the um of conversations with the muralist different ideas seems to have some really good references um some buildings we've seen around locally here he he does great work and as council member Elliot said um you know I think it would enhance the appearance of Morgan par significantly so I'm in favor thank you Mr Roberts let's go to Mr Banker Kyle how much money do we bringing on I should know this morg par on par U for this following year we budget in our our revenues about 150,000 that's that's average make a motion $2,000 to this project I mean give them something back and what I I'm just asking questions uh the uh my only concern concern is uh is not necessarily um it's not necessarily about money um I'm trying to decide what we're what what is the goal of this other than beautifying are we calling people from go Boulevard to to come to Moran Park and spend their money uh on our beach I'm I'm just trying to grasp what it is we're trying to accomplish I I love the idea beautifying anything in b beach um but I'm not sure if we're saying calling all uh tourist to our private community so uh mie what's what's your thoughts on that well you hit it with the beautification that's where we came up with the idea I knew they had just completed the cleanup of Morgan Park and we were trying to think of other things that we could do and that was the idea that we came up with and the welcome to Belair Beach is anybody that pulls in there and they don't have to live in Belair Beach to park there but I don't feel like we're saying come on in we're just saying this is our beach and we think it's beautiful and the turtle idea was you know because we're trying to protect the turtles here on our beach that's why we chose the picture of the turtle what is the it's all about beautification what is the lifespan of the neural before it needs maintenance um he said 25 to 30 years wow okay all right um wel well this is b beach you know and there's a turtle you say welome um okay well I I really think that we should take a vote on it anyway just so that we go on rord um I I'm just going to be upfront about it I I like the idea of painting on three sides of the building I don't like the idea of that side uh but U Can we go on record or is that good enough I think everyone else is in favor of it I I agree with Kim on pal Tre well we can change that but you know um we got three ideas from him and we wanted it to be simple but still very much in nature so if you have an idea for the bathroom wall side or we can just do the two sides everybody loves a manate and we de deated on the dolphin manate and Ray so we could add one of the other you know the manate or the stingray I like man I'm I'm just I'm having a problem with the uh the go Bard side of of painting the go Boulevard side just because I don't want to attract more people to Moran Park um I think that we do we do well as it is and um that that's just where I stand I a motion we don't do that was the one that was the main one so that people did see it I I have to agree with the mayor on you know this we try to keep this as private as possible I mean the 3our time liit I like that so we have a motion on the table do I have a second what was the motion you have sorry not to do golf what if we just did the picture but not put Beach I think it's still um I'm sorry we have a motion on table right now we we have to decide if we have a second or not okay the motion dies all right uh well if that's the case it sounds like um you you guys can do whatever you like with this uh with this mural okay thank you and we will um and contining with my report in October we will be having the shell golf um and it's going to be football themed and it is scheduled for a weekend when the Buss are playing out of town so we don't interfere with people that want to go to that game so everybody needs to sharpen up their recipes for chile and sign up to participate or either just come and eat believe our weekend we chosen was October 13th that sounds good I happen to know somebody that makes good chili I know so you better sign up again all right thank you com py do you have an up a comment regarding for cting an announcement about that oh yes yes thank you we also have a new activity that Miss sha Elli had presented cport cting and it is going to be once a month and I don't have my notes in front of me since we're on this Ro believe it's July 29th is the first one it begins at 7:00 it will be on the back porch of the city hall and just come and visit with your neighbors you bring your own activities if you want we will have some cornhole set up and maybe a couple of other things long games but it's just a getting to know your neighbors similar to our picking up um litter on the beach but there's no work involved time so um that's July 29th at 7 p.m. the backside of City Hall thank you m Roberts I appreciate do we have any other questions or comments for this um Patty I was told there's no beach clean up this week uh the Fourth of July and there was there were some people on the June I was there in June but there was nobody there for the June Beach up is it going to be back to August now or yes the June room was up at City Hall instead that was posted on the um sign that they they met up at City Hall for the clean up behind City Hall that beach okay there was about six or eight of us that showed up at 19 yeah that it was changed and that was in the what do you call it online letter and on the sign but yes we canel because the Fourth of July and no one was no one was in town all right thank you Patty I appreciate it all right now we are up to Let's see we are up to the now we're up to Planning and Zoning we have anyone from planning and zoning no the chair is out of town but he did provide a written report that was included in the packet all right well that concludes our reports and now we are on to number seven apparently Mr MOA build us so much that he didn't want to be here so he sent in one of his Partners to take the heat Randy gets the going here I appreciate all right Mr Daniel I guess you're off the hook today I appreciate you being here this evening and uh now we're up to number eight city manager report Mr Reef for your up thank you man um R down the list gol Boulevard undergrounding project um phase one we're ready for D to get started on that um there's nothing really in their way so it's it's completely on their schedule uh for phase two uh we have all the condom in for the communication which is Spectrum um get an update U to uh to Spectrum as far as when they're going to pull their cables we're still expecting that within the next couple months to be done within this uh fiscal here um we're sitting right now sort of at a um standstill with the easement requests um the uh consultant of project manager uh undergrounding uh Utilities undergrounding in Florida they uh they been diligently trying to get the uh easement requests from residents residents do not want to give um easements for where Duke is um recommending that the equipment goes so we've asked Duke in our last meeting um for an alternative option um if they stand by that we need these easements then i' I've asked them to come to one of our meetings to explain this and bring some of those residents in as well because they that's we're going to get to the discussion moving forward the uh star water Improvement Pro project last Friday um the engineer Larry flu and I met with the contractor we are um in agreement of what they want um as far as getting those curvs in um um so that they can get them in the proper way the first time they install them so they've asked for that we do um give them the grades every 10 feet so they can have a surveyor out there stake the grades um and then uh that way prise measurements up and down each street because it is a very difficult terrain to to install the curb um so the engineer doing all the work on the front end for them to go out there and uh resume the project our goal right now is we've approved for the paving to get done on a Morgan Drive 25th 24th and Cedar sprs and Palm Drive um those are all to uh they've all been approved by the engineers so that we can have a Paving um completed and the uh you know grass and and papers restored those residents are happy um it's been a long time for them to we and then uh the first set of uh uh detailed grading plans are going to get out are going to be 14 15 and 16th I plan on uh meeting with uh the engineer and the contractor again to make sure that they have everything that they need um and then we can get out there and and resume the Cur work the uh now in the meantime I've asked them to fill CU they filled in front of the driveways with the road base um while we've been standstill but I've asked them to fill the rest of the trening just because we' getting a lot of rain and I've noticed that we're kind of getting some some water sitting and we get Ahad of it before we start getting some complaints on that the uh code review uh I've met uh for about 3 hours with Mr Sterno we went through all the recommendations he has everything he needs right now to start traing the ordinance is um to then go to attorney MOA for his review but I plan on bringing workable ordinances for Council discussion in August um so that we can be ahead of the game for um first reading after the the time period elapses for the hurricane and then lastly our RFP auditing um Services we uh we met as an audit committee and there's a recommendation an agenda item so wait till later that all right thank you do we have any questions or comments for the city manager I have comment yes um regarding storm water Improvement projects um I wanted to point out that our plans have consistently said that N Street would have been handled last September um waiting a long time for that initiative to begin um we appreciate the fact that had considered and are still working on looking at the pump to augment the thank you um but work was redirected North and I thought we were going to try to redirect it back to 9th Street once that work been completed so I ask that we consider not thank you Miss Elliot any other questions or comments Mr reer would you like to address her concerns um I right now I hesitate to go from 14 to 15 just because they already have been broken the curves been cut out and um they have gaps on the edge of their street so I think they're surprisingly being very patient um where we're at right now we get this figured outside they don't feel like it would be proper to to delay them from getting their CIT at this point and that it was delayed because of the plan for the top cor right no this is this is delayed from the confusion on um how how we want the valley curb installed the contractor was out there with one method which worked for the first six streets we got to a point we got to that 23rd no no I'm referring to 9th Street nth oh so the Ninth Street was delayed originally because um yes the palm station but I do know right now um we have an idea of we were working on getting like requesting the easement from the property owner had no luck with getting back um we had a meeting with them but I haven't heard anything um back from that property owner um so at this point I want to direct um layer fluid to design to go through the road but um where we stand in the project as a whole um we have run into some problems with the design of the curve and what the contractor wants to install properly so that has kind of caused more delay than we expected um I do know what N Street is is a very challenging Street being extremely flat so I know just from discussions with L fluty there's some Deion that might need to be made to start the curve replacement on that street um so yes if uh the con contractors in agreement after we finish 14th 15th and 16th I can recommend that we go to 9th Street but again that's that completely in our control all right thank you any other questions or comments for the city manager Ju Just A fation N wasn't skipped because of the issue already been SK and for some whatever reason I don't understand it went from 8 street after that the p is later but thank you for theind Mr manager that um yes those stre were already I don't know how they got up there in the first place back to N Street which is a disappointment but um not back whatever influence that have to that project thank you Miss just just a comment um I think nin Street will be the uh City done I mean if we were going to proceed the way the original plan was go for the a stre to disaster I mean so hopefully might have to wait a little Mr Roberts would you like to uh address the city manager no sir all good all right that's it then we'll move on to the city clerk report good all right hello Mr I I provided a written report and I have nothing

council's selection of a professional audit services firm and to authorize the city manager to execute an auditing Services agreement with the selected firm uh the audit committee's recommendation for City auditor is Wells Hower and chel EA at the for the amount of $32,400 Mr Reaper you have the floor thank you mayor just as a recap we uh issued the RFB on April 19th and we received five uh proposals on May 31st of of those five four of them were within our budget range and the audit committee had met and discussed their rankings which I provided for um as one of the attachments to score sheets and in doing so they made a recommendation to have the firm Wells Hower and shatzel Pa um as the uh the awarded auditing firm and included uh BS and shadel's proposal for youreview thank you Mr Raper let's go to the citizens for comments on this topic would anyone like to uh address the council see as we have noncitizen comments are now closed Council I'm going to need a motion to I'm sorry wrong uh wrong area here sorry um I'm going to meet a motion uh to uh select an auditing service and to authorize the city manager to execute the auditing Services agreement with the selected firm I think that what exactly did I say all right so that's quite all right I'm just giving you a hard time that's all right all right and the second was uh made by Mr Baker Miss Elliot you have the floor thank you um the uh selection committee uh is the standing commit says a Citizens advisory committee forget the name I apologize for that the citizens advisory committee is um composed of a lot of very highly qualifi people that did some very good work in doing this evaluation um so they sit as the audit committee and our ordinance provides that the chair of the audit Comm be a council member so I served in that capacity um each of the responses to the RP were evaluated in full uh it was a very good process um each uh member of the committee made an evaluation of those responses based on the criteria that were presented in the original rmp they uh those criteria are waited and each one was tabulated for individual we talked through all of the issues uh and the ratings were compile and the highest rated firm ended up being Wells Houser um we talked a lot about all of the candidates qualifications um but we determined that here when we're selecting an auditor the individual qualifications aren't as important the that all of them are going to have to be I CPA all of them are going to have to be able to follow the process all of them are going to be able to as follow the the accounting procedures so we looked at some qualified measures also qual qualita measures also um this is a smaller firm which we like our existing auditor is from a much larger firm and we felt like we W getting the attention that we really wanted uh from our auditor um we feel like we get the attention of the key decision makers and the key providers in this effort but it is a small because they're going to be the partners and not um a department head or a manager from a big firm's Department um he felt that uh this particular firm also represents many of our neighboring peer companies excuse me peer communities and they include seal old Bar South pasaden B BL and R Shores so they have a lot of experience in our space and the communities of our size um one thing that was very distinguishing about this firm is that they specifi that the work will be done on site do this remotely and that can be very effective um there's nothing wrong with doing this remotely but being on site might provide some additional insights um as well as the fact that this particular firm our CFO used to work at so we're guaranteed this is going to be my but we're confident that this is going to be a very goodable relationship their service was tagged at $322,200 that was not the cheapest of the responses but was all of them were within a fairly narrow range and was certainly within our projected budget of $35,000 so definitely support this C thank you council member Shaw Elliott do we have other comments from the council Roberts no sir all right um I like the uh study that was done I think it was very thorough I read through the notes and uh and it seemed U pretty obvious that um you guys did a great job and uh I'm just curious is there anyone here from The Firm this evening that would like to address the council yes sir please come up and uh and let's have your name and uh tell us a little bit about you and your firm excuse me thank you very much um thank you for the opportunity for our firm to having able to submit our proposal and and on keer shatel Wells house Shel um our our firm and myself we have Vol m m governments over quite a long period of time um in addition to the to our current client base we had indicated in our proposal we had one time for period of period of 10 years we had wanted to the city of T Springs period of 12 years we wanted to the city of so I do think that we do bring of small inity I think we do bring a good base of knowledge um as was brought out and I've always felt this way as long as I've been practicing CPA and auditor that doing an audit on site I think is very important I've used the phrase that if if you're not here on site it's almost like you're trying to work in the vacuum and U as Monitor and being present in the client offices you get to get to basically get a sense of get a at the tone at the top and you get a better opportunity to know the people and and I I think it just gives us a better opportunity to be able to serve you and if there areas where we where we feel we can make recommendations I think you're I think as or we a lot more have to be able to find those areas having a physical presence um I don't really have too much know too much much else to add to that um I think you'll you'll find that we I think we do a very thorough thorough job I've been accused of probably over auditing I think if you're a team local municipality and you're you're looking at how older people's money are being spent I think it's important and so we we have our approach to looking at excuse me looking at money is being dispersed we take a broad stample so I guess I would conclude that U again I definitely do thank the city council for the opportunity give us the opportunity to be able to serve as your own thank you Mr shatel and I agree with you that the uh the onsite audit is definitely the uh more streamlined more efficient way of doing things uh because you get caught up in this email back and forth constantly and we all know it's very time consuming uh sometimes it's a one one request at a time and it can it can multiply the amount of time it takes to get the job done uh whereas if you're in our building that's a uh much more efficent so I I greatly appreciate that and I definitely understand the attraction thank you very much for being here tonight do we have any questions or comments from Mr sh Mr Roberts no sir all right thank you sir and I guess now we will take it to a vote Renee council member bankard yes council member Roberts yes council member Elliott yes and mayor G yes yes so it's unanimous congratulations Mr sassel to you and your firm and we look forward to working with you all right now we are on to item number 15 this is consideration of resolution 224-1 this is
