i'm councilmember ockey aye vice mayor gunner aye mayor manzo so passes seven to zero the consent agenda is approved we move to our regular agenda item number eight consideration of ordinance 21-0-1 an ordinance of the city council of the city of delaware beach florida providing for the amendment of chapter 2 boards committees and commissions of the city code ordinances relating to the creation of an administration advisory committee providing for incorporation of recitals providing for the amendment of chapter two boards committees and commissions of the city code of ordinances relating to the creation of an administration advisory committee providing for a copy to be kept on file providing for several ability providing for the repeal of ordinances and conflict herewith and providing for an effective date the description is ordinance to develop a standing advisory committee for the continuity for the continuity for continuity and expectancy expediency we'll have a motion moved by vice mayor gunn i do have a one suggestion and i'll pitch that before i see if there's any consensus before i ask for an amendment and that would be rather than call it a administrative community call it a citizen's advisory committee i think that just speaks to communications not only to the residents but from the residents it gives them a formal engagement in city [Music] it makes sense i think that's what you've been talking about all along for the last two the citizens advisory committee and we have a second on that thank you seconds by the slope so now discussion on just the change name change any discussion of that no discussion citizens just on the name change anybody have any comments on the name change only come back to you uh going by the last word on that and i'm going to take the book to make just the name change and then we'll go the whole thing okay so the amendment before us is to change the name from the administration advisory committee any place that appears in here i'm not going to read at all i'll try and do it on the first pass but that would be changed to citizen advisory committee a yes vote will approve that name change only madam clerk on the amendment only council member aki aye council member spoke aye council member shirley aye councilmember davis all right council member bean aye vice mayor gunn aye mariana hi so the amendment passes is now going to be called the citizen advisory committee we're back now to the discussion that we've initially had which is the formation of this committee and the consideration importance 21.1 when you started this you kind of started with the amendment so i'll come back to you if you have any thoughts to complete on it before i have nothing further i do agree i think this is a good committee i think it will save us a lot of time um my only question is just in the administration of this committee and it really comes down to how the um the city collects the information it's a very important committee and it asks for people to be very well-rounded i think our present application that we use it has nothing to do with this ordinance but how it's how we're going to enact this ordinance it doesn't really provide it says attach a cv or resume if you want i really think on this committee we need to see what the background is we're asking for people to be very well-rounded have a great background i think would be nice to know what people's background is sometimes you get kind of generic responses i think to some of the replies that we get it would really be nice to know what people's business fabulous city background is so it doesn't change this i think it just maybe puts a spot that it's kind of mandatory to give us your background something in their human type of job application oh and i agree with that it's a very important uh aspect of the city and its input so maybe we put a little more uh specificity to the vetting process and have them appear in person when and say a few words and give us an idea and ask answer questions i think that's excellent also and i also want to personally thank you i had my reservations about this but that it was a three-year committee i see that that has changed two years it's corresponding now with all our other committees i'm totally behind this anyone else on council i'll move to the citizens there are no citizen comments back to you glenn gunn for the last word before i call it no i would uh just speak to your fellow neighbors and we've had some great inputs from the residents before so if you're in attendance tonight and you have any interest please step forward and let the city clerk or the state manager know we certainly appreciate all the help and input we can get thank you thank you okay so i'm gonna pull the question i remember a consideration i'm gonna try and plan if i miss it you just feel free to cut right in here come and try and put citizen advisor committee in so consideration importance 21-01 an ordinance of the city council of the city of delaware beach florida providing for the amendment of chapter 2 boards committees and commissions of the city code of ordinances relating to the creation of a citizen advisory committee providing for incorporation of recitals providing for the amendment objective to boards committees and commissions of the city code ordinances related to the creation of a citizen's advisory committee providing for a copy to be kept on file providing for several ability providing for the repeal of all ordinances and conflict herewith and providing for an effective date um and i should point out that this is the first reading we'll need a second reading of this if it passes tonight so this is first three days everyone knows too important to get a passing ordinance we need two readings so this is the first one adam clerk uh yes yes we'll bring this to that second vote and move it forward council member beam council member council member shirley i'm council member slope i'm council member aki is seven to zero passes it'll be on our next agenda um for second reading if it passes then it becomes ordinance that has changed um madam clerk would you please for the next um make that change that we had with the uh with the citizen advisory committee and that's the only change that was approved yes thank you okay item number nine is consideration of resolution okay okay it's resolution 202101 a resolution of the city of bellar beach florida mending and restating resolution 2020-09 in its entirety authorizing the issuance of a stormwater utility system that you know in series 2021 in the principal amount of not to exceed 45 dollars to fund the acquisition and installation of capital improvements necessary to the provision of stormwater management services in the city providing that the series 2021 node shall be a limited obligation of the city payable from certain stormwater fees as provided herein providing for the rights and remedies of the owner of the series 2021 note making certain covenants and agreements in connection therewith and providing for an effective date description on this is it authorizes the issuance of the stormwater utility let me know not to exceed forty five thousand dollars do i have a motion i had a tie there um who's first uh one question for the city attorney you've read this through you're satisfied with it from a legal perspective yes sir okay you got a counsel comments citizen comments back to council ending with reuters this is item number nine oh what one other point uh this is supposed to remind me lynn told me that tonight we got a blue line copy placed on our desks here um section nine was amended by the instruction of the bank correct yes okay and then uh chris rose sent this amendment uh it's page eight basically it's just changes in wording [Music] yes yeah so so the change is it says in settling the rate of the storm order fee for each fiscal year the city shall ensure that the net revenues to be collected shall be equal or need to work equal to or exceed 1.25 times the annual interest and principal payments coming due on the series 2021 note in such fiscal year does that change anybody's ideas on this anybody want to say anything on council i would just ask for the uh for the benefit of the people who are in attendance tonight if the city manager could just take 30 seconds and recap what this is for just so that everybody in the audience understands mayor and council this is for the bond validation that we did earlier in the spring we went to court to get validated and this is one of the requirements of the bond it's a three-year loan uh the interest rate is 3.75 and as we already stated it won't exceed 45 000. we're going to utilize the forest to buy the uh check valves for the rest of the streets down and get a head start on up to 18th street to get a head start on putting those check valves in before we get to the point where we work on their stronghold system in the validation process that's kind of like a pseudo we bring suit against ourselves to make a legal determination of how strong this historical policy is occurring lynn i have one follow-up question to that this puts an obligation to us that our revenues to be collected um shall be equal or exceed 1.25 times the interest rate i i know this personally i don't think that's any issue but i just want to hear from you that that's not going to be an initial collection i think our estimated collections in like 170 000 years so it's that's well over 100. okay i'm going to go back to the citizens in case there's any comments because i just added that is there anything from the citizens back to council let's call this so item number nine is consideration of resolution 2021-01 a resolution of the city of bel air beach florida amending and restating resolution 2020-009 in its entirety authorizing the issuance of the stormwater utility system revenue node series 2021 in the principle of not to exceed 45 000 to fund the acquisition and installation of capital improvements necessary for the provision of stormwater management services in the city providing that the series 2021 vote shall be a limited obligation of the city payable from certain stormwater fees as provided here providing for the rights and remedies of the owner of the series 2021 note making certain covenants and agreements in connection there with and providing for an effective date a yes vote passes this there is no second reading madam clerk council member gavins aye councilmember shirley i council member spoke my council member augie i council member bean vice mayor gunn aye mayor this is approved um city manager you'll move forward with this thing yes okay i see the sheriff has arrived you're ready to give that report okay welcome come on happy new year and everyone um sorry for my targeting situation another city i feel take care of it real quick first but uh um uh we had a uh good ending to the year we had no other major calls month of december for what i could see so next month's report should be uh uh about like our normal report um for november 2020 we had um we did have uh one um larceny this month i can see that uh um we did have one arrest on a felony possession of control of substance uh one for possession drug prayer for am a dui that's only uh but there's only two people total arrested for the month of november for um our um regular monthly activity in this city most of it uh self-initiated once again mostly house checks direction patrols we did have uh 93 traffic stops uh this past month and uh there's only two crashes with and we had 124 citations and warnings issued in the month of november so hope everyone had a good uh new year david questions reference monthly report sure i did um and maybe it's just a typo replacement line but we have a felony uh in november 2020 it says forcible sex offense and you didn't mention that so i just wondered that's that's i i just went back to page one um i was looking the wrong month on that yeah i uh i will get some information on that for you um uh let me step in the background i did not see that report prior to now so i will look that up for you i'll get you information as soon as i can that's out of character for our city so if you can give us some information if we don't if you don't have it you know immediately you can just get into it um i i will uh get that for you before the end of this meeting okay that'll be wonderful just signal to me when you're ready if you have any if you want to speak again thank you um any counsel comments or questions uh citizens any questions for the sheriff it's great to hear that december was a good moment [Music] okay we're back to the regular agenda we're now on item 10. this is the consideration of creating a city of bellar beach policy to specifically address remote attendance as well as inquiring visible presence for the rapidly changing manner of conducting business electronically the description says to develop a concept for remote attendance by city council and the residents in alignment with the florida's government in the sunshine law and budgeting acquisition and implementation of the necessary equipment so first lab motion this will make some motion i think that was mars or was it dave fight it out march i'll go to read as well uh yeah i first would like guys can you put this on the agenda that was that was me and i'll go ahead and decorate invites america thank you if you if everyone will dig through their respect of the enclosures in front of them they'll find a full feature with just some slides so i'm going to put notes and thoughts for everyone i just want to make sure that jody can hear me on the phone sometimes i know being on the other end there it's kind of tough here yeah it's very difficult yeah okay i'll do my best here so i'm looking at the the slides there's two slides on each page i'm sure i'm not sure it's enough for the audience or if there's any out there but in essence what i'm trying to do is just bring the city policy into alignment with what we've been basically doing doing during all the emergencies and as i started doing some research on this thing what i find is a lot of other municipalities have been had standing policies in effect since the uh the 2010-2014 time frame what we've been doing isn't isn't far from uh what the norm is on this thing but along with everything else that i've always been preaching is i would like to institutionalize this policy i would like to have it in writing so that everybody can refer to it and know exactly what the foundation is and the principles from which we operate so let me just run through this very quickly that the goal of this whole thing is basically to develop a concise common sense written policy that outlines attendance including that electronic at public meetings for the elected officials as well as the residents if you go through the second page there the third slide the policy should and what i've done [Music] okay so to just encapsulate some of the things we're trying to capture with this we all lead very busy complex lifestyles and this really dovetails very nicely with just just the way we work and live today as well as how we conduct business so in essence this policy should number one enable the effective and efficient conduct of city business we definitely need to align with the scope and intent of all the florida statutes the bel air beach charter and code requirements and of course our strategic plan we we hope to foster participation by elected officials and residents and when i say residents it's not only to attend these meetings but prior to this we have been a little tight on attendance requirements so that precluded busy working people who have busy traveling for participating in municipal government and hopefully this will maybe bring some of those people into the poll the policy needs to engender a sense of community promote two-way communication discussion feedback and the positive exchange of ideas and of course as we found out during this whole covert the augment safety and the flexibility in case of emergencies so far as the background goes need to go out i've done a cursory benchmarking of some other municipalities and i've actually closed a resolution there from illinois and it dates back to 2014. so this is nothing new people have been doing this for a long time and as i address some of the things we need to include in the signal you can see right in that resolution that it hits on most of those topics and we can probably use a lot of the other municipalities as a boilerplate for what we want to do and really kind of speed up this process in the previous background information that was sent out there was a white paper by this uh robert eschenfelder and again it goes back to 2010 and he discusses the modern sunshine laws in florida and how attending public meetings electronically is basically consistent with all the sunshine requirements imposed by the florida statue in the white paper he did talk about a quorum and his recommendation is to leave it unless we find that the florida statutes have changed since 2010 but to go ahead and leave those as an in-person requirement so that in other words a meeting is not considered a meeting and not able to transact business that's binding on the city unless you have a quorum in person at the meeting place sunshine requirements just a quick overview meeting held at an accessible public place where public officials may hear each other and all other speakers and in quasi-judicial matters public officials and the parties can see exhibits and other evidence obviously these are all things we're going to strive for [Music] we would like to be able to not only see and hear all the other elected officials but the residents need to be able to see and hear us and if they want to speak and engage the city council then they need to be able to do that and we also need a format so that we can present documents and that sort of thing for everyone to view so far as the next steps go draft review edit and enact a written policy that addresses the use of electronic technology for these purposes i took an educated guess three months and i think that's just the the most time frame i think if we can find a good benchmark and use their boilerplate we can speed up this process very quickly we want to be able to cover such things as attendance quorum voting procedures and resident participation and lastly outfit the council chambers with the appropriate technology to allow an interaction of in-person attendance as well as a remote electronic attendance city manager and staff has already started that he's got a big screen ready to go in the back but i think we need to just kind of sit down and conceptualize how best to do this we want to be able to see each other even if we're sitting up here if we're sitting at home citizens should be able to see us and speak and then we need to figure out how we're going to work the process who's going to actually staff this thing and control the inputs from the citizens and that sort of thing i broke it down conceptualizing determining the procedures budgeting doing the initial acquisition and staffing and training the personnel i come up with an outside figure of 10 months i think we can easily shave it down so we're probably talking anywhere from nine months to a year or a little more than that and that sort of approach could obviously be phased in i mean tonight we've got uh shirley calling in our diamond so we can start wrapping this thing up and just understand how how where we are now and where we want to go and how we're going to get there so that pretty much covers all that there is one baseline thing left and that's in the actual uh section 2-59 in our charter that talks about the essence of a quorum the first section addresses the makeup and the purpose of a quorum and then the last portion of it talks about and i i can read that verbatim in the absence of a quorum that mayor shall have the assistance of other council members present compel the attendance of the absent council members which shout the land meeting for no longer than 30 minutes now to me that's kind of a loose end to this thing we've had numerous discussions with this thing and there seems to be perhaps some disagreement in how that's to be interpreted or what that actually means so i would like to take the time and a couple minutes of discussion here to figure out what everybody's thoughts are on that as i read through that it's a multi-part kind of requirement there that the first part is it's at the insistence of other council members present it's not a unilateral decision of any member present to decide what the action is that's going to be taken the second part that is kind of nebulous to me is this word compel i'm not quite sure what that means and i think we need to perhaps open up the discussion to figure out what that's supposed to mean and then the third part of it is uh basically it's not to be delayed for any longer than 30 minutes so at this point i can open it up for discussion um so back to council comments i'm going to jump in here i stick with the idea of the of the remote meetings um i think other cities are doing it other groups that are on our boards of doing it a couple ideas some places some of the boards they want will mandate a certain number of in-person meetings and the rest can be virtual okay we ran this city for six months on virtual meetings and you know it started off rocky because nobody knew what was coming and we ramped up and by the end i think we were doing very well with it um so it does work i don't think if there's anything that compels right now i think the idea and i look through this with the charter and our organization i think the idea right now is that we'd be here in person but i don't think that's a requirement that we're stuck with we can change that and based on that law article that he sent out they said basically that the attorney general apparently is all over the place on their interpretation of it um but they said that you know basically a quorum doesn't necessarily have to be in person it can be a meeting of members so i think we can look at this because it doesn't have to necessarily be in person it doesn't have to be in person every single time the technology we have at least the scalping of right now and we can probably expand that better there was something in this article that i thought was very good you know a lot of us are technology we like it there's other people who don't own a computer or smartphone um we have to if we're going to do this have an ability to have somebody here and we're usually somebody at headquarters where you come in there is a computer available to you if you don't know it so this gives the citizens the opportunity to come in but i think we can even think outside the box and think to maybe making a certain number of these things virtual we get 10 000 cases a day of covered right now i hope to god it's cured within a few months but was just talking with city manager you can't even get an appointment to get a shot right now so it may not be cured as quickly as we hoped for it so we could think about this long term and there's no reason we can't change this um in terms of timeline the only other comment i have is that the ordinance the i think we have to change ordinances so you'll get two readings on that but we the the nucleus of this is a good idea i think we can flesh it out as a council to the detail on it so um as for 2059 i'll tell you what paul marino told me a former attorney he said basically if the city council is sitting home he could compel their attendance which isn't totally correct because it says somebody else has that has to be brought by the people that are here compel their attendance and basically actually have them brought to the meetings i think that's a very severe thing but at the same token business has to be done people can't boycott meetings so i would hope you never have to use something like that i don't care if you take it out or not but if you get a council that decides to stay home there are new rules you have four absences before they're off council so it could be months that this city is deadlocked so that's fine okay i'll take i'll take those in the order you presented them number one is i mean i i think if you go back and you read that let's go back and let's get all the council comments and then i'll come back to you on the second go around actually goes back to read and then works its way back down anyone else i'm sure um facing uh the problems that the country is going through right now i think overall we've done pretty well to adapt whenever we're all out of the building we also seem to do very well whenever we're all in the building the one problem we have is the mixed setting you have some people here there's some people on the phone and you're always going to have people that are at home that would uh prefer not to come in that are interested in in our meetings so in a nutshell the piece that's missing really is is something to support some type of multimedia device here which we've discussed a little in the past it wasn't it wasn't the correct solution for us and i'm not really sure what is the correct solution as far as this understanding of the compelling council members to attend i'm not sure if we've really had this has been a major issue for us it it barely came up it came up almost once so hopefully it will never come so you know i'm a little i guess i'm trying to figure out where this actually came from why this was included uh in this presentation but beyond that i'm all for this moving into a solution uh for for our future because uh like you say cases are ramping up even if they slow down i don't think we're going back to what we used to know for anytime soon so i'm i'm awful i agree with what dave the thing we have to do is get the technology in place so that like the situation we have tonight with the council on survey it'd be nice to see her on video and back and forth and again with any call-in callings that we have the same the same way i think it can be done with this application everybody said what i was thinking and they can't hear you either so could you speak a little louder okay yeah wait here we go is that better well that's great here we go thank you that was okay okay so what i was saying was i said that you know just to the point of the subject spirit i heard mark speaking but only her very family did not even hear me or recognize me so it's very difficult when you call in i mean and quite honestly i'm sure that lincoln shared with you why i'm out but the leading amount is because i think i might have been exposed to compass and i didn't until the test come back from the people who think they might have it i didn't want to expose anyone else so i decided it was best to stay home um you know this is we all have life outside of being council members and so therefore i think it's kind of important to have some flexibility plus i think it's really important to have resident participation and i think you'll have more resident participation if we have some multimedia communication available rather than this calling which is very very very difficult to figure out so glenn thank you for bringing this to the council i appreciate it that's it jody thank you and i wish you the best i hope and pray that everything will work out okay for you and i'm sure we all do thank you we're we're going to go around second round and i think glenn i know you wanted to speak as as well vice mayor glenn head i'd like to say this is a very good presentation i do think it's very important to get remote and accessibility to our citizens that can't make it in i agree with the timeline and all of that and the purpose of it and i do think we need to look at equipment see what we do need to get as far as the quorum thing that did obviously come to a head [Music] i don't think anybody should be able to compel any member to come back in because actually it would be a violation of the sunshine law in my opinion for the mayor to ask any remaining council members here there isn't a forum here because you're not supposed to have any conversation so as far as compel the attendance i'd like to see that when you just take it totally out that's just given somebody extra authority to threaten basically to have other people arrested i mean vice mayor clinton you were threatened to be arrested on december 7th which is a very important day in our history for our military york obviously served in the military and thank you for that but to arrest the vice mayor of this city on december 7th was absolutely difficult to even listen to that so that's my opinion on this i'll take them in some of the order i i agree with the idea that in-person meetings are important but i think we need to have that flexibility and maybe when we construct this thing we come up with some reasonable schedule maybe once a quarter once a semi-annual period you have a requirement for a full council meeting in person that's to be decided on this i think if you go back and you look at the law article and it's going to be up to the city attorney to probably research and find out what the latest attorney attorney general opinion is on this so far has happened the fellow who wrote that white paper suggested you leave quorum in person to avoid any conflict if at a future date florida decides to stay with a in-person forum because that would mean that if you had any meetings prior to that it might invalidate any actions taken by the city where you did not have an in-person forum so that was merely his suggestion if you go back and you look through that white paper and i think if we can't find any changes then that may be a good good thing to think about is just stay with it in person [Music] this this idea of compel i i agree with what we just said and maybe it slipped some memories but there was a very strong arm state made at a previous council meeting where there was a well if if you decide to leave the meeting i'm going to compel the sheriff to bring you back well i'm not quite sure first of all as i i said the the whole discussion about compelling is multi-part and it's not a unilateral decision made by the mayor it's made at the insistence of the remaining council members there so it's not a unilateral decision that's made secondly i would like to know what compelled means city attorney i'll i'll ask you hang on make your point we'll ask you you can ask the questions but you're speaking from that okay and i've made my point so i don't believe that that word compel means that you you ask not even ask i think they the the frame of reference at that point on december 7th was i'm going to direct the sheriff to bring you back if you leave this meeting and i do not believe has to be a proper interpretation of compel i mean in my mind means we can ask the city clerk or the city manager to call the council member to please return and like part 3 of 2-59 suggests if that can't be done within 30 minutes that's the end of the meeting so i would at this point ask the city manager what's his interpretation of compel and then i'm going to follow that up with the city attorney and then we can even ask the uh the supervisor of the sheriff's detail here we'll go through the council first and then we'll come back to their translator please note those questions i'm going to speak about what was said because it's information that's incorrect i want to remind everyone what exactly happened on december 7th and you can go back and look at the tape um and i've got robin asked we had four people here we were having a work session discussion um two individuals one individual was speaking a citizen i called a point of order i was interrupted by the vice mayor that's against our rules told me to let them speak or i will leave and you will not get a quorum i wouldn't say anything and then he said what are you going to do arrest me he stood up held his hands out and said he said what are you going to do arrest me i said go ahead and do it and watch what happens i'm going by what our former city attorney told me okay and the information is there now he sat down and he concluded the meeting but if people are going to act up and break porn and disrupt this meeting then we will do whatever is on the ordinance whether you like the ordinance or not it's still our ordinance if you don't like it we remove the ordinance there's a procedure for that too as for whether we i thought we were going to talk about meeting reload we did not talk about existing ordinances because that really isn't in here but since we're getting way off topic um we're going to talk about compelling attendance i already explained but i think the reason was i didn't pass that rule that was passed for the prior many many years ago and it's so that you can't have people sitting home we had two members of this council walk out that night prior to the meeting we had one member walk out in the middle you can't do business if everybody's going to go home ask for in-person versus not in person the florida attorney general's opinions are all over the place and i fred i i we can i i think it's unfair to place this on you to be the supreme court and figure out what they're trying to say i know they're advisory only but there's plenty of organizations in florida that are meeting without quorum right without in-person quora and this article said that we aren't going to do it it is not fair particularly in the middle of a pandemic that certain people have to come here and other people can take days weeks months away from the city and just choose to sit home i mean hey i like sitting at home i can sit there in my slippers and conduct these meetings i don't have to get into suit and tie it's really nice it kind of looks a little bit more difficult for those who do come here i do agree we should have at least one meeting per quarter maybe one meeting per half in front of the citizens no matter what um but after that there's no reason this stuff can't be done remotely and if we have to get the attorney general to weigh in on it i mean i think it's just a matter of us changing our ordinance anyway that's what happened if you want to change 2-59 there's an easy procedure for doing that take it away and then if people want to sit home then they'll sit home and you just won't conduct the business after four meetings that you miss then you're off council is that similar um no i was just going to kind of kind of did a little bit to clarify and dave said you know i'm not sure why this slide was on and i was thinking in my head it was on because of that meeting um the drama and i just wanted i wanted to point out that it's it's not a one-sided it was definitely heated on both sides and the only reason why it concluded was because i had to start yelling in the microphone and practically stand up and get in front of two boys pretty much it felt like misbehaving so i think that the issue why this was put on was probably more of a personal thing than anything else i to me compelled can be whatever it needs to be would you please return back to this meeting or we really need to vote on this we need a quorum hey can you just go pick him up and bring him in real quick with sirens blazing so he gets here faster i think again when i talked about the last man not a lawyer but it seems like every word you can interpret interpret it any which way so i don't think this needs to come out but what i do think that it never needs to be done it never needs to be used and i think that comes back to what fred was saying about reasonable people reasonable conclusions all act like adults stop getting tempers involved stop getting hurt feelings and stop bringing drama from past meetings back again that's what this slide is about past drama wine to relive it and quite frankly with these meetings i am so sick of the drama this is a tiny city our issues aren't nearly as huge as other the big cities i do not understand why we can't all be alone that's fine other council members on the second pass third pass counsel i think we have a problem with equating attendance to participation and that is not that is not true you can sit at home in your pajamas and participate in a council meeting okay so that basically goes to the argument of well they're not here they're not participating in the city of government and again you we have already enacted charter amendments to what happens when you're not participating in those council meetings so that's that's a movement i do believe that business should be conducted generally without threats and that's that should be how we conduct business and when when you subtract that out of the equation then things do get heated and tempos flare and passions override critical thinking and discussion so i again once again i want to make sure we all have a common baseline of what this compel is i think i think there's no reason we need to go through the imaginations of changing that i just think we need to understand what that means and i i don't believe that it's i can twist your arm and compel you and bring you back here forcefully to a meeting no that's not the general way we do business here and that's not the collegial way this this body should operate so i just want to make sure that that's that's a common baseline and i'll defer it to the city manager and the city attorney to see if i'm interpreting that wrong or if i'm just completely off the track so i'm still i'm still with council then we're going to roll over to you and we've done three passes so when i go back to city council the city of officials um attendance first participation one point and it's the only nonprofit you can sit here and other than voting you're not compelled to do anything other than not disrupt the meeting no one has to say a word you may not like the topic you just sit here you can doodle subject to public disclosure but you can sit and draw a sketch but as long as you sit here okay when you go home and that was not a televised meeting okay then you're not in attendance any longer and then we no longer have a horror so i have no problem where a person is joking shirley is on the telephone right now she is completely participating in this meeting to the extent she wishes to that's fine she doesn't have to say a word as long as she votes that's it so that's attendance first participation i don't think it matters where you are it really doesn't and uh i i settled with what robin said by the good comments counsel anything else i'm going to the city attorney and city manager if we don't have any other council comments it doesn't matter what it means to the attorney suit manager well i have a whole list of things okay um the the principal thing is state law which is the sunshine law and that that has the requirement that uh the meetings be in public and the criteria that vice mayor gunn delineated in his presentation there of course is for a violation of that there's a penalty and the penalty is a personal penalty to the seven of you who were the elected officials if you don't comply with the state law so to me that's that's the starting point the several people vice mayor gunn and mayor manzo have said the the same things that i have uh assessment i made reading the article that was the first time i'd ever seen an article that had all of those up to that point listed i had uh at one point or another read many of those attorney general opinions and the reality is they are indeed all over the place and the uh it's you know most um folks i hope realize an attorney general opinion is an opinion it doesn't have any uh binding authority to it it's basically a um the current city or excuse me current uh attorney general's of view of the law at that that point in time the ones that count or the case law and that the case law i would suspect is is also all over the place um i i want to point something out to me that's very significant about 2020 you had to adapt during the pandemic and the reason that you were able to do the remote meetings is because primarily the governor issued a series of executive orders that gave flexibility to the the cities and counties to have meetings to so that we could get through the cover period i as far as i'm concerned when the executive orders expired we returned back to the previous regulatory scheme or statutory scheme which was having the meetings in person so as much as you may want to revert to that period of time i would say absent executive orders or absent statutory changes i don't know that you're going to be able to do that i'm going to take a contrarian's view of all i've heard and i i want uh especially vice mayor gunn to know this i i read all the the material you provided and i i pondered it quite a bit over the last you know two weeks or so that i've i've had to ponder it um it's not the only thing i thought of though i thankfully had other things to think about as well but the contrarian's opinion is if you want the law there to be a change then my suggestion to you is you advocate the legislature to make a clarification that the basically is the argument that the the law should catch up with the technology and i i think i said before to this council there's always a lag between the technology and the law excuse me the other way around there's always a lag between the law and technology and technology is always in a race to catch up it never catches up because technology just moves too fast but i don't know the last time that the the um sunshine law related to public meetings was was uh revamped but i would say it's been long enough ago that a lot of the technology capabilities were simply not taken into account and the one good thing out of cove and if there was ever any was that you know people learn to work in a different manner including this council and other cities and counties all over the state of florida but my suggestion to you is um i i don't know that i'm that enthusiastic about creating a policy although if that's what you want to do i certainly will uh you know be up for the task my hard suggestion to you is to lobby the legislature to change the law so that it's a statewide wide issue this is not the only city that's grappling with this type of thing and i i think the the beauty in getting the law changed is it takes you out of the the potential for um somebody asserting that you're violating the law i'm i'm very much uh oriented towards safe harbors and the safe harbor that you you have when all seven of you are here is there's simply no issue but that with seven of you present there is a poor on the end there's full debate and discussion of every issue when you start to have one or more or three people be absent i think you get you know further away from the safe harbor i i personally would always encourage my clients to pursue the safe harbor um you know and limit the number of times you're going to venture far from it the last thing i will say is on the compel issue that's what vice mayor gunn recited what's in the city's code that's a provision that you can change if you want to because it's in the code and i will make the observation compel isn't defined and the code provision does not delineate the manner of the compulsion so when determined in legal uh evaluation when you the term is not defined then the general principle that is applied is that you use the generally general meaning that that word has compel could mean a number of things i've heard compel means the sheriff goes and does something the city manager makes a phone call the city clerk makes a phone call all of those could be a matter of compulsion but i will tell you and i don't mean to speak for the sheriff i don't speak for the sheriff they they have their own uh legal counsel they're constitutional officers but there's always going to be in my mind a separation of powers issue between um us or the in in this case the presiding officer directing the sheriff to do something i think you will get pushback from the sheriffs on that because they have to be independent if somebody's standing here that is completely unruly and completely disrupted and have disregarded every reasonable request for them to conduct themselves in a manner that uh befits the quorum of this type of a meeting then i think there would come a point where the sheriff would say the person is being uh disruptive and they would do something but i think there's uh you you get into a um potentially a difficult situation for them if you try to direct them to do certain things that's my view and at some point i may have to talk to their counsel about that if it is an issue i'll conclude my comments with with a in a way a question and my question is it it has this been such a problem up till now that you really need to do something create a policy to address a problem during the time that i've been here you've never canceled a meeting due to a lack of a quorum and you i think have always and then can speak better to this and i but the times where there have been people away on vacation or sick you've had them the council members communicating with either patty lynn or both and you've you know worked things out so that you you didn't have a meeting where a lot of people came here and you simply couldn't go hold the meeting so i'm asking the question is is it really that big of a problem that you need to do something different and if it is and it's a concern that is a concern for the future i'm i'm all for being aware and planning for the you know how to do things better in the future i i think applaud mayor or vice mayor gunn that that's absolutely an issue you should be constantly considering but i again will end with is this really that big of an issue so you imagine do you want to add anything yeah my my thing with this zoom or whatever you want to call it i think we found out a lot of things over the past few months and i had talked to our i.t guy about what would i need to do because i think we gained a lot of public input when we were on those meetings and i think that is an important faucet that we need to go forward and move forward to do something in here that we can do that the console is going to go to ipads here probably in the next few months just that's part of the budget process and i think the opportunity if there's a way for the public to see you visually and they're at home and they want to call in and talk to the meeting because they don't you know they can't get here for whatever reason if there's something that's important i think it's important that they have that opportunity and i really thought that we got a lot of people a lot more people than what we got here tonight uh 10 people okay roughly we had more than 10 people on the zoom calls so what that tells me is we need to move forward and try to create something and how we do that is i think what the vice mayor is kind of proposing is to figure out what's the best way to communicate to the citizens and what's the best way for the citizens to communicate to you and you know if you're out of town uh as an example like in jody's case tonight we need to have that opportunity to make sure that she's heard the possibility she's visible if it's attainable i think those are the things that going forward the council needs to to try to get in what i'll call the uh electronic age and i'm not in the electronic age well i guess i am sorry um you still have a flip phone well i have my personal phones but i have a lot of you know i use the ipad regularly and things like that i have a flip phone because that's what the city provides but uh i think this is a step forward and and i don't know what you know i kind of heard that from the rest of the console that this this is a positive step forward and how we create the policy as far as the quorum and the issue i read that article actually twice and the guy there's differing opinions on many many things in that article they were all over the place and so i think going forward we need to look at this in some way and the first policy may not be all encumbering but it's it's got to be started at this point i think um [Music] one second joey let me just get when finished and then i'll come over to you uh as far as the compel i i have to go along with this compels of a word uh i think that the comment that it says of the assistance of the other council members present i don't think any of us would want and i would say from the statutory office of the sheriff i don't think i could i don't think any council member could i don't think the mayor could direct them to go get somebody from their house i just don't think that and i've had a couple conversations with them and that's pretty much where they're at with it so the definition of compel maybe we need to put something here and it's what has been telling me that could be what needs to be done and it needs to be clear if this is going to be an issue that's that's my opinion yeah i just did um a little bit of what lynn was saying you know this is the first time i've ever called in it it is extremely difficult to participate from this end i don't see the electronic communication being a replacement for one meeting and you know maybe that's where when we look into this further we address that in the case we're proudly because people are still in business of living life you know don't forget this is a non-compensating position um so you know it's not as though in my days volunteer or it will not although we are elected officials we are still a volunteer position and that we giving our hours and our time to just speak into the residents about our beach and so there are times you can't see a needy i find um the fact that we can't call in and participate sure i just find it unbelievable since we haven't given documents the technology to provide services for a council member let alone a resident who wants to participate so i mean it's really important but again most students as a replacement but this would be a situation and like driving or someone's traveling or you know call away or you know what have you they still have to be ready to participate thank you um city attorney i after hearing your comments i i think um i have to our protection always comes when we're siding with what our city attorney tells us is an interpretation of the law so you're feeling that you know there really isn't the option at this point in time for the city council members to routinely participate you know in quality quorum outside of the building then to me it's a non-starter that's to me i don't know what everybody else feels but i would not vote for something like that um however um i you know i i i think when it comes to the citizens there's no such prohibition so to the extent that we could and i agree with them news what he said we counted 10 people here tonight such a decent attendance everybody here is at risk and i applaud everybody for coming out tonight but you know you're putting yourself at risk of clothing to come to a council meeting wouldn't it be nice if you could be watching this on tv um victor invited me one time to take a look at indian rocks the technology is there we did it in the middle of the summer i was watching their meeting from my bedroom okay i never have to leave the bedroom i was i don't think i was able to participate i think he got that later on but um you're able to do it if you want so no reason citizens can't do it even if we can't um i am concerned uh and i don't describe any nefarious motives or anything to this but there is some concern about people who might be on council who might be not here for extended periods of time clearly what councilwoman shirley is going through tonight is exactly what is envisioned by the attorney general's opinions there's a documented medical reason and thank god you know hopefully she'll be okay but don't come in okay you know that's a good situation but um you know if you're away for a week a month a year that's a whole different story and i think that is a possibility as i look at what might be coming down for this city down the road for some individuals depending on what happens in the coming elections so it is something to think about i don't know if people should be permitted to have extended absences if everybody takes a vacation jody's right it's a non-compensated position go take your vacation but if people are gonna be gone for an extended period of time and that's something that has to be discussed on the council as to what the visibility should be i don't think we're going to resolve this tonight um this is a discussion thing so we might want to bring this to a work session but it's only seven o'clock so i'll entertain as much discussion as people have it's relatively early in the night so next sheriff did you want to speak on this issue you want to have your information or do you have to leave uh i i had something about it i got to take care of the meantime you want me to just he just wants to give us a piece of information i think it's going to take a minute does anybody have an objection sheriff come on up we're going to break and go back to the sheriff's report i referenced our report last month um i'll be able to find it i can't give you a lot of details of all the juvenile but uh the long and the short is that uh a juvenile was having some uh was in some therapy i remember didn't say that occurred back in july um on supposedly on beach and went to a house maybe involving some drugs and alcohol which ended up um you know involving a sexual encounter eventually and they were embarrassed about it and they at the end of the day they didn't investigate parents who want investigated but uh um and so it wasn't taking any further but we don't know exactly where it occurred either but it was reported because the person lives in the city um they sent a card on each and a house but we didn't even find out where those locations were so it was attributed to your stats however that doesn't mean it occurred here anyway if it occurred okay does anybody else have any questions council thank you for the follow-up on that really appreciate i think it sets us all at ease and hopefully the person will get the help against you okay absolutely thank you okay back to our discussion there's no one on the floor to address the city attorney's comments one is this a real issue yes it's a real issue we hit our stride at the end of the executive orders by the governor allowing us to take this to some meetings and sort of thing we were really beginning to hit our stride on that and now we are backsliding with this we've got jody calling in on a phone call who can barely be heard either way so obviously we're backsliding there and regardless of how this goes we need to get the technology in place to allow our residents to participate in this thing and again participate and attendance don't necessarily equate to one another okay the second thing is to advocate taking the legislative route well this is a legislative route here and it's within our sphere of influence and if you want to talk about lag let's talk about the legislative process at the state level or at the federal level here why not legislate at within our shared influence when we get things moving within two to three monthly council meeting cycles rather than trying to ramp up a entire state or forward the biggest cities thing you want to talk about glacial speed we want to talk about lag well by the time we get something moving at the state level on this sort of thing we will all be gone okay that's all i'm gonna sit down now i'm just gonna say going back to this overall issue i'm in total support of updating our technology so in the rare cases of like you know for example like jody tonight um or our residents able to participate if they're not able to come but i'm not necessarily in favor of complete remote attendance as in i don't feel like coming in tonight because whatever so let me just do it and it'll still count or you know i mean you all have vacations but hopefully you don't have vacations more than four of the meetings so it shouldn't be an issue if you missed one because of vacation i have but you shouldn't be able to go to a second home be a snowbird for six months and do your meetings from there because you ate them out in the city and b if that's what you're signing up for if that's the lifestyle you want to leave more power to you but maybe this isn't a position for you because you need to be involved and um going back to the glacial speed i agree the government all over the country is very slow but my interpretation of what fred was saying is that you don't want to be the first city to do it and something happened where it turns out to not be legal and then all our meetings don't count and our votes don't count at that so it's kind of more to me i interpret it as a safety in numbers if ten cities did it together then you have more of a leg to stand on but i know i agree with you everything's slow and i don't think this is going to get resolved on the state level anytime soon but i think we definitely need to update the technology but as far as allowing remote attendance at the whim of a person because you just feel like it you don't feel like coming in no special instances yes like so i don't know how to reword that but that's just my input council comments before you've been up to the citizens yeah and a good point there and i would recommend that you go through and look at the boilerplate resolution that are provided because there's actually guidance at the city level for determining what's an excusable activity so i agree with it it shouldn't be at the end of this and i think people come to this job to do the best job possible and i think most people feel here that there's a a huge benefit to coming out and meeting the public and the residents and this is how business gets done it gets done in person so uh what i would suggest is that we go ahead and take a look at the boilerplate and try to come up with a solution but i think it's something that needs to be done i think we need to do the technology side of it and we need to have some allowances for people to excuse themselves and attendance and yet still participate not be physically present but participate in the governance of our community council on the last round here so now i'm open up the citizen comments victor i apologize if i knew i was going to address the city council i would have put on a time but while i'm not technically a city of your a resident of your city um i'm hearing this discussion going back and forth and i'm i'm my mind is turning because you guys are reinventing the wheel i have other towns that i work for that employ me to do these services for them and one of them is city of indian rocks beach and basically what we have set up there i spent a lot of time with city manager greg mims over there and we had the same discussions back and forth what they wanted to do and have participation and have audience participation and what we set up was a zoom meeting and basically i have my cameras that i connect to a computer that streams live to youtube to facebook to zoom all at the same time uh so anybody can tune in and watch it and then whatever is going on in the city council is like a active participant so the viewers can see my camera focusing on who on whoever's talking whether it's a resident that's attending they also open it up for a limited audience but that to me would be what you guys are looking for because it just connects everyone and people can come to the meeting or not come to the meeting if a commissioner is is exposed to covet or feels not safe then they can just connect to the meeting from their house and do it that way but whoever's speaking at the actual meeting is captured on the cameras with the system that i have set up for them so um so i just thought i'd share even though i'm not a resident i don't speak no thank you so perfect any other citizens i'm gonna bring it back to council and i will say that again victor's invitation in the summer time when we were exploring zoom and the other stuff i did sit in on one of those indian rocks then it worked fine worked real fine so it was just like being there and i wasn't there so um that technology is here he knows it um i'm not saying you have to use him but he did a great job of keeping rocks anyone else i i think at this point i mean i don't think we're going to go through this resolution and pick it apart tonight it seems to me that there's interest at least in consensus if i hear everyone correct i'm not speaking for anyone but my understanding but i think we definitely want to look at the technology we definitely want to discuss this some more and i think this definitely should get into a little our next work session and try and hammer this thing out so we can bring it back in and see what you know what to do in the meantime perhaps the city attorney again i'm not asking you to be the supreme court i looked at that thing and you know there's 10 different opinions and ten different reasons and one says you have to be sick and one says you have to be working i mean i don't know what we'll do with it but we're gonna i'll tell you one thing whatever you tell me as city attorney is where the protection lies and that's where i'm gonna go with it myself so my response to that would be that the real key between now and when you next just discuss this is for me to look and see if there's what case law is there and i mean you've looked it up this in your job i look up stuff there are times you you may find three cases and there's fines times there's 200. and i don't know which one this will fall into but they're you know there's typically at some point if the statute has been around a while there's a dispositive ruling somewhere along the line and that that pretty well sets the benchmark and until the legislature changes the law again that's that gives you the the criteria that you should be applying so that that would be the thing i will do and then you know come back and be ready to tell you uh this this is the criteria that you really ought to be focused on isn't enough is it [Music] the other thing i was going to say is that the the discussion kind of changed and my question is is now do you want to do a policy related to the establishing a quorum or do you want to do a policy that relates to putting in place technology so that citizens can participate from from a remote place and to me those are two different kind of things i think it's all on the table i think we brought it all out so i don't think anything was excluded at this point other than the idea of us probably meeting remotely unless unless we can get something a little bit more firm in terms of case law but i think everything at least employer did everything was on the table so i don't think we've excluded anything and i mean in terms of creating a city-wide policy you know rita sol had brought this motion but we can at any point pull this question and move this thing forward but i think where it's moving is not saying we're definitely creating the possible we're moving it into a detailed work session with a little bit more information from you and maybe a little bit more chance to review this resolution that glenn glenn gave us think about this s'mores and we understand exactly what we're looking for how we're going to deal with this um because i i agree i mean stuff comes up you know people do have business arrangements and what are you supposed to do you shouldn't have to forfeit an otherwise good career on council if you get called away for a couple of weeks you know so i i think we should be as flexible as we could be within reason that's reasonable what did you say reasonable people doing reasonable thing and something like that so that was a famous quote i thought it was yours any other counts of comments we just hope you have the last word well i would like to obviously see us move forward with this so i'm just going to ask that we do put this on the work session and get some information as far as costs to update our equipment or that gentleman can provide us with the proposal on he what he can do and what he can't do and then at that point we can look at getting um a change made that is sufficient for citizens as well as the forum and all of that so we can take care of it all that's all so if i get this correct we're going to the question was to consider um consideration of creating a city bill or beach policy to specifically address remote attendance as well as a quorum physical presence for the rapidly changing manner and conducting business electronically so and can anybody jump in if i'm saying this wrong a yes vote we'll get this into the committee get fred riley working on this victor if he wants to do a little presentation or some information to us show us what you've done in indian rocks i think that would be helpful everybody get a chance to review this resolution so we're not killing this we're just moving it to the point i guess the next level and i think that's what what we were seeking initially okay so is that correct i stated it correctly okay the matter clerk please call the wrong yes vote will bring it forward council member shirley yeah council member smoke yes council member aki yes house member b [Music] council member aye mayor hi so this will move forward to our next work session mr riley as we discussed please good luck whatever research you can come up with any case law or what any other cities may have done would be helpful victory you have the opportunity just work right through the city manager given whatever presentation or come to that meeting and if you have the ability show us what you've done or you know get everyone in on them at the council's pleasure okay thank you all right so that concludes item number ten uh net item number eleven is unfinished business do we have an unfinished just just one thing i want to bring up is the sign i gave you a packet a couple weeks ago gave you some quotes and i i guess what i'm trying to do is find out from the council so we can go forward with this the sign's been gone for 60 90 days and i think it's time to do something and i know there's mixed feelings about it and i don't know if you brought your pictures with you tonight but if you do this this was the scenario that we gave for the digital or electronic just with words not with flashing pictures not santa claus or any of that and this is the side which is kind of a mixture which means not much worrying that's going to go in this digital and it's still i guess i look at it it's still a sign like we had before and i think just my recommendation is the digital side provides a better opportunity for things that happen like a hurricane or information we can get out we can get on there remotely we're not talking about putting pictures up there or anything we're talking about putting words up there so this uh the sign if we even took the digital off and just did this it's thirty thousand dollars save it again we need to hear that number if if we took the digital office and just made it similar to the sign we had before the estimate that the guy gave us was forty thousand dollars of course it's going to go out to bid this sign is about thirty seven thousand the duplicate sign is uh mixture and one is 45 000 because it's a mixture some so uh what i would like to do is get this thing out to bid it's going to take some time we've got 30 000 in the budget and we're probably going to receive 10 to 11 000 of the insurance so i think we've got the money to to do the project it's just i need the consultation and we have to give you this new resolution or some other type of formal instruction given the dollars well you'll have to approve the bid once it's out there and you've already owned the resume for a bit i just want some some consensus from the console where do you want to go with this it's time we've been back and forth on this for i don't know several months let's take consensus the hybrid one let's go give these prices again full digital is 45 000 no no the digital sign the estimate he provided us was 37 000 that's that's the estimate he gave us when we start mixing that's when the prices go up because you're doing some of this and some of that and he gave us prices of 45 and 47 for mixing them then he gave me a price for just what i'll call the old sign where you had go out and put the letters up and do things like that and that was three thousand dollars more than the digital sign it's less than a you know so plus it's old technology old technology yeah so uh this is a no-brainer you know i know that some of the concern by the council was the fact that um we're going to put something like disney world up there and that's not the intent the intent is letters not you know santa claus or uh you know whatever you want so i'm just asking the council to kind of give me some direction the uh communications committee recommended that we go to the digital side that they did recommend that so i'm just asking you to give me some feedback so we can put this out on the street and see where the numbers come actually is there's a neighbor keeping the old sign you know the old style side but if it's going to cost us digitally more work that doesn't make sense so i i don't think it makes sense to do that that's my opinion so you know i'm actually in favor of the one where you can add the verbiage down here for emergencies like the hurricane and stuff but this is the one that i would like to go ahead and look at it was only what do you say about two three thousand more no no that one's up in the mid 40s it's several thousand more what you're doing is you're mixing stuff yeah you're still going to pay the premium for the the uh what i want to call the the electronic message portion which is just this and then you're going to pay on top of that to put this up there also and your space is limited also okay but going back to the safety of our community it'd be nice to have that in case you know it is an evacuation plan or something like that so with the safety of the community i really think we ought to go ahead and spend the additional money and get the one that we can make an announcement when something is really important i just think you're going to get the same message out with the other something was important you could change the color of the text right and that sort of would would give you the same effect yeah when there's an emergency like a hurricane like we had uh let's see six weeks ago you know i could be sitting uh i could evacuate and be putting a message up there telling even though there's no residents here well the ones [Music] well that's a good idea that since we can change the color of the letter so i don't think that i would say save the eleven thousand dollars and go with the digital i mean that will solve everything you change the colors make important things stand out more advanced textures okay so it's hard to decipher because [Music] the informational board i think doesn't look near me at night as the one that's just strictly digital and you know what i'm not saying in the digital time as long as we are only putting a digital lettering in there that's not a constant speed of information it's stationary you know we need to talk about that what talent is going to be um you utilize but because it is digital the message can move we can't put pictures and images out but it can look like the new world or it can be a stationary message and i think that as long as you put some uh guidance in place you'll want that messages current launch to whoever happens to decide what they want to put up there today that's probably this is signing with me only digital information is probably the best looking choice and it doesn't look nearly as busy as the one that's a multimedia one so that's my input any other council comments and i am going to open this because we're going to take a directional vote here so i'm going to open up the citizens if there's anything we normally don't do this on unfinished business but we are this time because we're voting citizens any comments on this okay then we'll come back to the council if you're ready you can go to i can vote in my price straight digital however we want to talk about it well no just to clarify this is what i'm going to put out to bid because this is from the estimates from one vendor we might get a better price right you know so we've gotta give you direction of which one we wanted to put out today yeah so this is what i recommend that street i call that the street digital one yeah thirty seven thousand dollars on this with this vendor right okay anybody else have any comments not we'll just have patty take it one at a time the only only comment i have is it's a it's a hard pill swallow and it's very expensive it has to be done and i think that's probably the best case scenario how do we just take it by person just ask them what they want let's make sure we're clear and we'll tally the votes here council member street digital number three digital straight digital right or next spring picture council member guys 37 000. [Music] [Music] we'll put it we'll put it out to bed you've already authorized me to do that thank you i had two items of unfinished business from the last meeting minutes um just a quick update if you can give them to us and there's one of them if you don't want to talk about it don't say anything the first one was the meeting with matt mcnally uh regarding the code revision change i think he was the man who came in here he's asking us to actually change our code and then we put an option for him to meet with yourself and councilwoman surely he was an option i don't know if it ever happened just follow it up yes we we did meet with him and our engineer and i had a discussion with fred about the definition of habitable space and i think we've rectified that i will tell you that over the holidays they came in with multiple other versions of questions about what our code says and what they would like to do so this he didn't really spill the beans i guess is what i'm saying he he did a one hit and now we're gonna do a five six and seven hit so uh larry and i have talked and uh we're gonna send them something back because you know he came in well i'm gonna raise the elevation in a lot well that's not gonna work it's not fair to the people who live around you or i'm gonna do something else uh can i put my steps in the setback another good example uh that we haven't allowed anyone else to do it and i you know if he wants to submit a variance that's that's up to him but that that's just the generalization it's it's kind of like well we'll start with this now we're going to add some things all right so so nothing worth for council to do right now thank you for following up and you know yeah that's that's the second one which you do not feel compelled to answer um we were you in the vice mayor we're going to talk about supplemental law enforcement i don't want to go into any too much detail here just want to find out if we're moving along that direction i i've been out of town for a week and the vice mayor is of course here so we're going to sit down and talk to that we did have some over the weekend i haven't got the report back yet we'll see how that went we had two days of four hours spotter and deputy that cost us roughly a thousand dollars for that two-day thing so we'll just pick out some some other dates and uh figure out how we can work it out where we can fit some of that money into just by transferring some money out maybe code enforcement and then we'll give you a a big number in the end and see if you want more how's that i'll be interested in that report that was a busy weekend good call on the uh pick that was definitely a weekend to be seeing what was going on there was a lot of a lot of stuff going on that weekend so yeah you know it uh because we have to do a contract each time it's it's not a plaintiff contract that's that's how it works so but we've already done that so we'll come back with something i'll sit down with the vice mayor and have and if any of you have any input when you think of you know a specific date send me an email i don't have a problem okay any other unfinished business from council city attorney none city manager okay i just wanted to let you know you've given you the financial encode reports the bid for the video surveillance cameras and the building is going out on wednesday i've also put at your desk the code enforcement or i mean the strategic plan update of what we had with the the uh for the staff these were the objectives that the council gave us this year it's kind of an update of where we're going and what we're doing with those uh taking care of the sign occasionally we have someone come in and talk about uh the check valve's not working so at the last storm uh i decided to get a little uh salinity tester it's a little thing you stick in the water because everybody's telling me oh no the check valve's not working it's it's uh salt water so you know you stick this thing down in there and get the water test well i did two samples i did one out of the gutter on ninth street because i hear a lot about the check valves not working over there and the gutter water came in the salinity was at 270 parts per million the salinity for the salt water that's sitting right out here supposedly coming in the street also was 4291 parts per minute so it's just something that i kind of devised so when we hear those things we can go back and kind of test the water and it's you know it's layman's time but at least we can be able to explain that hey it's not the check valve it's just water that's in the street from you know the storm or something so uh that's something we did and the people that uh bellevue out of the states are probably gonna be very happy uh because they're gonna get a better beach stimulus check uh people that paid will get some money back uh depending on what they did of that underground they'll get about 2 300 back if their house was already undergrounded if they pre-paid upfront uh if they had overhead and pre-paid they'll get about eighteen hundred dollars back what that does to the assessment the people that have overhead to their house and the underground uh their sixteen hundred and eleven dollars is going to be reduced somewhere around 240 these are estimates right now but they look pretty good the person that just had the 1267 dollar assessment which is that we already have your services to the house they'll get back about 139 when i say 139 that means your 1267 dollar assessment's going to go down if you have the 16-11 it's going to go down about 240 which uh we will take that excess money that's left that's left over we'll pay that down on the loan to get the assessment down there's uh i think it's 25 people that paid everything up front so they'll get a reimbursement check so we'll firm these numbers up with a savings of about 380 000 so open project so very fortunate the last phase of it uh i haven't got a definitive answer from duke on when they're going to finish that last phase which is basically going down the road shouldn't interrupt anybody other than uh probably mitch crock's house and the house across the street for taking the final polls out so that's just an update on that project it started out at 2.2 million and it ended up about 1 million 830 so and that was a lot of great support from the council members and the residents very helpful so you know i want to thank you know i think that was very important to pass on to the residents in the neighborhood they worked very well with the contractor they you know if we had issues they worked very well with that we're getting ready to go we've submitted for a bid for the undergrounding of philip boulevard from duke uh and i don't know what the concert's thought is but i've got a thought that we maybe look see if it's possible to put even solar lights in our place if we've got the money in the budget to do that to eliminate that monthly cost so uh any questions that's all i have um i had one unrelated but before we do that you beat washington congratulations on the stimulus unfortunately i got one of those mega calls today and the person asked that i bring it up at the council meeting um so i want to bring it up and i didn't investigate it i got this information this morning so i'm just going to send it to the city manager perhaps a visit will attend this problem but patricia hoffman you know any further you know all about it i know all about it um i guess they've written two legal letters can you just go out and apparently these these construction people across the street will not move and they can't get out of their driveway i guess her husband dr hoffman is treating coping patients at the emergency room um you know he can't get out of his driveway so i heard this i'm like you know what let me get this over to lynn and apparently danny dardy was very very helpful um but maybe we could just get explained to these guys across the street in the construction that they got to keep the driveways area free for them well here just to clarify this there's a little problem there because the guy's building it just because this lot is across the street her driveway is there if if they bring a truck up to unload we'll say lumber to build a house and they're on the other side of the street that's still leaving that pass lane for them to get out of their driveway i don't i don't think that any time the driveway has been blocked it's just that there's been a truck across the street and the other warning there i got an email last week that said the word murder here before seven o'clock well were they working no they were coming to work there wasn't a hammer knocking or anything of that nature so this is an ongoing situation and unfortunately on 15th street two vacant lots two houses at the same time next door to each other what happened to i know i had to do this and i think you even took pictures of mine because i did it so well but you just have to put in parking pads on your property so that you've got the cars off the street well no no no no what the biggest complaint has been is them delivering materials to their construction site and it's it's only that one person no one else on the street has said anything there is a person that's questioning some drainage on the back of one line which we'll get that resolved when the instruction is done but just like when your house was built you probably drove a unless you did it all over the pickup you had a tractor trailer come up and they unloaded the supplies and took them off the truck and put them in your yard well you you probably took half the street or a third of the street so the house across the street had made a little better turn back and out of the driveway happened to me the other day on my stream where hey lynn yes um actually leaving together morning it was probably 7 a.m trailers of block being delivered there is nowhere for this school of stuff to turn lane going you know they took us off to alarm um and then they have to offload with forklifts and that is just positive teacher i mean there is no way around it they were there i appreciate they were there early it was comfort zone i was a little aggravated but it's part of the church as part of what we have with the instruction on the beach they used the two guys driving trucks handled it very professionally and did their best but they have been supposed to space but it's still and they did they did their best job to get offloaded as quickly as possible and out of there so i commend this for doing a good job yeah so so you know danny's been there many times i've talked to it's just an issue with and you're really in the early stages of these houses so we're gonna hear about this i have my number so um i'm sure i'll hear about it look um but i'll call her again thank you and danny they were very happy apparently with his visit so maybe utilize that to the best of you know what you can i i'm not taking sides i don't know what happened i wasn't out there i'm not gonna go look at people unloading stuff like it is a as jody says it's part of construction but if you can't really get out of your driveway that's a different story so we kind of want to learn together every time that i've been there when it's been the situation the truck has been on the edge of the property or partially in the street so yes that that guy probably did have his forklift out and he did he had his work left out he went out in the street picked up the lumber and drove around the truck and went to the other side because he he wants to be stable taking it off the truck any houses bill unfortunately it's a situation where there's two houses you can build at the exact same time and you're aware of it interestingly i i went down and looked at that situation and uh more concern for me i already discussed this with the city manager is the damage being done to the streets the pavements and the the uh the curb the valley curves there and we talked about coming up with some idea i mean we live in a highly desirable area people are going to buy lots put up large homes which means lots of concrete trucks lots of blocks things like that and we need to start figuring this into perhaps how do we pass that through to the owner or to the contract or somebody but we can't always be following around these uh new homes repairing valley clerk and things like that so that i just want to introduce that that will be coming up in uh some of these objectives and i think that's an excellent point i mean i know when i did mine you came up and visited and said you're going to repave the street so up until that point we were trying to be as careful as possible or a little less careful after that but um why can't we charge a deposit when we when somebody is building a big house a baby on something big and just like you know a security deposit on a rental property you get it back and then goes out and takes pictures before that but they didn't feel like glenn is saying the valley curves are all cracked and the streets all gouged up well you know there's going to be an assessment for that you're not going to get your refund there you keep it clean you don't gouge it all up and destroy us because really we can't keep replacing this stuff so many streets are brand you know you're doing them brand new and then people come in and trash them up so we don't want that that's not progress yeah the vice mayor and i talked about that doing something like a returnable impact [Music] but i think that we need to really take a look at our impact one or have a builder bond some real improvements because there is a possibility to damage them but i certainly do believe that we should be charging military activities because the damage doing those doing surgeries roadways are incredible i mean and i'm probably one of those guilty parties i live on harrison avenue and there's a weight limit on our bridge and there's been a lot of houses built that required heavy concrete trunks and blocks to come over that bridge that probably exceeded the weight limit um but you know i think that it's just this is a conversation or a work session but it would be impact fees and or um just getting a plan or hiring planner to take a look at our city and talk about how are we to handle these construction what's the best way to end but maybe we should add that to the session next time everyone's nodding yes it looks like so yes can we add that yes these deposits what you know just let's have a discussion just and the last thing you're going to need to uh the typically third monday work session is a holiday so we need to pick another either monday or another day that's about the concert just keep it that same week go tuesday or wednesday that's martin luther king's birthday i believe right yes it's up to you i'm available so we'll defer if you want to do it that week pick a day tuesday wednesday what's the best tuesday tuesday what specific date uh i think it's the 16th i think so be a tuesday is that right it might be the 18th 16th that would be the 19th oh wednesday wednesday wednesday the 20th everyone good with that could you hear that wednesday the 20th for the work session would that be good yes that time wednesday the 20th for this when is is there i thought i saw something about candidates not illegal women voters when is that thursday the next night okay okay okay it's going to be virtual okay well it's virtual okay okay so wednesday the 20th and um patty will advise us when the deadline is for any other items before accession so you manage anything else thank you you're welcome thank you city clerk nothing city park and i have something for you and it's a good thing um last month we spoke about uh writing a letter to the city of madeira beach and they provided us with some detailed letters that were written by mayor serrano and patty knew about it and i saw her in the parking lot she said i sent them to you and i said oh thank you and i said well i don't know if i'll be able to edit them she said i already did um i can't thank you enough i was super super heavy busy that week i don't think i would have gotten them out patty just so everybody knows edited those things right down i didn't have to change one word i virtually signed them they went out and uh thank you very very much you made that happen and i never asked you to do it you just did that on your own so very great productivity and very much appreciated uh city council comments it's an odd one so we start really swallowing uh yes i just would like to make sure that i thank councilmember shirley she's the one that put together that lunch and not the city for our sheriff's officers as well as the city staff great turnout it was paid for and sponsored by many of the people that live in our community so i really like to encourage her to make that a yearly event and continue to grow it so i hope you consider that council councilmember shirley other than that i uh thank also the city staff for all the work you've done over the holidays making sure they weren't swim that's all i have thank you um we didn't share the information but i did talk about the fact that you're going to do that i've been so much done with me as it was and uh it was a very very short notice when we got approval from the sheriff and i had a very supportive residence that were aware of it and reached out to me students helped and we raised quite a bit of money on short notice and we're able to provide lunch for 12 minutes tvs and get them each um thirty dollars of gift certificates for um local businesses that you know provide some coffee and lunch or what have you very little to do or maggie made um and we had a great support from residents that patty had you know kept the tally of the money that was donated and you still have funds available so if this is something that everyone wants to participate in if we can do more of a widespread city participation we could probably hope to do something again in the spring i believe we have over 100 sitting in a reserve account for um future opportunities so something we can talk about later but just literally no and then also yes well then thank you for sharing that we met with matthew nelly the votes are homes uh sorry to hear that you know we still have some open issues with him i thought we took care of that but justice regarding the media and understand um where they want to build a home and get power so hopefully we get to the bottom of that and get them started on a new project it will bring us some more than we can see so thank you guys for participating it's very confusing tonight thank you joey i hope you feel welcome um yes uh basically all i want to say is uh i'd like to encourage the council to while we're discussing policies for virtual meetings during troubled times that we move simultaneously to to go ahead and do something get some equipment in here i don't want to wait i don't want to take it down the road until we've come up with a perfect policy this is something we should have already had the communication committee recommended it we were discussing it code that's been here for a long time now a year uh it's time to resolve this and uh and give everyone the opportunity to uh to dial in from their home if they want to and that's what i'll add thank you um mark dean uh lynn this is uh kind of a question for you we we periodically talked about the stormwater easements throughout the city between the homes i just wonder if we have if they've worked on collecting where they're at or at least put them on a map as far as kyle yeah we haven't we haven't done anything with that we've done uh we've got all the piping and everything is on the map so we know where they're at uh we haven't researched any easements because that's going to take some time to dig through because we don't have any uh to my knowledge we don't have any worldwide of the easements that may have been given you know as an example i've got a house that wants to construct on i think it's third street there's an eastman going through their property that we don't even know what it's for so we're doing research to find things like that right and the um the other one i know we talked about the sewer lines from clausewayden to 19th street right now which way the sewer goes in that area well just before christmas i have a meeting with benelli's utilities and they're going to provide me something but it won't be what i want to call a public record because they don't want to share the utility locations they basically say it's a security issue but they they're going to provide me with something if i need to look for something and the other thing then i only discussed pathways on the north and south side of the city and the well problems with uh utilities and the pathways that need to be moved well the utilities that there is some of the florida statutes that say if it's a transportation project you can request them to move them at no cost to you yeah i know that for a fact as i used it where i was previously we need to do a little more discussion on the pathways because my thought is if we are going to pay them then uh we need to do that with the stormwater project so it's not a big chunk the estimate we got was 165 000 to do that and i think the in pieces and i have had some feedback from some of the neighbors that i want to pay so but we have to figure out where okay then i've driven through the city a couple of times over the holidays and there's a lot of low-hanging trees and some trees that are by the street curves the valley curves well danny we we had a list that he went around and sent uh it was like 30 properties where he left courtesy notices and he is following up on the people that are supposed to trim the trees we did that with trees we did it with dots we did it with sea walls and you know we just it's going to be a process because we basically took pictures dave and jody were kind enough to take us out they took me out before the storm and jody took laura out after the storm so we had multiple pictures and the co-enforcement person is following up on that yeah some of my neighbors are very concerned about some of the docs that are rickety out there and there's really nothing going on since the he's giving him a courtesy notice that there's damage or there's his dave and i went out there wasn't a major i wouldn't say there was any major sea wall damage it was more cramped caps you know across the top pieces falling off for the most part the sea walls were in pretty good shape so that that's a good thing and it appears that over the years a lot of people have upgraded their seawalls it's just the tap on some of them has some i know the older seawalls do not um i know we've talked about this before i'm surprised marvin didn't bring it speed limit reduction we talked about it on golf possibly what what do we need to do to get them discussed more or i think you need to discuss it in a work session [Music] i'm talking about the golf ball and that's all i know as an alternative those people who have access to facetime you may consider that as an alternative for calling in here my experience has shown that the voice and sound quality is a lot better and there's plenty of ipads floating around the city staff and you might be able to get a visual on who's speaking and that's where but that's i just throw that out there as an alternative they the sound quality is much better on the facetime i get to do that two city manager passed out the updated objectives i told everybody to take a look at that insanity check the priorities there the city managers astutely started to see linkages in some of these things that may take it out of just a regular normal sort priority so take a look and in your mind and you can pick up uh connections between some of these things that hey you know there may be efficiencies or economies to do this earlier or later because they just like the navy and the pathways may be more appropriate with the stormwater improvement sort of things there interestingly uh traffic congestion is known before on his list right now and the hard questions we may need to ask ourselves is the whether or not we need to keep that island that's right there causeway and uh that seems to be a huge major source of i digress here undergrounding major kudos to uh midnight they're the guys who really made those uh coming in under budget possible i mean some of that was lost in the translation you know in this interpretation had a stimulus check to the bei as well basically these guys made that project come in under budget we're still dealing and trying to get some of the other stuff done but that's why money's coming back and that's really a segue into i ride my bicycle around and boy this place could really be something if we started banding together some of these other streams hibiscus all those roads back there on the north side harrison howard all of those places could really be a show place and it's it's a matter of just finding the trip we need to ban these together and make it an economy of scale to get these things done [Music] that's it thank you very much thank you um i don't have any comments so with that i'm asking for a journal good night everyone thanks for coming out"
