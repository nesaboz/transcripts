fire and rescue District tonight no may I got a last email from Chief Davidson said emergency okay did he send see if he s anything in a report I don't think he did there is a report in the packet would you like to uh summarize Mr re uh looks like they had 12 calls for service in b beach through May 27th um that included motor vehicle AC accident medical responses and electrical hazards um looks like they're still working on purchasing the uh land to build the new fire station but it is moving along and um it's you know to replace the uh are they con to design of Mainland fire station to replace a 50-year old station and the uh personnel has been recertified for preop traval I support as well as there medical reifications any questions for the city manager all right thank you very much all right now we are on to the City attorney report this is item number five on the agenda Mr Mor you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor the whole fire chief thing threw me off there we go all right let's go backwards item three uh theels County Sheriff's Office sir would you please come up and give your presentation and good evening mayor at the council my name is Sergeant John she with the sheriff's office I the stats for the month of April for b beach uh we've had zero for the month of April which is down from March which is a good thing uh we have three arrests within the city uh during the month of April which are on these statistics uh listed there also there was 400 a total of 489 events within the city during the month of April uh and we had 562 un responding to those events very fortunately we had no crashes within the city during the month of April and we had 158 citations uh to include warnings within the city during the month of April which is the breakdown is within that uh the statistics that were present does anyone have any questions about this coun any question question you say traffic felony is that like a DUI or yes they are broken down the arrests uh there was one misdemeanor uh traffic felony which is a dwsr which driving with while license is suspended for the third conviction uh makes it a felony uh then we had some other traffic misers that are broken down also thank you yes sir any other questions Sergeant who has jurisic to control the inter coal here within the Waterway itself yes uh FWC generally has that Waterway and we support them within this uh section it breaks up depending on the area sometimes it's FWC sometimes it's our sher's office with the r control how do we address questions like the um no weight rules around the protected Islands it seems like that's being violated with frequency and I understand that there was a manate baby that was recently killed at least a little further Downstream so I'm I'm concerned about it the only fortunate way we can enforce those is whether it depends on a section of of Waterway whether it's the FWC or there are Marine units that were out with the Sheriff's Office and it's just being out and about uh we do have a larger continency at boats and uh enforcement that we have on the water but unfortunately we can't be everywhere at once times with the memorial weekend that we just had uh it was all the ends on deck and everybody was out on the Waterway so we try very hard to be everywhere as much as possible uh we try to be where the concentration of the most people are in responding for calls you know water rescues and uh disabled boats and things like that so it's kind of we have a lot of resources but it is sometimes stretch thin we try our best is thank you any other questions real quick I noticed in March we had two assaults any general or specific information regarding that as to what actually happened for March we had two assaults we don't I don't have those stats right now uh to bring up in um those could be open cases also and we're not able to comment on any open cases I would have to look in for the Mt March um it's uh our uniform uh UCR codes sometimes the cases are open and sometimes they're closed with an arrest uh if there's more um laid work or investigation that has to be done usually they stay open until they exhaust all needs or those are already done uh close by and rest but I don't have no specific stats on those uh two events okay I was more concerned about whether or not they were assaults from one citizen to another citizen I would be more concerned if it was a noncitizen and just roaming around that assaulted the citizen yes uh I don't believe that was it um but I don't have the exact information but I did make a note to try to get that information thanks I'm a little curious about the softw water Fisheries violation that somebody fishing without a license or they catch several different things it could be a fish that is over or under the slot limit it could be fishing without a fishing license it could be um mullet Fisheries it could be a plethora of different uh events now is that a hand off of them from the FWC typically not uh typically we usually we check waterways periodically people fishing from Bridges or seaw walls and things and maybe it just was an encounter with a citizen that maybe they were had an expired license or not having a license at all or had an under or over slotted fish and uh my last question is have you heard any rumors of another season of derl uh boat hunting I have not heard that sir no but uh I know the sheriff's office is constantly monitoring all the the Der boats that are in the the waterways within pen County okay I bring that up because you probably even saw the sailboat it was on it side three or four Mornings in a row almost all the way up to the uh yes to the where that ramp is over there um if you hear anything we'd love to we'd love to know okay so just it's a total Mak sense totally understand anything else for the sergeant I have one more question thank you um last month we talked about the fact that there were improvements at the intersection of Gul and Causeway with um AI implemented lights and uh that was great news my casual observation is that it seems to be improved all the way up and down Bay and is that correct where were there other installations that may have improved the traffic flow I know it's an ongoing thing with uh Department of Motor Vehicles and public Highway uh with also with the Sheriff's Office and things but the County Highway uh they're always constantly working on them so we don't I personally don't get uh any stats that hey we're working for these projects and these are going to be in the future this is what we're doing but I know they're constantly trying to work and improve all these lights and the flow of traffic for all of these intersections in rways I know it's a constant battle and I on several occasions manag to get all the way down to 19 without stopping is app you let me know how you did that all within the limit yes'am of course any other questions or comments thank you Serge I appreciate it next up Deputy Trump for the monthly code enforcement report good evening uh Deputy Trump count Sheriff's Office I'm your code enforcement officer and uh we had a slower month this uh this month with 24 enturies uh basically we had um I dealt with uh four high grass and weeds um one written ordinance violation uh with a fine uh two unpermitted remodels that uh dealt with u one was a roof project another one was a project that really hadn't started yet it was more of a jacuzzi and uh an electrical issue there but we took care of that and uh I had two this last Memorial Day Weekend where basically the uh guys were out working on a couple of these houses they're trying to finish up the constru on but they were unaware that they weren't supposed to be doing construction on holiday so I had a little chitchat with them they're very Cooperative to try and take care of that and uh I added to the traffic citations myself with one coming off of uh uh 22nd Avenue and ran the four-way stop and then a little speeding so we stopped and you know gave him a little talking to and a cation din um I was able to get out on beach enforcements on four different occasions with really no violations or anything else SE uh as far as on the beach everybody's been behaving themselves and trying to work accordingly any question as far as this I want to jump on something you brought together that about the fishing license and that what are the requirements like when you're fishing on the beach I I know in Indian Rocks beat you're now low of fish winers B 100 yards with fishing po I don't believe we have anything you have to maintain you have to maintain some type of relation right yes if you're if you're fishing from the beaches you're still require to have salt water fishing right I think a lot of these people come down the weekend or whatever and it's very cheap to get it it is especially if it's just a temporary one like they're here on vacation they can go to Walmart they can go to almost just about any you go online there's several different ways they can get it very Che just that they have it so they're in ordinance are they ever checked you guys ever checked the lies Yes actually what was brought up before with some of the saltwater feries violations and stuff our marine init will go out they'll they'll hit the beaches once in a while they'll hit the uh Bridges they're not always on boats they may be in their trucks or however that's why uh this AR said they'll stop by underneath the bridges they'll catch or catch it's a bad word but they'll make contact with several citizens and they'll check for illegal fish illegal sizes make sure they have their uh their licenses and everything too so that may be exactly what was brought up in the last session thank I I can add one thing to uh in reference to the boat that is out there the sailboat it has been tagged by our marine as a der like V the process is not overnight the cases have to go on for for 21 days once the case is finished and they have deemed it as a der vessel and they've not been able to make contact with the owners or dealing with it in a different way then the boat would be deemed is steric and we can remove it then the next process is getting the contracting company out there in order to remove it so it they try they're trying to keep it within the time roughly that 21 to 30 days to have it out of there but but I do know that vat actually has been he I believe the county does is that right as far as the removal of the boats some of it is count but some of it they get through state grants also uh WC actually puts out a lot of the grants in order to get a lot of these votes removed so it's a common should very good any other questions um you know I'm I'm guessing that this list is very short because either one it's hot or two they uh they' heard the uh arbitrary new share of I don't know but we did I mean like I said I've been working with Kyle and everything we've been looking and trying to stay on top of everything and we just it's been a slower month as far as some CS of problems or issues this has been one of the shortest list I've seen yet what just take credit for it well Okay I uh yeah cuz when I come out here uh I try to even on the days that I'll hit the beach I try to get up and down every single Street in the city every day that I'm out here and you know double check that first before we even do any we por or anything so it's just been a slower month that's good seems to be working I'm glad you're here yes just one other positive comment I noticed that the house on 21st Street I guess it's in ownership transition but it has been clean up 107 right which is I I've stopped by and talked to one of the workers there who is actually a friend of the um I guess new owners if you want to put it that way and uh he was actually starting to work on the inside of course they had a mess inside I guess so um it was terrible but at least you know right off the bat they got the front cleaned up and the yard cleaned up and everything else so it is going much better thank you any other questions or comments Deputy Trump all right thank you very much sir thank you sir okay Mr Mo thank you Mr Mayor um happy report as far as we know safe Memorial Day here in the city um over the past month I've done uh some presentations for the Florida Association of Code Enforcement I was just at the um fccma conference that Kyle was attending speaking on some new legislation that's been adopted relative to unsheltered persons uh got a presentation this coming weekend with the Institute of elected Municipal officials um especially for some of our new officials always a resource to consider um with the Flor Lega City's University um I'll also be uh presenting at the board of Planning and Zoning Association this week um getting back to things inside the city we though we are in June nearly 3 months post session there are still bills that have not been signed uh we continue to track them closely um I think about eight bills got signed uh just in the last week but for example bills that are being held near and dear to the pel speeches such as the short rental Bill still has not been sent to the governor for Signature uh as a reminder that process is that uh once it passes those chambers of leg of the legislature in identical form it has to be sent to the governor the governor has 15 days to sign any legislation sent to him um if not signed in those 15 days it passes as far as bills that have been sent and there are dozens um all all the two have been signed only two have been vetoed by the governor so we'll see where what that means for the remaining uh bills that are coming forward there is no set deadline by which a bill has to be at least not in the fla Constitution by which bills have to be transmitted to the governor so we await that um as far as legislative happenings in this community we are approaching budget season and I'm sure the manager will be speaking to that um shortly um for our newer members uh the budget has to be adopted by October 1st here that's one of the only legislative acts you have to do uh annually so we'll be beginning that process um and um uh more recently as far as other happenings in the community I did have a meeting about two weeks ago with member bankard and a member of the community Mr Manzo concerning the Beller Beach and Beller Shore um exchanges relating to the beaches and their uses two real issues going on there one the interlocal agreement and the second issue being concerned of some residents relating to their abil AB ility to use the wetand beaches in the same manner as the members of fell at Shore um very productive discussion uh informative and U I continue to move forward I am in weekly contact with the town attorney for the town of bers Shore and making progress on items both related to the interlocal agreement and just general as getting getting better acquainted as we work together as neighboring jurisdictions um outside of that uh the one other thing I would add since especially Roberts mentioned it earlier there is a property I believe it's 107 21st Street is the is the address that um has recently come into compliance that is a function of a change if not in ownership certainly in possession of the property and an investment uh investor style approach that has brought the property um into compliance on the exterior they are looking to um sell the property continue to enhance the exterior Landscaping Etc I believe they're targeting sale within the next week or two for continued compliance as part of that they have approached the manager and myself um a representative from the property as approach the manager myself would request that this commission consider uh reducing the fines or otherwise eliminating the fines on the property given the expedience with which they work with this so it's a request I think there's a representative of that property here now that seems they may have exited the room at the moment as I looked down at my notes um so I'm not sure they're in the room at the moment um but that's not something that's formally on the agenda tonight but it was something that was asked of us to make you aware of in these hearings we could if you wish to discuss it this evening as a commission you could do as a councel you could do so during other or unfinished business but it was not an agendized item um for purposes of the record we did receive um correspondence as I was um traveling to the hearing I think that gentleman just reentered the room um but I did uh receive correspondence from that property owner from a representative of that property stting hope this email finds you well as you know this office has been working for the property owner uh uh in order to deal with the open code violations and fines we've made significant process progress dealing with these violations in fact it appears all violations have been resolved and the manager confirmed that they're in compliance presently so the fine should cease we promptly assisted the owner who was unable to act on her own behalf and took all necessary steps to address these open issues we knowledge that the violations occurred over an extended period resulting in a formal invoice exceeding $50,000 and fines however since we were not in a position to address these fines we respectfully request these penalties be waved relatedly we are also going to improve the appearance of the outside of the property with landscaping and other improvements with a view of listing the property over the next few weeks at a full fair market value we look forward to your response thank you in advance for your professional courtesy again though not necessarily part of my report given that I think the member of the public who intended to raise this entered the room after public comment and cease I wanted to make sure you were aware of that um as it relates to book compliance uh and so those are that's all that fits printed my report Mr Mayor and I'm happy to answer any questions from the council Council I just want to thank you and Kyle again for thate we had our than any other questions or comments from the city attorney thank you Mr Mor I do wish to make one note because I just can't resist Mr Mayor there are two very very engaged uh members of the public here in the back row my children are in attendance tonight and I'd beiss if I missed the opportunity as a father to embarrass the public summer homework one of them D all right up next is the uh city manager report Mr Reaper thank you mayor I'm start off the tops work down um we have the go boulard undergrounding project I'm happy to say after we did pay back agreement for the Spectrum conduit that is more than halfway done and at this point they feel uh they could be wired um drop down from the aerial poles underground with at the end of September so that's moving along hopefully there's no delays on that um the next uh is our St water Improvement project um currently we got the streets that have been started uh doing the curb replacement Morgan Drive 25th through 23rd and they're currently down at Cedar Spruce and palm uh next to the building um right now those are to be the first streets that will be um asphalted resurfaced and um restored um in the schedule for that is late June at this point the um we're currently you know part of what the resent who spoke to forgive me if I say his name incorrect I think it's m um he lives at the corner of 23rd in G Boulevard um we've met with him several times the last time I spoke with him um about this issue um was a Friday before last and um being out of town um this past Friday when typically we do our onsite meetings um as my understand that u city engineer well L Moody had talked to him and um has talked to the contractor um some of his concerned is that there is a negative pitch which we can have um starting from in his dryway going towards a depression at the corner of 23rd in Golf Boulevard um the layout of the street is there is by the sidewalk on Gul where the radius is it is very low um it over the years has puddled and left sediment build up even growing weeds um that scope of the road is actually pelis County right away and looking at it um we think the best uh Avenue approach is to start at a high point um right at the very beginning of where uh you know it'll be just east of the sidewalk on go Boulevard and then you know can continue our uh continuous um you know slope all the way down the bay or uh Drive um but in that one spot it has to come back down to the depression that exists in gol Boulevard but we didn't want to match starting at where that Depression was because our plan is that the county does something to their Road um and reshaping it to meet where our high point is at the start of 23rd um I'm not sure if I summed up everything but I do know that the major concern was the depression or sorry the negative flow that was heading um on the new curb and what I've told uh the resident was that our main goal is to have the water flow to the east the Bay Shore Drive um One Way Or the other um where there's new curve make sure it gets down to the end of the road we have other issues at bore um which our engineer is U drafting up an explanation that when we get to bore in a future project um the idea is we're going to have to probably lower the inlets on mayore and maybe even add an additional Inlet some problem areas um to get that water to continue and get off and down the terrain um but we are looking at as a as a whole um you know including the bouard and the streets we're currently working on and then the future project um there's a lot of areas of the curb that the profile is not your typical b-shaped ballet curb it's very flat um we've seen this in other areas of the city before um not fully understanding why it was flat and I can't speak exactly to those areas because we do want to um when we get down to for example 19 we want to look at again the total fall of the road we want to maintain a continuous flow line and we have the water flow to the east um but at the same time we you know given that uh there is no ballot there's no actual b shape in the curve we are uh verifying that the water does flow um the concern is and again I'm going to uh we're working on cost estim of what it would take um as far as additional asphalt and raising driveways um to create a vshape in the curve um but in looking at it the to meet objective number one which is to get the water of the flow and stay out of the road we feel we're meeting that um with the curve that is installed even though it is not you know the perfect specification for a valley curve um so that is another good like like I said we are um working on a report that I will share with you so that there's a full understanding of what we're doing out there before we get to the asalt portion of the project um I think I might have covered it I know you know based on this diagram I sent it to Mr flu today I said this is basically what you've reiterated in your email to me he said yes and you know we we'll keep doing it until it's right so just we've been out there working on it um I'm sure we'll be meeting on it in the future um and then the other portion that was brought up was 22nd Street we did not have the curves getting replaced for the extent of that street uh because it was resurfaced in the past um 2 to 3 years uh one of the residents on that street uh contacted me and told me that the previous City manag told him that those curve were getting replaced um so after hearing that uh it's not the ideal way to replace curb but it could be done so we do have the engineer looking at it um to cut out areas of broken curve um where you're puddling and then you know replacing that we're going to get a proposal together for you to look at and consider does this begin at at gol golf um down to the four-way when we were designing the project we did um include the radiuses of the four-way stop because there there's a lot of puddling that's um historically been there so that was included in the project but not the the whole 22nd Street curve um that is all I have um did did I address all of your concerns how property there is no gr how are you going to fix this so we're going to ensure that they R okay that's why I was trying to show pictures of uh obviously part of the C has to be otherwise the flow cannot there's nowhere to come from so the question is how much the job has to be in my view it's at least half of the street on my side well again we're going to lay it all out like I told you I I know we'll send it to you and any other residents on the street but we we're been looking at this we spent a lot of hours out there on the site so we are taking it seriously and doing the best that we can out there thank you um the Cod riew right now Mr Sher has provided me with the writeups of all the recommendations that he's gathered I'm crosschecking him making sure that um nothing was missed and then we are going to start drafting proposed ordinances for Council consideration these won't be able to be read until after the budget the first of the year uh of sorry first of October but um we we will continue to work on that and get Council input um so that we are ready to go and that time happens the RFP for auditing Services came in date was Friday uh we got five proposals in so that was good because I think there was only six plan holders so it was a good um submission and uh city clerk is in the process of sharing all the proposals with the audit committee and finding out a first evaluation meeting dat and that again some the proposals they felt within our budget so that that was good and then just as far as the bu budget goes in general um I've heard back from most council members um our first budget Workshop is June 17th it's a Monday at 6 and I would like to either a zoom meeting or if you want to stop by just kind of do a one-on-one sit down and make sure we go through everything and that's that's it any questions or comments for the city manager yes Mr Roberts so um so Kyle on the 23d Street issue that that that you guys were working on and and your answer was perfect and I'm confident when you said we're going to make sure it works and that that's that's the message so I'm just curious previous to the improvements was there any water on that streets that actually flowed towards go Boulevard I do not believe there was okay I know that there was puddling um there was broken curve um what we did was we took a complete fall from golf to Bayshore and we tried to make it as continuous as possible um to ensure that the water does flow down to the sure noly possible the reason I'm asking that I know on 20th Street and it almost looks like an optical illusion but pretty much from the midpoint of that street on 20th between Bay and G Boulevard the water flows pretty easily to go Boulevard and the county has a very big uh area there where that water disappear which is great so that's the direction it goes I don't know if it was by Design or it just turned out that way but it blows well that direction now so just wondering if that yes yes um and again like we're going to give alternative options just you know CU I know you know your typical valet curve has got that vshape it may not we my proposal would be to raise the for boards and create at least 2 Ines on each side but there will be added costs and we don't feel that right now we're at the top uh which would be the leftest side the water will flow um where the curb is meeting the reveal of the asphalt so it's not your typical Valley curve where you have a FL line down the middle and St right there it eventually gets to a valley curve because that flow line does go down as you get down the street and then you're able to make that shape um but our feeling was to create a valley curve and create that vit um is more of an aesthetic and it won't be perfect but we will provide a price for consideration any other questions or com answer the city manager yes regarding the proposals for the auditing services I don't know if this question goes to you or to practicing um but I did receive the proposals today and I'm wondering if we have used a matrix or some sort of checklist in the past for evaluting I do have make sure she has that out anyone else all right we're on to item number seven Miss Rose have the Flor other than my report that was included in the packet I have nothing further to report do we have any questions or comments about Rene report I have one brief comment um I noted on the website that we have several listings where we say that there are currently open forward committee positions but I don't believe we say what those positions might be so that might be helpful I can add that okay thank you anything else I would like to make a comment about the U board appreciation lunch that may be something we want to take a look at regarding I don't know a better day a better time because we definitely want to thank all of the citizens that participate in those other boards and it appeared they had difficulty in actually making that lunch because it was not a big turnout for any stretch so maybe something we could I don't know just some different ideas on how to um lay that out so that we can thank more and more of those people sure we can consider other avenues in the future steak on a Wednesday anything else all right now we're on to item eight this is the consent agenda this is for approval of the May 6 2024 city council meeting next do I have a motion to approve motion to approve as present made by council member Banker do I have a second second second by Mr Roberts all in favor I any oppos all right consent agenda passes now we're on to the regular agenda item number nine consideration of ordinance 24-02 Mr Morrow would you please read the ordinance and provide a breach summary thank you Mr Mayor this is ordinance number 24-02 in ordinance of the city council the city of Beller Beach Florida amending the Beller Beach code of ordinances sub Part B Land Development code chapter 94 zoning Article 1 in general section 942 definitions to amend the definition of substantial Improvement to reduce the look back period from substantial Improvement calculations down from 5 years to one year and amending Article 5 supplementary District regulations Division 1 generally section 94255 alterations improvements and repairs to align with flood plane ordinance repart providing for implementation providing for resolution of conflicts providing for separability providing for an effective date this has been a second second and final reading of ordinance number 24-02 by title Mayors and members of the council you will mayor and members of the council you may remember um the priority that you placed on reducing your look back period as it's called for purposes of the FEMA calculations this is the period um for purposes of the 50% rule um calculating the improvements on a property to go back only one year as opposed to the current 5 years as that would mitigate the impact of Prior improvements before purchases um and similar limitations that may prevent people from doing prospective improvements as a result of past improvements and so um this is that ordinance and the two parts of it one is to explicitly change that and the second provision is to make the flood plane ordinance reference to that calculation consistent with this change um in terms of what materials people will look at when Administration does perform that 50% culation uh so this is that ordinance for a final reading thank you Mr MOA uh before we go to the council need to go to the citizens for comments would anyone like to comment on this topic seeing as we have none citizen comments are now closed Council I'm going to need a motion to approve ordinance 24-02 I believe believe I heard a motion by Frank Banker do I have a second second by Kim Shaw Elliot Mr Banker you have the floor um this really came to my attention because of the damages done by uh value last year by a couple citizens in one particular and I didn't really know about it until five years that we had and um while we doing our Cod review this was brought up and I asked the councel to the council Chas said like as kle probably not get all our codes done just to the extent they're more restrictive their statutory limits what we can do this more my my whole was we're in the storm season now let's get this down and coun and I do think it warrants that recognition for the council um every now and again you folks should be able to have yourselves on the back as you brought this up the goal was to do this before storm season was upon us and here we are on the first full day of uh I believe now first full 24 hours of season about second day and here we are so congratulations to you folks on on he guy to be right get beat up citizens all the time he's a force in the wall this needs to be done any other comments All right you please call council member bankard yes council member Roberts hi council member Elliot hi and mayor g i ordinance 24- passes unanimously now we are on to item 10 consideration of ordinance 24-3 Mr you're up thank you Mr Mayor this is city of Beller Beach ordinance number 24-3 an ordinance of the city council of the city of Beller Beach Florida amending the Beller Beach code of ordinances subart B Land Development code chapter 94 zoning Article 4 districts division 3 residential low RL District 2 Section 94220 minimum living areas in setbacks to reduce the S side setback for specified Lots in the Beller Beach first edition subdivision providing for implementation provid resolution conflicts providing for separability and providing for an effective date this has been a second and final reading wance number 2403 by title only uh Mr Mayor as you may recall from last month's discussion this is a very very discreet change to the side setbacks on a specific lot um it's really three lots but it only should impact one lot I believe um most directly um this was a a greater outgrowth of the Land Development code review and issues identified by the manager and with administrative issues in the community we are reducing the side setback on a lot in the first edition on three lots in the first edition from 15 ft down to 7 ft um all other requirements still apply meaning that you can do a zero lot line buildout um within that set back area you cannot um have any structures this just creates a little bit of a more permissive buffer uh between the two properties and um between the pro this property property May a join um otherwise I happy to answer any questions thank you Mr MOA uh before we go to the council good citizens would any citizen like to speak on this ordinance yes there are none citizen comments are now closed we need a motion to approve ordinance 24-3 I'm not going to make that motion motion is made by Elliot do I have a second second I'm going to give that with Mr Roberts M Elliot you have the floor I think our attorney Mor uh described this rather well as always um this is a very limited situation it really only impacts one lot and it brings it in a consistent manner as all the other Lots set back limits in the city any other comment Mr Mayor I'd just like to add um because the anticipating issues in the future generally when we adopt legislation we do not legislate to specific properties we legislate generally the only reason you see that as an exception in terms of this particular legislative process is because of the way your code is laid out there are setbacks by Lots within and further still by subdivision so this actually affects three lots but it is to it is consistent with your existing table we wouldn't change for example the height restrictions on one lot in the city um or something like that we don't legislate to individual properties um this has to do more with the way your Land Development code is formatted and how it format was effective St thank you Mr Mo we all know that things get changed for a reason right any other comments questions Mr Roose would you please call the rooll council member Banker yes council member Roberts I council member Elliot I and mayor gavis I ordance 24-3 passes unanimously now we are on to item number 11 consideration of ordinance 24-4 uh before I call on missor I just wanted to ask you if you ever considered Auctioneer as a backup no that's that's purely a Dominican Talent May but I I appreciate it I may I may Endeavor to to go that way if this all doesn't work out you speak to your children that way only when I'm reading it B would you please read the ordinance yes this is ordinance number 24-4 an ordinance of the city council of the city of Beller Beach Florida amending the Beach code of ordinances sub Part B land of ement code chapter 94 zoning section 94-72 fences and section 94251 fences walls and hedges to allow for fenes walls or Hedges on seaw wall caps providing for implementation providing for resolution conflicts providing for cability and providing for an effect F this has been a second and final reading of ordinance number 24-4 by title only uh as you may recall members of the council from last month's discussion on this ordinance um this this is to be create a more permissive allowance for not just um FES but Hedges to extend onto the seaw wall cap but not but not to extend beyond the seaw wall cap um in that manner where it runs perpendicular uh the concerns raised in last month's discussion or or reasons for this would be to prevent dogs children and anybody else from going property to property by walking along the seaw wall um technically as your code is written um you are not allowed to have any such structure on or above receip the um Seawall cap and this now makes uh allows for that as opposed to the halfhazard in which different people have done it U one of the concerns raised last time was the post within the seaw walls and again you can have the fens send over without necessarily having Place post through and support or deteriorate the structural Integrity of that than Mr all right let's go to the citizens or comments anyone like to speak all right see comments are now closed Council I need a motion to approve ordinance 24-4 some by Mr Roberts do I have a second second second by Mr Banker Mr Roberts you have the FL thank you Mr Mayor I think um a big fact in this Planning and Zoning Board did have a hearing on this matter and this is the recommendation that came from that as Mr Moore made some great um statements about what the benefits were're moving with this we're really just cleaning up this particular or so um I think it's the right thing to do any other comments all right your name would you please call R council member Banker yes council member Roberts I council member Elliot I mayor gtis I ordinance 24-4 passes unanimously thanks everyone for uh working on these three ordinances look forward to see them in the books all right now we are on to item 12 unfinished business you have any May the only business I I I would just like to know whether you wish to address tonight is entirely your prerogative as Council um is the correspondence I read into the record earlier only and I only rais that um urgency from the property owner perspective is they're attempting to sell the property within the next week or List It um and and obviously we have we have a lean the amount of the um of the monies owed to the city is $68,900 um the context provided um here in the correspondence they provided they they made reference to being unavailable or unable to recuit the property the property owner at the time was incarcerated for much of the approving violations some of our challenge was just in breaching the property owner as a result of that to make them aware of these um deficiencies But ultimately I did want to make sure whether you took it up or not that you specially stated uh well I would uh I'd be more than happy to hear the citizen or the uh the the purchaser of the home uh I know he uh wasn't we had citizen comments but since you brought it up be more than happy to let this gentleman speak please go up to the podium give us your name and address and uh tell us what's going on hi good evening uh my name is vad vad Chanel uh I reside from ring Beach town and I'm see for the property at at issue today um as um the CDX stated uh currently the property is in compliance with um an ongoing issue that uh particular the neighbors were struggling with for quite some time um been addressed and actually getting rest of this time and probably getting remod at this very moment uh so obviously uh the city accumulated SL expense during the ongoing issues uh with that said um uh currently uh it's I I believe it's somewhere around $68,000 $ 68,276 so uh to make a long story short we will greatly appreciate if you will consider to to reduce the fines uh as been said before uh the um the former owner uh is not well uh in addition to that uh she is uh she was incarcerated and incarcerated right now uh so um um property is up to cold and obviously we have all intention to keep that way I just actually had a very nice conversation with uh d Trump uh and uh I encourage him to contact me directly if there's any additional things that we can do to improve the problem um if you have any questions I will be more than happy to answer them obviously uh but uh if you will consider to reduce the fines from $6,000 to a greater to much a greater to less number uh we would appreciate that thank you very much like I said questions I'm going to uh wave the rules this time little back and forth was the last person uh any public speaking and um um I'm going to open up the floor to the council do you have any questions what if any uh proceeds from the sale will go back to the owner uh the yes how much money will go back to the owner uh well it's always determined by the sale because there is a a number of links uh legal expenses it's not even calculated at this at this at this point in time uh exactly how much uh will go to the one is it more than $69,000 yes yes Mr Roberts who is the owner right now uh the land trust and I'm TR the uh the owner of the property um uh an C uh surrender the property uh to a land trust and I am the pr of the property okay so at this point in time uh under the supervision of the attorney who is uh uh um managing some of the legal and other issues of uh uh M traps while she's as I said uh in Curr incarc um so uh um the property will be uh sold and liquidated and uh um and the multiple parties will receive the proceeds uh and of course cover the expenses affiliated with the life of these CS as context sating things that are all public record that can be determined within roughly the last 90 days and I'm not don't hold you to the exact time like but really truly with been roughly the last 90 days um as he stated the former property owner for whom the violation in initially attached transferred Pro ownership to a land trust for which this gentleman is the trustee during that time this land trust and and its agents and officers have brought the property into compliance have paid outstanding tax me of which there were multiple years back in in Mo taxes they have um theyve taken to try and get the property ready for sale and whether as an investment or or just an arrang M between people who are appointed to us which is of no concern to the city that's how that's how we've got here um so to the extent that the letter stated we weren't in a position to help now we are the members of the trust or trustee and his and his agents and officers are now positioned as owners of record to do those things and they have done them um and so they've brought that they're now getting it ready to list and then and from a code compliance standpoint and I you often will hear me approaches that from a Cod compliance standpoint the property's been droing compliance um often times when you have fine reduction and B reduction hearings um what you're looking at are the same sort of factors you see in chapter 162 which is the the statute that governs the enforcement of fines um and code enforcement and and when in determining the amount of a fine when you have like a code enforcement border magistrate the statutory recommendation is that they look at things like the gravity of the violation any actions taken by the Violator to correct the violation any previous violations committed by The Violator and then says the board May reduce find a post for that section and so they're coming forward to you saying hey my inter understanding of their asking and I will let the gentleman speak for himself is hey you guys want to incentivize compliance we did compliance and we did it quickly once we were positioned to do so so as whether it is as reward or as it to to unencumber us our request is show that incentive to to compliance different cities have done that different ways I think historically the largest that I'm aware of in the last few years here going to go back 20 and 30 years but in the last few years I think the largest was like 50% some cities do 90% um it's really up to you and what you're trying to do here um to accomplish you know their goal is help us facilitate a sale so that that's free and clear and then you won't have this problem ever again within the property owner who has been for reasons either within their control or otherwise who's been the source of these violations will not be the property owner any so help us get to that is there ass all some questions do you have a buyer already well originally I wanted to buy the property personally but unfortunately this life is this property is not really conducive to to my life just too small for me and my small children uh so there is a potential buyer yes uh it is also if I might add uh which is I'm sorry it's not directly related to your question when uh uh when you impose the the fines for the property at the timing was very unfortunate because when uh when when uh the city decided to impose the fines of $250 a day that was pretty much the time when uh she went incarcerated and obviously it's not your problem clearly but with that said uh it is when she when she went incarcerated the obviously the 250,000 day had out pretty quickly while she was awake so uh um but uh to answer your question again uh it is a a possible why yes does this uh Property Trust own any other properties not this time not not no not okay was this trust formed specifically for this property yes all right and um no intentions of the trust possibly keeping it uh for to for its own an investment trust anything like that no I don't I don't think that uh uh that that will happen Okay my my fear is is that we wave the F and it turns into a vacation rental spot no no no no no it's not going to turn into the loation spot okay the goal is very clear to help the uh user as I said originally I was considered to buy approprate for my personal res but it's not it's not but uh uh yeah it's not it's not the idea of and your existing Land Development code restrictions against that create new enforcement correct but understood understood to make that clear for the record in fact I have an over I'm sorry and I had an offer uh from uh uh someone who were cons considering uh to do just that uh to have some kind of application for and uh uh I am not engag this conversation well I appreciate that Mr B um I've sat on this board and um whenever a lot of fines see 50% reduction and everything like that I'm going to make a motion that we reduce the F by 55% um clear not that there's no vacation yeah I I absolutely no issue I can make a definite commitment here that uh well obviously I don't know what the people will do later on you know so when they buy the property uh you know how it goes okay but uh as of the trust and need a okay uh there is property will be sold to the can use it well you explain you've done everything as soon as you possible as soon as you took over so I think we should give you the leeny of 55% deduction that's a um what what is the deadline for for what you're trying to accomplish I heard something like a week there's something that has to happen in a week or so is there any deadline at all no there's no no deadline okay and do you have a buyer who is going to pull out if you don't if you don't resolve this tonight well I'm not really concerned that the buyer will walk away you know because obviously uh it's a highly desirable Community okay so it says I am uh I I don't uh um obviously I have no control of the real estate market but with that said uh I think that um um that will able to find another VI especially that we don't have a deadline it's not there is no deadline that we have to meet okay it is all the other leans the property had been paid off it had thousands of dollars in water Le and you know and I'm not going to worry with a long story of other things obviously the property taxes were not paid for 3 years uh it is and uh uh it's been uh current now okay so there is already a substantial expenses where paid okay uh just for the purpose of not having a deadline you know because there is a the uh the Tex option is no longer part of the conversation or something like that okay and uh because in order to do all the work in the house um we need to have the water so I say I have to pay the world and so on okay so this is the one only mean that uh um is obviously still there and um I'm trying to communicate the best of my ability to tell you that uh you know we're trying to do everything that we can so and as right now they're replacing the broken windows and cleaning the house inside so because uh tomorrow they will start on the flooring you know and that's it so uh when it's done it's done there's no deadline you know so obviously we would like to resolve the issue okay uh and uh um and move on okay and I spoke to the at least three uh neighbors yeah they very pleased that uh there is no longer police department and other things that you know I don't have to tell you what happen over there obious so okay all right um Council I saw Mr San's hand raised um does anyone have a problem with allowing him to speak in this matter please come up sir thank you mayor council just try to do the math right Baker so uh 68,000 divid $250 is 272 days and um you this is this trust that now has possession had of possession for how long Le uh I don't know the precise date of acquisition but I think it was in late March so wouldn't there typically be you know to get clear title any of these Lanes would had been paid so we should have been paid as of March so I don't think 55 I I I think there may be a reasonable discount but I think it might be more at the time of turnover and be back into that day in time if if I I just think we we got to make sure we a precedent as a city and um people have different situations that Unfortunately they go through but uh the the time the city is had to enforce this the time that our uh uh code uh enforcement has had to act on it U we we should make sure that we're more than compensated for managing the process so my recommendation uh would be you you probably you a 25% discount just do my math real quickly but again if this was properly transacted with the title The Lean would have been PID if the time transfer yes with the note that I believe it was done as a quick claim deed so you take when you in a quick claim transaction you take with all incumbrances so this go back to the DAT of the quick claim if it was actually filed um I don't know if it was filed or if it somebody signed it but you um you know the tax has got discounted the water's got discounted why should we get discounted for all the great services that we provide in all these citizens of Jo in the city that's just like thank you thank you Mr yes sir Mr Rob is there is there currently a mortgage on the property no okay what um so let's let's go down the road a bit and this is when the property sells and all the leans are paid and all the bills are taken care of who gets that money that's left over what when the house when the house is sold yes and there's and there's still profit there based on the sale price and everything else being taken care of who walks away with whatever money is left over a trust the trust house yes okay okay um with regards to advertising ing the sale of the property is there advertising so that other people can compete for the purchase absolutely yes as soon as the work is completed it will be listed with a real estate broker okay uh so yes in fact has a sign coming soon as we speak right now on the property the answer is yes CU earlier you said you had a buyer I have a potential buyer yes okay but uh but the property still will be on the market okay yeah and for the city manager Kyle so that this money that is that is due to the city for the fines where would that fit in our budget and how would we use that money so the money would just come back um in as revenue and go into the general fund okay all right no specific requirement right any other comments questions I I just like to know I like we don't like an abandoned house here and I think we should do everything of course the Count's not going to lessen their fine water and everything else but this is where we live this is what we're trying to bring to Residents that's why I believe 55% induction of the fine because as you know you got incarcerated would you say it was $260 something a day every day wasn't PID or whatever accumulate quite quickly so she was in carcerated or whatever and that's not the point at and finally a lot I something appreciate that and uh yeah the timing was awful and and I obviously I fully understand that you you live here so you don't want to have an abandon light the property who would work okay so and that's kind of the goal here resolving the issue and uh uh actually as soon as we start working on property we clean it up 3 days so uh I had a pleasure meeting with you City Manager on property twice and um I specifically asked if there anything else that we can do okay um I'm still uh curious as to who is the beneficiary of the trust who the beneficiary of the trust uh it has multiple entities including if this is refering to the former woman yeah it is so uh it is um some of your current legal and Health Care fees will be cover out of some of the proceeds of the trust and currently the home is is paid for 100% there's there's no data on the home there is no on the home I I'm uh I'm leaning towards the suggestion of Mr Sanic he uh uh he is uh advis us quite often and uh he likes to watch our money and uh I think his suggestion of a 25% reduction is a nice way to reward you for um helping the queen of marity so that's where I'm me how about you Mr Robert I think that sounds more than fair and I think U it's going to help you not as much as a 55 but I still think it's a a significant discount so I'm I also agree with 25% just one how many days did we charge it was 250 a day and while the manager looks that up there is a recorded Quick Claim Deed that was recorded on it was made on April 24th of 2024 and it was recorded April 25th of 2024 to the extent that informs your decision making so while I said the last 90 days it's actually shorter than that so what would be uh if we started from zero and uh from the day of the quick land de what what would we be looking at got 263 days from April 24th to the state of date of compliance May that's 26 days 26 you guys are making a lawyer do math on the Fly This is highly highly unkind I'm trying I'm trying to impress your kids here 6500 2 6500 is is the uh if you if you take it just from the data of transer so 25% would even be more than that so well that's what I'm that's where I'm leaning right now council member I like I have quite a few questions one is what is the normal process uh to request an abatement that's that's an excellent question this um Char Elliot one of the things that your manager and I are working on is is resolving that um it has been a little bit more of how we've done it right now where someone comes and usually they're on the agenda um again I I put it to your judgment whether you took it up tonight or not U but usually it's on the agenda they they request it the manager presents hey here's what it is what do you guys want to do um I as the lawyer try to remind you we should ground this in things like chapter 162 considerations possible but one of the this is one request we've received there's another that's we anticipate percolating and one of the things we're trying to get resolve before that comes up is getting a more clear process in place on the kind of criteria you consider both for your protection and the property owners so there's predictability we eliminate any arbitrariness in the decision- making process so um but present to the extent the city has historically done this it has come before the commission and sort of a please consider it based on the totality of the circumstan and what are you willing to do in L and this Council uh historically uh has taken a very hard line against violators that has not giv it very little uh and what I'm trying not to do is set of pres I do understand there was a set of circumstances where um the homeowner may not have been in the best state of mind and then also winding up uh being in custody uh but uh I think at the end of the day uh the trustee the the the family everyone involved I I just I can't let I I can't give a discount like that I just can't do it because I'm afraid that someone will come back later and say well you gave this guy one um um where's my discount I'm not persuaded um this is an investment opportunity properties are very valuable in our city Lots alone over the 400,000 enough um we all know that any ConEd property is going to be subject to any accumulated means and that goes into the purchase price and so either that is reflected at the time that the party's come together and the owner takes less because somebody else is going to have to pay the later or it's resol that time so I I I appreciate very much um the eff to do this quickly if to bring it back to compliance but that's also part of the investment Val if you get it done the FAS will be sold have in property for a long period of time so I'm not persuaded that we should do this council member Elliot you uh sound as skeptical as I'm feeling right now um so um I don't know I I don't know what the best medicine is for this and I think also that I think it's good that we're working on a process but perhaps there could be a standing committee or you know one of our other groups that can do some back I mean we can speculate all evening about how these facts came about but if somebody's incarcerated you know they still have the opportunity to rent their property they still they can appoint an agent an attorney to help them rent it and them maintained buy property management I mean one one of the considerations for the process is looking to have it go as far as find reductions um to go before the magistrate and say stat that process so but that's in terms of process we are considering all options administrative or I it's fine if we act in some sort of appeal process perhaps but it seems like um a good process could include somebody's doing some backf finding and pulling story together and and considering it and that's that's the the struggle that I'm having is that this is all sprung on us I don't want to get bed down in an entire work session to resolve this that's why I was willing to was geming out and find out what it was we were uh we need to decide on and there are a lot of um you know questions going on in my head how much money is the trust going to make and where's it all going and is this truly just how much money can I get out out of this house has been quickly to a trust that ultimately goes right back part of it to the owner who just did a quick playing Deed on it so there there are many many uh questions I have uh I'm I'm just to make this go away um um can I answer any of your questions perhaps sure I would want to do that as um so if you any questions yeah I think I think the problem solved okay so it's in my view okay so obviously you want to have a clean property in your community so that's what it is so um so obviously uh we can have a long ongoing discussion and uh wait you know until the sale of the house for as long as you wish uh with that said um I suggest maybe we can just move on so there you know quality people that will move in the house and um and St I'm Sor yes are you happy with the 25% if we gave you that 25% would that resolve everything tonight you're not going to ma Street try to no you're not Happ 25% and and I understand your position I I understand your position and I understand that whatever happened to the previous order property is not your problem it is you want to clean house and in your community uh my my concern is be taking this to court and appealing it okay and then the judge would say hey she was incarcerated for 200 and some days I'm going to reduce there's not a clear um it's not clear that that's even a civil action it's actionable it could be well anything could be you can file anything I just in terms of how chapter 162 operates that's not 162 and I have in front of me but it clearly says you know we should consider reducing it okay if they and I think they comply well this Council needs a majority to uh uh to move on something like this and um right now now I see we've got one person one council member who sounds like she doesn't want to give anything uh we've got one here that wants to give the world away I give the world away don't say that I want to give something that I'll get resident in this house as soon as possible make sure there's no more legal action well based upon the amount of fine 25% off of that fine is a substantial amount of money and I believe for $116,000 I could have made that guard a little Immaculate so um I I think that it's uh um I'm I'm willing to do 25% I'm willing to go with the 25% too if he's willing to drop you know what I'm saying no more legal well I I don't there's been no indication that pursue that as it is but we can't find to these proceedings and there's presently no motion on the floor um there was a motion made that did not receive a second there's no other motion no other motion made um as in terms of procedurally where we stand at the moment well there is a motion of 25% right no nobody made nobody's made that motion you made a motion to 55 did not rece second no other motion have been made someone like to make the motion for 25% motion made by Frank Banger do I have a second second second by L Roberts on favor I any oppos all right you do a roll call mod please just so that it wasn't clear I could not see your okay M Rose would you call the RO council member Banker yes council member bankard yes council member Roberts I council member Elliott no mayor gtis I so vot by your vote it's approved 25% yes reduction which is a reduction of $1 17,32 41 all right my map spr we will clear that up and I will I will communicate that to your legal council we receed there this Council has agreed to reduce the fine to 25 thank you very much all right do we have any other unfinished business and um Mr Mor you're not allowed to bring up understandable me uh just one issue I don't know this business or not but can we look Ates some of the benches in six Street uh the one is kind of broken uh they're not secured some of the res espe Sunset ask me to see if we yeah we'll take a look at that together UNF finished business sir um I I tell you and uh I think tonight we sort of did set a precedence for special circumstances um this this was a little bit different uh circumstances than we normally have where someone just ignores ignores ignores inlex um this was definitely unique and I think uh whenever if we're trying to to develop a standard we should take the city consideration I think 25% is a uh a reasonable reduction under special circumstances as we develop a policy we'll keep that in mind and just understand as well I I know it's it's Habit to sort of say we we set a precedent but each matter will stand on its own eror which is I think also what you're speaking to um you know sometimes there's an inclination to just look to your neighbor and say well they got so I should get but that's whether we talk about variances we talk abouts it doesn't work that we can that poliy develop good point and uh thank you for reminding us all right if there's no other unfinished business let's go to item number 13 Council comments I'm going to start off with council member B okay well there's two young persons in the audience tonight while we take a lot of your dad's time hopefully tonight you can see how well he represents our city and many others so we thank him for this and I hope you appreciate uh Thursday's the uh 80th anniversary of DayDay hopefully we all remember who who currently serve have served especially those all TR their day each like that's it thank you Mr Banker now upim Shaw following up on my comments regarding Bay Street East Bay it seems like it is going a lot better um I did attend a webinar that was um a hearing on the improvements be made on EXC me not East Bank West Bank um look on the website as far as the specific dates but they are starting a project to um re uh resurface and uh correct any of the issues on West Bay as well as install convenience in the middle of the street that will be used for some decorative purposes as well as kind of redirect traffic a little bit part of the purpose of that project in addition to just maintaining the streets is to better connect the panel's trail to the rest of the city all of that is good news except that it did not include connecting it via bicycle trail we found that there wasn't enough room um for the existing Street structure to able to enlarge it for um any B planes so that's a disappointment but um we can all look forward to some moreing opportunities when they start constructing on East Bay I'm going to to echo on that right quick and then I will turn it over to Mr Roberts um yeah it's it's amazing that we have the traffic that we do and they're actually narrowing the lanes and they're putting islands all the way from um Clear Water lgo Road up to Indian Rocks Road and one question I had was about are you doing anything with the merge lane you're trying to beautify and you stop right there and you leave those ugly things in the road but uh uh I also feel bad for the the business owners uh that are along that pathway because a lot of people are going to lose their ability to left turn into the parking lot you'll have to go around make a urn and and come back to be able to enter these businesses uh I look forward seeing how beautiful it's going to be but I also am worried about the traic on the project I don't know how much opportunity is you they had the full plan laid out I'm just grateful that they're not putting a dedicated bu L down so because that seems to happen occasionally around County and uh and then you lose a land entirely Mr Roberts staying with the traffic Contra I did notice on Memorial Day weekend I don't know if there was something special that occurred but the um traffic the car lights were Bumper to Bumper at 9:30 or 10 p.m. on Saturday night and or Sunday night so that could have been uh just due to traffic volume which was not a great sign Mass ex yes yeah not good anything else that's it all right um Mr Reaper the only thing that I really had is the traffic light and our intersection uh we we really need to kill one of those Ren lights that that represents going straight and and I'm going to tell you why it's because I've been kind of neutral about do we want one do we want two do we you know is this going to work or not so uh there was a great big truck in the left lane waiting to turn left he's going to go slow I hop in the right lane the light changes and he came all the way over into my lane I had to lock him down and I he never looked at me one time I'll tell you why it's because he saw those two lights over there and thought I'm going straight down the road that I wasn't going to make a left turn so he thought the entire turn was his I think I think between removing one of those those lights aligning them properly so everyone knows whose light belongs to what and then restriping the the lines moving them back I think that that's probably the best opportunity we're going to have to to fix anything I don't I don't think there's a real good F but it can't hurt it can only help an arrow an arrow actually yeah but drunks can't see go but the lane you were in was specifically a green arrow turn it was the right Green Arrow turn right yeah turn L and I mean had to lock them down coming right over on me there was nothing I could do about it oh well we look um off my my driving horse and uh just thank everyone for watching at home tonight and uh anyone that showed up tonight thank you for being here and uh you kids get to bed early tonight all right the city attorney's had a hard day today um other than that everyone have a good night um do I have a motion to adjourn motion to adour as long as the city manager takes the kids out for oh
