    "transcript": "good evening everyone welcome to the april 26 uh special works of war city council work session for the city of delray beach please join me for the pledge of allegiance roll council member robin ockey here council member frank banker council member glenn gunn here council member leslie otero here council member rita swore vice mayor dave gallis mayor joseph manzo city manager lynn reeves city attorney fred riley here thank you before i begin we have a three-piece agenda here um i just wanted i had said something different riley in the break and he wanted to address us as council mr robin this is just a follow-up we had the executive session earlier and that of course and i'm saying it for all council members and two two of whom are new but that is a confidential discussion and the discussion needs to remain confidential until the litigation has been concluded in whatever form that takes so i just wanted to mention that the mayor asked me about i want to be explicit because it's one of these times it pays thank you yes okay so the first item that we have this is a work session and even though we're up here normally we used to do it on the floor before pre-coping and it was a little more informal but this is a little more informal um first item comes along we have three items but two of them are very long the first one is discussion of the planning and zoning boards code review final report we're going to review the proposed changes to the city code and so we'll start it off with that anyone feel free to begin together we want to just take it in order you want to go paragraph by paragraph instead of hopscotching around i would like to explain my funny pictures i passed out just let's identify that for the people in the audience okay so uh even though this was not one of the things that was mentioned in the uh the recommendations this is something that just recently occurred basically this is the first time i've ever seen this a resident or possibly a contracted employee decided to paint this person's seawall cap um from picture number one it it doesn't look terrible uh in real life it's it's pretty bright and i don't know maybe the neighbors could get used to it i'm not real sure but that led me to wonder what would happen if they picked a worse color so if you look on page two there's the same seawall cap it's pink now if i was across the water and i had to look at that i would lose my mind um if you go to number three there's another color i think that means go i'm not real sure and then if you look at number four you can see that the neighbor on the left joined in on the colorization of the seawall caps my point is is that we've never needed a regulation on something like this but now i'm beginning to wonder if this is a possible possible new trend or just what if somebody else said that's a great idea i think i'm going to do it too so uh using my photoshop program i decided to repaint their sea wall with a neutral color that was pretty close to the original color of their seawall cap and i'm just wondering i'm asking the council if this is something that maybe we should consider writing into uh code just to prevent this from ever happening and if it does happen at least we have something to stand on would we have any legal way to stand on this uh maybe our city attorney can answer that i mean since it's private property wouldn't that be a concern as far as color if they want to pay it now you know i agree that it would be hard to look at this all the time but i'm just wanting to make sure there's nothing else so they can come back and you know after the city for this because it is their private property well you have the ability to to put in reasonable standards so i i take it from what vice mayor guns explained this one was painted but there's many of them that are not or most of them are not correct as far as i know this is the only one that's painted okay and it just happened a few months ago well what what you often would do is if if somebody has something that's already existing then you can in essence for one of the better phrase bring father it in but you can set a standard that going forward is now what applies so that's what i would would tend to suggest you do and whatever standard you choose if that's something you want to regulate in some manner you uh you know you would have these standards have to give people knowledge of what what is available to do and what's not you know i i will say this at the outset um to me this is a global statement concerning this topic is a lot of these things my question is first question is always going to be how big of a problem is this and if it's not that if it's a you know 1 in 100 year problem is it really something you want to spend your time trying to fix if it's a glaring problem then maybe it's you need to address it i have a very similar view to you so i know which house you're talking about and i didn't really notice it i mean but yeah it doesn't look great but i don't think it's horrific second i mean do we even have regulations for house colors because that's that would be the next step if you start regulating that then it's house colors and what happens if i don't like light blue or peach or you know that's a big expense to make somebody repaint their house so i see where you're going it's i agree it's not the best thing to look at and yes i see but i'm just afraid if you go this little step then the next person is going to start complaining about their neighbor's house color and then it's going to go the next step and i don't know if this is a battle we want to get over if it comes a time where we have rainbow bright you know caps going around the that area where everyone's doing a different color then i think we can address it then but i'm kind of with fred if it's a one-time occurrence luckily the sun will fade and i think we'll be fine but i think we have other caps that are in need of repair which i think is more of a looks worse than a painted cap if we had to pick our battles and i have to agree with you i mean this is a slippery slope frankly next um this isn't a condo association and one of the things that i'm going to be talking about all night is government overreach and if you overreach you get sued okay you don't want to hear it but that's what's going to happen it can't tell people what color to paint their house this isn't a condom you think it is but it's not you can't tell people to pull the weeds out of their front yard you can't tell people they can't put a skateboard on their property for 24 hours we're over regulating here if you want to paint your house pink it's not my favorite color but somebody likes it and they paint their house pink mine's yellow next i've seen fluorescent blue i've seen all kinds of colors going around the city you don't have the property and unless we could show a fairly debatable reason why pink is no good or that green that you give is no good i mean if this is a safety reason that's one thing but because we don't like it or our neighbor does something they don't like i mean why stop there let's regulate house styles let's regulate what shape your driveway should be we're regulating everything we're regulating too much when you over regulate people eventually say enough with the regulation these are private properties so you can go for health welfare and safety but when you start telling a person what color they can paint their house you have to tell me what color i can paint my house and i don't think a lot of other people are going to tolerate there i can't imagine that this is not a condo association frank banker mark i'm going to come too okay so what we're gonna do is this there's the citizen comments it's really not a citizen comments piece anybody have any objection to citizen comments we're gonna come to you later on let the council debate it and we'll open up for citizen comments right i think the question before us is the sea wall not the house call or anything like that and this has always been my question the sea wall was probably there waiting for the house and who installed the sea wall i would say the county you wonder how the [Music] is that documented that the owner of the house put that seawall in there it's up to the owner to repair it if there's a problem with it okay that's that one has been replaced by the owner because it's new so the owner paid for the replacement of that seal so when the seawall was painted what protections were put into the water you know what i'm saying the paint fell under water the seawall was there for a while and the pain is recent well what i'm saying whenever you do something on the water you have to have a barrier you have to have things that can't reach out if it was dropped or something like that is that done properly because there are permits required by american law for them i guess i was just picking on the colors no i i i agree with you i i agree with mayor until he can't start saying campaign it would make me sick at myself and frank to your point i mean we certainly can say if you're gonna paint your seawall whatever precautions are reasonably necessary to protect the water absolutely but i mean i hate the kelly hey he didn't do a psychedelic one they could have done a psychedelic you know 1960s style too so again just because we don't like it somebody else may love it it's not it's not it's not the fact that it's a blue sea wall cap it's the fact that whenever it gets to rainbow brite you can't undo it because we didn't write code for it and that's basically what i'm what i'm bringing over this council and and giving the opportunity to make a decision i would agree with robin and joe that you know we have no restrictions on what color you want to paint your house and i don't think we can put a restriction on what color you want to make your seawall unless it presents some sort of a safety issue but i don't think that we can do anything i was just looking at the code there doesn't appear to be anything in the building regulations that says you can't paint your house yellow or pink or green or orange or whatever you want so i i don't see how we could do it with sea walls unless it were to present unless there were to be some sort of a safety issue absolutely great i mean if there's a navigation reason that you know like like a stop sign read or something maybe there's something that means you you know or if you make it if you paint it to look like a buoy or something like that if it's confusing you know people that we could stop that but if you want to make it you know one of the things i'm going to say tonight over and over i think sometimes the less said the better on this stuff when we get to the scientific and fred you did a terrific job researching this but i got issues and sometimes the less we talk about it the better it is because when you start telling people you can't do this that's when they start saying watch me i will do it um and then we get into that whole set of lawsuits you know that we don't want to be getting into so anyway anybody else have comments on this so this was kind of off agenda but it is a point that's valid so you know that we might want to consider i'm going to propose that we maybe just go page by page and flip through these and everybody get the comments out um we can yeah let's let's take care of this issue with the with the citizens so we'll go to citizens at this point mark our being we should drive the only thing i'd say about the sea walls i think maybe let fred take a look at it water navigation might say something about the color if it's green or red or anything like that or it's reflective at night someone coming in there to head for that sequel you know for example somebody painted just at the race and somebody had a race car that was like reflective gold you know if somebody paints something that's that could potentially mess up the ship's navigation and we could do something about that i don't know maritime law so i'll defer to you do you know i actually in law school was awarded a doctorate an admiralty there you go hey captain well you got it the thing i would say is and i do this frequently so this is nothing new with munico you can search the codes from from any city or almost any city in florida there may be another city that has looked at this and put forth a thoughtful well-founded code provision that addresses this let me look and see if i can find something like that and then [Music] have it back to you so you can at least see what somebody else did a lot of the stuff i'm looping back to something that happened a couple months ago i think dave had a question about the boats being moored in the city's jurisdiction and that was you know very easily i found a code provision from another city that did address that and did a real good job of giving us you know something to at least look at and i would expect that i could find something you know that had had some bearing just so you see how somebody else did it and there there may be a relatively straightforward way of looking at it and something for you to consider right maybe take it offline or maybe able to help you break into the network with the coast guard and the agency navigation partner okay yeah um folks we got to speak into there because mark's giving me the sign that he can't hear so um glenn gunn said he will try and work with fred uh maybe get him hooked up with some of the coast guard information aids to navigation okay you can hear me right speaking to the mic everyone all right chapter i think we go right to chapter two administration unless anybody had anything before that so with that i'm going to be on i'm on page 6 of 15. council does anyone have any comments or anything you wish to discuss let's just go page by page anybody on page six i did have one just a scribbler kind of thing i think you have to have like the 10 000 i think in paragraph b 2-350 under city manager reeves let's see b expenditures the five thousand ten thousand other places we're saying you know they're one dollar coming over we need to bracket that a little more carefully i guess i i don't know yeah no it's it's it's a discussion point and i mean my point was we're getting up to some nice limits over here and nothing against city manager reeves it could be you know before we had another city manager and i didn't always hear the best of things so um these are pretty good numbers these are pretty high numbers right now that we're we're going up to so that was my one of my scribble points and the other thing was it's talking about changing what i think in an ordinance by changing it by resolution i don't believe that's the appropriate way to amend an ordinance i think you if you're going to mend a piece of the ordinance you need to introduce jake and he said yes you need to do the amendment process you can't change it by resolution temporary authority yes not permanent i think one other thing is i i can go with the increased values everything's going up in the world but i would like to can be out there with just a duty to inform that that you're maybe pressing those limits or up to that limit just what what i was trying to accomplish the the city council you know instead of going out for a bid which takes time and staff time and cost for things that are between 10 025 if we're able to get three proposals and we've suspended the bid requirements several times for those type of caveats so that that's really what i was asking to to adjust that still got to come to the city council you still have to approve it and you still have to you know we have to get three written bids from someone or proposals uh i'm just trying to kind of clean that up and then when it's something over 25 000 then we've got to bid so you know these numbers are probably 20 years old or more well 20 years ago 3 dollars what is three thousand today realistically ten i don't know but uh so that's what i was asking to kind of streamline the purchasing process i don't have a problem with bringing it up if you haven't brought it up in 20 years but i'll get i'll use the fred reilly logic i use it when it helps me fred and it's not really a problem we don't have that many things that we're going out to bid on because you know being a smaller city i mean i don't see this as being a problem it's not like you're coming here with 12 bids every council meeting or anything so i don't know that we even have a problem with the numbers as they are maybe kick them up a little bit i'm just looking at these numbers i mean remember you know whatever we're putting here goes for whomever our next city manager is and you know yeah i have confidence in you but i don't know that i want to throw that to the next person necessarily right out of the bat because this does have the ability to be manipulated very easily i mean you know we're trusting in you and you do a wonderful job of getting us some competitive bids even if you're not required you have the context but this could also be abused i mean you could make whoever win win that you want to win you know by simply picking the highest guy in the county and then pick the guy you really want so you don't do it some people could do it and that's the whole competitive bid process for you know point let's talk to the council this goes right to the heart of how long it takes to do business i mean everything prices expenditure is going up revenue is i don't know but we've got to be able to conduct business in a expedient manner he has to keep coming back to the council wait for monthly sessions or wait two weeks for a work session to get an approval where we we have to go to council session anyway then we're really hampering his ability to conduct timely professional business so i'm in favor of these these uh upper limits these these increased livings i think that gets business done in a more expedient fashion and if you're saying the safeguards are still there for duty to inform and approval then i'm not quite sure why we should hamstring the city manager with limits that are decades old well also there is another statement in that same paragraph that says the city council may authorize expenditures from ten thousand one to twenty five thousand upon receiving three written bids so we're still doing the same thing we're just not tying your hands as much because i agree everything has went up way up since these numbers were put in place and i agree with the councilmember dunn we can't keep hindering you from doing your job but haven't come to us for all the little things and it's already covered that we'll have a say in the bigger items at the end of the day it still takes two signatures that's true that's the bottom line yeah and as far as the values are rounded off to a dollar you're not leaving a provision between ten thousand and ten thousand one so it needs to be a penny and i like where this is going [Music] um hang on we have to talk to the citizens i'll run it any more council comments that's our mother's hand you just bring your chair up here if you'd like so you can't get away from the habit i'd like to give my two the only thing i would suggest is maybe put it in with the budget every year and change it let the but you have to change it up ordinance buying ordinance we can't we can't change it through the back door like that i mean it's okay it's very easy to change but we just have to go through the writing process saying review it once a year or review it once a year anyone else back to council so i think we have kind of consensus here that everyone seems to be okay with the limits i i have no i mean if everyone's okay with it i'm not going to stand in the way it wouldn't matter anyway um i do think we have to change this that our ordinance has to be changed by an ordinance and so all of this has to be changed by an ordinance um if we're going to do this and i do like mark's idea that maybe we put in that ordinance i mean it kind of makes us have to do it but take a look at it every two years maybe or you know i don't have to look at every year but one way to do it a mayor would be to um to have uh target a b and c as determined by the budget that would force you to determine those amounts every year because we do a budget every year so that would satisfy what marv is requesting personally i would rather it be an ordinance and and be written in stone because it's harder to change and i think it's vague would you say it's a because then it's buried in a budget and it's hard to see so it's a good way to change it without making more work for us but i think it should be a little bit more work for us but i'll defer to legal on that well i i agree have it be it by ordinance and if you're going to change it change it there's times where you have to have absolute clarity on spending money and having it in the ordinance and nowhere else is to me by far the better way of doing that and i think the citizens deserve to know what authority we're giving to our city manager they may or may not like that and we need to hear from them so um we could like i just don't think we need to do it every year like every two years maybe you know look at it because if you can do it every year but we're gonna put ourselves to a lot of work here that's our time frame on code review anyway i think i called for this one you were on the last one i mean it seems like we do it every two years yeah it's kind of like every couple of years to look at it so maybe we do it with our code review yeah every couple years look at code review that could be added okay patty are you noting this stuff okay because we're not all right anybody else have anything on page six you go to page seven i had a problem with number seven and i'm going to defer that to legal also mr riley um it says on uh 2-2-45-8 notice that failure of the violator to attend the hearing shall result in a fine being assessed against him or her i believe this goes against every rule of criminal law okay you can be tried for murder and you don't have to show up for your own trial i don't see how he can compel you to come to your violation hearing particularly if you're an absentee owner and you live in montana and you own property here you know i i don't think that makes you guilty until proven innocent so i don't think you can say that i don't think that even has any place in here whatsoever that's just me i think that's a due process issue i don't think you have to say a word at your hearing and why do you have to come they know how to get it lynn reeves knows how to get he can send you just respond it's a due process issue you're absolutely correct and i i will not try to implement that okay i think that should be deleted when i council have any issues on that delete the entire delete that whole thing that says notice that failure of the violator to attend the hearing not may shall we shouldn't be talking about that [Music] and this is just a point of information on 2-47 2-247 powers it's talking about subpoena service i don't know if we have a special deal with the sheriff or the police okay well they don't serve civil subpoenas you need to get a private process server so we're saying it could be the pinellas county sheriff but in reality it won't be you're going to have to use the private server unless they do us a favor because they won't do it for a regular attorney so just fyi i don't know if you want to change it or not but they won't well we just wanted to get because it said city police department they won't do it either but you have the right to form something or a small that is a right that we've retained in our in our charter and um code so i mean you don't have to strike it but i'm just telling you for a practical purpose the sheriff's not going to serve it if you put together a small city police department let's say a part-time squad or something like that you could conceivably do it i don't have a problem if we don't have it you want to strike it it's because i don't have the entire code open but 2-245 that e i mean that's that's number eight what are the other is there any conflict or any uh unexpected consequences if we delete agreed we're not the leading number are we we're just we're just taking off that sentence that says notice to uh i think it presently says notice i i did look all these up notice that failure of the violator to attend the hearing it says may right now and the suggestion was make it shall result in a fine being assessed against him or her my um my recommendation is to eliminate the whole line because if i'm challenging this uh as an attorney i'm gonna say you've already stacked his deck if i don't show up you've got good ground for a few we're not leaving the man as far as i'm concerned take the whole sentence out i don't think any if there's anything more i'm not i'm not asking that though i have an issue i mean if they if they don't attend they could still have a fine to make a set result in a fine being assessed so if they don't attend they could have a fine even though they didn't attend so i don't have a problem with the way it's stated i do because you're highlighting that their attendance has something to do with this it's a case of the obvious if you don't attend you can be fined you choose to attend or defend yourself but why say why even highlight that attendance has anything to do with this it doesn't that's not what you're being fined it's redundant you don't need it it's a case of the obvious council what do we want to do i have to open up to the citizens first hang on citizens are huh back to council we have consensus i was i wasn't there at the meeting so lynn reeves was an advisor there and uh wander schwerer was there is there's something in the thinking that we're not well the wording right now is made and really they were trying to say shall would be more they thought would be more enforceable but the wording as it says now currently it says attend the hearing may result in a fine being that says against him and then they end him or her but the fact of the matter is if if the word shall isn't put in there you can still get a fine if you don't attend you may get a fine and that happens with some sure that's just a rewarding that's just a fair warning i mean yeah if you don't attend you could still result in it but they the co-review committee looked at it and said ciao is more i'll say it was more realistically we have people who don't come to the code hearings anyway right they still may you know fine or some stipulation is an example for not a good example we've got a rental property the magistrate finding the 500 administrative fee and 75 dollars a day for not registering that property so they didn't have to show huh they didn't show no it said you know they what you're telling him with may is you may get a fine but yeah shall is definitely doesn't matter yeah [Music] a fine for uh coming they're getting a fine for whatever the violation was so we're going to leave it alone and just not put shall i don't care if you say him or her that's funny i think we leave it alone but add the or her at the end that i do agree with but leave it at may and you know yeah well i was gonna say leave it the way it is the key thing is if they get due process which is notice and an opportunity to be heard and they show up and put forth a vigorous defense or they don't show up the special magistrate if there's due process will then make a determination that's a valid proceeding and if there a fines levy and a fine is levied and it was done with due process so in some ways i i think you're over analyzing a little bit i think the the committee was trying to put more teeth in it and that it's a noble uh desire but the key thing is make sure there's due process which there is and whatever happens is up to the special manuscript this isn't a knock on the committee there were no attorneys on this committee uh you didn't sit in on this i did not attend these meetings i know that comment was made a couple times that they're not attorneys you don't expect them to know all this kind of stuff this is what you go to law school for so um they did fine job you know getting these suggestions to us and that's but this is not a knock on what they did but i don't want law that is going to cause us problems so that's fine um so we're going to make we're going to say may leave that alone at the or her and then powers we're going to strike city police department right everybody's good with that because we don't have one so okay that takes care of seven does anybody else have any comments take it to page eight fees residential registration fees and homestead exemption then it says that you're going to research the surrounding communities fees my only comment that i put by my little note here was why not higher why not 500 why not 50 why not 25. i mean well you know these people are making a bundle on these rental properties so if the city gets a little bit out of this particularly since it causes some aggravation for our police and for our administrative here um that's fine that would admit well just to clarify what this fee is for this is a fee for i'm going to use uh nautical watch because they're a timeshare well they pay a base fee the previous fee was 100 and when we raised the rental registration fee we didn't address these fees so what i recommended to the committee is the base fees 300 i think it's one to ten units is 20 more dollars and then [Music] beyond that it goes to ten dollars because basically you raise the rental registration fee against we'll say other condo owners which you know they're paying but we didn't get these what they called i'll call them resort things like the beller hotel and nautical watch where they pay a different fee and that's what this is to just increase those to to higher up basically but 100 it was 100 we raised it to the rental registration fee which is for everyone else and then the other fees were just doubled and these haven't been changed in a long time right okay and did you research any surrounding communities to get an idea i i talked to some others and it's kind of all over the board how they handle this some people charge a very minimal rental registration in other communities charging i think we're the highest i will tell you that we are the highest in the area it's it's not set in stone it's x dollars for this so we're already actually doing a substantial increase with these numbers it sounds like to me so i think that in my opinion that bees are high enough with these increases and that we move on because it's hard to compare apples to apples when you're looking at other communities with those two facilities that you're talking about i mean it's virtually hard to compare them so a lot of it would just go in with these increases the suggestions and they sound like me i think the mayor brings up a good point these these fees haven't been increased in a long time and i think it would be wise to benchmark this against some of the other municipalities to see what they are charging one of the things i bring back from this ie thing and and we'll address that at the uh at the meeting because i ask for an agenda input there is a recommendation that fees be examined and reviewed on an annual basis i mean not waiting five years decades or whatever to do this to make sure that you're keeping up with the times and it's just a best practice so a i would suggest that we actually do benchmark some of the other municipalities and two as part of the annual code review process or a biennial code review process we go ahead and take a look at that but start looking at fees on our whole frequent basis thanks good point anyone else on council yeah i'm uh i'm good with these rates i as you stated i would welcome just knowing what other municipalities are doing up and down the beach just bear in mind someone i wouldn't comparable us uh we shouldn't have the same fees as indian rock speech and i think you know to that point let's you know because this has to come up this is an ordinance change right let's make sure because we can get a little pushback when we raised the rental registration fees uh there was comments made there was a lot of comments made actually the city let's make sure everybody in the city understands why we're doing this it hasn't been raised since 1967 and you know and we're the best price in the neighborhood and it is bellar beach and you get a higher rental rate than some of the other cities i mean let's you know i'm not gonna say sell it but let's inform everyone why we're doing what we're doing and we're just not grabbing money here you know this hasn't been looked at in you know probably some time right another thing to consider and uh read over i'm sure she can confirm this there is no property there's no property available right now if you find a rental property here you're doing very well that means that they can charge a premium just like homes are going for a premium right now so uh it's clear profit uh if if they're in the rental business i'm sure well another thing you need to keep in mind is kind of the catch 22 right now because of the rules about kicking out a tenant that doesn't pay i mean landlords all over the u.s are suffering big time because you can't kick out somebody they can live there for over a year with not paying one diamond rent as of right now they've people been doing it since last march and they've really taken quite advantage of the situation that landlords are suffering so yes and no you've got rental properties that are hard to find but you got a lot of landlords that are saying they don't want anybody in their properties right now good point of course some of these are short very short-term rentals like the miller beach club and things like that that's not they're not suffering they're they've got to park pack parking lot and then he's laughing because he knows i'm right all right anybody else have any comments on that all right we move on so we're basically going to we like the key number everybody's good with that we'll change it and um and then to what glenn said and what you all kind of agree with presidential right now we do it october to september there was a suggestion because it confuses people that we do it by calendar year that's a good suggestion so does it confuse people like well i thought i paid last year and realistically they paid you know does that have any impact with uh with our accounting no you're going to have something that slides but it's not gonna make sure that we're all good with that okay everybody's not in agreement okay um let's move on to page nine we have environment prohibited conditions declaration of nuisance anybody any comments on that i do then because i think this came out of a an actual incident that we had in the town a couple of incidents we had some people who had put like these rubber um i call them gutter fills or whatever and they they were saying they needed them for their car and stuff like that i i'm not so sure that we have a problem if it's just cars here's my concern okay if they are incapacitated in a wheelchair or some other type of you know a device that they have to use and we're going to say you've got to take this gutter you know valley curve and go down and up we may be having an ada issue that was my only concern in reading this i don't think the car is so bad of an issue but i think that could be an issue well this was brought up uh partially because in other areas of our code you can't put anything in the curb that blocks your drainage and these do block your range and a couple of them and danny lifted them up it was mud all under it you know so it is blocking the drainage flow on the street but that doesn't address my what i just asked i mean yeah i agree i mean if it's just a car and you're doing it because you know you don't want to scrape the bottom of your car just go over it a little slower and you won't do it but if you're in a wheelchair or you're in a something else you know that you need to go down that curve to maybe load into a van or another ambulance or something like that and now we're saying you can't do it uh i don't know that we want to be doing that so well the only issue we have now is then maybe we need to put fred i'll defer to you maybe we need to put some ada language in here that nothing shall prohibit you know the proper use now if somebody says it's for ada here we go again it's the dogs and the you know the guide dogs issue again you know but i mean you know i think you know if it's legit or not so i don't know i'm just suggesting it trying to keep you out of an ada problem so mr riley well it's a good it's a valid point um i i always have to be measured when i say things in public but the uh those are the plaintiffs attorneys that represent ada complaints are some of the most innovative slash questionable attorneys i've ever dealt with in my life so the probably all you're looking at me when you say that i'm just bringing it up if you think it's valid i do i think you should think so i think you should allow that that's an acceptance do you want to do a change to the code that prohibits the blocking the gutters that that is something you want to do then correct well you know i mean these things have a name and whatever these kind of things are i mean maybe we can specify if you must have it for medical reasons then here's the ones you have to use maybe you can find the one that has the least amount of drainage issues i mean there's options here we don't have to just let anybody put anything in there they don't have to they they shouldn't fill the valley kirk because that is like acting like a dam you know so can we put in there something about a special permanent like they have to get it approved by the city like don't just say here's a list of companies just say like lynn needs to go out and see which one they want and make sure it's valid and removable or whatever and make sure that there's a wheelchair and not just go to the coffers well in one example [Music] one example the individual told me and i have an email from him that said he would move it if there was a heavy rainstorm but he's never removed it and we've had some heavy rainstorms yeah but we have so how many driveways would uh somebody in a wheelchair have to go down that has an actual drain guttering system there i mean they're not in the driveways right there is there any in the city that ends in a drive i don't understand why you would affect a wheelchair when the drainage gutters are set aside from your driveway so if you need to go down there to get into an ambulance or a van or anything your driveway is your driveway you should still be able to get there but with that said i also like the idea of council member dr ockey of saying that they have to get the special permission from the city so that somebody does know that you know that person in that home is handicapped i agree with that but i do i don't understand why somebody can't get out of their driveway the vans can back up into their driveways to kick them up or the ambulance or whatever they're going to get out of there i've never seen a drainage pipe or at the gutter in a driveway it's in front of every driveway in the city no mine is over to the side there is no train it's it's not the drainage job that you're taking out the curb well you've got to have a curb these miami curbs they don't have a long pitch yeah i mean i don't know why you wouldn't be putting anything in a miami person i mean it's slower than a typical housing the reason why they're doing this is because they're they drive high dollar low profile automobiles and they don't want to spray i understand that but it's still under a miami curve unless you're hitting that driveway at 20 miles an hour you're going to put the scraper but it's not about the car you know you don't scrape it if you backing out so that's i'm not i have zero worry about the car because there's an alternative i think when you choose to live in a beach community where there's water on both sides you have to adhere to the drainage and drive sensors i would i would say that um they're prohibited uh unless you have a medical necessity it's an ada yeah i mean i don't think you're i don't think you want to go down the ada route and tell people oh it's not that big of a problem it is a problem if you're in a wheelchair it could be you can get stuck in the thing if you can't if you don't have the strength to get yourself out of it i just think it has to be a level surface if you're riding it and you're not going to get into geovan can pull in your thing maybe it can maybe it can't maybe you've got six cars in your driveway so you don't want to inhibit any disabled individuals progress in any manner that's all i'll say citizens council we're going good i say just add the ada language get the permanent approval from the city or something not permanently maybe approval city i agree with the councilmember doctor hockey okay so now get adjusted that way i had nothing else on page nine anybody else sold number 10 buildings and building regulations there's a lot on the page so anybody have any comments section 1032 yes you're now saying if you have right into the mic i can't i'm sorry we're now saying if you have to repair three sheets of sheet rock can you find it yeah my question is why 100. um the other the other problem i had with this is i mean i think it's pinellas county requires you to have a toilet portable toilet every time you do any kind of major renovation um some people maybe never built okay they're not going to take it to your backyard they're not going to drive off-road they're not going to bring the truck and they have to maintain this every week i know it doesn't look pretty in your front yard but think of it as progress okay somebody's building something really nice that is actually making your area better i don't see how you can shield it when you build a project to pretty much cut down what's there you might leave a tree or two but it's not like you can put it behind a hedge and i you know we're hitting people with every fee in the world for impact fees and this that the other thing and now we're going to say what you got to fence your toilet in that you're going to have for two months or three months or six months i mean it's a toilet i know it's not pretty but it's just one of the necessities of building a project and i don't know that there's an easier alternative i appreciate the suggestion that we want to try and keep it hidden and i don't like looking at them either but i do like looking at the nice improvement that comes out of it you know i'm a little bit lost i'd like some clarification i thought uh councilmember frank banker was talking about section 1032 i don't see anything about it he's talking [Music] yeah no i i wasn't going to get into 10 35 but i wouldn't want somebody to move their toilet in the backyard next to my porch and they won't move it i mean you know you're gonna they're not going off-road it's sand you know just like we were just talking about sand is a problem so they're not gonna drive that truck over your sand they're gonna drop it right by the curb at 10 35 i uh i think it's it's not necessary and uh the reason why is because i had a dirt road for the last three or four months and uh i knew it was kind of we were going to get asphalt one day and and it was worth the wait and uh there may be a outhouse across the street from you but you're going to have a beautiful home across the street from you soon and make it worse i mean i i think it can be a suggestion if you can place it in an inconspicuous area if you can but i don't think we should mandate it and start making people build fences around outhouses just for these things these are typically not long projects and you know they just said what i said i mean something good has come out of that usually somebody's improving their property values let's work with them we want our city to keep building and improving as long as it's clean under the regulations of the port-a-pot i mean it all depends on how many people use it per day per week it should really help follow i can tell you from personal experience they're very rarely used in the summertime because they're just sweating so much that um they don't get used much i mean the guys come and they there's nothing to clean out it's just that's the way it works so but you know it can be yes they have to be maintained of course um deal anyway i had i did that one other issue here with the weeds the invasive species and i'm talking about the weeds listed here um i know we don't want weeds okay but i don't want wheat police either okay i don't want people walking through the front yard going you gotta eat and having had kentucky bluegrass lawns and prior houses i will tell you they drink a lot more water than the weeds which drink almost nothing which is why they thrive in this environment i don't know that we can even make a reasonable argument that weeds use less water i mean we already say that you can't have certain height on grass and weeds and i think that's perfect we want to say you want to avoid it but government over regulation here i mean you want to have wildflowers happen remember it's not in our code and it's conspicuous by its absence and i hate to say this because somebody might be listening but the governor last year i think was last year a year before signed an assignment bill that says you can put a vegetable garden in your front door so i know we like to see those pretty lawns in bel air beach but you can see a corn field too so i guess my point is let's not push it okay because somebody will put a farm in their front yard and they have every right to do it and we can't legislate that out you could have lots of rows of dirt and there will be weeds so i just think don't worry about the weeds it's not it's fred riley's kind of thing that's not a problem glenn i think the reference to this actually makes it more specific there have been some recent issues where hey it's bamboo of grass or a tree well by tying it to the state the florida state listing it takes it all out it takes all the questionable stuff out of it ties it to the state and says okay there's our reference there and if it changes before the state florida changes but we just go right along with it and it takes some of the questionable things out of people coming and saying hey you know my bamboo is a grass it's not a tree so you can't tell me i have to trim it all the time and it just kind of takes the pressure off of public works and code enforcement and the city manager so yeah the scenes are just for invasive species we're not talking about weeds in general but but it's florida state has an invasive species list an example brazilian pepper and and we've had complaints about various other trees that are in the city and the neighbor says well that's on the invasive species list well in our code it doesn't talk about the invasive species list it talks about brazilian pepper but beyond that that's all it talks about so all this is doing is saying if it's on the invasive species list you need to remove it but it's not i think what it says it's a stateless obnoxious weeds list it's it's not i mean i i know the brazilian pepper and things like that are you know these are trees bushes whatever you want to call them they got you know the state doesn't want it but i don't want to spend city money going through people's front yards going you got a whatever the hell the name of the weed is and you know you should know and you got to get that removed because you know how they're going to remove it they're going to dump a whole bunch of weed killer on it that's really not good for the lizards the ground the ground water and everything else that's with it and then what do you get i mean well i want to get the lead police i think it's overreach i'm going to give you the example we have a neighbor that continually brings this to us because there's a tree i forget what the name of it is that's on somebody's property next door and they don't like that tree and it's on this list and they they want it gone you know just spreading stuff into their yard and actually we had that discussion on the meeting about this situation and so that list just gives a reference we're not wanting to go out on somebody's weeds it's just a cross-reference to what the state says or invasive conscious state listed not just means the city doesn't go out looking at everybody's vegetation it's usually whenever there's a complaint and that's whenever this gives you teeth this gives you something a spine to back up if the neighbor has a legitimate complaint right as far as our code enforcement officer going out and going i don't know you've got hurt [Music] yeah i mean look the problem with this stuff is if you write it as a law somebody might go out and do it that's my problem with it if it's on the books it's alone okay we got a lot of stupid laws we have them other cities have them and if you put it there somebody can do just that and i'll tell you where that ends up okay it ends up with stuff like they had up in dunedin with the mayor or whoever is going to be your mayor down the road getting the hate mail and the death threats because somebody's gone why are you picking on mr you know military hero's front yard and his wheat okay we don't need that we don't need that publicity so i don't care about a brazilian pepper tree take it down that's fine but this says weeds i don't know what we're talking about but we need to make a little stuff in the grass and i don't know what's on the list and i don't wouldn't identify most of these weeds if i stepped on them i don't know you know it's all green yeah i don't care so [Music] i think we should uh read this or put it on there because i agree with uh council member glenn gunn and city manager and vice mayor goddess that this is all referenced by the florida state and i think we should stick with the florida state rules so that we're you know in the same situation as they are um also it isn't any more of a big deal than what um the city manager reeves stated is when somebody has a problem that they complain that there's nobody going out checking anybody's lead so i feel like we should put this in there and and go ahead it's there to solve an existing problem it takes a subjectivity out of it it cures a repetitive problem where every six months somebody's calling the city manager because they're complaining about the neighbors next door and they're trying to make the city manager make a subjective determination well is that an obnoxious weed or is that just a beautiful plant in my yard well the state of florida has already made a decision about that so let's take the burden off the city manager and align the state it a lot of it's trees it's just what the state goes out yeah there's 106 there's 106 species on the list i just pulled it out and uh it's pretty straightforward somebody has an argument it's on the list okay go check it out and tell them about it right and let's make sure we do that in all of our properties in every one of our gardens and in our back block over here you know we we work by the same laws that the rest of the city goes to the problem is is that if this stuff is right next door right on your line it will encroach into your yard you can cut it all day long it is not going away you you have to go and cut it on your neighbor's lawn you have to go in there dig the stuff in some cases you even if you cut it all the way down to the ground it continues to come back that's the problem and it's it's not that every one of these is is going to spark somebody complaining but it is a nuisance and i'm sure everybody here has had an issue at some time or another especially if they you know they really care about their lawn uh with something growing over there that upsets them you know and so it's just it's one of those things that i think we owe to the right residents that if uh they've got somebody that's not caring for their lawn and they want to complain about it we should probably go check it out folks yeah we please i think we've debated it let's bring it up to you know we're not here to vote on it tonight we're here to just get it out of committee if we will so there's enough support to move it forward let's move it forward and we'll debate this at a ordinance change we'll deal with it then maybe lin can give us this list of weeds and trees and whatever else is banned but again i preach is over and over we're subject to the same rules so if they're underneath your dock then we're gonna have to weed it out too they're in that thing in the back here by the by the water then you gotta get weeded out there too i mean we gotta practice what we preach we're not above yeah man girls aren't in that list i know but you know but but it's not just mangroves back there we just cleaned out the the uh the drainage behind the city hall and it was filled with garbage so and i don't think there's any dispute today if somebody complains about something on our property we'll check the list and if it's on the list we remove it but we're not in the weed police business either so i mean we're not going to go canvassing the entire community looking for 106 noxious weeds i just think this is if there is a legitimate complaint we actually have a list that we can refer to that sorry it's not on the list i can't help you and that's really all this is right i understand that okay all right that lane asks for citizens comments citizens okay did we resolve the original drywall relationship um yeah i'm sorry frank we didn't debate that i i agreed with you nobody else said anything so that's it that's an exception permanent exception yeah but it's too small it's it's i mean it's like three pieces of sheet rock you know you're gonna pull a permit because you're changing your kitchen you know i mean you can worry i suggest you remove it well the county building code i believe is i believe it's 400 square feet the building code yeah that's a that's a whole whole look this is this is a wall yeah it's it's it's small maybe if if we put whatever that is below it you know the county's affordability code they make you get a permit for and all this was to do was kind of add some things like you know you don't got to get a permanent wallpaper any reason we want to deviate from what the county says no i i mean that's what we should do but why do we even want to write that the county already says it i mean why do we need that in our code it's because our code is different when the cameras we we are able to make exceptions yeah so or take it out that's fine you want to get back to us on what the county says and okay so we'll debate this setup uh but there's definitely a question as to what the right square footage should be anything else did anybody else have anything else on page 10 yes i was just going to comment that this last discussion about the league police and how much we're doing i think that sort of comes back to what we said in this in the executive summary that you need to be looking at the strategic code goal number three was aesthetics and community we want to what does it create a life of wealth plan involvement in a city and an atmosphere that enriches our sense of community and quality of life and if i understand nothing's changed since i was on council the most common complaints and that penny hears from our residents is code enforcement and a lot of it's stuff like this so this is where we need to take a look at what do our residents want what is it that we're here to do if they want the code enforcement if they want aesthetics to be part of the code enforcement and they've expressed that and they're willing to pay for it i think this kind of thing that we were trying to incorporate here thank you thank you some comments i wanted to your point um i agree with you uh but to a point i said it earlier we need to keep in mind that this is private property and there's private property rights we cannot over regulate and i'll say this over and over again we can't over regulate as a city so you know yeah you might not like the fact that your neighbor has a wildflower but if it's not on this invasive species list well so be it so your neighbor has a wildflower maybe something you wouldn't have be caught dead in your front yard having but that's their choice they paid for that property unless the city is going to buy up all the property maybe a common area like they do and you're shaking your head because there's no way in hell we're going to do that you know it's your property remember you put a tomato garden in your front yard so let's be reasonable and i think every we have a nice city so i think if we're reasonable everybody will be fair but if we start saying you can't have a wildflower somebody's going to show you how they can have a wildflower and you know i think we're going to be able to lose the end of that battle because you can talk about aesthetics all you want but the person has the right to their property and to do with it what pretty much what they want as long as they're not creating a health hazard in you know another problem with mr riley did you want to say something oh you look like you want to say something okay anybody else we move off this page then so we have a little bit of debate coming up on this but i think we're moving forward and with the comments and [Applause] there's always this conflict to put a definition of immediate family because if we catch a contractor or someone they'll say well i'm this person's cousin well so i can work on this house because i'm his cousin so i the intent is to try to say it's got to be something for me i'm your cousin your family brother-in-law because people will even when the code enforcement guy goes there on the sunday they'll tell him well it's my cousin so he's okay so the thought process was to put something in their definition so i have no problem with that because i i've heard that exact problem we can define what the immediate family is i don't know how to prove it i mean if he says he's my brother um you know what do you do say show me papers you're not gonna do that um but i guess i take it to another level here why do we ban construction on sunday so let me be the devil's advocate you know why we're not a religious community so why can you build on saturday but you can't build on sunday and don't tell me noise because we just went through 115 days until summer so what about why do we have an issue with built with making noise but yet the property owner can make noise so your landscaper can't come and run the leaf blowers and all the other noise making stuff but you could run the same thing i just don't see the difference i really don't i know that's not what people want to hear but it's not right because we allow weather noise on sunday we do we have and yet you know we have this thing like you can't work on sunday so a guy's like wallpapering power washing the driveway he's painting the wall outside your house i mean that's not you know i can see if you're doing demolition but some of this stuff doesn't even make noise i know we have an exception for emergencies but i'm just bringing up the point why i really personally don't feel like we should open up contractors on sundays because you do have an excessive noise then and you also have vehicles parked all over the streets on sundays when you may have your family because even though we're not a religious community a lot of people that live here are very religious and they like to have like a sunday brunch or sunday event with their family after church and stuff i don't see why we want to have construction workers they can have one day off as well as the entire city of delaware beach i do not and will not you know support having any kind of contractors work on sunday unless it is an emergency of somebody's plumbing or their ac i think another reason why is because uh if we allowed it they would do it seven days a week it's one day you give them a break you give the neighborhood a break make it a little bit quieter yeah you're always going to have that guy that owns his property and breaks out his pressure washer or you know it's going to make noise but in general i would prefer not to hear roofers banging out a brand new roof on sunday they can do it on saturday i'm good with that but it's nice to have a quiet day okay i [Music] monday through saturday it's nothing but contractors pick up trucks and trails up and down the roads now factor in spring break snow bursts whatever i mean let's give ourselves one day a week where it's it's a break and i agree yeah and it's not going to stop my neighbor from being out there at 7 30 mo is long i just kind of chalk that one up to being a good neighbor and i i understand but i don't need to have five lawn care and let me make it clear i'm not advocating a change we're looking at code and i'm asking a question and i'm going to turn this to legal we're not a religious community i want saturday quiet next guy wants wednesday he's a doctor the doctors still take off wednesday doctors used to take off wednesday so maybe a doctor wants wednesday off and the next guy wants tuesday so we all have a good reason and some guys don't care if there's always seven days a week so what's our again i'm not advocating it so don't misquote me anyone but what's our legal standing to say we're so nice we don't want any noise on sunday what go listen to gulf boulevard on sunday morning with the motorcycles you want to hear noise frank's nodding his head he knows okay it's non-stop well i i i think everyone on councils agree that we should have one day in peace try to get peace and life i mean coming over that bridge and i can hear it on eight street i think we're all in agreement that sunday's an appropriate day not to have construction i when i was out campaigning mr mayor i had so many people say to me why did they ever move the quiet time from 7 a.m from 8 am to 7 a.m that was a big concern and if you live in construction just yet as you can probably hear the construction equipment it's 6 50 in the morning okay and there's a lot of residents here that would see average age 50 55 58 are retired they don't hear that at 7 o'clock but i understand i think one day a week sunday's the appropriate day to have and maybe you always even think about pushing a quiet time well to your point why not if that's what you just heard i mean i don't know who said this council didn't set it it wasn't the council before that i'm looking at glenn because i know you were on that council i don't think you changed the quiet time to seven that's been it's been seven it's been a long time i know when i built my house it was seven and i didn't start at seven out of deference to my neighbors i wouldn't do that i could have but i didn't but i mean maybe we should say seven thirty eight o'clock i mean seven's a little early yeah i i think there's something some merit to that because what happens is yeah they don't start hammering until seven but they're positioning their equipment and stuff at 6 30 and 47 so i mean we may revisit that i think trying to tie a religious aspect to the consensus for a sunday isn't a good argument i think what you need to go back to is this is a working community people are working yeah the average age is 55 and this is a working community and many of those people work on saturdays you know they may slide and have sunday and monday off but many of those people are working on saturday so monday through saturday people may not be there at home to enjoy the quiet time so but sunday is typically a good overlap with people having time no argument but i'm throwing it fred i don't expect an answer tonight but we're looking to coach why sunday and what's our legal justification for again we know we're not already i don't expect an answer now but can we do it i mean because i don't want somebody saying you're holding back my construction project by one day times you know eight months so what's the justification we're not a religious community oh i know you like to have your brunch well that's wonderful some people like to have it on saturday some people like to have it on tuesday they have the ladies over whatever it doesn't matter everybody's got a reason so my question is is what's our legal justification for being able to do this i'm totally in favor of making it quiet i'll even vote for saturday to be quiet too um but you know no no no emotions tonight it's just work session [Music] but you can at the next meeting i mean and frank's point is right i mean you know this it's illegal but this this noise pollution from gulf boulevard i mean you you could hear it down the block it's unbelievable may i say something before you do of course before um you start digging into this and spending taxpayers money looking all of this up and everything does the council ever want to change it from sunday i mean i'm not in favor of it so i don't know why we would spend taxpayers money even looking it up it doesn't matter the reason it's the day of the week that no contractors are supposed to work so i'm not in favor of you doing any additional work on it and spending our taxpayers money on it either so that's just me well if you can't equivocate a legal precedent for that and i am in favor of knowing why we're doing what we're doing before we get a lawsuit so tell me i i hate to put you on the spot but councilwoman swope said it doesn't matter it sure as hell does matter okay why are we why do we have sunday as the day of rest is it ocean grove new jersey so it's not an issue right now and i think that's a good point that reid is bringing up here it's not an issue right now it's all in the books it's been on the books it hasn't been challenged so we don't forget i'm challenging it it's it's a code review planning and zoning code review i'm bringing it up they didn't worrying it up i'm bringing it well if you're going to do that why are we closed on sunday fine i mean you can challenge this until it's 2 00 in the morning but it's it's a waste of time i mean doesn't council have the right excuse me tell me what you just said this is an open meeting what was the comment that you just made why are we closing why can't we have construction on christmas day i can't hear another religious thing i don't know i don't see why we're even considering [Music] i'm raising an issue i want to know the legal justification how why what on what we base this closure because if i'm building a project every day that i'm closed it's costing me money there are only two people in this room two bodies in this room that can give him direction one is a city manager and the rest is a city god this is a meeting and i'm asking him a question and he's being paid by the hour while you argue whether he can answer i've asked you a question i didn't ask you to do any work i asked a question so tell me what i could do it sounded to me like you were giving him the right direction i asked him a question um [Music] can we just stop this stop i'm tired of the bickering mama bear is coming out stop stop the mama bears thumb that's wearing me down just as much okay now stop it right now let's act like road man not children and let's talk to fred and let him do it stop looking for a direction are we looking for direction from the city i'll take the third time because you're a slow learner i ask a question i want an answer now why am i not allowed to do that mr gunn you want another 1983 suit i'm asking you a public question what are legal basis which i don't expect you to probably have an answer right now but if you know it tell me and then if this council wants you to research it that's fine i'll be damned if i can't answer the city mat ask people a question every question i've heard is some sort of direction for him to do it mr goddard you're not sharing this meeting you're out of order i've asked the question sit there and be quiet mr riley my good man that's what you want show everybody how smart you are mr warrior go ahead my good manners stop me from interrupting you because you're on the floor well the council needs to be able to discuss things or debate things among themselves so i i've been waiting to give an answer so i'll do that the as i understand it the code now provides for sunday to be the quiet day to my understanding and i'll have to go read it again but it's not tied to a religious holiday so if it's not tied to a religious holiday in the code then i i think you have a some basis for leaving a sleeping dog where it is that's and that may not sound like a very good legal answer but you know it to me it's not unreasonable for a community to want to have at least one day a week where you you do have some peace in play so you know that that's my answer and i i think what you will find looking at the code provision is that's probably been in place for a long time and it probably was never tied to a religious holiday i understand what your pointing out i understand that very well and you know it becomes one of these things it's an arguable issue you know arguably should you change it yeah y'all are arguing about whether you should change it or not i again i some sometimes this isn't meant it's criticism it's only when it's observation y'all uh debate vigorously things and that there's nothing wrong with that that's what you should be doing and what you should ultimately uh the point you should arrive at is what is in the best interest of the citizens you represent so i i will to council member slopes point out a curiosity this evening i will look at it i will not charge the city for looking at the code provision and if there's something that is glaring i will make it a point to come back and tell you that so that's a good compromise and now you can continue debating it or you can move on to the next point point of information what i hear from you is saying that we can establish a day of race there are no doors no i my understanding is the city council long ago already established and it's perfectly legal right well yes i would say it's arguable that the point mayor manzo is making is a valid point i understand the point is negative what bottom line is there's seven council people if if seven people want sunday or the majority wants sonny sunny will be the day if the majority wants wednesday correct it doesn't have anything to do with religion if you want to change the quiet day then you probably you would have to do it by ordinance but conceivably you could change it my my point is and this is not a religious comment but the there has traditionally been a day that is a quiet day for one of a better phrase in most cities i mean there was a time when in the deep south it was the you know bible belt and the laws were very much oriented towards that i think that has in many ways going out of favor and probably due to court cases but you could conceivably change it i i will you know rather than debate it endlessly i will look at it on my own uh inquisition and if there's something glaring i will tell you that fair enough any other comments citizens counsel page 12. page 12 wraps into page 13 on prohibitive activity activities and one of them is motorized vehicles and one of those issues well um there's a suggestion that we add ada compliant mobility chairs i think that's an excellent suggestion the second thing is that i believe and they made i know this was up for change i don't know if the state legislature actually changed it but they were talking about well right now motorized bicycles are considered bicycles so we permit bicycles on our beach as of right now a motorized bicycle for the state is allowed to ride on our beach so i'm not sure if that's going to change from the state they were talking about it but i don't know if they actually got it through so if not that's something that is under their law permitted on our beach whether we like it or not right you would have to ban bicycles in general because on the beach if you wanted that and the sheriff's position is the state law says motorized bicycle is bicycle is bicycle so so that's the only one i had on 30-144 the rest of it looks fine to me 30-53 why are we [Applause] eliminating what better tensile strength is how to galvanize over aluminum grass blondes especially that was discussed at the code meeting and i'm trying to remember who because it does deteriorate it's probably a corrosion encroachment concern not a tensile strength thing you know probably you could get around it by just saying marine grade or quality you don't have to specify whether it's stainless bronze or zinc or whatever if you just go to green what's the county suggest again we should be with what they're doing i don't know why bellar beach is different than the rest of the county i'll check to see what the county says but you know today people building docks are doing other things like stainless and stuff because the the bolts the galvanized it does deteriorate just need clarification right aluminum and on the last page under regarding seawalls and dots would this be a good time to add in language as a ball sea wall repairs modification shallow performance add something in there that all seawall repairs and modifications shall conform to the neighboring sequence i would say yes that makes sense but in all reality that is not the case um you already have sea walls that are varying heights and depths out and i understand where you're going with that but i don't think it's it's practical i don't i don't think you could um this would be coming forward you could make that you've got a cracked cap and now you have to move your entire sea wall so i i would i would say probably not unless you've got something i don't know i think everyone's responsible for their own and even though the uh it doesn't look great i don't like blue well i'm just saying so i'm just trying to find conformity exactly so um i i see where you're going and um but i again i think that the problem is is your neighbor uh has concrete and you replace yours with the the uh yours is automatically going to not line up with your neighbors so that's that's kind of the case would you agree with that yesterday [Music] somebody puts in a new sea wall they're typically raising that 12 inches if there's a water flow you know if we the city replaced the art seawall on belle isle and uh harrison and we've raised it 12 inches because then overflow now what i will say is whenever it's the neighbors turn that's going to encourage them to bring it up and make it match um because eventually they're going to be like like i am right now i'm going to be one of the odd man out you know because i've got an older c law anybody have any other comments on we do page 12 and 13 together because they kind of like to say go into each other anybody have any comments i had a question on section 3-185 the last one regarding sea walls and dogs there's a suggestion there about the warden days to get an assessment about 30 days to remove a repair i can appreciate that but i think you need to put a deadline on that somehow otherwise a person just comes forward says hey i've got an assessment and i'm not happy with that when i need to get another one and then 38 stretches into 60 to 90 to 120 days so i mean is there a is there a deadline somewhere that i'm missing [Music] put the brakes on the process there well as an example the vice mayor and i went uh what three or four months ago on a boat ride and we gave notices to all those homeowners and some of them have taken care of the situation some of them haven't but i think giving a you know giving them the opportunity to get an assessment we don't need five of them if as an example the sea wallet fell in on facial which robin knows and i know dave knows we had told them through a code violation that the seawall was bulging it just didn't get repaired before the bulging pulsed out and fell in the water so i think you know making them get an assessment of 30-day time period is reasonable and also it's going to be tough to i mean just being realistic sometimes you can't get anybody out russia and it's situational but i i think at some point you need to say 120 days or even 365 days to complete a repair i mean otherwise how long did that stretch out the guy says hey i got my assessment i've satisfied your city requirements all in the meantime the neighbors as an example right now to get the sea wall put in or dock their their months yeah so maybe that that is a caveat that we put in there you know maybe 180 days after the assessment it has to be repaired if the assessment says well it may have prevented what happened yeah well they had already got what happened those the people that were gonna buy that house had already signed a contract to fix that seawall it just happened five days before they closed on and that was one of the days where you know we had a lot of rain then there's a suggestion here in 30-185 actually there's two suggestions one is to update time frame that a marina slip shall remain vacant without a boat i think that has merit to it and then it says and that's i'm not sure about the second one suggestion to add language to require removal of a lift upon vacating arena slip i believe we spoke about that in a prior work session about people selling this the uh the lift to the incoming person so i would hate to see somebody rip it down only to say the next guy says yeah i would love to have that and maybe bought it so um he shouldn't abandon it uh you know he or she but you know if we can broker a deal or at least get them in touch with each other that's what we spoke about i remember i passed right and and realistically unfortunately right now there's there's a person at the marina that hasn't got a bone in the slip but he's stuck in england he can't come back to the united states so he's paying his rental fee but he just can't come back to put his vote back there so that's extending circumstances to me so i don't think you but if it's just uh you know if you don't be able to slip i believe it's patty do you remember is it 30 or 60 days 30 it's 30 days unless you're getting repairs or taking a long trip and you have a written right so i don't think it's a bad idea to put something in there maybe with that caveat that you just said because there's a perfect example or you know somebody decides to take a trip with their boat you know around the world i mean they might be done for six months and they still want it i think what we're trying to prevent is somebody from brokering that slip or you know keeping it and you know using it as a chip to sell you know with their property or something like that that's a think thing what we're trying to prevent [Music] right if we can get language and i think that would work so anybody else have any comments citizens counsel on to zoning page 14. lynn maybe you can help me out here because i didn't know there's no background on section 94-6h it says no parking with a hundred feet of gulf boulevard yeah of the the planning and zoning board members brought up that uh not allowing vehicles to park within undefeated boulevard because as an example it makes it tough to get out you know especially if it's two-way traffic so what they were asking is don't know like landscapers or whatever that's what they were trying to believe uh where are they going to park the corner house where is he going to park the landscape is always parked right spot and i mean that was brought up by one of the yeah i'll tell you what what they're currently doing is they're pulling all the way up to the stop sign to the point where you can't even see it nor can you see to make a right or to see traffic coming towards you whenever they're parked on the right side of the right street and that's what the complaint is i get it it's probably somebody who lives on 20 seconds they do it all the time but they need to i don't know about 100 but they definitely need to leave some room where you can see both directions there's already state law for that and that's why i'm questioning the hundred because what you're doing is you're taking two properties all the 102s all the 103s one of which is mine okay and you're basically making that person unable to park any vehicles in front of their house and that diminishes their property value it makes things incredibly inconvenient now there is a state law you can't park up against the stop sign in case anybody forgot from the driving exam it's 30 feet so if they're parking within 30 feet of a stop sign that's illegal and if they're parking within 20 feet of the intersection that's illegal now that's an enforcement issue for our city making it bigger isn't the situation i mean you actually i'm thinking of one in my neighborhood whose house i look at his driveway happens to be on the east side of his property number 103 he wouldn't even be able to park a car you know under any circumstance and that's not right if we're going to do that that's going to lead to potential variances and the takings so i don't think 100 feet there's no good reason for that when the state says 50 feet i'm sorry 30 feet by the stop sign 20 feet of an intersection it's an enforcer maybe the stipulation in our ordinance is state guidelines that's because i like it i i i don't care about the 100 feet i just don't want to block and then that should do that that's just what was brought up that's what they were trying to accomplish but do we do we need to again i'm gonna ask this question do we need to put in our ordinance stuff that's already in the state law i mean that's a driving law you know you don't need to be redundant here the state already has that while it says no parking within 30 feet of a stop sign in florida 20 feet of an intersection i mean do we need to repeat that i don't care it's no big deal to pass it as an organization we always do an updated flyer we put that information in there we the state guidelines are kind of like a minimal guideline our real concern is the bigger contractor people when you have a long as you're coming down the road you can't see the sign or he obstructs your view of traffic going across gulf boulevard that's the issue so maybe language that just kind of makes it a little more restrictive for yeah you stay with the state guidelines but you kind of connect it down a little bit to restrict the parking of larger commercial grade vehicles i mean a car is not an issue because you can typically see over a car but when a guy parks his dooley there with a double-wide trailer there that's the issue so maybe maybe some restrictive language the other thing is what i don't see in here something we've been talking about too long which is parking across the street two cars so natara came and told us that she did a study i guess with chief burton that you can't get a fire truck if we have two cars parked opposite each other that's not in our ordinances and if somebody gets an overnight parking permit or anything else landscapers that can't be allowed to happen that is a safe that's a real safety hazard so it's not in our law right now and it's not a state law so you could be legally parked on both sides of the street and if somebody just comes out a little bit i mean i know it from when we did the last uh city-wide yard sale it was hard to get a car through it i can't even imagine if you have a fire truck so so that i think we should put in here i mean i don't know how you word it to make it clear but it shouldn't be there and if you get an overnight parking permit if you're gonna have a party for 20 people you can park up and down inside of a road but you can't park across from each other maybe we can put a picture or something but they can't do it that was one of the complaints that we're getting we don't allow overnight parking anywhere on our streets lynn is that correct for anybody it doesn't matter if you're having an event or not now you can have it up till a certain time but then those permits or that permission to park on the street is always on the site that the event is being held not on both sides of the street correct that's what it's supposed to be there is no overnight parking permit you know somebody's got an issue with weather park bring their car and park in the city health parking lot two landscapers okay like what glenn's talking about i get a guy who has this huge trailer huge truck he parked i've seen this i mean it's happened on our block sometimes they just come at the same time one guy's on one side one guy's on the other the fire truck's not getting through it's just not happening and he they're both legally parked maybe i mean the one might be a little close to the corner but they're both legally parked so that that to me i just that's a safety hazard we've talked about it here so there's no you know it's not anything new that's that was the only point but maybe we could create some language in here that says the adjacency you know because as an example we'll just go down the street and there's a house on the on your street on the left side if you're going down your street but the landscapers parked there but up by your house your landscapers park there so it's it's still one but it's a distance to get through so someone but maybe it's adjacency however we could work it i just think the one one other thing i want to bring up there was some discussion about artificial curve uh our code says no artificial burp in front of that there is a house that has some artificial turf and i learned today that there's another house that's talking about putting thirty two thousand dollars worth of artificial turf zero scaling it requires no uh reclaimed water or right so you know we need to our current code says no artificial turf and i don't think i don't think we want uh the green stuff that you can go to home depot or to get off the road so but if you have field turf that's 36 thousand dollars it looks i mean they have it at football stadiums it looks pretty good but that's i wouldn't want it on my neighbor's house so uh i think the council needs to make a decision you know how you want to handle that with the artificial turf because there are a couple people that have put it in there's a good example of a whole yard of it on gulf boulevard to include the right way uh it probably uh is that probably 1200 block or somewhere you'll see it it's been there many years uh but you know i what's the council's feeling on that right i i personally don't care i'm fine with it it would alleviate the weak problem and the landscaping problem so see maybe we should all get sick and we'd all be happy that it conserves water my only concern is i'm going to defer to you fred i mean drainage is a potential issue if it doesn't have the proper drainage it could be a real problem but i mean they build you know beautiful multi-million dollar stadiums with it it's not wait say it's ugly i mean i agree with lynn the stuff you know that you get for a couple dollars a year at home depot isn't really what we want but again legal basis it's not our property what can you legally say to people about they want to make it look like the brady bunch and have uh artificial turf like mr brady had in the backyard so what do we do you don't remember that you're too young well you asked for this marcia marcia so i i don't mean to use the same stock answer but i will if this is something that concerns you then let me see if we can find someplace else that has addressed it so that we're not reinventing the wheel you're the point you make is is to me is fine um i'm i'm a property rights person and but you know you the the one basis you would have for doing something is if it creates a drainage issue for your neighbors so that to me is a legitimate basis to to regulate it in some way but let let me take a look and see if i can find another community that's addressed right and most artificial turfs even the stadiums have to be replaced every five years because they do get drained clogged so i mean but now they have you know it's not just artificial there's like rubber compounds and ground up tire and everything else in there to make it easier i mean it's come a long way since it used to be fred if you can you know shapes and sizes and all that but uh it was that we currently have code that says you can't do it is that right right that's correct okay so we knowingly have neighbors that are already doing it and nothing's happened so my first question is why have we not addressed it why are they not in violation and have been addressed that's the first question the second one is is is that really what we want in our front on our front lawns do you want to maintain your grass and your neighbors got plastic out front it's it's obviously an artificial color um is that is that the direction that this council is wanting to go do we want to look the other way and let it happen and just get rid of the code or do we are we welcoming this um i you know i want our city beautiful and i don't think astro turf is beautiful the guy who put it in dust probably this what the vice mayor is asking goes right to the heart of the issue that rwanda was trying to say here the vast majority of code enforcement issues originate as a complaint and the city's responsibility is to always go after those and investigate them and find out and resolve those but to rwanda's friend what he's trying to get the council to recognize and i think that's where we're coming around to is things like we police dock painting police astroturf police what are the priorities where we want to be testing our code enforcement people what's the cost of doing business what are the highest priorities would we rather be going after that the guys the double-wides parking uh and restraining uh traffic going down the residential road or do we want that guy out looking for astroturf so at some point we need to sit down with the residents poll the president and it goes back to communications and the strategic plan and the consensus of the council and the city manager and staff where do we want to devote our our revenues our expenditures our staff our manpower sort of thing what are the priorities here so you know very valid questions but you know that's that's something we need to start thinking about sorry thank you what else yeah i agree with glenn i don't think this is a high priority because you know i'm angry you know after turf is not my choice of lawn but then again you know somebody one of my neighbors has you know the rocks all over their driveway or rocks and their vegetation and that's not my choice either so who's to say that astroturf versus rocks which one's better it's all opinion and it's just this council's opinion but maybe two councils from now all have astroturf so i think i think it's an opinion thing so to me i'd say let them put aster turf in their front yard if they want i don't think we should ban it but unless it becomes a drainage issue and that's then that's where it becomes a problem for your neighbors so i don't think that should be allowed so yeah i wouldn't think you know astral turf is not going to be a drainage issue because typically it's put down wire on top of soil or some drainage substance a lot of a lot of uh our code does a lot in the backyard it just does a lot of the framework and if you drive around the city there's a lot of people that have these little golf greens you know they're sand filled and there's ash turf on top of them well it's not ash prepared please it's not the stuff you get at home depot so and and we've only got one it's got a small area in their front yard and the planning board committee did a couple of my mind looked at it and they said if if you could establish a quality level then it doesn't really look bad it's but if you can't establish some quality parameter then it would be very hard to enforce what i'll just qualify my statement too i don't think it was the intent of to just because you're not enforcing it to remove it it's still something in your toolbox and somebody thought about it long ago and thought it was an issue and maybe you need to do some more critical thinking a little bit later down the road but it still serves as a placeholder and if it becomes an issue again you still have something in your toolbox to do some critical thinking and discussion and debate i'm not advocating just because it's not being enforced you pull it out because somebody thought about it long ago as an issue so that's all i'll do is just qualify all right all right that's page 14. that's page 14 folks we're on page 15 the last page anybody have any comments i have one comment it should be 94-256 it says 246 temporary structures with that i was confused um it talks about moving van ander trailers yeah i mean what are we trying to do here well no there's a section our code that says you have a pod but you can't have a trailer or a moving fan so all we're wanting to do is you know somebody's moving in or moving out we're just trying to say that moving vans pods u-haul trailers they we kind of put them all in the same bowl i guess we're forbidding this right yes okay i just didn't want to be banning people from moving okay no no you have to get a permit and you post it in there seven days am i right maybe seven days i think yeah they can get a permit for seven days for a pod or a so it's for a move now it's a drop off okay all right they'll drop a pod in their driveway but our code only talks about pods it doesn't talk about the u-haul truck or anything else so we need to add that to our code anybody have any issues with that anything else citizens i think that takes care of it unless there's stuff that anybody that comments and stuff that should be in here that is not in here hearing nothing okay addie i hope you got all of that and she's nodding okay so we'll bring this in as a series of ordinance changes over a period of time some stuff being more important than others and some stuff still being open for discussion so that's where we're going all right next we have um the final item is the discussion well actually we have two items we have the discussion of the uh sign ordinance and then if there's any other miscellaneous from any of the council members um it's nine o'clock we've been going for several hours does anybody need a break because this might be a little bit of time 10 minutes is everybody good with that title one so five ten okay uh item number two is the discussion of the sign ordinance review of the proposed ordinance um i don't know where to begin because it's the long borders i don't wanna necessarily go page by page fred do you want to i mean really the architect of this so do you want to maybe give some overall comments yeah i would like to make a couple comments starting out and this is for frank and leslie although i think leslie may have been here for some of this last summer um we had a gentleman that raised an issue about the sign ordinance and it's something that had been discussed before but what we did when he raised some questions about political signs is that we did a resolution that basically said the city was going to not enforce that aspect of the sign ordinance and basically try and do a status quo he was talking to mayor manzo a few minutes ago the guy that approached lynn and then i spoke to him several times is a lawyer that was from uh bleep michigan and he he was very learned he absolutely knew what he was talking about and he pointed out some things in the ordinance that were very legitimate points and was extremely helpful and he was also cooperative about i don't want to cause the city any problems i'm just you know wanting to give you the benefit of my uh background and that was very much appreciated after that i went through and spent considerable time rewriting the city's sign ordinance the sign orders what i the approach i took is i tried to do several things one is i tried to put as much stuff as i could that would preface what you were doing and why and the reason a lot of that is especially at the beginning of the ordinance is so that if if you ever have you forbid have a court case to do with the enforcement of the sign ordinance then you would would at least have things to apply to that that set would give you the basis to say we have made every good faith effort that we can to do this consistent with the applicable florida law and probably even more importantly federal law and constitutional law the so all that that type of uh stuff to to or provisions to give the basis for what you're doing and why why you're trying to comply with the federal law the state statutes etc that's that's all up front in the the sign ordinance there's um you know the fundamental thing you can't do because the sign ordinance is it comes down the constitutional right of free speech is the the more you can make it about the size of the sign and for instance if you designate that this this is the size of the sign that that's what you're regulating your regulation is limited to something that is has nothing to do with the message and that that is the key as far as i'm concerned to understanding all of it if you are doing anything that relates to the message then you're going into what is potentially dangerous waters with constitutional violations because it's the government regulating or you know prohibiting somebody from having their their constitutional right of free speech the the the one provision is i wrote i looked at several different cities how they handled it i tried to change our existing code as little as possible and somewhere along the line you you've probably seen a redline version of the document if you you haven't i'm happy to provide it but that redline version is always to me helpful because it shows you know what you've changed and it gives you some perspective there's um excuse me one second are you okay leslie you didn't break okay there's um you know we we can certainly discuss the the various things that are in the sign ordinance i put in a severability provision at the end and the severability is typically something you you always try to put in because if there is a term that is you know inconsistent with the law or in this case unconstitutional then you would have a basis if you're ever in court and say the the whole law shouldn't be struck down but that provision um okay judge if you strike it down that the rest of it is still in intact that's kind that that's trying to to mitigate damages the one thing i will say um in this was i discussed with lynn numerous times is and i'll just say it very clearly as clearly as i possibly can these these cases related to free speech and signs is an absolute quagmire and i spent a lot of time looking at a lot of cases some two of you were lawyers and you've read supreme court cases and oftentimes they're 40 or 50 pages long and that that tends to be a long read the the thing that is was confounding and writing this is there are a lot of cases at both the federal court level and at the u.s supreme court that relate to the illegal standards for the sign ordinance or for sign launches across the board there's of course some uh seminal cases and i tried to reference several of them and in saying that if you pass this you're trying to comply with those important cases but i again will emphasize in my uh opinion this it's an absolute quagmire and if you adopt this or a version of this and in the future there's ever an issue what i would do is the same thing we did last summer is try to appeal to a reasonable person and find a some way to to address their concern but that isn't always the way it happens there there are you know groups that and i'm not gonna pick one but i will say there's organizations that um at times this is what they do they litigate over things like this that are constitutional issues in pain city completely different from the sign ordinance but we had a long-standing ordinance that related to where somebody could have a a church and it was basically church zoning and the group that approached us was from pretty sure dallas and i ended up working with their attorney and what they did is contacted the city and basically this was a law from i would say the 40s 50s and they said are you aware that this [Music] law in haiti city infringes on the constitutional right for people to have a church and we have a discussion about that and ultimately what we were able to work out as if hain city needed to update their code provision related to that and they were extremely cooperative in you know giving us ample time to do that and the you know on the other side of the table though it was clear that if if we didn't we'd end up in federal court and we'd be defending that law that was now 50 60 years old and um that wouldn't have probably ended so good for uh pink city but i'm drawing a contrast there's there's groups like that that are willing to work with you to help you update the laws and then there are groups that they they aren't looking to work with anybody they're looking to file a lawsuit and make make a federal case out of it and that's where it would be i'll just say this in passing what in my tenure here in bel air beach one of the things i have really tried to do in you know knock on wood i think we've been largely successful is not end up in federal court um there are times that you know if you have a police department then you will end up in federal court because there's going to be that kind of case but you know federal court case is a pricey affair and it's something i would hope we would be able to avoid in most circumstances but i again will leave my comments with this this is absolutely a very difficult area of the law mayor joe has already told me there's things he can drive a truck through and i don't doubt that but you know i i'm all for modifying it in whatever way we need to to make it is absolutely consistent with the law but i again will say there are cases every year that modify some aspect of this and it is it was really frustrating working with these because a lot of the cases weren't even consistent and you would think that you would get some consistency between some of the cases in federal court and the us supreme court be honest with you there were some i didn't even think the supreme court was particularly consistent so you know but that's that's the lay of the land and that's that's what we have to work with so i certainly am wanna discuss it and uh answer any questions you may have alright council um yes um i've read all of this as well as i'm sure all of council members did and my only question is and it goes to the political sign one is there's no time frame stated in here when they can put that sign out i mean let's just say for instance you know he's running in an election two years from now so you can put your sign out now as long as you remove it 30 days after the election because that's the way it is right now written here that i understand it to be so is that the case you can have a time frame and let me get to that part of it [Music] i thought it was for a 30-day period it used to be 45. the 30-day period to my understanding is to remove it after the election right with that that's after the election but there's nothing that states anything prior to the election that's what i'm asking about because well i'm going to give you not a very satisfying answer the the election season is a has become more and more protracted every cycle and the the the cases go towards what set the election day and within a reasonable time and there's a court case that says 30 days i don't remember a court case that that set the reasonable time before it is 30 days or 60 days and that's a problem with a lot of the cases the cases address one aspect of the whole issue now i said it's not going to be a very satisfying answer and it's not no so let's say i know somebody is going to run for mayor the next time our mayor's position pops up in march of 2022 so i can put that sign in my yard tomorrow if i want as long as i remove it 30 days after that election i mean that's the way i read this open what i don't know did i miss it as well how many sides you can put in here i think you had one yeah it used to be i looked for that and i used to be one but i didn't see it um there's a case that related to the number of signs you have and that the analysis that people go through the courts go through is if there are multiple people living in the home and they have different political views then why can't multiple people back multiple candidates and in addition there's you know the presidential election but you're all also likely voting for your senator or your um congressional representative and the candidates at the state level so you know put saying you could only have uh two signs for instance would be a an arbitrary i'm not debating i'm just asking if it had fallen out or no i understand the reasoning right and i think those are the arguments we face all along okay so those are the issues a lot of the the discussion is against doing things that are already triggered so again i refer back to all the purpose and all the explanation of why you're doing this i mean basically what you're trying to do is have a aesthetically pleasing community that doesn't have a lot of clutter and that that is a legitimate basis to regulate that's why there's all that language in this about that type of thing i guess to expand a little bit of what glenn said i understand like one for president one for senator but what happens if i decide to put 10 of the same one for like the same person like if i wanted 10 for a president whoever 10 for mayor i guess that that i would be more worried about that instead of multiple people do multiple signs for one candidate i don't know if it's a problem i don't know if that's is that what you were kind of no no and you're right but i think the answer is yeah you can do that if you want your property you know to life i mean our rule used to be one per candidate but you could have you know six people in the house of six different candidates or people in the house all for the same candidate well i'll say that you can regulate this is a practical matter i mean most people want to respect their neighbors and they're not going to put 100 signs in their guard okay i said most people maybe not you but um you know most people are not going to do that and it's not a problem most people are going to put one or two signs in and that that would be it but the problem you have is if if you start limiting it then you quickly get to you're limiting the message and that's where you're going to get in trouble fred to that end i'm not going to go through every little way that this can be challenged i don't think first off did an excellent job with this i know how difficult these cases are because i've read most of them i've been through this stuff already um strategy that somebody can be listening to and challenge our city with it okay i think anything is subject to challenge and i think i said it earlier tonight the more we call attention to something the more we may get unwarranted attention i believe the gentleman came in here not it was that same night that the attorney came in but there was another gentleman and lynn reeves told him to take out his son and he put two sides in okay so you know gotta be careful so i'm gonna make my comments somewhat general there's a few specifics here but um page 10 we talked about this is an easy one streamers ribbons are not permitted except for the city nope i mean i don't see it if they're not permitted they're not permitted we're no different than anybody else city functions we're on sale so what we either like them or we don't like them take it i don't care which way a streamer or balloon doesn't bother me but um just the point okay item eight cities signs may be removed by the city that's what usually gets the lawyers calling you or me or lynn i'd be real careful about exercising that yes we have the right to remove them but um public property yeah but we've also removed my project property we've asked that that's a couple you've got mr um i like to say his name but the lawyer who came in that sign was removed and he caused the problem or was i think it was actually removed from not mistaken it doesn't matter it was asked to be removed same difference um page 11 construction signs i mean you know i apologize this was a long read i think the size of construction signs are bigger than residential signs so i'm just wondering why the preference for construction message over political message or my personal message no there's no preference okay so maybe we should have one sign you know because i do note that sometimes a construction guy has this huge sign you know and like we're limited to i don't know two by three or so you know and his message is not more important than ours or what happened so just something to think about with the suggestion um the temporary signs um we talked about you know having temporary signs when we talk about it has to be the culmination of the event one of my things that grows through here is you can have temporary signs that don't culminate in an event you know and some of it might be political some of it may not be maybe i want to put up a temporary sign like i don't like such and such councilmember i could put that there i could put that i love such-and-such council member i love the city i hate this next city or i don't like that i love the next city you can put that up and i think that comes under temporary maybe non-political signs but that message i don't think you can restrict in fact i think one of the actual cases was somebody put something up just to that general thing like he didn't like somebody in the town the town tried to ban it and they said well it's your property you can put the thing up so to that i would just say you know a temporary it may not have a culmination so if we take a look at this with that in mind we also since this was a problem this summer we had people holding handheld signs and placing multiple signs on properties this doesn't address handheld sides at all in the city so i don't know if handheld gets any special deference than a regular one but i don't see that should be any different well when when they're on the sidewalk which is public forum then they're leaving them alone right but there were other signs placed in the in content not harmful to minors well there is a thesis okay i don't know some kids what could possibly be harmful to some kids um and other kids might be harmed by just you know one little word or something i mean it's hard to define that i don't know how you even go about doing it but a bad word isn't necessarily harmful and some of these kids could swear about the sailor so i don't know that you can again get into content here so it's an issue um again we talked about uh temporary signs for a specific special one-time event or function that does not normally occur more than once a year ie sales a property construction process well you know again what about general message i'm not going to go through but you can put a million general messages and it's not there some of that might come under politics some of it may not be and um so we don't define what political sign really is in here um and then we talk about the ballot for qualified candidates um some people aren't on the ballot yet so there's people declared for various positions um somebody wants to endorse somebody for a mayor who hasn't even qualified yet uh i don't know that he can't do it but um i think we do limit it because we save ballot issues with qualified candidates you could just say such and such party is wonderful or the other party is terrible you know without going into detail you could say president is great the president is terrible and that's not really a an issue so that's not really an issue that i think we could restrict so that doesn't get in here uh what glenn said i mean i don't i didn't see anything in here either i had how many um there doesn't seem to be a limit on your political signs um i think we could set something reasonable i mean you can't have a front yard of 100 signs that's that's the whole thing that we can do is say you can't have a neon sign and you can't have a billboard in your front yard and you can't have 100 maybe for one candidate okay if you have 100 people living in your house see mr reeves because you've got a problem um you know i think that's the problem this whole removal and impounding of signs i would be extremely careful on that and maybe put some language in there that maybe the city manager or the person who seeks to do it the code person maybe contacts you in advance and let you know it's not like this happens every day but that's the thing that's going to trigger the person coming to headquarters the person you know we were lucky last time that attorney could have very well hit us with a federal suit and he didn't um and yeah win it or lose it but like you said you spend a bundle defending it so that is something that you want to be careful of i've kept it general i think that's my overall comments you should be able to put up a sign that says pretty much almost whatever you want like it or not and we may not like it you know you could say you hate your neighbor you know it's not a good way to have a good friendly neighborhood but um you can put that in or you can say you love your neighbor and i i don't know that that is really fleshed out in here that that right exists because it's not a one-time event maybe i hate my neighbor every day every week twice on sunday that's my comments generally but overall i want to commend you because it's easy for me to look back on this and say here's where there's issues and holds um overall there's not a lot of holes this is pretty good it's really good so that's what came to mind for me anyone else what it was it was so long i couldn't remember why i was in the swamp i mean i understand where we were going and it basically boiled down to the vehicle you know i understand why you calculated the language that you did but i mean it was such a lengthy piece of uh ordinance i couldn't remember why i was in the swamp and then when i get to 86-4 exemptions c it talks about you know it talks about uh you can have warning signs or potential dangers or other signs for the benefit of the citizens as authorized by the student manager well all of a sudden the city manager is back in the censorship rule because somebody could come out and say hey i'm trying to make a public announcement to my people and give me specific information so all of a sudden he's got to start figuring out whether or not that's a specific message we're trying to cover all the basements i think it's impossible that's my comments thanks [Music] yeah so some kid comes up and says that's a fancy piece and then there's other kids that it wouldn't be offensive if it might offend you and me more than it will send a kid you know that one in which that could make america one of the greatest legal standards was related to pornography and that was the uh although i know it when i see that's what a it judge said that that was his standard and of course that's no secret at all that's what he said and i mean and that becomes very subjective because yes you don't want children to be offended but there's highly sensitive children and then there's kids that nothing will bother you i mean obviously as a mother of thinking about my young innocent children but i mean if it's a sign that you would bring with you to church you probably should put in your yard just i mean i think like the f word saying you like the person over another is not offensive even if that person is offensive in real life but i think it's common sense here and what is what can hurt a child what's appropriate but to robin's point i mean there's a supreme court case on somebody wearing a shirt to court with that very word from the judge and he won because he said not judge the other person he said that's freedom of expression that's an adjective and i can say it and you know so it's i hear you i mean it's not being a good neighbor i wouldn't put it up if i was your next-door neighbor i think that's a person i wouldn't do it but somebody else may not like their neighbor too much i think we actually had a situation in town that the neighbors were trading the words back and forth so it happens yeah and i don't think we could step in and you know do it i mean again i think sometimes the less said the better uh this is very comprehensive so if you you know if you see any merit in what i've said added to it i'll vote for it the way it is today i don't think there's anything you're going to write and it's not your fault that's going to be bulletproof anyone can challenge this thing and just understand that we do the best we can and you are subject to challenge well the thing to do at this point is to take this and then do redline changes based on the notes i've taken and then get that back in front of you to look at it again do you have any idea of how long that would be because we really probably do need to get our assignments back into effect because we just need to have one so do you have any idea how much additional time you're going to need i'm just curious are we going to be able to maybe vote on this in the next city council meeting so are you looking at probably june okay let's say councilman is next week yeah i can make some revisions and then send it out to you there's there's a couple things i wanted to get a little more information from lynn because i wanted to put in stuff related to the comprehensive plan that this goes to your aesthetics and your legal standards but i will do all i can to get you a version that will have the red lines and we will have that for the next or the meeting in june okay um what if uh you go ahead and give us the changes that have been recommended today and uh and give it back to us and then we commit to looking it over for a week or two a firm date so that you're not under the gun whenever it is time to actually vote on this thing so that you can integrate our changes bring them in and then resubmit it to us well y'all you normally have a meeting uh workshop mid mid may for instance so what would in an ideal world um i would have it to you before then so that y'all can uh you know cover it and be done with it and say this is the version that we're gonna go with when do we start the uh budget processes that may june okay so may actually works well um and just for the record we never suspended the sign ordinance we urged caution with enforcement of the signed ordinance to the city manager and staff i think that's what the council did so the sign ordinance remains in effect on the books that we have now but obviously we had some individuals that were putting up full-size banners that went the length of their house just taunting us and that one person said go ahead and sue me they were setting us up some of these people in my opinion in other people's opinion um we had a situation with this attorney who said i'm gonna put the sign in or else and and so we said exercise restraint we still have ordinances regarding permanent signs and all kinds of other signs and just for the record that's still an effect okay we never as a council suspended he did a resolution that recognized that there was an issue related to the political science and then the discussion among the council members was if you're going to modify that provision you ought to look at the rest of it to to basically bring it up to speed so that you know you you're not fixing just one aspect and you've left nine aspects of it that now make you vulnerable so that any comments any last council comments just uh i'd like to see it before the agenda is released for that work session yes there seems to be a conflict between um 86-2s of bees saying signs placed on land for advertising used conducted thereon shall be deemed to be accessory and incidental to the land building for use in the zoning portion of 94-252 says you can carry on i'm having a little trouble hearing that oh i'm sorry um in the zoning portion 94 252 talks about home occupations are subject to the following limitations there shall be no sign exterior display or exterior storage any materials and no other exterior indication of the home occupation or variation from the residential character of the dwelling so you can carry on a home occupation but you can't put a sign up and it's this purpose 86-2 b sounds like you can that makes sense yeah it's just something that we need to reconcile yeah okay you know follow and follow the zonings in the residential well it applies to both the residential low and the residential medium district that says if you're carrying out a home occupation you can't put any sign out and this new sign ordinance sounds like you can so i see a conflict there with those two my inclination would be to keep the residential character of the community don't let people put signs out because it's incidental to the residential use of the property council anything more okay fred thank you yeah you know this is not a knock this is really an excellent job of researching this and i don't think i've ever seen a more detailed analysis or an importance here this is a lot here so you know i think we have a good foundation here to finish this thing excellent all right folks um it's uh going on almost 10 o'clock we have general business does anyone have any general business mercy any citizen comments finals do you have a motion to adjourn we got three anybody in favor aye opposed goodnight everyone"
