evening would you please stand up and let Club Patty country swear you win do you solemnly declare from the testimony and nothing but the truth yes okay I'd like to go over the rules and procedures that we're going to follow tonight especially for the sake of the applicant I will actually read the various requests first then our city manager Kyle Rico will go ahead and make a staff report we will then ask you as the applicant to come forward to the podium and make a statement of anything related to this variance that you'd like to tell us and we'll go through a short open discussion period at which point we will go ahead and vote on a series of six criteria that we as support must ask you as the applicant and confirm that you have met our sections of the city code after those six criteria we will ask for a motion in a second to approve or deny variants and then we'll call vote Patty at this point I want to go and ask you have we received anything in terms of Correspondence on this parent's request no sir thank you I'll go ahead and read the request at this point this is for Mr will listick and his wife Elvira finger Rod who resigned at 2241 Granite Drive they're requesting a variance from our swimming pool code section 10-172 which relates to setbacks Heights and widths it's subsection 6 The crucial statement is quote the height of a swimming pool shall be no higher than 18 inches above the crown of the road the rest of the various request verbiage has nothing to do with what our request is tonight so I'll stop at that point three actual request is to install a pool five inches above the maximum height Allowed by the city code to get maximum height is 18 inches this request is to be at 23 inches at this point I would like our city manager if you would Kyle to give us our staff report we go from there thank you Kyle riesler city manager of Miller Beach so we received this application on April 17 2023 uh our city contracted engineer Albert carrier with trans systems reviewed the application and plans he concluded that the swimming pool request is going to be constructed greater than 18 inches elevated elevation above the crown of height he said the proposed deck elevation is going to be 23 inches above the crown of the road and the variance requested is for the pool to be if it's an additional five inches above what the code it says that the maximum can be so yes after that um the application line for this variance and here we are just great thank you as most of the board members here tonight remember 30 days ago or April meeting we had a case similar to this the same section 10-172 of the of our code is there any questions [Music] I'm having dreams about this section every night okay Fred wasn't here last time with us but that's exact same case we had different different home very similar condition above the ground John thank you Mr lessic at this time I invite you to come forward and make any kind of sticky you would like to our board members thank you uh will Alyssa I'm here with uh Kelly schools hello everyone Chris Arnold with Kelly pools I feel like this is getting to be a monthly uh get together for us basically what we're asking for is the relief of five inches from the code that states the pool cannot be any higher than 18 inches above the crown of the road the lessics live in a house that is built many years ago it's not a new construction the house is currently 27 inches above the crown of the road we're gonna have a four inch step down which is typical in our industry to the pool deck and the pool deck will be at that level so that'll put the pool at 23 inches above the crown of the road there are pools on both adjacent properties both the same elevations for the most part drainage will not be affected at all if they either property and that's all the rest of course the five inches are relief anyone has any questions I'll be happy to answer thanks for the explanation thank you Chris thank you Mark at this time I'm going to ask you to come up and join us the presence is requested before we actually vote I want to announce to the board and have it on tape that I Mike Kelly is the owner of Kelly pools have a conflict of interest in this case in that Kelly pulls his selected contractor by the homeowner Mr lessey so I will not be voting in the Ford's vote tonight I have filled out and submitted to the city form 8B which is a state memorandum of voting conflicts for County Municipal and other local public officials this is from the state ethics commission and as a result this will be adding to our our formal amendments at this point I'm going to ask Vice chairman Jane Goldman to take over the beach I have issues with my voice and we've got a lot of reading yet to do so I'm formally getting it again with the game to run the rest of the meeting great thank you very much this is going to be easy I think for us to get through I'm going to ask each for whatever questions are going to approve it or deny it and how you'll help us with keeping ready yes ma'am okay so our goal here is to make sure that we know what the applicant submitted and we feel comfortable with it number one did they everyone probably has a worksheet don't they yes yes yeah okay question number one did the applicants has the applicant demonstrated that special conditions for unique circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other similar structures or buildings in the same zoning District if you vote Yes the variances are approved and if you vote no it's denied so from a question number one mark do you want to oh Pat are you going to ask the questions yes Mr Beam Mr Elia yes Mr Gardella yes Mr gatliff Mr Mariano yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly I'm Steve so it passes six to zero with one abstention okay thank you question number two at the applicant was demonstrated that the ovarians were questioned is

you thank you is there any other items that comes before our board at this point the old business and a new business I want to mention to everybody that one of the requirements to serve as an elected or an appointed official is to annually fill out a financial discussion disclosure form it's a call form one it's due to the supervisor of elections by July 1st of this year at the United discussion about it today because normally she gets those forms set is income for the ethics commission or does it come from supervisor or relations they come from the ethics but then they return to the supervisor so each one of us is responsible for four have done it they start finding you I think Hampton general of course there's it after September is the grace period yes yeah so that's the only other thing uh to my knowledge we don't have another variance coming up in June is that correct right so you'll have to get the get the form a Patty sends it to us into the supervisor election by Joel first and you'll email those to us they mail them U.S Postal Service it'll be coming soon and sorry I can't hear you well like the chair and I discussed I had called the commission and asked him because they show the due date but they don't show the date they're going to send them out so I'm still waiting for them to call me back with the date that those will be sent so as soon as they let me know and I'm going to have to follow up I guess um because they're not answering it's been two days as soon as I know I will email everybody and let you know when to expect it okay right right well since Jane Goldman is still running the meeting the campus in front of her when you're ready [Music] you did a great job"
