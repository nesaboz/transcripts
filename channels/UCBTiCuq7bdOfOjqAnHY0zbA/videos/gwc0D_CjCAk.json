    "transcript": "two I'd like to call to order the June 21st Public Work session meeting recording in progress join me in sane to supply the United States of America to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all okay Patty would you like to take the role please council member Frank Banker president council member Belinda Livingstone president council member Leslie Notaro council member Lloyd Roberts here council member Mike Sable here vice mayor Jody Shirley mayor Dave Gaddis city manager Kyle riefler here City attorney Randy Mora president let the record note the members got us and Livingstone are attending remotely okay first item on the agenda is the discussion of the Strategic plan and this is brought forth by uh city manager report file you have before thank you guys mayor so since the last meeting um we went through the first roughly half of the gold sheets of the Strategic plan um so pages one through five which are included in the agenda packet is what we went through and I made revisions to the wording throughout those goals based on what the council directed during the meeting and where we left off at the bottom of page five so we need to start and goal three communications and Community tip number six so if there's anything um in the first five pages that you don't agree with the wording I kind of took out the things that we were already done with and then we rewarded some things like maintain lock and easy um you know places where we had the uh internship program you know see community volunteers does anyone have any they want to add to pages one through five okay but I think we're ready to move on to page six if you want okay um communication Community um first bullet point our little this is continuation with the ballpoint operation Services managed rather than expectations budgets schedules and effectiveness of IE storm water mitigation I believe we're still in that part of that phase I'm the next full point of timely accessible user friendly so that a developing feedback system to acknowledge and provide closure online permit system for parking uh weird did we lose you Kyle I'm my brother okay I'm still good while we're waiting for Kyle to come back I think the um one thing on the managing of residents expectations when it comes to storm the storm water mitigation the point of that being addressed was to make sure that residents understand we're trying to minimize the flooding we can never fix the problem and making sure that that's um shared clearly with residents because I think there are some expectations that we can fix the flooding of the roads and we'll never be able to do that so I I just I mean I don't know how we do that but we need to somehow get the message out to Residents and hopefully expectations is the key word right I think a good form and a good time to do that and maybe um I know the same managers told me there wouldn't be a design is going to be worked on and completed by the current Engineering Group they're going to be making presentations to us at meetings and I think each of us should use every opportunity during that session when the engineering firm is presenting that we say something along the lines I mean it's monetarily impossible to come up with a plan that eliminates play ERS it's monetarily impossible we don't have the other cat three-store guests under a cap two store though I'm talking about completely completely so if I want to just repel our page right yeah so so we need to reinforce that and I think that might be a good session to do that when the engineering department explaining what their plan is and how they want us to support just though we use that opportunity to set the expectations so they know that we're going to do a great job the design is going to do a great job but understand it's not going to completely eliminate the potential of flooding on your streets and or your home it's just some people do walk away with that thought because it's a big number of respect too so it almost appears as though we're going to fix the problem of course we're cleaning out the mess that hasn't been maintained for many many years and um trying to solve it as much as we can I think the problem is it's not expense that people will get so much because I don't think they're really aware of the expense they're streaming poured up for weeks months repaid we put in summer storms come along and it's back in the street they're saying I had when they did my street two of my neighbors said that was this yeah as as Assad was floating down the street and I said well you keep doing the same as Marty would say in a golf match keep doing the same thing expect the same results and that's what we've been doing for 75 years Kyle are you back with us yeah so I don't know where I started losing connection so we just talked about expectations yes right so we're on the second rule of coin on Page Six okay so uh timely accessible user friendly um to develop a feedback system to acknowledge and provide closure uh we do have uh sort of a feedback system with the as a city manager you open the we have council member hotline we provide the emails to every council member on the month on the you know website I'm not sure when else we're trying to do for a feedback system where we've been using those utilizing surveys for different uh you know projects representative input on that I kind of agree it goes with the next point where you're talking about a complete contact list that's been tried many people just opt out of it it'd be totally effective if we were able to reach 100 of the people then you can do that online surveys the email connectivity but uh as a stand you know we're lacking the potential to reach you know probably the 25 to 30 percent of the population on any one issue uh Kyle do you know what the percentage of people that are sign up for the city newsletter uh right now we're gonna just pull it up I can tell you just get the accurate number I think we're in like the 400 but the sum of that may be uh you know spouses in the same household it's taking a second alone another thing I saw on there was the um it says the online permit system for parking the boats RVs and trailers we haven't experimented or anything where we could try to do some sort of online form on the website to facilitate that I think that would be good because a lot of times people are bringing their phone Friday afternoon from work can't make it to City Hall they want the trailer there for the weekend it would be very helpful if we could do something where they could print out the permit and attach it to the trailer once it's parked congratulations so um if we didn't have to rely on staff to process like if it's over the weekend the only problem would be able to because if we're not able to fill out a form of permanent that'll work great as long as I fell on the restrictions of the code but we don't have any kind of database to cross-check that with no adults staff you know available so like if somebody did fill out a permit that they could go and fill out another permit we don't have the means of actually controlling that I guess okay hey your guard and we can't hear you oh okay Kyle um yeah I hear what you're saying oh man I I was kind of thinking along the lines of is there a way to do it do they have to actually come into the office to get a permit or is that something they can call in and say Hey I want a permit for the weekend can you email me something I mean is there a way for a working because there are some of the people in our city that work believe it or not yeah I think I think definitely if um is steering business hours but we can definitely get the email over and then they'd have to print it out themselves but I think yeah we can make a system like that work you know you're provided anything you come in or we do send like you know the colored card permit to even then you just got to print around yourself right or how this kind of brainstorm a little bit but I know why some people don't always have those permits is because of just that reason they can't make it by the city hall during the 9 to 4 30 business hours or what have you right okay I'll make sure that we have some sort of system to do so and do you understand me now yeah yeah okay all right so I killed my video and uh hopefully that um don't worry um I love the idea of packing online for I've absolutely believed it requires human interaction uh to approve the form at City Hall uh basically we established guidelines that they must complete the form before this date if time otherwise you miss out on the weekend and then you can certainly email it back in PDF form to be branded out I have no problem with that whatsoever and I I think just to say everyone in trip from having to come to City Hall I wanted to also touch off all right uh closure yeah to acknowledge Amplified closure okay so develop a feedback system this is something that I I discussed in my previous term about developing a feedback system um and whenever we're set to acknowledge this is that this is that said the city would be acknowledging hey we've received your feedback and then who is supposed to provide closure is that that I wouldn't think it would be any council member because uh at any given time we're going to have different opinions and and possibly even get it wrong uh but if it's coming from the city manager and or staff uh well then if that's something a little bit different and we're we're not having to maintain public records uh where you know screenshots all of that all of that I think it's great that that we should all receive whatever uh feedback would be completed on the form so everybody gets the email but I would uh I would request and expect everyone on the council to not respond directly um of all that form system if it's somebody that emails you directly with question that's a little different than everybody getting it so that's that's my two cents on that part the reason why we didn't do this in my last term was for this very reason right here I think uh the sunshine potential for Sunshine violations and also for maintaining a public records okay um so we we sort of have an online form like the ask the city manager what I can do is I can have of the council emails email whenever somebody you know submits one of those forms and then I can continue to do what I do much that I reply to all all of them so um I guess I could either I could reply to the person specifically or I could reply and copy all the council members which is fine as long as you know as long as we're not I'll get in there and emailing um and also a lot of feedback like for instance with uh council members Abel he gets questions and he'll he'll caught me being with the resident and then um I know and provide the answer to the to the questions and that's worked out pretty well for the closure works for me I'll try that but also um I will say this okay so uh council members Abel responds uh forwards this all to the city manager and then city manager responds to Dean I'm assuming that council members able to probably say I'll forwarded this on to uh forward this on to city manager and hopefully give it back to you but that's where council member Sable gets a direct email this wouldn't be a web form online this is where he's just getting an email directly yes that's all yeah that's correct when I get an email what I do is I forward that with the person's uh email address on theirs at you know Ford City Manager can you please take a look at this and looks like that's it I'm hands off no decisions it's just forwarding on a message yeah this this is uh pretty much what we all do so uh well just I mean there's nothing to change there I I'm talking about this feedback system and that's that's really my concern is how that's handled whenever someone feels a generic form out um and who and who's going to actually respond to it um and that's where I think it really you're all in the city's website you're harassing you're asking them questions in the city and I would think that cage staff or where I'd say manager shouldn't spawn agree yes I necessarily continue to do it that way um but if you want to be in the in the loop of what comes in I can just have I can set the website to to email everyone so you just yeah I think I think when an area responded you would just see see if the city council so it's not what you said and we're here at Spring from the horse's mouth okay all right good plan all right Kyle and we have a we don't have a complete contact list yeah I have uh 384. that's what our current list is now okay I don't think there's any way to change that is anyone else yeah there are people that are completely disconnected from the city and they don't want to know they just want to live here or am I their own business if they don't want to get involved and I respect that they're privacy okay so moving on to the City website okay so whatever we love to offer at the uh the contact list there's some increased functionality of the City website um yeah the last major makeover tool is when I first came in was in 2018 we currently use digital eel I mean um WordPress platform uh digital eel is a company they're on Golf Boulevard a little salty or if you remember their exact City but they they're the ones that help us do them intricate tweaking of the website with um we can't figure it out on our own um I don't know if there's any uh suggested format things you could change just in the the architecture of the website we're always open to making adjustments to make it more uh resident friendly does anyone have any experience with um with a marketing firm or a website design firm that we could reach out to who does uh Beller love shoes for the city of Bel Air they have a nice website you like I'll have to find that out of Bel Air for Valor Blossom yeah town of Bel Air has a nice website it's pretty interactive and easy to move around I think I think we should I think we should look at every design yeah surely um and here's why if you find one you like they don't have to whip at the bill or or do any customer programming they've already done it because they have all the modules [Music] we have pretty much the same all the same features um obviously if digital ales not do it we require change hosting companies to make that happen where they would have to reach out to whoever it is is hosting and see if they do the same thing almost all of the WordPress websites are modular base so just how much homework have you done to find a correct module and then if you tried it out and does it actually work the way that it's supposed to and there's not too much you can't do with with WordPress it's just we don't want to have to start completely over we want to find somebody that's already doing it good point Dave okay so I can find out accountable there because you set that all up see if I can reach out get an idea of pressing and things um Interactive surveyed feedback applications for me kind of just talk about that um timely accurate agendas minutes events weather traffic weather and traffic events um I think we're doing pretty good with the the agendas and the minutes getting the recordings on there um if we have a significant weather altered through a community where you try to send them out on the constant contact or put it and put them on the front page of the website as far as the ADA compliance we the last thing we did was we made sure everything was all the documents and the agendas we're readable um you know so they're click and have a computer read it and I'm sure there's other facets uh radiate compliance that work not in you know I haven't been able to I guess format but I direct that to the City attorney more about where things that we could do to be replies one of those cities have have done that foreign yes sir I think the last time we discussed Ada and the website uh was uh correct me if uh if I'm wrong but I think it was best effort uh within the means of the city is that correct on some level yes it's that's it is an amorphous Target in that you have to have made best efforts there is no yet clear federal guideline I cannot point you to these are the six things in the seven boxes you need to check to be an ADA website compliance website compliances is up until this point truly been looked to by non-governmental agencies guidance like the wcag or wikag guidelines and within wikag there's different grades of 2.0 and 2.2 unlike the windows versions of yesteryear and so um what I would have to look at is whether or not I can't recall whether or not this this city had received a lawsuit in connection with Ada website compliance as many cities did around 2016 to 2019 and if so what commitments may have been made in the form of a settlement that'd be one place to look if any kind of settlement was reached some cities had suits and then because the cultural moment passed only in part to some judicial orders in the federal courts some cities just had their cases go away without consent judgments or settlements with commitments but regardless yes you're right you need to make a good faith effort you need to be prepared to accommodate so there's also the situation of saying what subsidies did was put some button or landing page on their website saying we are prepared to accommodate any requests and then they get a request and not have measures in place and so we don't want to be in that position either but generally speaking we are past the time and viability of the position of saying we didn't know we had to do this or nobody's asked for it so we just left our website the same it was in 2005 most cities are trying at the very least to get elements like alt tags on photographs uh readable you know OCR enabled readable text for screen readers and the like and those are some of the more basic elements that have become more common industry standards that we're likely to see with most contractors you're looking to some communities I know have done rfps for this sort of thing you can also look at piggyback contracts and the like from a person standpoint but that's what I would say as to where the the state of the law is on on the Ada website compliance accessibility and I think that one of the problems that we were running into is the more online interaction we offer the harder it is to being complied that that is correct and that's why with some cities you see records pulled after a certain period you know you may with a lot of cities now you find you won't see minutes going back before 2019 and 2020 because some City said well going forward from this date in 2019 we'll make it but we're not going to go back and make records available um also the more content you pull push the more content that has to be accessibly enabled so whether it's your budget your you know infographics and these sorts of things that's where you started to see that challenge so yes there is an element of the more content you push the more challenging that can become and that's why you've if you've if you've tracked this issue like I have you you'll notice the change in City websites and how how Bare Bones a lot of them are at this point and why they don't have several different pages for every different department and things like that uh one more okay uh when it a wouldn't it make more sense to have Ada in front of interactive so that we we know that that probably comes before adding special bells and fancy bells and whistles because we can't can't do Ada on what you know on any of these features you want to add then you have to we have to delay it until we can yeah that's a policy decision for you folks while yield back to the council to discuss yeah I think that's a good um a good adjustment on the uh on a goal to definitely just change the order of those kind so change the order of of the functionality of the website that ADA has to be at the top of the list comes first and then yeah comply okay um moving on so the next page on page seven it says Ada complier to Monitor and we just kind of talked about that uh refined implementation of electric sign we kind of have done that over our experience of using one of the switching between colors that originally started with the light and I was told that uh using the light uses all the diet or where's the lights off the quickest and we switch to a red which was not very invisible after giving feedback from residents being decided on that bright blue color supposed to be the best color for this sign um we stick to text messages we don't do anything fancy with all that energy um and then we we operated from the 6 a.m to the 10 p.m time slot so it's kind of what we've been doing this I don't know if there's any other input of things that we can do better with the messaging anyone have any feedback maybe we can scratch it off the list off the board okay all right um engage Community Town Hall meetings um you know they're kind of have been run in the top of the Paul format for a while now um dollar Beach 101 budget Capital plan utilize Town Hall meetings to educate residents on budget see you know CIP and codes I'm not sure where we've had other things I'll just list coffee with the mayor uh weekly city council owners the council members have been at Beach and Bridge cleanups of any activity sponsored by the City we've had representation there those are just a few of the things that have been ongoing plus we've outreached you have mayor vice mayor attending the local councils of council members uh like The Big C and you got people like Frank that's going out reaching out to County type activity so it's bubbling up to us and US reaching out to the Greater Community as well so maybe that's just a continuation maybe we just continue to engage it's already being done right okay um I guess optimize City websites sort of redundant um okay okay uh before Aesthetics create a vibrant well-planned well-maintained appearance for the city that denotes a sense of community and a quality of life underground wooden pole replacement evaluating team costs updates so we started moving forward with that project um and at this point you know they're underground in the south of Causeway Boulevard to move next into North Dakota Boulevard of the marina and um as we leave it uh the wires are going underground they'll be uh topping off the excess pole above the street lights and then we'll be left with the wooden pole on the street lights provided by the community in their current arrangement um that's something that um you know it'd be an additional cost to change out the lights to something different that's something I'm getting options from June but that to be presented to the council so that a decision can be made whether we do anything when those lights are leaving for now Kyle was that the sea turtle friendly lights that is yeah most of the communities are moving to a concrete white pole um with yeah the amber light is provided by Duke Energy that is uh endorsed by the uh FWC we're not required uh we're not held to the same standards that uh other parts of Health Boulevard are altitude because we're not actually a pot core Corridor um it actually it's a state route turns their bulls again ours is a county maintained work Road the not a national fdot quarter so um we would need to check with the county on what what standards they would want us to have called Boulevard at we're currently kind of grandfathered at every other lighting arrangement okay thank you okay um okay yeah we've done that with the iterating the rescue funds into the capital um underground project complete ex across my office and done crossword movement um walking trail pavement breakdown from the streets we were already kind of crossed that off of the previous goals um Street repaving of Valley Care repairs I think that falls into not only what we've done with the future stormwater projects but maintaining the uh the street index um Street payment condition index and see evaluate every every year what uh what needs to be resurfaced moving forward um the way the stormwater project was planned was to take care of all the streets that on that index that were a scale of 100 I believe it was a 50 or below which was a yellow announcement of red being Marsh so after moving through this project we'll kind of be a good good point of having good Street surface and I believe the next pretty sister looking closely with being the Bell Isle I mean but this should be addressed well through the stormwater project Street lighting and underground utilities um and it goes with what we talked about with the city street lights and assessing where [Music] um like the streets are darker than others or better than some of the better later than finding out what what standard we want to have the lighting at throughout the city and progress you know forward with a plan to to bring all the streets up to a relatively aesthetic standard [Music] I know we're paying the streets that we're doing storm work too but there are some that are pretty bad are those getting done at the same time we do the storm water repairs yes the ones based on another specific deal specific streets um you're talking about I don't I just know we've done a couple that we had residents come to meetings and say that their street was really bad what's the plan for repaving and maybe if you could just circulate those streets that are targeted so we know what they are yeah just offhand um you know when we do the Ninth Street area it's nice Street and then it's the uh uh theater Spruce and Pine and then as you go up through 14 15 16 17 18 all those streets and then I just get up into um 19th 20th 21st it's those um and then 22nd was done and it's 23rd 24th 25th and Morgan and then it stops there a Shore is still in pretty good shape so that is not getting rid of Davis stuff over you know pipes and modifications get done but yeah but um there's pretty good coverage but I couldn't um I put together it was a summary of streets that their projects will will address the pay rate on okay so I can circulate that you can just share that with councils okay about five six years ago did we do a lot of major repainting of the streets some of them here and there because we did our street I didn't take it either I'm talking about just a bill like one and a half inches of black dog but there's some of those ones like I think 19th or 23rd or something that I remember residents making a comment that there's a problem is pretty bad um under the subject of Aesthetics I know it's on the beach Waterfront thing but I would also put Bee Tree nourishment as part of the Aesthetics goals yeah yeah but that's under yeah a quick question about the Gulf Boulevard reunification um the the association out there is looking to at least do the Christmas banners I guess what we put down on this coordinate with Community efforts for uh holiday banners so do you talk about the Christmas planes and the Community Foundation exactly because of his money before yeah um so the question is put it under government yeah beautification put under Aesthetics yeah as well the tools okay and again it's more you know weekend birthday but we can coordinate with them thank you yeah I would think that uh maybe it wouldn't just be Christmas log it would be any uh lamp post decorations because we we have them year round okay [Music] so that happens already are we are we adding reimbursement to adobe's Aesthetics [Music] recommended whenever uh cast member nataro uh mentioned that I was thinking it Billy falls under each uh and water for our butt it's nothing wrong with with maintaining what we have so we cleaned it you know control make sure it looked whatever we have looked nice I think it's as far as the original goes it's not one of the things that we'll ever be able to do alone true okay all right so Beach and Water Foundation I build five preserve or protect our City's natural Beach and Waterfront environments Beach swimmer safety booty decision that's been made so being maintain and I assume the amount of Beach bathing Zone the uh between nourishment supports a accounting projects we do that and currently we're at the at the hold up right now trying to get the funding or to find the alternate means of funding through the county you know that the county is working on that um I don't know if there's anything you want to do in our strategic plan or just assist ing me on this one no please do I have something to add after you do them go ahead okay uh as you know uh I've I've been doing a lot of work with a couple of other Mayors all this uh let's let's made to to fund this project they will tell you whatever you want to hear but at the end of the day they they are it's a circular conversation uh yeah we need to do it and then as soon as if we walk away they're they're right back but let's get the Army Corps Engineers to play notch I think it is probably in our best interest that we all individually in our own way become very noisy and if you have friends in other communities that are also on the county or on the commissions or councils depending upon the community in this enforcement uh encourage them to also get more more noisy because they're going to tell three people they want to hear but they don't necessarily have to respond to three people and that was just from the low pressure coming off of Georgia and Alabama and everything like that um this is a picture three hours after high tide going down where is that that's right at Sixth Street beach entrance okay all the way down into Indian Rocks there's no if I was a vacationer and spent a couple thousand four thousand dollars a week come here and go to our beaches I would never come back if you're not going towards one not the city but I mean Pinellas County and you think they suddenly would get off the excuse my French dead ass and do something about us but I agree with the mayor it's just like it's a typical government you know just goes around and goes around everyone wants to do anything okay so I'm going to be The Optimist here and say we get featuring nourishment the city needs to start thinking about some way to hold on to our sand we need to put some rock formation in place for something to keep our sand in place because no matter how much sand you bring in it's going to wash out and I don't care how often you do it that's a guarantee sand moves that's what it does there's a reason we have a big Sand Bar off the beach is because everything that was pumped onto the beaches trying to get back to where it came from so unless we do something to hang on to it it's a new point and we continue to re-nourish and who knows what we're doing to the ocean floor for our benefit and we're not doing anything to keep the sand in place so that's why soapbox but I definitely don't there's no point in every nourishment if we're not going to do anything to try to hold it in place well I have that I have a responsib that's okay sure um what I have learned in the last few years trying to find some creative way to get our sand back and also to hold on to it is you'll will be very lucky if we get uh if we give a patient or Ishmael okay because it still requires paramedic from the Army Corps of Engineers however what what I've been told is they are no longer issuing permits at all for hardening uh because whenever they look at what's the what's the fixed Faith they claim that the least invasive way of making sure we have Sam is renourishable so if you go out there and you do break Waters or Jetties or whatever it is that that you know we whatever it is we think it's the best solution uh according to Kelly lee for the county it requires a tenure study um of the area before you even break ground with a project they want to track where the tides are flowing and how the fan is Shifting and a very extensive and expensive study and then they will let you do want it somewhere and then don't want to watch it for 10 years and if that one works okay well then they've got to start the whole the whole process over again or wherever else you'd like to do it um this is why the county has no interest they got they got away with a couple of them down south or maybe three or four of them but uh from from what I've been told over and over and over is they don't do that anymore uh hi Dave um I know yourself and some of the other Mayors have been working with the county so from a funding standpoint I think you addressed this once before one of our meetings does the county have the moneys available to do this so I'm asking that question can the county possibly come back and say well gee whiz we'd like to do that but we [Music] care of that is is um so I think you had told us on before that in fact they do have funds available to take care of this of course they would prefer the Army Corps of Engineers do it but that being said if the core is stepping away completely does the county have the funds to take care of it yeah I I think the uh right now that the based upon the conversations that I've had with people who really uh I'm sorry let me make sure I work this correctly we have taken our message to the county over and over that hey you have at least 36 million dollars ear art for Beach nourishment um so a little bit of that has to go to the Treasure Island Saint Pete Beach area they were able to get um they were able to to get the Army Board to uh to fund and uh and look forward but it's not fun but approve and then they were able to get Federal money and and stick money and and do the projects it's my understanding they're not doing it again that now they've introduced more easements that they want down south uh to do the nourishment going forward I don't know if they'll get it or not but the point is is that now it's not just saying uh Santee Island but now you've got Beyond uh uh Madeira Beach and if there's anything I don't think that there's anything North but you've also got some issues with uh inlets where you have to have threads and gone and things like that so what they're what they're saying is that well we could partially fund the project even if we 100 funded it we wouldn't be able to get it done and so I believe the TDC right now has a I believe it's like a from like a half a percent is is what they're currently electing from the bad tax or Beach personal and I believe right now we're proposing that they move that up to um let's say one percent yeah a half percent we're talking about or proposing that they move it up to uh 0.75 or possibly even a whole one percent and so they also have to decide all right well if we change that which other error mark are we going to steal that from uh or are we going to raise taxes county-wide uh on on the bad tax and just make it higher so there's just so many movement Parts but we still feel confident that the Kent County as a whole can 100 fund this uh another uh idea that's pitched was that we could stay involved and Lobby all our Senators and representatives and see if they will give us money or at least partially match us I said that it's not such a burden on the county but because of the recent hurricanes there's there's no money left uh they're they're all they're only getting it all to prepare damage from the you know the last several hurricanes um Mr Mayor is it a two product or three prong system for featuring nourishment I know it's fed state but that's the county also get involved when it comes to the Army Corps of Engineers or at the county completely out well what happens is the county actually manages the the where they go to the Army Corps and they we need this and and they you know they make their uh argument and then the county says okay we'll do that or no we won't or yes we will that you need to do this um and right now that that whole uh block is is strictly because of they won't 100 easements uh everywhere where they think they need them yeah Michael my question was the funding only I believe it was only two parts like 70 percent fed 30 percent state or is or does the county kick in money too no it's it's uh the film does 20 the state matches the county 20 and then uh the the FED will pitch in up to 60 okay thank you and so you know if you lose that 60 percent now families you know that's a big goal for them uh but whenever we know that we're bringing the money in and face it uh baseball is something you get to go see a baseball game whenever you either live here or you just so happen to be on vacation at the beach so all of these other pet projects where they're wanting to uh to redo these uh baseball stadiums or possibly build a Sports Complex or give Millions to the dolly Museum their number one priority should always be the beaches and then whatever's left you can fund the elements but but right now that is not the case okay um should we all agree to move on so we can try to finish this before our break and then we can if not we'll have to hold off on this finishing this strategic plan so Kyle next red tie mitigation yeah response capabilities typically what happens is when we get fish kills and we start washing up um it takes a lot of fish up and down Sand Key for the county that activates the their contractors to assist in the cleanup so usually when it's uh you know in dollar Beach our staff just goes out there and you know picks up for fish individually and uh um disposes of them within the lining of the dumpsters sometimes the county will assist by providing a roll-off and I'm sure to put the put fish in but that is something that we typically have to do with our city staff they do a pretty good job at it sometimes it takes several days sometimes they just keep coming this last one was a horrible they finished up in a couple days and got them all off the beach I'm not sure if there's any way we could speed up our cleanup responses that we do in-house and just getting out there and doing it so do you need to modify our current um response and I mean you have a plan in place it's working is there anything more that we need to add to that there's no need to review it if it's working so um yeah we're getting out there and just cleaning up at you know a fast response is the best thing to do and even when we see in the county engage in the outside contractors and clean up by that time he had picked up all our fish so it's been kind of qualified calls on us to give you a response so being part of the Strategic plan we're just going to say being responsive to Red Tide mitigation and there's no need to do anything to for your plan your plans in place it's working it's fine correct yes as long as it doesn't keep no escalating or it could become a problem if we just keep getting waves fish you know but I guess that's when uh you know we'll see what can be done at that time okay can actually do Waterfront code enforcement should that be added to the budget um there's a lot of additional expense of the insurance um I can look into it I'm not sure we'll keep the boat I guess we make a place of the marina is an idea we'll trailer it we pull it out of the water and keep it Interactive house over on Spruce or whatever that tree is next door but I think we this subject keeps coming up and every time we approach it we're almost told we can't do any enforcement because we don't have a boat so if we're not going to do anything about solving the problem then scratch it from the list or start saving for a phone that's we gotta do something we can't keep pushing but there's no need to keep talking about it we're not going to do anything about it I was do you want me to start investing in costs around a vote and then operations fictitious number in there and start say start saving for it there's no need to I mean we're a long ways from purchasing anything so if we have something in a reserve account you know next year you can start looking at what they cost but we're saving five ten thousand dollars a year or something like that then in a few years five years you might have the budget to buy something yes Lloyd so Cloud you referenced to me before on conversation so we have a vote um that your staff used to go go out and examine and maintain some of the Outlaws what size vote is that that's a tiny uh 10 foot John boat made of plastic uses an electric trolling motor it's definitely not a yeah I realized that we all kind of laughed because it does sound pretty small but it's not more like chasing guys in Miami Vice or anything out there so basically the votes being used whatever boat we would buy would simply be used to get from point A to point B if they saw something going on on the back part of the properties you'd have to take it around the outside you'd be in the intercoastal it's going to be a little more choppier for a smaller but well that's that's where these guys are my intercoastal and they're going out and checking the alcohols and maintaining them knocking off the oysters and all that kind of stuff so um again I mean we could buy another boat but I don't think it has to be expensive doesn't have to have sirens and lights and all that kind of stuff all right let's switch us back to let's start a savings account so we can at least have a plan moving forward at this point we just keep talking about it for the last I don't know six or eight years and we have not done anything about it that's something I want to add as soon as this year's first coming budget 24th yes I would like to you can vote on that of course at another time but yeah I would like to see that okay all right so uh last page just a summary of the goals right yeah yeah this is a this is uh where typically we came up with the objectives that uh you know fell in line with what we're trying to accomplish and put those goals so they're coming here um I left it in the ones that were still we're still doing um but I could many some recommendations for what our objectives are going to be for physicals I do please go ahead yeah or objective too I would definitely like to focus on live history to where they're where they're gone you know yeah could you please repeat that we couldn't hear what you said I'm sorry I said uh for objective two I would like to say again following Arts I go one safety and helpful goal one object or two under public and stay in Hell street fighting okay yeah I'd just like to just quickly reinforce what Kyle had mentioned earlier on that we had a little bit of a discussion about this I would hate to see the city staff have to run around and try to make customized lighting for different streets I think it was great he mentioned earlier to come up with a standard for the city that that meets the city's expectations and that's what we go with and and we're done with it that's fair we're being nice but there are ourselves some locations where there's no wiring and I believe solar would probably be the only solution unless you wanted to start trenching and having do whole special wiring Pole yeah the type of lighting I guess I was more I should have explained that better more from the standpoint of one street wanting only two lights on their entire Street and another Street saying we've won 13 lights so the type of light um you're correct mirror may be directed based on what's available from a power standpoint but that's more what I was thinking about because I've actually heard some residents say a few ways I don't even want any lights on our street so I don't think that would be in our best interest to accommodate a request like that we would basically say we want to Streetlight every so many feet or whatever the case may be that we agree on maybe a little bits per foot yeah does anyone else have anything on this maybe this should be I think we said this last time but like a homework project that uh come back to Kyle with some of the generals to each of these goals are you okay with that Kyle what did you hope to have this complete can we look at it the next work session just this final page yeah that's completely fine um really just so the main goal is to incorporate uh the strategic planning um inside of the budget planning um I think we're doing so so anything that has to that directly affects this upcoming budget um you know that's first and foremost but then other things that the staff objectives the staff would accomplished throughout the next year um you know give us ideas and then we can assign them and get them look okay maybe the next budget we we can just right after that meeting address strategic planning if everyone would be okay with that box mayor Shirley yes sir should they pay the other way around oh Jesus yeah that's absolutely fine but I know we have a strict um time frame we have an outline of when we have to meet and I don't know Kyle and is that something we can do can we do this before the meeting does that mean we have to meet at five if you've already published the meeting at six you know it's yeah we have to meet before and then limited so that we stay on the on the published of retirement for the Workshop in the Southern Village well my page uh would you consider this empty budget meeting because we're setting our budget sure yeah it could be discussed during the workshop I don't see any problem with that okay so what does everybody else think I think it's a good idea three it just a mid mid meeting uh comps check Dave how are you hearing us are you hearing us okay I can't hear you perfect I got you thanks no I hear you what's happening is that you're if anyone speaks too fast certainly the system garbles it so you have to speak very clear in size and close to the microphone okay if no one objects we're going to take a taking a minute break yes all right break time thank you June 21st um work session back after our break it is now 7 17. so item number two is discuss moving the sandbag station to the marina and this is requested by council member sure um just one point say what you have in front of you you know basic proposal background solution or evening but really we have our sandbag station in located at the entrance to one of our largest remedies and that's you know running on the park for weddings um and other you know romantic things if you see the picture you know this is what you're really created when you drive up you have that kind of ram shackle um looking at sandbag Station instead of seeing you know the gorgeous area perhaps Pavilion in the future and that just one item about how this affects the community but the next one is really it's the during a storm it is at the end of a one-way um and that's why I posted that one picture showing the street because if you have one and a car is going down that it's waiting for sandbags it does make it difficult for people that are maybe put in a trailer in front of their house you know for evacuation Etc well we have the room right now at the marina you could put upwards of 60 cars in there without affecting golf I understand golf's also a evacuation route but you know so it's 9th Street regardless that's not clogged up the uh the golfer is not cloth at all it's we're clogging you know citizens so I want to remove the burden from those citizens place the sandbag station and frankly what is a uh commercial activity which is the marina area where we have space for it so do you like I mean I have my background solution reasoning if you want to look at that that's it Kyle would you like to add anything to that no um just uh you know like we could in the past we've built that uh sand in could call it Bayside Park that was done in 2018 um sand it could really be put anywhere if it was at the marina and just have to coordinate other traffic flowed one of the issues at 9th Street is you know when you have the cars coming to the sandbag station is getting them turned around and out of there another figure was brought up through the past was creating some kind of path uh or drive through by the frontier building into the main parking lot to to enable a way to circle the traffic um but that's that's all I have on that is there any way to have a outflow through the parking lot did you look at that and see if that was feasible to provide access out we have one-way traffic there is enough room um it's not going to be uh necessarily a two-way street you could create a definitely an access creative that you wouldn't have to keep open at all times um but it's it's ever it's a doable it's possible that there's enough room in there yeah I think Mike I think it it makes sense everything that was brought forward here I'm thinking at a at a higher level in that um well for example the county says on their side sandbags are only recommended for residents who may experience minor flooding from rainfall sandbags will not protect against storm surge from the bay or entire Waters now clearly that's where we live you know Pinellas County has plenty of places where they may have localized problems because their storm water system can't handle the rain amount there because of a storm you know so I hate to be the bearer of bad news but if we even have a reminder you know storm and and the High Tides come in and they connect over the sandbags aren't going to do anything and I feel I feel badly when I see everybody working their tail off to be honest with you filling up these sandbags and carrying them back and forth and we're limited by the number of sandbags we can get for obvious reasons what do we get 20 which are what's our rule car how much money 220 and then I see people putting the sandbags in front of the garage doors you should never do that the only place you should put those sandbags where the water would come into the garage door is like in front of your in my case like the kitchen door that comes through the garage on the other side water is going to get you know that's the door you need to protect not the garage door especially if you're only getting 20 sandbags you know you start putting them in how many houses when I drive around the city that I see where people have sandbags in front of the garage door not only that but many of them keep them there for a long time for some particular reason but I think that's something we need to think about really the core where we live do we want to offer salmon is it really worth it at the end of the day I don't know I mean people have been here I'm sure less than you've been here very long time have we ever had a storm or a storm where that it hit in this area where this where this handbags actually played a role in preventing water from getting into people's homes for me Marine 2015 and it was that was only a Tropicals that was actually only a hurricane when it just passed us and Hermione and what and what happened we had ordered up the garages and everything like that some of the some of the places haven't been short ever actually flooded out as we we didn't really start this handbagging in my opinion in the appropriate amount of time I think and I think the problem that we run into and why so many people need sandbags is not so much if it's high tide full moon we have a major storm and the water gets close to the front door and that happens quite frequently and then you have someone drive down the road and they cause a wake that pushes that water right to the front door and it happens on Harrison right over here and um and that's why I'm sensitive to it because I don't watch that house you discussed that earlier in fact I think councilman Brothers point was it's not a case of you know if it's a case of wind you know if that's when we're talking about trying to educate the community that these flood prevention measures were taking they'll help alleviate but they're not going to prevent the flooding right it will come go ahead okay uh first off I I agree with Mr Roberts that sandbag is not going to prevent flooding but I will say what it does to you if you have torrential downpour and you have high winds it will prevent that rain from penetrating under your door because you're blocking the wind from pushing the rain again uh also sandbags are just part of hurricane grab whether they we argue over whether they were or don't work or anything like that people expect sandbags so I will stand behind one understand that we never get rid of of Distributing sandbags uh and then the last comment that I would like to make on this is I have no problem moving the sandbags up to the marina however I live on the North side for the people living on the South Side they are going to have to drive an extra mile to get those sandbags they may not be happy about that the city hall is the centrally located point of Belair Beach and it's convenient for both the North and the South that way even though it's not the best configuration for turning around and and hurting the cars in and out but I'm just playing The Devil's Advocate because I I know what people are going to say whenever it's moved North is that you did that for people up north and what about us so I'll I'll get points if it's there Leslie living on both Boulevard there are times when trying to get out onto Gulf Boulevard from side street is a nightmare and you know if there's a storm coming through and you've pulled into the marina getting back out onto Gulf Boulevard to come south from there you know it's not going to be fun it's going to be a nightmare unfortunately hopefully the people from it comes from Clearwater Beach and come and turn down the come and gone over the causeway at least Ninth Street there aren't as many people you know what I mean yes I don't know 15 different notes actually I don't know if you peeked in my nose but most of people coming in the events at Clark and the main parking lot they don't park out back here I frequently visit this park in this this parking area because that was my age so we were here a couple times a week I've never seen that parking lot [Music] the City utility shed is adjacent to the current shared value station that's all material and opinion that you transport across town each day we had the sandbagging station open and we move it down to the Marine times of the essence when a storm was approaching our staff further have cones and he would be attended in prep minimizing their time should be the most and utmost important consideration everyone lives south of Monterey we will be putting the sandbag Extinction in an evacuation Zone used by Sand Key Clearwater in a public crosswalk in great ad everyone going for sandbags will now need to cross golf ball or to return home we further could have a traffic jam on Gulf Boulevard getting in and out of the Marine having the bagging station City Hall that was all cars to get onto Ninth Street easily and if crowded the ability to safely Parts stay with their vehicle and not cause congestion on the county evacuation room first of all further makes this an easy right hand turn for most people living in Bel Air Beach they don't have to cross broke over cars now cars now are generally way overloaded by the way a vehicle weight capacity when leaving the sandbagging station most sandbags weigh between 40 to 55 pounds we provide 20 bags to each resident which generally has a total weight near near or exceeding a thousand pounds compact cars SUVs have weight ratings from 825 within 1100 pounds sandbags alone can exceed this weight when putting the bags in the residence Vehicles now instead of driving a few blocks on an overweight vehicle they may have to travel nearly two miles on an overloaded vehicle if a car breaks down returning from the sandbagging station on Gulf Boulevard then a real problem occursion of evacuation time sets in the period boat Runners of the Marine during the forecast of a hurricane will surely be prepping their their vessels this will bring additional Vehicles into the Marine parking lot which should cause not only confusion but high temperatures and possibly more the current sandbagging station is easily guarded by the sheriff's department and easily watched over by our city employees it is further chain closed at night coming into it it was just a few years ago the same bagging station was subject to landscapers taking sand putting it in a secluded area could once again have anyone take sand from it for the cashier construction Crews have staged material trucks equipment etc for underground in the Marine parking lot this alone has shortened the Topography of the area even before underground in the county has placed construction equipment terrible temporarily in the Marine parking lot simply a storm occurs getting the equipment out moved out will not be workable function and again shortening the area of sandbag for nine years I've been here no incidents have occurred or caused trouble we're at the same baggage station is current true when Ian came it would look like a cat by storm was coming people were nervous people came to the sandbagging stations and droves but mostly everyone was courteous stayed on 9th Street may we ought to hire Jules Chandler the one day she did a marvelous I mean she really did a marvelous job turning the old cars around bringing the car I mean like take I get my hand to her and she did a great job um but once again I always have a problem with something that works in government interfering with it and trying to make it better usually makes me wish thank you you probably put more work into that recliner than I did in uh this initial thing but you know really if you can take that opinion that government can only make things worse and this is not the right place for you uh we we're trying I mean I got enough to see the other game I'm not on 9th Street but I'm just trying to look out for the residents of my history when we went forward to that so you know it's up to you guys how you vote no I feel I feel bad for people on 9th Street this past storm but again um it looked like we were getting wiped out I mean uh even The Weather Channel it was a little upset when it turned you know well Frank was here really uh I think maybe other channels on the beach a good solution might be to look at that temporary Drive aisle that would at least allow people out um through between the buildings I guess it is is where we would be is it is it the North side or the South side of the yes because that won't really hurt anything if we did like a you know a gravel temporary Drive aisle it's really not I mean we'll have to make sure it's closed off it might mean putting a park bench in front of it on each side so no one you know uses it when they're not supposed to but allowing us access out because I I can see that if you've got a couple of car you know cars stacked up here that it could be cumbersome getting turned around maybe as a solution would be to try to find a way to evacuate those cars out of the sandbag area without going back out tonight I work that station you were eating for two days and we headquartered there with again I don't know what Jules have been there younger days or whatever and I'm not saying about the age room but she did one of those jobs marvelous job getting all that traffic in and out and and everyone was like I said they held down it was Guardians I mean yeah there was congestion on 9th Street duel point but it worked out so what do we want to do with this anyone so it sounds like Kyle's going to take a look at some possible improvements options got potential going from this parking lot to that parking lot which is just it's like a growl temporary driveway to be blocked by a park bench's idea so you have you come in and you can do that out here right so that'd be the state because once you're out you're out you just get the hell I thought come down tonight fill up this direction take the temporary Gravel Road to this parking lot and then exit out on and maybe Kyle as well um because you know some of this was addressing Aesthetics which I get where you're filming from so Kyle maybe if there's some temporary like non-permanent structures that can be put in that area to improve the Aesthetics of the sandbag fiddling area there you know take care of that so people don't actually see it until we want it to be activated well it is it is it simulates a dumpster enclosure very similar to what's behind the building so I don't know how you can do anything better I mean it is a very nice one um I can tell from the photograph I mean I'm not standing next to it but it's durable it's on the gates are on Wheels they're easily closed they look like they're in good shape I don't know what else we could do um you know it looks to me like a dumpster enclosure which you can't get away from having those and parking lots and whatever could you move it over too can you just start talking about that temporary Drive still keeping the temporary Grime just put the uh that hole in there hurry and that junk to it so we'll keep it centered in the city you wouldn't have it really in the eyesight of anybody or any of the area or weddings because you can't get the spot it's a dumpster report yeah but I don't want to take my pictures yeah you have something you wanted to add yeah um in Mike's thing you said he got a complaint from somebody on Harbor Drive about the time when Ninth Street gets flooded and stuff maybe we move the Ninth Street flood Improvement issues up to the top of the list to go with [Music] [Music] [Music] 20 bags is not going to cure anything you know I mean like you said uh I don't want to work on them like a Roger because I don't know 20 bags is good for a front door smell back door most people have probably four openings to their house here and if you want to get sliding doors between the bags right there can I Kyle can I ask that you and Mike take a look at this on a side project and come back to us to see if we can come up with a solution because this is not we're not going to come up with any ideas here it sounds like no one's really in support of moving it so maybe we can just come up with a solution to make this more usable yeah come up with a yeah a way to filter the traffic possibly opening up that connection pointing between the parking lot and um artwork it sounds like the Marine projects okay Kyle can you just shoot me an email to remind me and I'll work with you we will have a good proposal like that we're doing for the other stuff sounds good okay good all right moving on um I remember pre-discussed the term limits for city council members and this was a council member Roberts thank you very much I realized that it wasn't that long ago it was a city decided to implement the tournaments I have always been interested in enough for term limits until relatively recently maybe three or four years ago to me it makes way more sense if bottom line if somebody is in a position for the city council member mayor regardless and that person is not doing the job they should be doing it then it's up to the citizens of the city to take care of that from a voting standpoint some of the downsides of having the term limits or response obviously if you have somebody who's doing a great job in the city positions and are there for two terms and they have to leave that doesn't make a lot of sense to me secondly our mayor has told us that he's been potentially considered for opportunities in some of his positions available in the county and for the most part he's not really considered because they know he's in a two-term limit scenario he's already served you know one so they know it's only going to be here for a short period of time so he doesn't really get considered for those positions so all that being said I am completely in favor of just basically eliminating the last sentence on Section 2.02 that says commencing with the office of those council members whose terms begin in 21 individual council members including the mayor shall be prohibited from holding office for more than two consecutive terms so to Randy if we wanted to reload it and support it it's changing that what's the process we have to go through thank you member Roberts that is an excellent question the process for amending your Charter would require a vote of your electorate so what we would do is adopt an ordinance that says we wish for this matter to be placed on the ballot I think I've I've typically done this with the secondary ordinance that includes the valid language there are specific statutes on referendum items the I believe the title is limited to 10 words the summary is limited to 75 I would write that and so what it would be would be you saying yes draft an ordinance to that effect to place this on a ballot measure coming from the commission on you know for the consideration of the public at the next regularly scheduled election I'm not I see we are presently in June so we would certainly have time if you wish for something like this to get on the ballot for November though we would want to make sure we know if you have a November election year we want to make sure we know what those deadlines are with the supervisor of elections office because they you know for example in a March election you typically need to have ballot language submitted to them approved by your commission Etc by mid-December so we would want to check what those deadlines are if and I'm not sure that we are having a regularly scheduled election that the city residents were going on I know you folks are not up for election in November but if there's some other interim just not remembering as I sit here right now so we certainly do it in time I mean yeah definitely in time for March 2024 obviously this isn't a like pressing issue that needs to be really tomorrow if if you did do it by special election it's my understanding who I've not specifically researched this that it would be an expense to the city sometimes City cities need or want to make these kinds of things happen off cycle in which case that's that expense to you and whatever resources that you would need in that regardless what does everybody think can I just add there are several areas of um with regards to not necessarily term limits but the city council in general I think we have talked about possibly reducing the size of council members to buy rather than seven you know doing some things like that and all of that requires a charter review and maybe we need to you know put that on an agenda to to start doing a charter review on some of those items um because it is there will be um number of items that will need to be voted on by the city by the city yeah right so I am in full support of doing that sooner rather than like like have the review the charter review done before the end of the year so those that so that they can do all the leg work to get it on the um ballot for um so you feel like there's going to be several of other changes yes there are the next item that's on the agenda would also have to go over the process if I can I have a speaker I was on this committee committee um I'm definitely against removing the term limits in fact there was a strong feeling coming out of there because in fact we had a former mayor that was we wanted to get rid of the term limits didn't like that um no reason for term limits is if you have a transient population coming in coming out uh then the use of The Ballot Box is a very good way to control what's going on in the community but we have a very small community and most of our votes are we all can tell you you know look around the table before you can tell which group you know people belong to and keeping the same member in there tends to disenfranchise those that you know are not in that group um that being said these are really these are Charter issues um Panic how much does it cost to raise one issue during the general election it does there is a cost Associated because when I was on the review you were only really allowed to put forward two so we had to prioritize all the charter amendments that the committee wanted put out so what was your question how many how much for one I mean I I don't have it in front of me I'll have it off the top of my head um are you talking November are you talking anymore regular cycle that to put forward a uh because you have to put the printing and the additional cost for the ballot placement uh this was actually A3 2020 but yeah I noticed that is yeah the question was during or if it was during a regular section a regular general election say March 2024 March what would be the added cost to add a single ballot measure roughly just one yeah it it's not going to be that much I I can't give you a dollar amount but it's not going to be a lot because that's already our our election and they're just going to add that on their one ballot question one referendum question I will tell you and without speaking to the cost just procedurally there are some communities at a time where they've had as many as you know five to ten on a ballot because they were doing a charter review and decided they need to overhaul things excuse me so I'm not speaking to the administrative cost associated with that but legally you can do more than one or two again that's a question yeah I think the last time we just prioritized what had to hit the ballot each each week and I believe Dave was trying to add something Dave did you have something to add to this all right yes I did uh I think who will be uh on you on this is is that there's there's multiple changes that I think would make the and the way that that the local government provides more efficient and also it would be more cost effective uh we kind of touched on it briefly about removing not removing but eliminating confrontations and droppings down to five council members uh that was that was one one idea and if you look at it you compare all the other communities up and down the beach uh we we had the most yeah so that's that's one part of it the other part is uh I still am in agreement with term limits but absolutely one more is needed at least and the reason why I think I think Mr Robert sort of touched on that about how it whenever you you first become a mayor you start making a slight impact but then you build the relationships with the county the state uh your your neighbor communities and your second term as mayor is whenever you're failure are able to start uh gaining traction and making things happen um so I would say that whenever we push this through and it's actually my fault uh limiting us to to two terms was a desperate not a desperate but a terrible mistake and I think that it's going to be hard to sell this tea on it but I think that if we all agree with it that it would just be up to us to sell the concept to the city so that it didn't fail in an election and uh and then the the last piece of it uh is the streamlining of our whole election process rather than doing the expensive let's do it in March I think that we have far greater voter turnout if we realign our elections with the general and midterm elections so what does that look like and how do you restructure everything that we know right now how much of it can be to dominate it all to a single Allen item uh in other words if you look at the entire concept rather than each piece of it you may not want just one piece of the past and the other two fail I think that whatever it is that we come up with and we agree upon we try to jam it in one single ballot item that this is this is our vision for the future and then of course Mr Mora would have the dawning task for figuring out how the implementation of that would occur because you're going to have people that uh are not up for for election or or their term is not about to end or it would fall on a weird day if you convert it over so those are some things to consider if those are uh that's just my opinion on where I see the city going forward and a lot of it is in response to what we're all facing right now which is we're about to uh beginning of the year we're going to have to start doing this full disclosure report and I think I've heard at least one or two sitting council members say they don't want to do that so um I think that as as your neighbors realize that what they're having to disclose to even been a part of of the council they're not going to want to do it anymore so we may may very well have a limited choices going forward yes Frank I go back to a general or President Washington with his parting words at the end of the second term new the transfer battle from one citizen Statesman to another as a core principle of our constitutional republic Washington first knew his supporters that wanted him to stay most of America won his state but he also said that the longer he or anyone retained power over the Democracy the less Democratic it became I think two terms in the city or anywhere is more than enough 92 percent of the voters not almost 93 percent of Voters and March of 2021 said so I agree with what Mike said I'll use the word little clicks into towns that come out when you look at how many people said you can change you can change administrations overnight and uh I know people say well sometimes it's hard to get people but that's people have to step up if they want a government I mean one of the reasons I ran for government I can't stand most governments the way they work but I came here to hopefully preserve what I inherited when I moved here I didn't want to then change and that's why I read through for this so I'm going to be a guest and I will be against eight anything yet just three years ago the voters we dump enough money into something so I'm sure you can get 92 percent well I think um we all agree that the charter review is um necessary so let's move forward and trying to put the charter Review Committee together and then all of those details will get hashed out agree so it's basically just put the data for volunteers to our City attorney and well I'd I'd want to look forward to your code because I'm I'm not sure if you if you're well want to make sure there's other no other people requirements for that I don't believe there are but if you're doing a charter Review Committee your CAC may be uh sufficient vessel for that given it's there's advisory committee given its very broad charge under your under your Charter that may be a vehicle for conducting that but yes I would work with Kyle and we could come back to you with a recommendation at a later date on how best to to be here in your city to see how you've conducted those in the past either so I want to make sure that we're advising consistent with the current one perfect and we'll look forward to hearing that is there any census Direction in that regard to come back with recommendations on a process for our Charter Review Committee it sounds like this yes certainly consensus so thank you I understood okay moving forward to item four discussion of salaries for city council members does thank you very much and uh Dave already mentioned the only reason that I even brought this forward so I'm reading here in our current charge of 103 said the council by ordinance and actually do this but the main reason I'm thinking that we should consider something like this when they had mentioned the form six we're gonna have even less people that are going to be interested in one series and my hope would be that potentially some type of a small salary being sent some qualified good citizens in our city to run if that made a difference that's my thought I would just if I make vice mayor I know for each of you you've seen my memorandum that discusses this I think just for the benefit of the public that may view this there's it warrants briefly briefly addressing what you're talking about during the legislative session this year the legislature nearly unanimously adopted a new statute that changed the financial disclosure requirements for elected officials in local municipalities you have historically filled out what is called a 4-1 and the form one has General disclosure requirements of where are your assets and liabilities held and that's about it form six is different substantially is what is commonly referred to as a full and public Financial disclosure these are public records field a on a form six begins with you stating a calculus of your net worth and that net worth has its own directions on how you are to calculate it field B I believe immediately begins with you identifying all of your assets held that are in excess of a thousand dollars each and so if you for example have a firearm collection and your guns are of value exceeding a thousand you would have to give the aggregate value of your gun collection and then each of those that is valued individually over a thousand dollars so you have to identify all of your assets over a thousand dollars not those that are solely held by your spouse or partner but you would have to disclose those that are jointly out then Additionally you have to disclose all of your liabilities and access them so your car note for example things like that would all be requisite disclosures in addition to these requirements the penalty for non-compliance has increased from what I believe was ten thousand dollars to twenty thousand dollars so a substantial increase in the penalty enough that you would not want to play around with seeing if you did it right this is not limited by whether or not you are compensated that was one of the proposed amendments that this only be required in cities where elected officials are compensated by their city that did not take there was another attempt at an amendment that this only be required in communities that were of a certain size or population let's say Orlando or Miami not quite South choppy or Bellaire Beach but that didn't take either this applies equally to all elected officials in local municipalities it takes effect with the new year it is effective immediately as a law but the terms of the law make it such that if you are in office on January 1 2024 you will be filling out a form six you should be filling out form ones that are due in the next nine days so by July 1 or form one for 2022 is due but if you are in office on January 1 2024 you will be filling out a form six for the first time so that's what the to the extent the public hears any of the changes that are required this is um you know the the justifications for this are of course increased transparency enhanced ability to evaluate potential conflicts this is separate and apart from election and campaign Finance disclosures that's a different thing we're talking about your your assets not those things not hey I got 500 for my campaign that's a different thing subject to different rules not administered by chapter 112 but administered by a separate section the last thing I would note is when you fill these out these are public record you are admonished not to put your social security number or your bank routing number all that stuff in there but when you do fill them out they are that are in fact public records so that is uh for some that's called become a cause of concern I know I've talked with some elected officials who said that that's not what I sign up for um and and that's a personal choice each person is going to have to make I gave a Statewide presentation on this yesterday for the Florida League cities through their webinar which are free to watch it's largely an exposition of the memorandum that you've already been provided so that's that's I I can mean to sideline the conversation too much but I think that's important to know what we're talking about when we're using these inside baseball terms Randy did I read somewhere that in lieu of actually filling out the four and six an individual would have turned in or trying to copy of their income tax return uh that is true but imprecise I would say that what if you look at the actual substance of the form six that allows you to satisfy the elements of field e it is one field of the analysis so you can use your tax forms to to substantiate one field however comma in doing so please know that you are making your tax returns public records right how much are you looking for a salary I I haven't done any detail on that I just wanted to see what the thoughts were with with the council I know when I've talked briefly with some of the other towns when I've been out of town and city meetings meetings is like that so I had found out during those months conversations that I haven't found any other town or city that is not compensated many of them are surprisingly compensated with a number that shocked me but that's not really what I'm just again my whole statement was if this might help but did additional citizens of Miller ehp incentive to want to be a participant and what goes on in our city that I'm for it's not for me what I'm saying is who amongst us needs a shower to do this job I mean not me okay I don't think anybody in we have to entice somebody to pay them if we had the money in the budget to pay somebody to pay your council members are field staff is so overworked in my opinion we and we're looking about buying a boat or whatever like that they cannot keep up with the duties duties they have now okay unless unless we put them on 12 hours a day which I'm sure you know suggest me that but put another field stamp or something like that because I don't see how I don't see how they can keep up now with the work assignments they have with this rain now they're going to be Tripoli taxed because in a few days they couldn't get out and do some of the Mowing and everything else like that I think the money should be going to the employees of the city and we have extra money perform the services that the people ask for and we should be verified yeah I mean I appreciate the sentiment you know the thought about it but you know it comes down to a dollar put into account someone's pocket is one dollar that's not on the streets help improve influence but I mean you know and if we could come up with seven to five let me know it may not be as big a deal as that person I'm not definitely not affordable Leslie if you have any input I would agree with French today or um mayor any input okay uh also believe that we don't actually look at it we live in Alert in each hour I'm all for a Open salary uh where we're meeting so that we don't walk around hunting we did this for hero um I again I we don't I don't think anyone in in the room uh actual needs of money however about entertain her or perform stick alone if you haven't yeah and you were going to ask her in that form into that that account for pain so now working for the city is actually cost a lot and I say absolutely nothing from an obligation but other than our uh as uh co-appropriation for everything all of you do that part of that part of it this is Belinda can you hear me yes okay I completely um understand where councilmember Roberts is coming from having attended several of the Florida League cities conferences myself the discussion of salaries and so I understand that I own I understand also that we have one of the smallest cities as well so we're going to taxes have the latest this perhaps other Commissioners or council members um but you know mayor goddess put up a good point about moving forward is going to cost us more than our time um and so you know some things small and I know when you hear the word salary you think a large number it doesn't have to be anything big but just something to compensate individuals for their time because I do have a feeling that I did watch Attorney Morris class on Tuesday and um it was very informative and very um detailed and some of the information that we have to provide I think that folks are not going to want to step forward and perhaps this might provide them with some sort of compensation for them thank you I would I would agree that it's they're because the one the one uh one of the things that came to my mind is in consideration of this form six I'm going to have to hire my attorney and my account to determine how I perceive and there's an expense to that I think it's necessary I don't think it's going to help people step up to the plate but I think it's necessary to offset some of the expenses you incur when you assume a position like this there's a risk involved and it's a I think it's I think it's necessary and I don't care how small any town is every League of City meeting I've gone to we we are the only city not compensated if you're a council member and you don't want that compensation for your expenses or whatever it is that you might use it for then you can always donate it back to the city I mean you don't have to take it but there I think that it's important to offer it we're the only city that doesn't I think the town of Bel Air might be the only other jurisdiction in Pinellas County where they're not compensated yes um the that to my knowledge that's the only other one in Pinellas County where that's the case I will tell you that communities are having the discussion on some sort of stipend or subsidization not a salary but some are talking about subsidizing that costs here is a cost to defray the cost of service since this is a what would some I've heard somebody call it characterized as an unfunded mandate right as you said I'm gonna to do this right I may wish to engage a professional that's that cost to me now because I've otherwise agreed to serve and so I should perhaps this would be an appropriate um use of public funds in connection with your role that's ultimately for you folks to decide I would note that however you perceive the way that your work your Charter is written if you pass an ordinance today it doesn't take effect until two election Cycles later so that's something to to take note of that it would not take effect in April or something of that sort just something to consider which I think that's fair enough I don't think any of us are looking for compensation we knew what the deal was when we took it but moving forward for those who will consider running it's important to have that laid out for them so so again it's my ordinance um would this be something we would just bring in front of council then it doesn't need to be uh voted on by citizens in a general election the way your Charter reads this is the council by ordinance shall determine the annual salary if any so it contemplates that that could be zero and it could be something and whatever it is to be shall be determined by the council I I would have to review that and make sure there are no other Provisions in your code as this was a work session in preparing any such ordinance but yes it would be submitted of course subject to public comment and input but yes the Council would have the ability ultimately decided by ordinance on first and second reading I think that I think it would be if something had to be done by the electric I know what it says but I think it was challenging I think the elected cast and what are you basing that on I just I just so I understand and I make sure in front of me but you're um you're changing the whole structure or the Dynamics of the history of this town of uh now just accounts are going to exam they were going to start paying each other well I'd be happy to review it I would just say that the people of the city have spoken in the plain language of the charter and what I would interpret would be the plain language of the charter understanding would be a cultural shift for to be certain I would I'm not aware of any language to the contrary of this language if there is I would review it and I would certainly I am not suggesting at all that the city circumvent what is otherwise required I'm not aware that the the ethics code chapter 112 specifically allows for a council to vote on its own salary increases such as provided that they take effect after the Turning Europe of that city council so I'm not aware of any legal restriction otherwise but I'll be happy to review that and bring forward anything for you so I think to move this forward would it make sense that you come back with an opinion for us and yeah just whatever consensus Direction you provide if the consensus direction is please provide us with the insight and what the process is we can do that if the consensus directions please prepare an ordinance we can do that I just want to make sure I'm clear on what you're asking me so I can achieve goals and we have clear expectations of one another I'm going to suggest ion yes uh extent response to Mr Bankers comments about uh [Music] Mr uh can you just maybe I think it's your microphone can you just speak loud into your microphone because you're breaking up if you hear me though yeah like Gardens we don't hear anything if I make I mean just a suggestion at this point this is mostly adamant um would it be better if we move this to the next working session because of the problem with the mics right now it's right now because I could not understand what the mayor was bringing up I had parts and bits and parts of what was in you know obviously important I agree and I'd really like to hear is you know a full it is full thoughts can you hear me at all now yeah that's better Mr Mayor how about this moving forward why don't we um move into the next work session but maybe when we come back to that work session you put some numbers to a pencil you know pencil to paper and lettuce what are you thinking about compensation about eating compensation just as across the board compensation for you know and I don't because I have no idea what to base it on I have no idea I don't even know where other than hauling around other cities the first step I was going to ask Randy so is that something that falls within our guidelines Randy or is that an additional expense as an example if we recommended to go ahead and put the ordinance together we just length for the amount of I'm not sure I understand the first half of your question if you're asking is that within the retainer yes preparation of an ordinance like that is ordinarily within the retainer can you talk about something like a charter Review Committee and that's a special project that's outside of it just based by scope and operation uh but the preparation of an ordinance is what you pay me to do on a regular basis um the only time the preparation of preparation of an ordinance can become a special project under our contract where it requires special attention I would give you the example of what I did in Indian Rock speech with the short-term rental where it was we're having five workshops and four four hearings all in one ordinance in a meeting with all these shareholders that's a different project but something like this before we start working with things so thank you so that's why I would recommend if your branding can come back with the ordinance with the amount of money and then that's something we can discuss we would know what that's saying know what it looks like and then we can have it the next Workshop okay this is what it is and then we can agree on either zero or some number for the Divine are you going to do the research who's going to research um I I believe our firm recently did this for another jurisdiction and I will I will ask for that thank you heart compensation study and circulated if we have okay if you don't I'll make sure that's clear to come okay that sounds good all right okay and that'll just hit the next work session okay all right so moving forward to item number five discussion of a full-time administrative assistant position council member yeah I actually had a pretty detailed discussion with our city manager they have tried with staff to try to find somebody as a part-time that has been unsuccessful for various reasons I feel like we need additional support in that area and that's been confirmed by people and our staff that I've talked to so I think the right direction to go is a full-time person I have had people talk to me personally about you know the fact that we call the city and the current staff is unable to actually get the call because you guys are so busy that additional staff person I feel would definitely help in that area as well as other tasks that you guys take on so that's why I feel like we need to and I'm pretty sure it's already budgeted for a full-time yeah so we've already got it budgeted so all we need to do is um you know tell file please move forward and advertise for a full-time as opposed to a part-time and let's get that built I would be very much in favor of that and we always used to have a full-time receptions and stuff now everybody sort of picks up the pieces yeah I mean I agree I mean I just don't want to step on the stove I mean we oversee imagine that's Kyle's call Kyle but I I haven't heard from you directly on this thank you um I think we'll remember Roberts is saying is that um we we have it planned in the 2024 budget for full-time and uh causal seems to be a great thus far with that but at this point in our current budget we uh we haven't had that position which was a part-time position still for enough time that the remaining time left we could advertise immediately for our full-time position and be able to compensate for inside of this year's budget okay just be clear too we looked at the code enforcement there's a drop in those hours so this person can help at least the administrative workload covering that that loss there that they could be additionally working on that as well yes um I feel like bringing more of the administrative work into code enforcement and even some of the the driving around and observing code violations bringing that more in-house is is a much cheaper Endeavor than to you know have the sheriff do as much I see the benefits of having the Sheriff's Office to perform some code enforcement but I think we should try to do as much of In-House as possible as well okay no goodbye it occurred to me that um if we get a full-time Administrative Assistant then we could um have somebody else do the code first which means we might be able to reduce the budget for the sheriff's office for their doing quote of course where I said we already grow up those hours okay that's what I'm just saying we already dropped the hours in the budget yeah so I just wanted to make sure that that's a good idea she fills in that Delta there yeah yeah it sounds like Dave did you have anything you want to ask well first off uh am I any clearer yes okay great all right uh next uh Kyle and I had a discussion about this and I agree with his proposal I think it's a great idea uh I would like to go back on the other topic that I will wait till the end of the meeting just to revisit that right where I think salary that's where he is you didn't have anything to add Belinda Linda can you hear me yesterday I am I'm in agreement I have a second conversation with Kyle last week um and I'm in favor of moving forward full time in the training assistant and support as well I um I'm the caller that hangs up and calls everyone's extension every time no one answers yeah I can only imagine how residents and then I call them Kyle saw so um I was I am in huge support of having someone even if it's just answering phones so yeah hi else please proceed yes okay um yeah Jennifer General business anyone have anything else we all get this librarianism his Library position this way I actually said that you're in there greeting that much you sign up to be a counselor I'll give you more than it's important enough to read every month but uh I just want to be clear and restorative that's correct yeah yeah because what we found I think is that we had a lot of people getting the car and we were reimbursing for it and they weren't using they had no skin in the game so once we're hard to put skin in the game yeah the participation dropped a little bit I was now this is hearsay that I was also told that the lord of the library said if we were a participant to their Plug-In or whatever like that would be 100 there was something last year that they wanted like forty five hundred dollars yeah and I threw that out there I just don't want to mislead any questions no you're absolutely right anyone else yeah um Frank mentioned it earlier and I had a discussion with Kyle as as well as a Avon and for myself Aaron I do okay so about um the standing of the field staff I have a lot of background in public works the fact that we only have two field staff is wrong on a couple of measurements first of all if either one of them call in sick or have to go on a vacation there's many tasks in public works that can't be done by one person this can be so then either Aaron or Kyle or somebody has to fill in we really consequently I asked them there there's a an acronym for it out there but there's schedule maintenance that often can be done because you can't get to it just don't you don't have to stand we need more we need at least one more full-time employee in that Arena when I asked the question well if we do that can you keep that third person busy um Aaron almost fell on the floor okay I'm gonna ask that question I mean he's confident that if you keep that third person more than busy so I think we're doing a disservice to the City by not having that third field staff person out there and I would say a large percentage of the conversations I have with citizens has to do with Aesthetics in our city and those are the things that we're probably not getting to because there's a lot of things they do that aren't seen that have to be done but when people say well gee why doesn't this look better why doesn't that look better because so I'm asking right now what do we have to do this is I think a good time to do it for the budget we're working on if we can budget for that additional field staff person for 2024 and if there's any way to do it sooner I would fully support that as well I like to see a little more research behind it before we look at it you know in total for adding to the budget but I mean if you like go out and investigate you know the person qualifications you know what would be needed for that position because I agree I mean you've had two people and some of them are two-man lifts you can't write that that object has to be moved and not a periodicity whatever but yeah even if you just see the numbers we've promoted one of them to a foreign I think that you know this is we're into Mrs Kyle's wheelhouse Kyle to present us with what another person would look like is ours cost for budgeting and what type of Duties and that sort of thing kind of a job description and bring it to us that's at the budget meeting let's talk about it the budget meeting just permiss those details okay that sounds good I'll get that together uh let's see I have one other thing um laid out that was a tasking by the mayor to look at the rental policy as far as the wait list so I just provided a draft obviously changes our red you know Drive changes on we're not working on tonight I just want to let you know that it's in the package so if you got time you know read it you know provide thoughts for the next working session Mike I think you did an excellent job and it's only one thing yeah lead all over it as we see no no no the only thing is that um if you have if your names on the boat if you names on the list you don't have to have a boat for what was The Proposal like six months you start you start paying from day one and I got you go ahead do you know what I'm saying and then you're in you're proposing you have to have a building for me to put it on the list all right you know you know what I'm saying yeah um do you understand all right okay so I have to maintain a boat for seven years park at some place put it in another dock or whatever has 90 days to provide about whatever upon it what I'm saying yeah you know but yeah I agree with Mike let's review this and anyone that has comments yeah so I think he did an excellent job and then when we review it the work session maybe they can get included I mean that's like what I'm writing is please bleed all over yeah so those that's more homework right so you go with the goals and you're going to review this yeah there's comments but a lot I don't think that I'll put that in another um Leslie do you have anything no he's loving Stone do you have anything no I'm good thinking I've never had something Dave do you have anything oh yes I just uh briefly coming back on the salary uh that there was a comment on the council that it needs to go back to the citizens that let down uh make that decision well in a in a in a way they already did because they voted on the charter and gave us the freedom to be able to make these decisions also due to the fact that it requires an ordinance the citizens will have the opportunity to speak freely on their opinion twice as we vote on this and also if we decided to discuss it again in a work session so I am a a one last comment on that is that uh no matter what we do none of us will be there to to reap the benefits of increasing or creating a salary for for somewhat going forward so I'm I'm all for working on something of towards a salary for future Council man good point anything else I think that's all I've got for now I appreciate everyone tolerating uh me having to zoom in and had I known it was sounding as bad as it was I would have changed the hardware early on in the meeting my apologies ever happens again just play I'll say I can't hear you call in or something and uh and I'll make it right well that's it and uh for the bike here Shirley I greatly appreciate you doing a superb job of chairing this meeting and I hope I don't have to rely on you many more times but I do greatly appreciate the work you did today oh you're welcome thank you thank you thank you all in favor all right all right have a good night guys thank you"
