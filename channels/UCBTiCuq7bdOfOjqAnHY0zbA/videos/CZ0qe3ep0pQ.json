    "transcript": "all right good afternoon everybody good afternoon um so i'd like to call this park recreation work together on this wednesday january 6th at 3 00. she is kind enough to be our standing secretary is your role called share tammy um i shared george ortel not here uh deborah yeah and nora here great job everyone okay so we have a quorum so we're good to go all right perfect um okay so the first order on the agenda today is to approve the agenda can i have a motion to approve the agenda today your first match second second the vote and then item number two today is citizen comments if we have any any citizens call any citizens comments out there would you like to talk are you in the back i've been through most of the parks i just wondered if all of you have been through the parks to walk them all we had made up a list a long time ago with different things we saw in the park that needed attention such as trees maybe being removed you know sea wall conditions over that i don't know doing that kind of inspection we kind of looked at the walkways whether the concrete was in good condition any ground settling by the sea walls general conditions of any of the benches or the tiers going out where they need any work i don't know is that something that you've been looking at since you yeah we surveyed all the parks we divided them up and everybody reported back and then we gave our list submitted pictures by email or that was just a few short weeks ago so like i don't know specific i don't know what the list was like we're going to do this but we're not going to do this how that ended up but yeah we did that we took a look at the pathways i know that's been a discussion with the council for a few years already and we wanted to kind of upgrade those uh you know clean them up you know clear the trees out of the pathways are you speaking on a specific park which park are you kind of referring to pathways halfway north and south from the city you have a walking path that goes oh you're talking from the first street and then you've got the pathway that goes from 13th all the way to 18th yes so that pathway in an old phone book now there's no record of it unless lynn has found something but it used to be like an emergency turn around because those streets are all dead end 13 through 18th so if those were cleared you could get an emergency vehicle through there because it's about 10 foot wide so i don't know what the status is in as far as those streets 13th through 18th but well it's like i said the other night constantly the issue with those is the council's got to decide if they want to pay them or not pay and it never makes the agenda though so who needs to put it on the engine well it that's a console issue no i mean not like theirs so they have to put it on the agenda yeah so one of them has to like suggest it well they they have suggested that we got a price it was 75 yeah 175 000 to do it 175 to do it all to do it all okay and i said the simplest way to do it if you want to do it is do it when we have a stormwater project and just add that asphalt onto it storm water project that way because you're tearing up like right now we're tearing up 7th and 8th street at the end well that's the prime time to do something like that if you're gonna do it but the console hasn't decided to do that yet in total because it's it's a lot of money just one of the things that has been on our agenda for a while and i was just hoping that you know there was interest with the new group maybe to push that through or talk about it there were there was some interest of the people on the south side of the city they were kayakers and they were using that pathway to come up to the beach but you know things that fell by the wayside especially with colton and just general stuff but thus not meeting as much as we used to or spending as much time i think what we talked about is like the fact that they're trying to get like a survey because like if i ask by people they they want that paid and if i ask another five people they absolutely don't want that paid so i think they were trying to get a consensus or a vote with more than like getting out to 80 people by asking neighbors you're going to find that that that's just the case you know some people do some people don't but the big thing is a safety issue you know if you're gonna walk that pathway and it is a walkable pathway and you have any hazards out there you know like holes or whatever and not a decent way to walk somebody's gonna fall so then the city's liable for that so it's kind of a toss-up well one of the things um but the uh the people that i know um will know that i walk in these four miles every day and i usually walk all over um and vote for the sidewalk now is a nightmare because the people that use it as a highway like workers come from across the bridge and build the kitty rocks and things and that's what all the people that i've talked to um do not want a sidewalk going up to the town because we'll have that again i think i don't know if you would hear it before you had issues with the kids going through their motorized everything yeah and you know you would have i had you know back in the day when you have a police there i was protected because that makes absolute sense to me right but uh i mean my board your safety but for thorough advancement well i i don't know about people driving through there we can put those big metal bars so you can't get vehicles going through them but only to use an emergency be blocked off i don't think honestly people aren't going to be driving through there that's a really rough way to uh [Music] that's what would be wrong with that because it's a walkway and sometimes people are they'll be two people beside one another i've seen people walking their children that have to jump back um and i'm all i understand that bikers have the same range as a pedestrian um but i've seen lots of people that have been on the phone on your bike oblivious and it's and it's if you walk as much as we do out there the bikers and the motorized people you will give me that especially you know walking out walking all the time and i would hate that to be changed through our town through the middle we have now as a safe way for people quietly environment i wouldn't mind seeing things for walkers i think that would alleviate traffic i don't think bikers are really going to use it as much i'm not saying they won't i think everyone who's a fighter is trying to get to point a point b and people who are walking are using those back streets because it's more peaceful i don't want to walk next to those cars i don't want my dog walking next door i love walking through that or they could safely walk through because like you said you're spray-painting roots i don't know if it's in budget or where how to push this water but well basically it's for community interaction i mean i doubt if you're going to see people take a bike down boulevard all the way down 13th and then go inland i doubt it you know nobody really knows it exists but the people that live in the city in those areas so they have other people use it there are a few people from indian rock beach that use it but they've been using it for years because they live on this thing so it's not like we're advertising that it's going to be no we're not from the eye you know like just the eye in the sky look the same what do you do we have a license yes to you to maintain that pond the grass not anything else right we'd have to get an easement from the county but i know they would give it to us right it wouldn't be an issue for the workers hm thank you i didn't recognize you with your mustache all right thank you very much thank you okay do we have any further discussion on that or don't talk about anything like should we put it on the next it's past that point it's past that point it's already the console we did a survey to see like what it's been a couple years and because at first we were talking about shelling it but then we got looking into that there is a certain kind of shell it's called run bank shell that it's almost like people but they put it in at the turtle park and i took pictures it's awesome yeah it's it looks really nice yeah you can ride a bicycle on oh really yeah and not fall like not fall like spread it um next best thing i would say to asphalt is it compacts and it stays together it's almost like a roadway i mean you drive a car down and that's 175 000. oh no no that's much cheaper that's much cheaper but the console talked about hayden what the run back yeah well you'd have to do some maintenance to it annually but for the most part not much you may have to add something to it it's i mean i don't know how many miles we put in an old market probably three or four miles out of it maybe longer more than that i mean miles 15 foot wide drive car down so it's just going to take someone on the council to like push the issue what you know initially it was talked about to do run by shell then it was brought up to do paving it as opposed to the run-back shell because there is some maintenance with that so and we did have a short discussion a little bit the other night about it we had a little discussion about it at the meeting yeah so we'll see where it goes all right item number three on our agenda is the approval of the december 9th meeting note or the minutes can i have the first student to approve those we need a motion for that can i have a motion to approve those minutes in the second second all right so those notes are minutes okay so the fourth item on her agenda actually has to do with the minute so it's i'm like rick's not here but um i would like to make a proposal that our minutes be turned into as opposed to being in paragraph form and you guys get the minutes and there's quotes of people and kind of like opinions i would like it to be just bullet points like very concise there's a couple of examples because that's the way patty does it with the council because you can't sit there and try to quote up everybody or say oh i was very discouraged about this or you know so and so did a good job but so and so didn't like like no opinions no bias just black and white bullet point this is what we talked about objective exactly so i is i would like to propose that we move to that because i think the one that'll make it easier and if there's any question about anything it's recorded it's recorded so um and i think it would make it easier for us to go through and define things because like i know like last meeting we talked about because when i presented to the council um one of them asked us to like when we're putting activity calendars together or you know like the events to get input from you know the citizens and you know we ask about getting it maybe on the survey and you know we were told no it's not that kind of survey but that wasn't even mentioned on there and it was very important i thought because the council asked us to do it right it just didn't end up on the minutes at all so i think if it's bullet pointed and not paragraphed out i think it'll be easier to like catch everything because you're just catching the topic right so can i have a motion to move to that format okay we first been doing a second normal okay so that's passed um so we'll just pass the information on to the secretary is that okay yeah okay perfect all right now we get to do the fun part of the meeting um well actually number five in that room but um just a recap of so the for the bellar beach we love our city donation program so the first thing that we have to do then got back to me and said we can't like tack onto the garden clubs like tax exempt we have to get our own so i'm hoping that we're going to be able to get that done between this meeting and next meeting so we just need to be told what to do well the attorney said a group would have to do it outside of this board that's what the attorney told me okay so i sent you an email but i didn't i didn't understand what route when you said group i thought you meant our group no well you could be part of it but it's not part of the park board he said it has to be a separate entity can we make up a separate entity or can we oh anybody can do that but it take it takes longer than a month to do that well i don't mean get it back here just at least get the ball rolling yeah uh let me talk to fred some more and see if i can get you some background documents from somewhere because it's not a big hassle to do it it just takes some time and there are some costs to it so uh that's the issue where it's got to be a separate entity so with the cost can we use our budget to cover that cost that's something i'll ask brett if he thinks we can do that immediately all right i just wanna that's like we have to do that first before we do it yeah so you have to get a tax id you have to you have to be incorporated uh you have to send bylaws to the state that has to be approved it's not just is it easier than getting a grant yeah getting a gray green i'm joking because like i looked at some of the paperwork for the grant like proposals what oh oh you looked through the paperwork for the grant yeah it was included in my biker that patty gave me like some of the applications part of the benefit doing all that stuff yeah gotta be creative right so i just you know i realize there's a little bit of leg work with it are we able to use the tax idea incorporation of the garden club your separate entity because their their their prop how you would have to create it because what you're wanting to create for is to better the parks okay so that's what the bylaws have to be developed for so but there there's those things are online and easy to find so we can be a separate group but all the same members yeah you could be but you'd have a separate meeting there's nothing that says you can't be part of it because it's a private uh if somebody wanted to talk to somebody maybe close bel air community foundation they have that and they do projects for like right now well i'll say last year they were doing the things it's community foundation they were doing projects for their police department where they put all this stuff on that they the police department felt they needed that they could have extra and so they went out and did fundraising for that and they put up put put on a lot of things at the rec center up there well that's the city but this bel air community foundation does other things like the if if you go to uh if you're where where ponce de leon is in that park there yeah that military park that's something the foundation did they they actually got sponsors for that part okay so you're suggesting that um one of us go over there and talk to someone there you may be able to call someone there okay yeah i'll do it and unless someone else wants to volunteer if you need me to find the number i'll i'll talk to actually they'll be there friday yeah i'll ask their partner director because he'll be here friday okay that's great okay thank you is there any other discussion on that program for right now no okay um okay so now we get to do the fun one so if you go back in your packet it's pretty much the same list with a couple things added so i wanted to see um i don't know i was thinking about a couple different ways that we could do this so i thought um if you had a suggestion that's not on this then we write it in and then everybody vote for the ones that they like like maybe your top five or something like that and then we just kind of tally them up and then we each can make our presentations on like what we're suggesting and the information that we found out um like say for example i found from valor country club one of the instructors she'll do a boot camp on the beach monday and wednesday at four o'clock for ten dollars class so like just and if you don't have that information that's fine it's just you know the more information that you have the easier it will be for us to make a decision on what will go and what won't go so if you could just kind of take a look and see what's on here and then if one of your suggestions is not please just write it in and then we'll go and kind of pencil it in and then we'll vote and then we'll tally does that make sense and then just kind of call out when you're ready i'm ready can i talk about what i want to add on yes because i need to write it in okay so um i'm a big youth kind of person but after looking into it there's not a lot of kids at bellaire so i went the opposite direction and realizing we have an active aging problem going on so that there's not a problem no no no technology problem there are devices like if you fall you can't get up you can use your iphone to text of your steam you know your nurse your hospice nurse or a family member there's that technology available so i'm suggesting you teach a class bring a tech guy in and he can get his business cards out and volunteer volunteers time to just whoever wants more information about what's out there as far as the technology to help the elderly when they're alone and then my second thing is doing cpr classes um we could have the fire department come in do first aid aed how to recognize a stroke heart attack things like that and just keep overall kind of like refresh your course i think those are both great ideas i think like they're not code friendly for first quarter is my first thought because like i think cpr i've taken a cpr class like for to be a lifeguard or whatever one years ago like you know to have a group of people come in here and try to do that i think every one of you yeah right now yeah there may be like in september like that once everyone's vaccinated and the numbers start coming down very hopeful that's going to happen i do like both of those ideas but that was my first audition for talking does anybody else have i love speaking art class and yeah that's a great i mean even for the beach like for little expensive it's pretty expensive and it's pretty intensive and time commitment as well it's not just like an hour you know well the red cross do you receive yeah i think a lot of people are interested in it but you have to get everyone so i will like literally right next door so the next time i go i'll i think it's generally between like 150 like around 150 range to be certified or to learn how to do just to learn how to do it um can you do a little more research on pricing and class options and stuff like that i think we're going to run into a lot of these problems where everything just let's push it off and like how we'll say yeah yeah i think we're gonna we're gonna pick five scenes we wanna do right now okay and then so like and then we're gonna leave if something's not working we'll trade it out if like something will work better in the fall or in a different time frame then we just added new i feel like we can orleans distance that i think we can add on so much so much to that that we don't even have to decide in this moment um well that's really not an activity but it is businesses that's what we're up against we have just citizens with new businesses and if we don't want to invite irv and bel air then it's down to dedicating it to your dogs you know no i definitely thought they have all that time [Music] we can have a wine table donated by like a liquor store but we're pulling in different neighborhoods there's so many things and i think we can do one really really good and then here's the thing how are we even gonna tell these people yeah somebody's gonna take over that facebook and first off that's fine but i think we have to do a little nailer or i can go door to door and drop it into our hands i'll see the legalities into that but i have no problem um blood drive on the bus yeah it's parked in the thing parking our thing okay so where could i think that usually you get i gave like yesterday right where did you get and the blood drive is complete free because they're very yeah they're awning about that okay i'm not working there okay deb what um do you have to add that isn't on here already um so it's like i think we should like vote on it and then if it gets i didn't think we're going to give the details explain it we can but okay just briefly she's amazing and she does all kinds of yoga but older person like me would be more um and her price is just ridiculous it's only ten dollars per yeah sixty dollars unlimited so if there's three classes a week and i believe what she said tuesday thursday and saturday yeah tuesday and thursday 8 30 in the morning and saturday at 9 30 in the morning that's yeah that's quite possible and it could be 15 if there's like you know the week in the month so the 60 is so i mean it's like four bucks class it's so affordable and she's a really good teacher we did just the meditation part and she'll do like 45 minutes with yoga and you can modify to any level you want so like if you're a yogi and you want to stand on your head you can and if you just want to sit there and you know just do a gentle stretch she can modify she teaches a trip right yeah so she's a very very she's amazing yeah she's a very good instructor so is that what we're talking about under the first category no that's the stand-up category if you come down to um beach yoga meditation that would be that i just want to make sure okay yeah yeah and she's amazing and then the other two things and just having things they won't be like something you can talk about briefly i think like a book club for different people to get women in the neighborhood my husband definitely wants to join the book well we'll let you pick it up together you know get people out of the house and get together and then the other thing is like we were talking sometimes like having one time things i used to study photography i'm pretty good at it but now i see lots of people you can do a lot of things with your phones if you're educated about it and i have a person that's amazing photographer but one time we get together and show people the women together and women and um show them how to do better things on their phone are you laughing at me no i have to talk i love photography so i was like all so do you have information on pricing or times or anything no that and that that's different maximum she wasn't here and uh would be i'm sure perfect uh well it's two things because like i thought about this and i was like okay there should we should probably put together events that are like say okay max you can spend but a month is like 50 bucks like as a citizen because okay i don't want people like spending all this money like there should be like some free things so like i did knitting and crocheting that was one of my and then um i would do like the wine and walk thing like like walk the bridge and yeah there was something on here until like coffee and lime yeah blind block and then um the other thing i had which can be like um in like the next few months is like puzzle club so like people can just like get a mat and they can work on a puzzle and then they can roll it up and like save it for the next time or whatever i'm still working on when i started in april so those are just like the ideas okay but things that are like free like so if you're gonna do like one that's like they pay like i say they're 45 and then like okay if they want to do like one yoga class is like 55 for the month like they're already like probably like oh i don't know so then if you incorporate some free like events or you know activities people will be more willing to like come out out until the last person oh no it's just fun so it's like a turn it's like a tournament but you just keep going until there's one thing instead of one later on you know so before the end you can get lots of there's lots of times you know i feel like chess is a fun thing but it's not really confident right now um but with chess you can also do like again another tournament with the grand master where he comes around and plays like there's like a 14 year old boy here in the area that not at all beach but he knows he just got his grandmaster i think that would be fun to like play against elementary you know stuff like that but it's all future stuff i think you should tackle it to your picnic and make that good okay make that big and do a really big fundraiser then so everyone's going to come out it's free we're spending money on it already and we're going to collect some money on which is all going back into everything that we're doing now how would we get that information even like when we did the things with the place we didn't have a way to go on the door how could we get that information out like you're not supposed to it's a code not they did available it get finalized and they did it the other night the other night the neon lights are coming is it what what is it going to be what's the board it's going to be electronic good i'm sorry the guy that gave us the design to he's going to update it a little bit but we had a little smart nose yeah it was all over the place and some council members for a while wanted like we had which that's i told him the other night at the meeting that my suggestion is to do this we don't need to do half and half no because that was another thought so it was unanimous so we're going forward okay okay all right on that well it has to go to bid and that's usually out 30 days and then oh we're still getting it out yeah you have to bid it because it's it's 30 plus thousand okay so we're months away but the survey we're getting ready to do the mailing for the people that didn't we we sent it out electronically to the people that were on our what i call our old constant contact list and i think 82 people out of that list filled it out and another 30 maybe and filled it out so we're going to delete those people from the mailing so we don't send it to them twice and we're going to mail to all the property addresses so you have the mail on the list huh plus you're printing you know we've done like little postcards for some things at times so you know doing something like that if you can take you know you don't need to mail this you can take this and make it [Applause] this same effect okay so are you you're good i'm yeah um i did you put this bleach clean up at ice cream social or saturday i like it i did okay so and the boat crate indian rocks each let's do it at the same time so we've got two different lists here one is the event calendar and the events have to be voted on by council so events would be and that's what like the first thing okay like if you look and i kind of mixed them all together i shouldn't have but so the halloween costume parade um dog costume parade sorry like for saturday october 30th that would be something that we would have to prevent present to the council like it will do it all at once and they would vote on it the bow parade would be another the lighting of the christmas tree and the holiday social would be another the garage sale april november would be one and no the garage sales bradshaw if we can decide on that list of five or six things i will present asked if i can present it at next month's council meeting so we can get those dates locked in and we know that those are on board if we're going to do a one-and-done cpr class a one-and-done paint class those don't have to be approved but like the events that we're talking where we invite everyone in the city not just if like 15 people want to go to a painting the sunset on the beach class so that's the distinction between our two lists so that's what we're gonna why don't we vote on that first because it's a shorter list and we need to submit it for next month's meeting so if you just look i think it's kind of split up between two pages starting at the bottom the um lynn and i kind of talked about this when i first started because like there's more dogs in this town than there is kids and like i put my dog in a hot dog costume and ran around the block and no no parade you know so it's like i think if like we did a little it's and no one got to see no one got to see her and she was happy because she was embarrassed like i think that would be something that a lot of people would think that you could bring your kids and i we've done them in our old town and people love it i mean this this party train was like a mile long and like you just have like um someone in orange vest in the front and maybe one in the middle and one at the end to kind of guide along the path that you know is preset and then you just come back and you know you have an ice cream social or whatever we do we can work out the details later but we need to get the dates and the actual event locked down so i think those were the five that we've kind of been looking at the halloween dog costume parade the christmas tree lighting and social that we tried to do this past december but we just didn't have enough time so we definitely want to get it on the list for 2021 the may picnic in the park and we can do april or may it doesn't matter i just know that the garage sale is already in april so i thought that's why we would shoot for bang to kind of separate them out a little bit and then um the boat parade being the same day as indian rock's beach does there so if you guys can just kind of read through those and like any comments or changes suggestions okay so i guess i need to make a motion to approve these four events that we're going to present to council can i refer so deb is and then normal second everyone in favor aye aye everyone's in favor sorry forgot to pass the others um okay and then the second and i will do my little spiel because i did do some research but i kind of put everything in line on the same not the calendar but the typewritten page so i started with the you know we can call it whatever i call the bellar beach family picnic i just throughout the date of may 15th that's saturday in the middle of the month jazz in the park but i went through and there were a ton of cute little you know not the first time this has been done so there were tons of cute little postcards with jasmine park family picnic you know so there were lots of little options to pick from but it would this was my thoughts and if anybody has like changes additions if you want to go a completely different direction but so everybody to be covered friendly can bring their own picnic lunch their you know their chairs their blanket their chicken skillet um and it's b wyomi if you want to have a glass of wine we're not gonna serve liquor um we would provide desserts and to be covered friendly i did some research on like things that we could like so if we have a table set up people just come up and you know whatever i want a brownie a cookie or a cupcake and then we're not giving out plates or it's all finger desserts and then we take the reserves and they're beverages everything's bottled you know behind us in coolers of ice and you know like so it's a bottle or a can as opposed to us doing you know like you see those big infusion jars with lemonade and iced tea it's so much more cost effective but we can't do that right now and and i know lynn has talked before like oh yeah we can just grow you know hamburgers but that was pre-coping and i don't think may is going to be enough time for us to actually serve with food and when people don't want to eat it but that was just my thought so i'm like open to suggestions um so the jazz band that i heard at ours the new orleans style restaurant that's new in turkey springs so i called him i spoke to the head guy for five musicians for three hours for a new orleans style jazz and they all dress up alike and they've got the trump phones and the saxophones they sing and they were excellent for three hours at 625 so it's basically 125 bucks a person and i thought that was pretty reasonable um i already talked about the desserts and the non-alcoholic and then i did a little research too um i came to these guys but like so i found real close to us so they just started making these um they have three three styles so you have like the jeep with a surfboard you have some palm trees on another one and you have a turtle on another one and they have all different kinds of tank tops and all different kinds of t-shirts the first thing i ask him is i'm like uh where'd you get that date he goes um they're all made up so it says sand key was established and they made up the date and i said well can you get the date fixed by may he said yes and then he said if a guy wants this one they can take off the flowers so what i thought we could do is you know we have a table set up and we have one example of each of the iron arms um in a tank top and a t-shirt in all the different colors that they have and they will sell them for ten dollars and i'm gonna try to work them down at eight but for right now i thought ten dollars was really reasonable and then like so we'll sell the ones that we have and i'll just you know we could pay for those obviously when i get them but then we would take orders and so it's like you know we take their ten dollars write down their name and phone number then i would go or we would go somebody would go place the order it's literally two miles down the road and then we would just bring them back here they can come up with city hall but that was just yeah um you know it would have their name on it and you know whatever they could give their size it would just be a quick little sheet i want a white tank top with a turtle you know and longer or whatever the case may be and then they also had the stickers so i always i have um i don't know if you guys have noticed i put them because you know you see them for everything but i heart i never saw anywhere for um here so i bought one for everybody what i was gonna do is just like buy those in advance you're gonna stick it on your forehead buy those in advance and then if we don't sell them i think they i think i bought these two for five bucks um just ask them if like you know i have to stack this tall left you know i just returned but we aren't gonna pre-order i mean this is if you guys want to do this but i thought like i've always wanted like a cute little shirt with feller beach and i just never seen them anywhere and i think for 10 bucks i think they might go i mean we could get kids sizes i didn't say that kid sizes and adult cycles so and they have all kinds of baby stuff too like onesies i just this probably won't fit on that but like we'll see if they can he has the ability to order a decal so i will ask the question if we can get them to fit kids or babies like kind of size it down because he has time to do that um oh and then i thought you know i know here they have like the bellar beach with the logo with the shell so we would put some of those on the table too because like sometimes people just don't come in here so they might not even know that they're available yeah i had these made probably 15 years ago cute it looks like it's in really good shape pardon me it's in really good shape well i i ordered about a dozen okay that's his 11th one okay so you trade them out but i just thought it would be cute to have a table of themes with our city's name and like the cute little because if people buy those every time we go on vacations but you know how you have to buy the belair beach sticker for your car well it's i know you do it all here it's all computerized [Music] you gotta have your driver's license or registration if you're if you rent you got to have your lease that's it's too yeah but i feel like we could have that information there like don't you want that like you want the shirt i want the sticker well i always get the stickers but like you literally because she's got this little machine that she literally types your license plate into so like it's it's nothing that we could do out there okay uh well yeah yeah well it's just an information literally like a poster and how to do it where to go to get your sugar yeah um yeah and then like i was just thinking like and then this my list was much shorter than nora's but like we need to like an activity list like with games for kids that can include any of the stuff that you mentioned like and i'm trying to think of new orleans like when i i've only been there once but there are tons of people like doing face painting and you know those caricatures where like they draw like a like if you could get like an artist and they do them in like 10 minutes and they don't look a thing like you but they're fun and whatever it's just a thought we can do whatever activities that we want but i didn't know if we wanted to totally go overboard with the new orleans theme or just kind of have the music and the name and i think the music made and we can throw it on them that are going to be code friendly at the time characters i'm sorry you have to pay the city for if someone comes and like the person that comes and does like the little painting thing okay so that's the the other thing that we have to talk about so our budget and correct me if i'm wrong our board's budget for the year is six thousand dollars and that's already been approved so like we can decide like i would like to put a budget together that we try to target and if we end up going 200 over we're not going to sweat it but like you know knowing that the you know the music is going to be the biggest expense i think and i think that you know the desserts are obviously the second um and then we see where that lands and then if you want to because i think it would be kind of cool if like um i i don't know if that would be something that like where someone would pay for their sketch like you would anywhere else or if we do for free so we could we would have to figure out like if we could pay that person just like the band would you charge x amount an hour and they just do as many drawings as they can so that i didn't know where to start to research like where to find that person and i literally was at the new produce market down on golf on my bike in this van it was a one of those mobile caterers for desserts and i looked high and low online i could not find it was a lady's name could not find it so like i i know that'll be more expensive to have like a dessert new truck come you know then they would have it all individually wrapped and they would make it you know we would have to go to publix and ask them here's my case of containers can you individually wrap everything for us about what we did for the police um and i forget the name of the restaurant they did a lovely job yeah wasn't it yes and what did you think yeah though they were they really accommodated us jody's the one that went and picked it up and dealt with it yeah if you can get the names yeah we would love for them to work and it's not selling it like we would be pre-buying everything and they would be giving it out oh yeah we're providing the drinks i mean at least we're not providing lunch i thought we should provide something okay so i got desserts and drinks i mean unless you guys i mean i don't i really did we're not providing food like typically everything no i i'm wrong yeah and this this uh restaurant i mean they did they went above and beyond as far as accommodating us to the price point um because we get the uh place so you don't remember the name and i meant to call jody's separate now i'll get it tonight tomorrow yeah well that's a detailed thing i just thought i mean if i think if we can't provide food we just need somebody to pre-package and just say oh i want a brownie oh i want a cookie oh and here we go no no i know it's it's not but i also did like the i went to something where they were trying to like individually wrap the desserts and they got those brown pastry bags good that's costly back and it's not individually wrapped that's perfect where'd you get um because we are asking them to bring their own lunch which i kind of prefer and i would definitely prefer to bring my own mind what's good about that is if you're diabetic and you need some sugar there you go we're offering that drinking group hydrated and sugar for your diabetic yeah it's something that we're saying hey thank you for coming here you go um so we need to decide on really the only thing we need to decide on today is do we just have to decide on any good today the budget and the numbers i have six thousand dollars for the entire year that's the christmas lighting that's that's everything the boat parade is no cost to us right yeah well well if you want to give some kind of prize or something because they do give prizes in their lives i can tell you that fundraiser yeah they do give they give prizes that's so um well let's talk about what we think is a reasonable budget for the picnic because i think that's going to be the biggest expense of like the dog costume parade is going to cost nothing and your suggestion of two thousand dollars there's two thousand dollars you couldn't play starter we can move it up or down this seems like the biggest event yeah that we have so like in the most costly 2000s give it a third because when if we don't spend it we lose it right it doesn't fall over no it don't work it doesn't roll okay so um christmas lightning was still i mean not social it's a social we'll still provide like tea coffee cycles let's see everything that is well at this point we would have 2 000 for the picnic 2 000 for like the vote parade which we may not need and then 2 000 for the christmas social which i feel like we should take away a little bit from the boat right now yeah i love the boat parade i want taco to you know i think uh that's more of an individual cosplay that's great um and move it to where move it to like some some smaller employee we've already gone through all that i tried what explained that so it would have to be a city employee if we are hiring somebody and offering free like if i'm paying a call to just tennis i'd give her 100 bucks let's say and i invite the community to come up for you it's it's kind of touchy because it's a great area why what's good well it's it's mainly things like workings comp and things like that if they're an independent contractor then they've got to provide insurance they've got it there's there's all of this stuff it's got a it's kind of intermixed and what tammy asked about was could the city pay five dollars of a ten dollar fee now we uh uh help you out spell out the problem well what what's the worst case scenario what what's what are we able well first of all you wouldn't pay for uh if you hired someone and they just came and did it yeah one time that's a different story that's what i mean okay i'm talking about every like everyday classes no no i'm talking about like this tennis knockout and then warm up with a pro kind of thing or a yoga on the beach just provided by or kayaking but not every saturday kayak it's just come out this one time or whatever it is right then then you would do it as an independent we'd do it as an independent contract okay so we'll just um i think we should do a prize for the dog prize for the vote that a little bit should go there and then three votes on the dogs charlie wins no louie we're having people who don't own dogs vote all right so those are just pictures post on facebook tack something on can we just like submit it to the council like what you mean add another event i think she's talking about a smaller yeah those don't have to be approved if you're talking about things like if you want to do we'll say rent a tenor tennis instructor for two hours or something that's an independent contractor they they we would we could pay for that two-hour thing but they wouldn't charge the people that came to them right okay but that's not an event that's an activity that's a one-and-done and it's not it's only a small group of people will come not an event for it's more like a class yeah i was saying like the big events i need to get approved by council because we need to like give them time so if we wanted to talk they'll approve them pretty fast yeah if we wanted to tap something out of the developer okay so then i will like that was just my the jazz in the park picnic and then like for my suggestions and they're already on there so like um if you look at the calendar i just kind of typed with an example this could change like depending on what we vote on but i was just showing you an example of like the first week um so beach boot camp like i said the instructor that i found is available monday wednesday at four o'clock is ten dollars in class um deb already went through hers and it's on here if you see it each yoga meditation 8 30 tuesday thursday at 9 30 on saturday all ages and then um so i'm still waiting to find out because there was a yoga instructor cheryl who has done yoga in this room for a while cope with that she's not calling candy no we know he knows yeah so they they've reached out to her several times um and if she ends up like we haven't filled anybody in her time slot or nor have we put anybody back in the building so she comes back around and she does something you just don't um and then my other suggestion which wouldn't be for now because it's too cold is the stand up have a word yoga and then he would do lessons and he's already done the lessons here before and my husband and i did it with our neighbor and her husband and that was really cool but um he does have an instructor that will do and it's not like crazy stuff where you're standing on your bed on a paddle board and i'm saying you're not you're you might do a downward dog would be the biggest balancing thing that you would do but we would do it right up here so if you follow him it's up to your face or whatever so those were just the things oh and then the other one that's mine are already on the list anyway so the painting with the twist so it's for this is like a one and done i think he does it like once a month but if we just did it with elmer beach and he said okay we want to shoot for one class march 5th i don't even know what day the week that is but um for three hours everything included unless you want to bring your own food and drinks but everything being the chair the easel the paint everything is included for 45 and it's for three hours and then he sets up like right now we could go and sign up and do it on 22nd street because he he has a minimum of 12 people so if we can't get 12 people in bellaire beach to pre-sign up and pay and say they're going to go and there's only like four and then those four people can move it on so does that make sense say again if you can't get 12 then we'll do what we'll just join in speech class because he's already set up there and he does um he's got a website and a calendar and just all that information exercise online and pay online and just show up but that's a one and done kind of like the cpr or i mean we could do it like maybe once a quarter i don't think people are going to want to do that so i guess what we need to do now is taking out the activities we need to vote on the ones that we want to start with for first quarter does that make sense so it can be um i'm perfectly fine with us just going okay who wants to do this and raise you know your hand and then we kind of do the ones with the most votes or if anybody has another suggestion um for this quarter the boot camp and the yoga instructor can literally start next week if we want them to um i don't have dates nailed down with anybody else because i wasn't you know they know it's pending they know what's being voted out so i just wanted to get availability pricing you know and you know time slots just so people know so if everybody just will take a minute and go through the list and like maybe put a star or however you want to mark it by the five we want to start with and we'll see if we kind of have a consensus and we'll just go with those so please okay the bridge [Music] um are you guys ready yeah okay so um all right i'm just gonna go down the list and then like make little tallies um anybody to start january with standard pepper yoga no it's too cold okay paint and wine paint with a twist on the beach okay so we have one i'm gonna go for that yes to everybody yeah okay okay um outdoor music or movies at city hall i didn't do any research on that so i does anybody want we didn't have to do a drive up there i don't know like i would think that would be something that we have to move down the road to like do the research wait till it's a little bit more where you can do a big projection screen yeah on the lawn okay again a lot of this stuff is so great so just think about like you don't necessarily have to you don't have to you don't have to do it but just think of like the group as a whole like i know when the lady in harvard loves posted on next-door neighbor does anyone enjoy a the book club 700 people she literally turned it off and like people were going how could i never hear back from you how come no one ever because like there were so many people that wanted to do the book club and she wanted to max it out with like 15 people so like you may not want to do the book club but i'm just think about the bigger picture that you're voting sure so jeff is voting for the book club is anybody else a book that book club no one knits i can guarantee it maybe two people but um pickleball club we can't really do this one right now because the tennis courts are being refinished anyway right right exactly so that's moving down the road okay spanish lessons we haven't talked about does anybody want to do spanish lessons in january no grasses no okay how about bingo where are we gonna do it yeah okay forward arrow forward okay couch to 5k training anyone anyone no what is that i mean honestly i have an app on my phone through audible like it just starts you off with the you know run walk it tell them how many miles to do yeah and it builds you up to your fight okay from from nothing from the couch so all right walk the bridge with cop what do i think the town would like just right now so we have three for beachbody okay beach yoga and meditation and the great thing with that one is i don't know we kind of talked about a little bit but like say if um cheryl does her yoga class in this room and she's been doing it she knows that twenty-five percent of the money that she collects for her class gets paid together with the beach um the two instructors that are doing it on the beach and they're not using building utilities bathrooms they're using nothing of the city they can go on our calendar but they don't have to pay a city 25 so like say tara who's doing the class for four or five dollars you know for her to have to pay the city to like you know she's sitting down there every day anyway doing it she's just basically inviting people to join her um at an affordable price so they don't have to pay just so you guys know and like if we look but like the paddleboard guy when he's done it before what he asked for was a flat flat rate so like say he does three classes a week when it gets warmer two's yoga and one's a lesson he only does lessons like once a month and the rest is yoga whatever it may be he has to pay a flat hundred fifty dollars which to me seems kind of like if he only has two people show up he's actually losing money depending on what he's charging so i was surprised he asked for that but i think that's what he does with clearwater beach but you know everyone's got their own little thing i think he'd be better off paying 25 but the two yoga beach people don't have to do that but we do you have to decide which beach we're going to use um for the beach event at some point um okay so chess club anyone block chessboard i don't think right now okay bridge club we've already got a bridge club so that was gonna stay on there same thing with the garden club i think i wrote that on there they're already pre-existing so they're definitely on there um knitting or crochet class we can wait to do it did you say wait to do it um that's um okay cheryl's already like established so if she wants to come back she's on there um we never talked about this one but i do have an instructor i just don't have pricing so i have done this but i did like a two-month thing i would do a one done and it would have to be covered self defense class was awesome um and he will do like a three hour uh but we'll move back this is another one and done oh actually i think the first saturday of every month it could be whatever but a beach cleanup and ice cream social like for the kids it's cute okay so you don't want that are you already doing that okay so we have five now i'm already doing it jet ski rentals i think we should push forward because it's too cold i do have someone for that but i called you not really you've never called me back but i did find a mobile company um jewelry making there's island white keys like and children just to get together here okay so we will put that on the counter that could just be like a or we can okay who votes for jewelry making we've been doing jewelry making should we do like a one thing i just don't know okay let's do more research on that one you really i don't i don't i don't know enough to vote um kayak and ecotours is actually the same guy that does the stand-up board classes so he has paddle boards for rent and kayaks and he does like an eco tour out of the round i don't know what he's saying there's a bird i don't know what he does but it's not for now um cpr class i'm for that for january i don't know if it's for january because like we need more time we need to do research on there what about the red cross blood drive because they can come right here in the parking lot right lynn so we got five on that um we need to do more research on the tech before i've fallen and i can't put it so yeah yeah okay are you guys looking at me okay photography do you need to get more redone like info on that like availability yeah there were a number of people i mean if there were people who truly wanted okay who is in favor to do photography on january okay so um looking at this so the paint with the twist the wine class that was unanimous so i'm going to call him and get a date and then we'll put it on the calendar does everybody go with that um book club it was four out of five like my question for that one is i don't mind putting it on but like are you gonna leave it you need someone that's just guaranteed to be there every time will you be the leader i don't i've never done it and i'll help you the lady house had never done one before either honestly like women show up and they'll tell you how it's supposed to go yes that's the issue where are we gonna meet no okay we go to um the first time we went to a party across the street and then now we've been meeting at mike's pizza like outside is this ginormous table and we're all like this um and really no one's like how it goes um so yeah that might be one that like we all like voted on or four people voted on it but like it's too close [Music] the questions but just for you after you read your book i just can't commit everything else no that's totally fine so we're going to move book club out like up a little bit okay so um walk the bridges was 5 so that is definitely gonna go on there um each boot camp was three out of five so that's on there right um beach yoga four out of five so that's on there um bridge club is already on garden club is already on tennis lessons or the knockout tournament i know that's what we've done but that um that will go on there so we need to do a little bit more research because i don't know a tennis pro i keep trying to get the guy that teaches right in brown park enemy and rock speech oh i feel like and then cheryl where she's pending um and then the beach clean up and ice cream social like then that will definitely go on there we just have to do i just put first saturday of the month that's obviously not locked in so we just need to take that and put it on there and then the red cross um blood drive needs to go up give you like a 20 amazon card or a movie theater ticket without this happening they always do something but i bet should they find their own you just need to set it up good so we've literally got one two three eight well i circled nine but i was kind of like differentiating the ones that are kind of like um is is everybody happy with this format for calendar yeah i wish this could come to my mailbox i guess oh you're at home for everybody for the community these are the activities you know i know i know yeah we're here to it's basically going to be word of mouth and the um we'll post the calendar up like from show that come in what we can also do is post them on those boards like in the parks right and then we can um what i was thinking what i would do is literally like so i have a couple of friends um they're actually the wives of my my husband's golf guys whatever they live down at this end so i was gonna like give just one to each of them and go tell all the ladies that you talked to in your neighborhood because there's like what six or seven of us at harbor drive and like i could very early first avenue just like in our second album in our little pocket where you could just go and i mean that's how i got more i went and knocked down a door and said hey sunday morning i told you though i said go get her she'll be down so that's how i was thinking because a lot of these things we don't need 50 people okay um our son buys this house well we already voted on everything so we're just going to do a wrap up and um thank you for understanding okay oh yay where uh saint pete he wants us to move there too but she's not going anywhere we're signing bye thank you okay so everybody's okay with this format or yeah okay so i'm hoping i'll ask patty or maybe you know like i'm gonna type in everything that we just voted on and then patty can email it out to everybody and then the two gentlemen aren't here tonight that they'll see it because we we have enough people to pass this stuff without work correct okay um and then the few things that we need a little bit more research on like if it was your gig like if you could get a date nailed down at the red cross the dates that i suggested and times for to walk the bridge if you look at it on the calendar this is just me making stuff up so we can totally change it so on tuesday from 10 a.m and then you walk the bridge and you go get coffee and then on thursday i put 5 pm and you go off the bridge you can go get a glass of wine and you don't have to do either of those things you know you can just walk the bridge and come home or whatever but if there's a group of people and you know you're obviously in the social distance and do all that stuff you're supposed to do you got to bring your mask and your you know your little purse or your pocket or whatever so when you go in to get whatever you're going to get to drink if you choose to do that you know there'll be people that want to do that people that want to split up or whatever but i will do both of those like um and i know everybody raised their hands so um are you guys okay with those dates and time should we start with that or do you want to switch to something else so 10 a.m on a tuesday and 5 p.m what you could sit outside a filipino they have to die at least think about that they have tables at both places to sit outside and people have their dog clothes so do those times work for everybody and you could do one or the other or neither like nobody's tied into this stuff do you want to switch over break it up a little bit or you want to keep it tight do you want them two days apart from each other or do you want to push one a week later or something oh i was just thinking like to offer it twice a week and then if you can only go once sure then you know what i mean you could go to one or the other or either but i thought i'd do one in the morning for the people that work from home or whatever the case would be and then one after you out at five so if they work or whatever um okay so the boot camp said the yoga and meditation is set um i'm going to call and get a date for the paint and wine and see if we can get 12 people to sign up for that um again that one's going to be a word of mouth like me just asking people who just asking people and then saying this is the website and that's how we're going to start it until we convince we will put it on next door neighbor we can work on the facebook page i know deb has i'm not on it but there is a bellar beach facebook page that you have to be invited to and there's a group of them so if we put those two things on that it's gonna get way more people than you can pass it out to you so we do have some avenues to get it to people it's just not we don't have we have to wait for them to get the avenue for everybody because we can't spend 500 on a mailer every time we want them not every time just to get everyone to go on the website and let them know that it is and that's what they're doing like yeah we're trying to collect because we had a constant contact list of 475 i think it was yeah and probably 150 of them live here the other because what they used to do they used to come in here and if you walked in the building for anything you want information on the city sign this so they just built this list and why don't we just mail out to the existing addresses well that's that's right right so what we're doing the communications committee developed this survey that we're going to send out to the rest of the residents to see if they even want to be contacted because in the past that has been an issue as an example i sent them an email to the 115 people that undergrounded down on 22nd street 10 of them wanted to be contacted i sent them a letter and 10 of them responded with i would like to have information on the updates so you in the big picture you may get 250 people out of the whole city that wants the information and the same person that said don't contact me is the same person that put on an extra neighbor app we have a parks and recreation department in eleanor beach like and this was like the whole fiesta that i don't really know about him before but so it's kind of like a tightrope of you know they don't want to be inundated they don't want a bunch of text messages and phone calls but like if like you said it was like hey just a please look online the bellar beach website because there's all these activities and things to do that are new check it out and see and then if they if they're not interested in even that then forget it yeah yeah that that's pretty much you know i've lived here 22 years so at times we had really good things and then at other times we used to have a picnic every month at morgan park in the evening first couple times it was several people one monday but then nobody came and the parks and rec group did that and they finally just said hey why are we doing this once a month i think this is a vacation town so people are here six and six up north or somewhere you know so it's not consistency at all yeah small community inconsistency yeah people tell me every day well i didn't know about that i had an individual tell me he didn't know i was charging an assessment or underground it literally says on the website from bella beach it says fitness classes coming so all we would have to put is fitness classes and activities right and then just fill them in it's already set up on the website we just have to get it and anything we post on there can be transferred to a facebook page we have yeah so it's already done like those oh so we just let the communication board know and i think no no it's posted yeah so that that the structure is already kind of set up for us to slide it in you'll have to start from scratch so that's good just getting people sometimes to well we have a lot of hits on our website but we don't know who they are you know i mean even tara the yoga instructor she's like don't worry about advertising people see you walking down the sidewalk with your yoga mat they're going to ask you where you're going and how much it costs and what time it is and it'll grow that way so all right um so we have the four dates that i will absolutely put on the agenda of the next council meeting to see if we can get those passed and then we have like our five or six things that will go on the calendar every week and then we have two or three things we need to lock in dates um i actually like until the council approves the may 15th day for the picnic i can't really lock in the band but he's like we really have very few things in the afternoon all in the evening so he's like you're pretty much if you want us on a saturday afternoon in april or may we're pretty much open for that um so and then the other thing if everybody's good with it once because we already voted on it in past once i get a paint and one class date from the instructor and once i get um a red cross date then i'll just call um patty and i'll have her update those i'll update the calendar and send it to her what about simon i don't know like i know for like so the jazz band plays at that restaurant for sunday crunch and that's how i saw that okay yeah so i mean i don't know if they'd even be available that's probably why i did not think about it but it doesn't matter i mean that's the following question from the bridge where's our star oh it was just we would leave right out right here okay yeah and there's more details obviously than this but i just thought if we got the basics like chosen then we can just kind of fill in um like i i don't if we can talk about it but i don't you don't really need to vote on where we need right okay so we'll just all those little details like we'll just go in and we can adjust them as it goes if we need to whatever so um okay cool i oh and the last thing on that kyle this is just a request for you like say before the picnic the picnic gets approved it's may 15 like it obviously i'm assuming we can use the tables but i don't know if we have lemons like you know tablecloths to put over it or coolers like or i didn't know if i had to drag our yetis out of the garage and i mean like i don't know what we have and what we need to get bag bar or steel i don't want to go buy a bunch of stuff i want to just see for drinks for drinks and like tables and we don't need a lot the tables are no but what we've done is use plastic disposable they're like 12 bucks on amazon and the plastic blow away they're open and they look terrible yeah i know but no we don't have any paper balls but that's what we've done or because these are plastic we don't even put a different cloth because they're worshipping but yeah but okay so no tablecloths how about coolers coolers don't worry about we can get yeah okay so you have tables no coolers can anybody think of anything we're gonna try not to do silverware not do napkins not do it's like here's your cookies here's your drink like we don't utensils and stuff like that like they should pack napkins in there they need basket cartridge garbage bags we have like recycling you have okay well there's three garbage cans here what kind of garbage do you have just like a plastic or a vane wire this is just plastic so we can eliminate water yeah because see we don't clear that perfectly you have to understand you know because i know a couple times we talked about recycling the parts but we don't have that capability here to do that and the trash company is not going to do that oh well how do they pick up our recycle that's you individually no they won't pick it up individually you know it's residential versus business yeah see now we have a single recycling thing that we put newspaper and bottles in and that's what they pick up from us but they don't go out you know in like parks and stuff and the experience having been in that business for a long time the parks it you never end up with anything recyclable because somebody will throw food in it and then it's contaminated and then we'll take it what what if we took our i have two recycle bins no no i'm not saying what i'm saying is you can put a recycle bin out there yeah someone's gonna throw through but it's gonna end up contaminated because because somebody will throw at your home it's a little different story you're you're paying attention johnny is not going to pay attention he's going to say oh well there's a can there even if it's green or you know whatever it is he's going to throw something in it and then it are you nominating yourself yeah you that that's what you would have to do to to do it um i think i would do the honor system on it and see how it goes but here's the thing what am i going to do with that we a 50-gallon garbage can that's a recycling can that we put stuff in for city hall okay but what i'm saying when you put it out to the public the experience that i've had with it even though you say this is recycling and this is triad what does your container look like what does your 50 container look like it's a green trash can wheels it's not the circular with the smaller circular that's not a problem depends they can't even get them to put in a green and blue bag like it's a professional golf tournament there's a green bag with the recycling thing on top of it and a blue bag and guess what's in both of them hamburgers sodas uh whatever you want but we can put a couple of cans out to say recycle yeah i mean you know what it doesn't hurt to try it looks like we're yeah so okay all right i just wanted to know what we have and then um all right so i'm just gonna do [Music] i know an overall and everything i just want to make sure everybody is good with what we just voted on so can i have a motion to pass everything that we just talked about for the activity calendar nora [Music] okay and then the last is just all of your business does anybody have anything else that they want to talk about or ask a question or if we pull them back over there should we do you guys want to do a fundraising thing with them what you think they might shut down the whole fitbit i don't think so but i don't i mean you just never know like i i hope not because we're going to try to do as socially distanced as possible and we're going to try to follow like i would say if it's lunch like twelve to three is that i guess the people is that what time were your old picnics they were midday so that's why i got 12 and lunch and then if they have something that they have scheduled at night they still have time to like so then for sure we won't get shut down right um okay i don't think you have to worry about getting approved it'll get approved okay but yeah and then we can work out all that what we're gonna have to do is like set some coolers what we'll do is a work session yeah like uh that we work out that we only do you know we do our little checklist and make sure because just to make sure it goes as seamless as possible that day and like try not to forget anything or you know and just get bodies in the park to kind of i have an odd question have you ever put a plaque on a picnic bench that is that um it's like plastic wood um what do we have the park bench is made out of plastic board yeah can you drill it into this i can't remember yeah it's just like lumber it's lumber but it's recycled all right i say we sell those blacks on the chairs in the different parks we can launch if once we get our like tax exempt we can launch that whole program so usually we do it together no one's going to want to do it but we have to think about how long you know term all the details sounds good um so any other business anybody anybody go on the edge are we ready to adjourn"
