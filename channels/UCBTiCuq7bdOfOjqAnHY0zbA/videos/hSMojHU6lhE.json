    "transcript": "all right so five o'clock here on Tuesday March 21st uh call order this year Bellaire Beach audit committee meeting and [Music] um a first call for approval of the agenda make a motion to improve and your job Elliott yeah okay one one t okay all in favor aye aye give me a post it's about the second order is to elect the audit committee chair so this is something that hey says we have to do every year so I've done it happy to keep doing it oh great I nominate you a second he smart about this stuff I accept all there all right and then if everybody have a chance to read the minutes for April 12th uh audit committee meeting from last year yeah I just have one question was there an earlier March meeting like we're having now no the audit was late last year okay it actually uh the April the first meeting in April was to go over the potential budget it was the preliminary budget and then the June meeting was where we actually went over the audit so we're three months ahead this year with the audit I wonder okay any questions with the April 12 minutes but I got a motion to approval I so move second all in favor aye video posts and then the June 13th minutes all in favor all right any opposed okay that is approved so now we move on to to review and accept the draft of the annual comprehensive financial report for the fiscal year ended September 30th 2022. [Music] or take questions from everybody so then uh it's a March council meeting we had the Auditors saw March show up and give a presentation on this draft and to this point we are missing two elements of of the audit which is one of the statistical section and then the other is the certificate of achievement for excellence from the government Finance Officers Association which we achieve every year we've had it since 2016. um what was the first one is a statistical section that we're still waiting on so um which might be kind of important right yeah sure I mean there is a miscellaneous statistical data I'm audited that's how it was different four blank pages same information not available yes but it will be yes I will say okay and submitted so if we don't know exactly when that will come in so we can ask for an extension  that's what I want to do or can we approve what we have and then not issue acceptance of this until we get the rest of it um we make any sense to do that or no um just hold off if we want to wait for the data um there's a lot of information yeah but I think we can review anyway so at this meeting we can review what we have and then we could set aside a date because then um worse comes to worse because we can't find out exactly when they're going to issue these Awards if we don't get it um Peters prepared a placeholder until we do get it just saying that you know we intend on getting it and we can submit it as is um so we can start with a one-month extension to put in so that hopefully by April we have the the data statistics what does salt marsh think don't have the data is it they they who put the I believe it comes uh I believe they said they're away from the county for it but let me check up on that so if that's something we want to wait for I'll find out more of a timetable but we'll at least get the extension past March because the regular clock here is two by the end of March okay yeah so I would recommend getting a 30-day extension um to receive the statistical data as well as the uh hopefully the award for the award um but in the meantime we could talk about you because there's a couple things that I've got notes on that need to be cleaned up okay before it can be published I had just a general question Kyle oh Ryan you'll know this right away too it when it's published it's published by what means it's kept in file available to whomever or is it sent to the Florida government or what's the age step it's officially submitted um but I mean once once we submit then it's on that is our copy on record for the submitted to the State of Florida yeah right yeah yeah so that's okay on our website oh yeah so it would be a PDF that they could review yeah all of the few prior artists a website it's all part of that and I have to ask you how you get to it because it's not so well it's under it's a website it's under finance and it is probably reports or I'm trying to remember but I found it well you're shorter than I am I've done that a couple times it's in the most nothing's where you'd think it was going to be not intuitive yeah right did you have any other did you go through do you have any questions on it well I mean I I don't know how how much of the weeds you want to get into um you mentioned management and purp for an outsider looking at I mean I could guess who management it is and say who management is in the reports because I it signed it by you Kyle understand that and yes are you the treasurer I'm sorry no I am not Tim Hollick I was on the uh Tom Elliott citizen advisory committee um so uh can that be clarified anywhere or is that too obvious I think it's a standard obviously as a banker you know all these audits always say management so whether it's a corporate management or this is the city management I think that's just that fasby or a gap phrase that's used I don't think they ever spell out I I've never seen a comfortable law background so I'm going to say words have meaning and I'm just trying to figure out who's responsible uh ultimately if it's the city council and manager uh could eventually or whatever if it's changing the the usual I don't want to do that but I just try to I think it's you know according to Gap is how that's okay yeah it's just sorry I didn't hear what the terminology was just the management is used in here but it's never defined as who is management yeah I mean an ordinary the leaders of the organization yeah it's pretty common term as you said in audit reports the management those who run the city basically I mean I if it's set out management means and then it's never mentioned again except it's not like in a loan agreement where it's defined oh great yeah all right yeah yes all right uh the uh well for what it's worth a page uh Roman numeral double High there is I believe you wanted to assert a um [Applause] you wanted to insert uh this is on a transmittal letter um oh no uh four at uh Roman numeral four uh the one two three third paragraph uh penultimate line in that paragraph the city has decided utilize it you need a 2-to there right yep okay sorry I didn't pick I just thought I'd figure you want it to be perfect so and I've always been puzzled by the statement we have no commercial businesses located within the city when I drive past the motel am I missing something here or hmm yeah you're beating a dead horse that's always my question it's not a commercial business um it is but the city doesn't have it really any commercial Revenue right email it just has that one Resort hotel right and there's others further down there further towards the the Auditors for whatever reason just don't see it because we don't have land use and Zoning for some for a hotel or commercial it's considered they're all considered condos um even though they rent like hotels yeah and even the motel I was told that people own a group an individual or groups of those rooms and they participate in the rental amount through the manager of that place which which made us like having time shares yeah yeah yeah operating like a hotel and it's all one family yeah the final registration rates actually spelled out um individual units or if you own 15 units because they are great so it actually kind of like allows for that in the code okay um whether or not it's a well obviously I'm looking at the weeds here so I I but it's it's a and we always pops right out new eyes everywhere that's why we are not receiving any yeah operating like a hotel from visitor philosophy or anything like that the other question here Kyle when when you go through the statistical uh section and it's all 10-year look back and we say it's unaudited are those ever audited they were audited in the past but those schedules are like they didn't go review them again today but those are they're just pulling that schedule forward from the prior years all right I mean is it any when you say I honored it bells and whistles go off or are you talking about like these schedules like the number of police uh well for example I mean I start to page uh 49 go to 83 from Johnny went ahead here but I just look at that so that's just the historical right I realized that and it said on audited you have to even specify because on audited as I say alert you to wait a minute it hasn't been you know checked through a professional Auditor in the in that fiscal year period I assume it was audited right yeah probably just by a different auditor that's why they won't represent the difference you're right yeah yeah yes they're just trying to say we didn't audit this stuff this was all done in-house so so we had our own Finance officer that was employed by the city including Outsource made all these reports right no did the previous yeah the previous reports until when did we make that change a couple years ago salt marsh has been probably well we just renewed the contract last year so this is probably the fourth year I think probably it was when I think it was the last year of Joe's terms mayor that we switched first year yeah first yeah or was it the first year first things we did yeah and we never used an outside auditor prior to that right yeah so who I I had the impression that the treasurer and new Kyle got together and printed all this out that isn't the way it worked how did the how does it all do yeah it's compiled by prior uh audit reports so salt water sticks about the whole report itself oh you know when you get into all of the financials Heather works with Saul Marsh Financial Consultant that we contract as well okay and then salt marshes and she prepares it yeah so she prepares our regular financials okay and then she gives salt marsh access thank you I appreciate it it's not as Loose as it appears thank you that's all right you have any comments or you know I didn't actually use a fine tooth coming to look for every anything in there I I looked to see that the numbers and the columns made sense and it looked like there wasn't any gross errors in it but there I'm sure there's a lot of things that um could be addressed since we're taking the time to do this anyway so to make it more most presentable product that we can but I don't have any um critiquing comments about the way it was constructed or put together misspelled words or run on sentences oh yeah like a couple that's flag five items here but I'm sure there are some for sure well we identified a couple sub repeated last one they repeated it this year did they repeat the millage no no they fixed that one but it it y'all get uh the salt marsh bag uh brought it up in the meeting but it's on uh page 23. so it's about after expenditures there's a line that says deficiency of revenues and that should be excess of revenues over expenditures okay so the good news is is the city you know was a positive 1.1 million dollars in cash flow if you will for the year but they're just used to always being a deficiency so which ties back to my like questions and my earn more from a budgeting standpoint I'm going okay uh we've got some overage and excess and um just in the beginning the general activities and it talks about some of those overages and stuff like that but that I think more for my the revenues were five hundred and six thousand dollars higher than expected expenses were lower than expected so we end up with the 600 000. what are we doing with that money you know that was mine underground issues and things we want to do and that was going to be a question to Kyle when it comes to budgeting but yeah uh so you get that on page 23 22. okay page 23 and what are we doing here deficiency of Revenue you should read uh excess of revenues over expense expenditures excess of revenues but they they did the Bellevue Estates bot issue they put Series 2014 a b and c so it should be 2018. yes uh under long-term debt second paragraph s yeah uh 14 15. so the second paragraph it starts during fiscal year 2018. the revenue bonds should be series 2018 a 2018. well not if you consider when we started the project yeah it was 2014. exactly get a sharp eye Kyle I got a question of page 48. so all the amortization of the truest debt for 2023 they show 120 000 in principle but I thought it was 160. I thought every year was 160. yeah it shouldn't be every year 160. so they need to change that so unless they're counting the pit are they counting the same period it's only a portion of the Year 23 is only important 26 ends that year yeah so it's 40 000 a quarter so like yeah that's your 120 through September so for the remaining is that but this is as of September 30th 2022 through September 30th 2023 it should be 160 000. oh that means for four years ending September 30th 2023 . yeah so that would be this year you could just ask them okay that make yeah it makes sense because can we go back to 14 yeah yeah if you need to be 2018 hey okay it's just questionable for the 2023 and 2026 add to 160. it's not that just put stuff yeah it's just points it at all so it would have been like so it was a 20-year Bond so the first bot first year of the bond would have been 140. got it but yeah we're in the the state 20-year bond that was we're winding down okay that's why the 40s there at the end yes got it okay the only other comment I had was on page 44 [Applause] and this is really part of the presentation of that salt marsh brought up and so you know Kyle I don't know if you guys have thought about this so on accounts receivable when you read accounts receivable underneath it says receivable for the general fund include 196 915 from a resident of the city for code violations for failure to meet construction schedule timelines so he made a big Point multiple times in his presentation that this is a material change it it it's it's not material to the outgoing operations of the city but it's a material event for receivables if we're gonna write any of this down or take a reserve right so uh I didn't understand how I mean I get the difference but I don't know how that how we represent that accurately in the finance that's the whole thing right so if you if you go all right well we'll we'll we'll write out 20 well then the resident knows hey well then that's their starting point right yeah right so the reality would be is if we get down the road and we do agree to a 20 discount so let's call it 40 Grand at some point that 40 Grand will come off of the earnings so I still don't think a two hundred thousand dollars even if you wrote the whole thing off is a material change to the city where we've got you know six billion dollar cash balance yeah well from a number standpoint it isn't but from a parent's standpoint just as you said it is so maybe we should put that into a fund or something that can be adjusted and not a not declare it as a definite receivable a variable receivable of some sort uh with a plus or minus you know I don't know what the accounting isn't growing well we've been we've said to let a collection letter correct it's accruing yes so yeah we have leads in place yeah there are Lanes of place but we've here still it goes to a zero property value every year becomes less of a percentage but you know the there's going to be a way to handle it without it being receivable and without playing our cars that we might let the guy off the hook you know because we wanted to finish his house so why don't we call it something else I'd rather see it come into the budget as an overage then have to pay it back mentally or or subtract it from the budget afterwards um I mean there's no such thing as anticipated Revenue that is adjustable that's a good point mark so at some point so then they had to accrued it to an income yeah and to make it a receivable exactly was that because we started leaning the property for it is that because we build them forward and now it's ridiculated yeah and there's a lien on it too so we have to actually forgive that lien there's a legal process to go in and lower the amount or amend it or whatever we have to do it's all um all of that is visually handled but we're not doing a very good job of representing it in the budget so it's it you as you put it's not really substantial to the operating budget of the city so maybe we don't include it as a receivable but as um I'm lost to figure that out but but I mean it's a concern that someone's going to read it and figure out that they're not we're not going to get this and they're just going to not pay it they're looking for the concern of salt marsh in their presentation is that um if we do discount it in the future it'll be you know a material from their perspective of material impact because of our past performance has been to significantly be discounted right they they're saying and they're going in saying well I don't think we ever had anything yeah we have not this big not this big they've never gone below 50 percent um and that was for circumstances but they've never been where I propose a possible discount and the feeling was no because of the history of the case and this is this is a case he's blatantly been told and not caring for a long time he builds a house and then he wants a an exception to put his pool in the front yard yeah my neighbor down the street buddy um George he was he was given an extension he was given a further extension due to the covet um yeah still couldn't stick to a schedule and they're both without a contractor right so it was in the yard was unkempt in disrepair and the neighbors had to live with that for years I can't even remember how many years it's been going on and it's still yeah it's the third anniversary I think this spring they're fine I remember speaking in front of the uh board about him morning of variants who could have the more space in the backyard and then for the pool so you can ask for that after you build the house in that before can you see the plans right right if he takes us to court and we I mean do we have to include anticipation of um yeah so that's what and I guess that's what we're all saying is that this we know it's not going to be any higher than what this number is but it could be considerably lower than what this number is or the the or the expense to get the money could be greater than we anticipate that being which means the bottom line our receivables are going to be lower than we so we will train in the report this must be this year event right where we issued the liens for 196. I think they got the threshold this whole year I think the I don't know what the threshold was but he said given the circumstances of the amount that it changed what it was it changed what it was it would not file a lien before I think he just was doing I believe we've had leaves since I'd say like ten twenty thousand dollars you know just to make sure that there was something right recorded property taxes are still being paid it's smart there I think so or no and he's still building he doesn't you know you got another one situation too on 21st Street 103. the one that they bought the house and they tore it up inside they wanted to redo the plumbing and everything and tore the floor out then they plant these fruit trees in the front yard and then let the weeds grow I reported it and then it got cleared and yet the patio stones are still sitting out there and now they got like Plumbing pipes for showers or whatever out there that has been an eyesore since the day they moved into the house bought it it still is was there a Target here so uh anyone have a suggestion as to how to deal with it so if we would say why don't we go back to the accounts so to cook you know they're the ones that raised the concern that it's not really Revenue it's expected Revenue collect on it right it's less than likely you're going to click they have a recommended yeah uh right I think it was he was inquiring if um if we had full intention of collecting yeah we do and and that speaks to the point in business if you have full intention of collecting it but circumstances mean that you're not going to be able to collect the whole thing then it changes what what it's called right so and that's okay I I guess but he didn't I guess they they didn't want to say that it's put in there at the amount of the lean and that we know we're never going to get the full amount and then that's the point that the auditor is going you know it's got to be portrayed a little differently well when I read this void of the auditor's opinion I highlighted this and said we'll never collect this and I those were kind of my own notes to myself these notes you see are before the auditors so we'll show it a billion won excess it wouldn't hurt to take a hundred thousand or the whole two hundred thousand dollar hit did not well but then back to you the point that we lose it loses its meaning right in these in the population the residents that that we're going to enforce these codes so well maybe we asked salt marsh for some uh guidance well guidance but then so what if we don't take a discount and then next year you know he wants to settle up and we have to we take you know 75 cents or 50 cents on the dollar right how does that change the financials what would they do what what would be the material issue and couldn't we just put an asterisk next to that Revenue piece and then if if and when it did change we could just footnote that there's an exception because it was abated so it's not like a but it's going to be after it's not like a quality of earnings where you do the ad back this is an audit so uh yeah but well this was in 2021 right so that's probably when they recognize the revenue was in 2021 when this fine was issued and then they pull it to accounts receivable right it looks science is growing it's still growing but you know what would happen is it would have to charge that debt expense if they wrote this off basically yeah so this was right it's great this allowance it doesn't an allowance doesn't necessarily mean you're not going to collect it it's a conservative way of kind of pulling it off your accounts receivable it'll hit bad debt expense which should in theory hit your Revenue in some way when you say allowance is that portrayed is going to be a deficit it just means that the possibility collection is is not good okay well we don't know for certain and we never yeah we don't know that but that's I think I I think you have that discussion with them I mean what you know when Banks make loans um there's a good percentage of those ones that are never gonna it wasn't that opinion what is it called pretty small two percent two point three percent is your bad debt Reserve we just like most businesses you know Manufacturing Company all have so we could allow set up a reserve in our accounts to deal with that it doesn't remove the accounts receivable off the book so no it does not right it does not if you would create the alarm for uncollected fines and it's it's an it's a number saying Hey um but you have to put a value right so we could say um this revenue is 400 000 request auditor okay to provide guidance on uh on the accounts receivable to do it so we don't get at some point someone from year to year is going to say well this Revenue in this category in regards to the lien by 100 in regards to the uh How does it go down if it's a five page okay that sounds good so it's like having a bad debt line basically or yeah allow us for bad debt yeah I don't know what else and you can offset fifty percent scrap metal yeah [Laughter] that's foreign the assessed evaluation mileage and tax levied didn't have that I was kind of curious what that was um that was on page 71. I'm curious one that was pretty big Joe yeah I know I yeah I know I was looking at that it was a huge jump [Applause] World property 72. yeah the real property values [Applause] oh maybe it's just curious the 10 people that were the principal taxpayers were interesting to me like I don't know any of them who is that I just know that the Joel Berry is a guy that used to be Radke's old house so Radke's house was the most expensive tax assessment value 10 years ago yeah I don't know what houses they are so I have no idea um I think those were my questions were more about you know budgeting and moving forward and I you know it's a good exercise as we move into the budget cycle um you have Heather coming to this council meeting I have to speak on it from what I can tell you want to kind of feel out um why um we can't tighten up what our revenues are in the budget years we seem to be over collecting yeah we seem to have a lot of excess every year 380 000 500 000. there's a lot of excess that you know in the scheme of it it's not a very big budget that seems like a lot of money yeah but these are such unusual times for a multitude of reasons you know odds are not going to be right this is the majority of the driver though it's like we played for Capital expenditures it store water you know it it seems like the last two years they've all gotten pushed back so we plan to spend that money still sitting there in reserve I'm saying this is undesignated funds 506 35 000 this year it has to be that and and the thing is like when Lynn was here oh well we're just going to use that money to buy a piece of equipment or something and I'm like well no because we have all these unfinished projects that probably we should look at rather than buying I just want to make sure we're planning that through and not you know that those are my big concerns because it's every tax year every year we have this excess and then there's it just kind of goes oh well we need that money over here let's just plug it in well we could we could investigate what the last three years reason was for that and then maybe we can adjust our thought process there was a lot of padding in each department for the expenses and we were coming away under budget it was pretty brutal last budget year of Terror some of the the wish list just like oh what what's 50 000 for this well just in case they'll take it out yeah oh yeah yeah and I think that was because of the previous years yeah and I want the underground project done and I'm like going there's you know there's a lot there seems to be a lot of excess left every year that could go plug into the underground rather than being spent on a piece of equipment we had to buy 10 10 years from now we're doing with the storm water from here and put it where the most important thing and figure out how to get the other stuff and by the way did that pass yeah the financing yeah all done I mean no well it's uh passed the workshop yesterday it's going to go to council for reading and then it'll close first week of April that's great that's terrible it's still the same yeah good that's good work yeah you guys such a good job at that thank you one thing I was curious about on the uh on page 23 you know I think this kind of goes to your point that sure so far 242 000 ahead of what we had planned I don't know if that was I mean it's a pretty big 50 of what our budget was we collected obviously a lot more on the revenue line there I didn't know if there was something unique about that or it's a pretty big number there was a parking yeah the charge for services and I think that's part of your question with the excess it's a big portion halfway down under the revenues and you know if there's maybe there's a footnote in there I didn't see it but it could be in here that I feel like we had I have dancers thank you some kind of new but that's a lot of money where the services I mean and all together a 625 is awesome right yeah that could put a dent in a project I don't know what it was okay so you had it that close but this is just current here it's the utility services tax that we collect so the percentages that we're getting from the utility but that's above if you will see go down two all right okay oh this is our um uh the OCC garbage collection a lot mowing claim on these parking permits  meter piece so meters is a big chunk and this uh the building did it building rattle in there too no I don't know it's a lot of parking yeah [Laughter] so we don't know what that is no it's this right here so garbage collection should be a wash it's been we try to avoid that the actual number is seven hundred thousand dollars parking permits parking meter fee is oh that's proposed actual it's 172 thousand dollars we're doubling the parking fee this year so 172 of that number is probably parking yes did we it's on um next door our parking fees went up but yet you can still Park free down there what's wrong with IRB right yeah I've been too busy doing my my veteran service stuff and and I just saw the come up on the email account and say I'll read it later but I saw that the title of it is aren't you moving to Park Mobile too yes yeah that that is a great way because you can do variable based pricing right on the weekends yeah let's just raise it up holidays raise it up and then you know Mondays knock it down yeah that's pretty good the holiday is a big one right yeah yeah holidays yeah yeah the holidays are tough to maneuver that spring break hey Rob I don't want to forget you do you have any questions no I mean I had a couple of the same ones that you guys raised but nothing other than that all right good dude we'll be interesting to hear what your solution is I would tribute that uh lean and money this over the city yeah I think the best is Let's go ask salt bars yeah you need to create an account an allowance for an alpha look out and you know what do they recommend what do other cities do for this it might be something we have to propose to the council yeah because I know you know the chances of us collecting it all are pretty slim but at the same time I feel I don't know how the Council of the body feels about forgiving my or my intentionally yeah that's the case I'm the bleeding heart on the council right now when it comes to this stuff and uh yeah they've been tough they have been really tough about it but the amount has mounts haven't been that significant this is um and the point that bugs me about this is that the assumption that I'm never going to pay this and that no one ever pays is exactly what you know they're charged or anything it's not good because as you see the result is the neighborhood lives under those circumstances for as long as the homeowner wants to the neighbors want it doubled well I think there's a way to get it outside my windows there's a simple way to get an answer to that about worrying about if we take this wait a minute if we take this resident to court based on history the our City attorney might be able to tell us without spending a lot of time on it what the history is when entities take somebody to court for things like this what are the odds of winning versus losing well the special Masters all already given us the favor that's why we've linked well you got okay so you got that on our side but the judge always says you guys need to work it out just come back in the afternoon he missed his uh 30 days to appeal that magistration that's still many aside sorry about that but the point is if if there's no Co into anything with the house right that's when everything's gonna blow off yeah exactly can't turn the power off it's still under construction where is it uh one 103 25th no the court is 25th is hibiscus oh I know exactly we're talking about yeah yeah too many other thoughts are uh no I didn't I mean it's kind of my first time through yeah it's quite voluminous yeah yeah yeah it could be a test tomorrow right and then their management letters probably they they directed us to that they just say you know review that and that gives you a quick understanding of it yeah so a kid it's an unified opinion which is uh what it used to be called the unqualified opinion so it's the best rating they can give Heather does continues to do a great job I appreciate all she does and I think as we go to the budget this year you the five years of projection she did for us for the most issue as well I think I saw you I saw you like we've been asking for projection for years so all I could see was we were running out of money at some point this this money wasn't gonna last project uh so we will uh we will submit these questions at combeds and we'll get back together with the statistical uh vital data is to give a file approval so we're going to ask for the extension I plan on getting the statistical days and hopefully the award for the award I don't see it as being a major issue right if we get a favorable response from the accountants as to how to handle this you can resolve that at the same time and get it all done yeah so there's nothing we could do down there because we've already asked for the uh we're not going to accept at this point are we yeah wouldn't make sense since we're asking for information yeah right okay yeah all right and we apply the resolution we have to have at least two meetings which two museums yeah and two meetings on the budget probably not part of the year but I guess we could be because we're planning on reviewing the budget yeah so we don't want to do an audit review and a budget review so uh maybe we'll have a third or maybe we'll get just sure so we make sure it's right but I don't I think we all don't feel it we can accept the budget today because it's not complete no I agree number five you can't on the agenda we can't meet number five correct I'm going to cross out where she's put acceptance here because we're not accepting it right any other General business for the audit committee I have nothing to adjourn okay okay I'm motion Tom second okay all a favor bye great"
