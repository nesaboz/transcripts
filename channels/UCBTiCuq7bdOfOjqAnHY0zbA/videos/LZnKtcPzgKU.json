    "transcript": "okay i would like to call to order the meeting of miller feller beach parks and recreation tuesday march 16th at three o'clock secretary shot could you please call the roll okay danny lavender chair yes yeah george ortel vice chair rick shock secretary absolutely um okay perfect um so number one item on the agenda is the approval of today's agenda do i have a motion i have a motion thank you can you have a second okay any discussion when it passes um is lincoln no no okay [Applause] okay and then the second item on the agenda is um i thought this was next month but um april but the nomination of election of officers so the chairperson vice chair and secretary my understanding knows that kids voted every april so maybe we're just just to talk about at this meeting yeah i can check out that okay yeah yeah so the one that we did for us three was just like contemporary based on circumstances and so um my understanding talking to patty with that was just she sent out an email and then we mention it and talk about it today just to let everybody know how it works and what the opportunity is and then we vote on it next month it was my understanding but he's going to check that out and i can explain it to kelly and to nicole when they get here next time if we vote next time but basically it's like you can either nominate yourself you can nominate someone else and then we vote on it like we do anything else and then the third we'll go back to number two when he's done but the number three item is approval of the february 10th sign okay when she gets here because she did the meeting that's the last two times i'm so her name's on here you could probably stop oh it says right here in april it says april yeah i think we were just kind of supposed to mention it so everyone knows that it's coming up to vote on chairperson assistant chair and secretaries typically in april so yes since they're not here um do you have to be here to vote yeah okay and then the fourth item on our agenda today is citizen comments do we have any citizen comments today i have it's market it just kept yeah there was some thought about cutting him off to three minutes if he showed up today but he didn't show up today but i totally agree with you he doubled the length of the meeting which information sometimes is good information but we literally adjourned and he talked for another 20 minutes um so like is there anything we can do to get that under control yes because is i agree yeah okay that's fine i hate to cut people off and sometimes they need five minutes not three so i hate for it to be so cut and dry but i agree that last feeding went past the point and in the discussion panel that's worth me just kind of joined his own comments and questionnaires it just seems like if we want to have a citizen like comments that's fine and but then they should go back to their seat that's it i talked to patty about it like as we were setting up this meeting everything that you just said i said to her and we discussed it and she said it's because he's on the board and i did you know like i'm relatively new and i don't want to step on anyone's toes so i didn't want but i totally agree with you and i understand that i know how to take care of that i just um in a flight way i will do it and it's not just horrible yeah because we're such a smaller group and we typically don't have a lot of citizens but he did just kind of join in and do and i understand your point so we can take care of that i can add just something to that too and you answer it by saying you know how to handle that and i'm absolutely sure that with your compassion and kindness you can handle it beautifully but it's a good thing you brought it up not only because it affects the time we're here but um the squad out there as soon as we start planning events stand by because you're gonna we're gonna have a parade of people in here complaining and moaning and whining and um so it's it's good that we have a plan to deal with that yes even after the council has approved it they're going to come in here and they're going to lie like a bunch of babies about how oh my god the public's going to come to bel air beach i mean when i think we should offer more water and say welcome and are we interested in purchasing a home in delaware beach i mean how often does this happen but we need to be prepared this is going to happen right absolutely and you know my cell phone number is on the website so that's like i have been getting some phone calls not a time but as soon as something gets on the calendar like where it's visible to people in maps i agree and it's good that we see i guess for me just to take that one step further i need to like if i have one person telling me this is the way it works and then i have another person telling me this is the way it works i don't want to get in the middle of that that is not my job it may not be my job at all after next month but it's going to be somebody's job and i you know you can only have one you know like you can't have two different people with authority over you telling you this is the way it goes and this is the way it goes there needs to be one way that it goes in one person without it coming back if i you know what i mean like we do what one person says and not the other there needs to be some agreement and this isn't honestly that big of a deal we're not talking about fifty thousand dollars being spent we're not but it's like you know like the budget for example i was told from the get-go from lynn that we have an approved budget that is up to our discretion to you know to events and so then when i get up in front of city council and they're like you're pre-approved you bring back your budget and we'll let you know if we approve it and i'm standing there going but that's not how it works but i don't say that because i don't you could tell there was some tension and every person that was going back and forth somewhere and i am not getting in the middle of that right so no they're definitely some very strong factions um and some quite frankly combative relationships and i don't want to be a part of either side i really don't i just want to have a like a nice event i want people to play nice if you know if we were trying to spend a ton of money or we needed like something where you know people should truly get emotionally involved like you know we need to be safe and we need to do the right thing i'm not saying that like so there were some very good points and um and things that you know whatever but you know i just need to know and feel strong or just not meet us as a group that like if we spend a couple hours and we can make a decision on something and we say this is what's going to happen and you know noor is in charge of this and you're in charge of it then we all know that it's taken care of and then we're not going to go to the next council meeting and have four people go no when we've been told that no this is already pre-approved you can do it so i'm still a little gray in that area well i'll just say you know i mean george has been doing more than i have but i had one about based on the fact but i thought you handed yourself beautifully i thought you took some unfair shots and you handled it with incredible grace i was i was like she's she's she is sharp lady i think we have to remember and i think the only lesson that really came out of that in black and white is when we present something like we just you know remember in the future to present a tentative budget and that's it they approve it and they then it's good to go and then the citizens show up you know how do you want to handle that give them three or five minutes and then let them speak and say okay thank you very much we've heard you uh this event has been approved by the city council if you have an issue with that i recommend you contact our city council members directly and we move on with our marching orders okay let's come around here stir the pot we've seen that well that's fine january using the rest no it's good and i haven't been a part of that yet at all and you know so it's i'm glad we're talking about it okay so we're good on citizen conference okay number five so the bellar beaches is another thing that happened on by the earlier today so the we love our city donation program for the non-for-profit so lynn gave me a packet and everything that we need to fill out but we can't do it within this group there needs to be a whole new committee formed yes and so i had a question and i was going to send you an email but i thought i'd wait till today you know the advisory council that they're putting together now do you think it could be a part of that group or do we need to have a third group formed because i think somewhere in the middle of that like people aren't beating down the doors to join these committees and i just thought if we could that's why i tried to attach it to the garden club who already had one if we have to form a third group to do this not for profit and we have to put it on the board and it can't just be all of us again because i can guarantee that all of us are going to sign up for another you know i don't think it can be what it can't do i know it can't it's got to be a different yeah can it be some dupes or no he said it had to be a different company oh he must have okay i was under the impression it could have been the same uh yeah i thought that it had to be different and that's why i thought you must have verified that hoping there could be the advisory council because they really don't have to do anything it would just be literally like yeah something handed to them well they'd be it'd be a separate organization they would be yeah yes so i was wondering if the the non-for-profit could go under them and then we could just put you know the email or the with the website with the program on it and then well i think you perform the not for profit anyone can be on that board it's not anything it's not official with the city it's separate completely i i've never heard that you couldn't be involved in bold could we could you check on that yeah that was my understanding of glenn was that it had it couldn't be us it had to be somebody else yeah i mean it can't be us in entirety in other words we can't double on that but i don't think buddy will check out something members of us so if you just say if we filled out all the paperwork and say like it was the four of us in this room and those two weren't on it and that would be fine um because it's an opera not-for-profit organization that is it's separate so i never heard that there would be an issue um because you're only you're forming it for the tax purposes so i i just it just doesn't sound right to me but i'll check i don't know well that's why i was confused and why we just couldn't fill it up and do it like we had kind of been talking about i think because we're part of the city this community they can be so we can be they but they can't be us [Laughter] i think that's probably summarized yeah yeah because i i feel like that would have to be a city rule saying i don't i just i've never heard that so that's what i'll check okay if we can double check on it and then um does anyone want to volunteer to be the lead person on the paperwork for that i've never done it before but i can certainly help okay i appreciate that but like okay so i guess my understanding is foggy too like so if if nora takes the paperwork and she calls me for help is that illegal i feel like you oh don't we have a lawyer on and process it yeah you need to have a lawyer actually no this is supposed to be city law you're supposed to be completely separate yeah it's not so is that even the city why can you support this it's the goal around for having that i guess it's for the tax purposes but it's not it's supposed to be separate it needs to be separate from the city so i cannot utilize the i don't know that's what he's going to find out for us yeah i'll start doing research on this everything i heard i've never done one but it's all the information's probably online laid out so i'll start researching yeah but from everyone that i've ever heard who has experience with it says it's really not too much to it okay so but it just yeah there was just a little confusion on being a separate group okay and so that's why i didn't know like if we can do it and still be considered a separate group now does anybody have any other questions on that so that's just kind of pending like that because i didn't i thought another committee had to form my understanding and if i'm wrong i or a different group has to it wouldn't be out of anything to do with the city like a committee or anything like that it would be a group of people if anything doing their own organization and then they're that way they can collect the money take the donations and then they can choose to use the money any way they want or you know donate it to the city so it isn't actually something like a program we can post on the city website either i mean that's where i got the idea was looking about 20 cities websites so i know it happens well yeah if they were if they're the ones handling the money and the donations and all that and then they turn around and they can donate to the city but it just frees up a lot of regulations doing it that way since the um how it works you know i asked that in the very beginning yeah from day one i said why can't we just attach it to the garden club well not necessarily attachment but if you wanted to build it just go through there i'll just see how they said that how the garden club is not a city to sponsor the committee his entire so they're citizens but they're not affiliated with the city it would just be like if my neighbors all got together and said we're going to form a bunko club that's right they're a gardening club so like the bunko club isn't affiliated with the city either but somehow they just i think they might be why would they have to set up a 501c3 for their donations to detect that so like you know the benches the garden club donated i think they same idea they just are like not affiliated with the city they just live in the city they'll also have a lot more flexibility with the money that gets donated than the city does well like you're like um yeah i know i don't know if they were part of the setup process but i could ask them okay yeah or even if we could just piggyback onto them and not start i think that would be ideal um oh wow i don't know who's in charge right now um it's kind of like you haven't heard from since yeah but it you know i used to it kind of switches you know a year later who's in charge but they you know when they need to have meetings and things like that they make requests so i could follow up with the last person that i was dealing with okay and then see who's who's in charge now so we'll do a little bit more research on that and um they would probably i mean if it's you know the idea is solid and they've done some things they i would think they'd only be happy to increase the donation i don't mind going to their next garden they haven't had one in like a year in a year and a half you know what if i can find out a name and a phone number yeah i can get you something the last time i was dealing with them they donated the you know planners and the benches so they they you know we were uh we were going to purchase them because we have to purchase them and then they were giving us a check put back into the general fund that's how it worked perfect okay so we'll just see what happens and see if we can move forward with this because it's a good idea and it's like obviously we love the stuff that they're doing we just want to do a little bit more of it and do a little bit of a variety it would just be like if no one minds that it's being donated in the name of the garden club or if we just ask because it really can't be donated um through parks and rec anyway is what it sounds like it would have to be a civic organization we're not doing anything differently we'll just ask for their help with the paperwork well yeah walk around on about like fourth between fourth and finally she's always outside she's always up for a chat and that's right all right well good well hopefully like we can get that taken care of and move forward with it soon um okay so number six on the agenda is the activity calendar and the recap and event date review does anybody have anything they'd like to talk about with the activity calendar there's been a couple of changes but it's going pretty well obviously it's just not getting warm the first month it was slow because they didn't hit any of the temperatures for the classes i did the stand-up paddleboard yoga class like not this past sunday with a sunday before and she had three different classes so she just she it's all on the website but she does it two days a week tuesday at 5 30 and sunday at 10 a.m um every week and then there's stand-up paddleboard lessons i think once a month on a saturday or sunday so yeah so she has her own advertising too so it doesn't have to be people looking up the bell or beach website i still think we obviously will continue to have some communication issues unless nicole or somebody on our group literally sits there every day and post it on bellar beach resident's facebook page and even then it's only hitting a couple of hundred people not the whole you know i'm not on it but i mean i just know about it but there's not a lot of people that are on it we're having trouble getting these things out to people and it's going to just continue to be an issue until we have you know a way to communicate a little bit better meaning a mailer and then actually the last meeting was a whole issue of the sign out here and it was made very clear that people want to be communicated to or with by email and that's right back to that same old problem is how did we collect emails we talked about we come in to get stickers ask for their email people say no one wants they don't want the email so it isn't just a challenge um as to how we communicate so i don't know what the i think they were sent back to i think lynn was going to investigate it another no there was a portable sign they were looking to right electronic that was like an alternative culture for emergencies oh that's only highway signs okay what is the latest they're going to do a survey to the contacts that we now have to feel out do people want to follow things what do they want yeah so there might not be a sign at all well it took what type of sign it might be the old school lettering sign probably not that it was it was it was it seems like most people agree that science needed you know they'll get to identify the building um but it could be just a monument sign that says communities for information information besides that yeah all over nextdoor.com yeah buyer for that i don't live here which is really very on top but um it was this portable sign which i don't understand why i mean anytime anyone saw one of those signs on like boulevard they did that for i don't know like a week like not to honk or something that doesn't look yeah and now they're voting to have that you know as it's permanent no we're not permanent well what are we gonna do with it what yeah just take it out every time the idea was like so we had something for when they're doing evacuations or hurricanes state of emergency you know it's for an emergency situation yeah kind of like when colgate was starting on the beach issue and then he found us a sign that they put out so it's it's slow but growing i guess is my only point because we have communication issues but like i said my numbers on the website i mean we kind of went through that two or three pages of events i think we just should continue to try to grow what we have um and then maybe add some more down the line as it gets warmer or people start like asking for things but just kind of continue to grow what we have and then as far as the events um so may 15th is coming up fast so we have to decide with the jazz in the park if we want to postpone it to the fall when everyone has been able to have their copic shots i'm assuming it's going to be open to everybody by then and there can be no talk that i went to jazz in the park and i got covered because you know it's still around and i get that and um and then maybe things will calm down a little bit by then but i just wanted some feedback because that was kind of as people were saying i can't guarantee i'll be there i'm not sure if i'll be in town i might be able to help that day that's when i started panicking because i'm like i can't commit to this with me and like one or you know one or two other people it's too big of an event even if we just like have music and water oh and the t-shirts kyle went thankfully and he went and placed an order of just a start-off order of 60 t-shirts mix and match women's events and then he did the you know the stickers you see on everyone's cars you know the one i like on the water bottles big ones and small he ordered those and some bella beach koozies i took your exact list okay perfect so i took it down there and they said they'd get on it and it shouldn't take too long but i haven't heard back yet so as soon as i hear back okay we'll pick them up and pay for it and say anything about the minimum count so i'll just see what remember you said you might have to add more so if they just make what you had and give us the prices i'll probably just take that for now okay and just like obviously is this just bel air beach swag is that what we're saying yeah just like the hacks and the other stuff yeah we're gonna have more things available for sale yes okay so and then i was hoping we weren't going to because like say they sell them two for 24 or two for 25 bucks they sold the men's t-shirts with the decal they sold them to us for eight dollars so like i don't know like are you guys going to decide the prices or do we have any input on the prices um you have input it's lint's um decision to make i don't think he's trying to you know price gouge it i guess i'll take a bunch of money i could see just like a dollar or two maybe added ten bucks like an even ten bucks or something yeah yeah because i think the women's tank tops were nine dollars and the women's t-shirts of the men's t-shirts were eight dollars um and they didn't give any deal at all on the stickers what they charge there is what they charged us um but the koozies he did give us a break so anyway okay i figured it was lens but i didn't know if he wanted yeah i just was hoping he wouldn't charge so that's why do we know what the cost is going to be the total cost uh products just approximately for and then that 350 should come right back sure like one itself it should be a wash but we were talking about why would we wait until the picnic especially when the picnic may have been postponed a little bit like post coping if you know people come in here we're trying to get them to come in and get their boot stickers and right now all that's back there is a hat and people i know are making up their own like i mean i've seen them yeah you start wearing them or just start talking about them and sit and get them here yeah and you could definitely post them on the monthly like yeah yeah but i'm like we really didn't have a reason to wait like it wasn't like a big deal and then we don't have to we don't have to have somebody behind a table trying to sell them and show them to people and like i think we should put them on the market as soon as possible yeah they should be done this week so yeah perfect um so is there any more discussion on the date of the jazz in the park i would love somebody's feedback other than my own thoughts i think your suggestions in a group setting well i got mixed feelings about the whole thing i mean i'm i'm old enough to get my shot at my first shot governor desantis has said by one day they're going to be open up to everybody i mean nobody really knows you're saying everyone might have to be revaccinated at the end of the year anyway so you know i mean i'm all about airing on the side of safety but we can ride this train as far as we want i know i mean i'm george i'm not being my humble opinion code has become an excuse not for people not to do things they don't want to do they want to go to the bars restaurants you know the bars in the restaurant they don't want to see their in-laws they it's covered i mean so i don't think we can be i don't think we can be sued it's an outdoor event um i mean my goodness but i'll go with whatever the consensus is oh no and me too like i am not like saying let's push it back like we are um i literally have to make the phone call he told me they were available i just wanted to have one more meeting with um and just get everyone's and to make sure that we have enough people to and i have actually had like um there was a guy he lives kind of near us and he posted on next door neighbor and he actually came down for one of the tuesday walks and he volunteered to help us with the picnic so like i and i actually think i have a friend from book club she will also she lives on 12th street i think or no 22nd she will help us with the big thing i think we can get like if one or two of us aren't available i think we can get other people to help there's if all we do is pass out water and like have you know there's not going to be a whole lot of working stations since it's kind of like a bring your own lunch and beverages so i don't really think there's it just needs to be mad for lack of a better word it just means it can't just be like oh we're going to have some musicians out there and then like eventually i mean like someone has to be here that knows what's going on or to direct people or say oh yeah the recycle's over there or whatever the cape heart you know like we'll have assistance with the parking i was told there is a schematic for parking based on events that were supposed to happen last year with the limited parking that we have yeah we did a whole bunch of diagrams so we we don't have that already people were asking for that um and then i think i said i think i sent lyndon an email about and this was previous about um if we would have city staff accessible to help us like you know set things up but if we don't sell things we don't have tables except we'll need one table and that's it that's the two second setup like this really is should be a no-brainer i feel like it's being made into something bigger than it is which is the part that's kind of scared not scaring me um causing me the furthest you can walk take an uber i mean i just think it's becoming you think uh the rolling stones are coming to town or something um i mean it's just i i don't know i think before though we need to get wins i don't know when the next session is i don't know can they vote on issues and work sessions i don't think they can they cannot they cannot because we can agree here and then i pretty much guarantee you that that group up there is going to say it's too early too early in the year too early in the year so they gave us a chance we do all the work now and then it goes up in april whatever it is well we're not talking until may and this video says okay but i think when we get too excited we put that data up there and see if they'll even even go for that see i thought they already gave us the approval on that date at that meeting i thought they said come back with the rest of the information i might be wrong but um so you think they'll well the idea but okay the date i thought i think you will get canceled i think they're going to say it's too early it covered and well that's what my fear was too but then they'd say it's too early and so that's why i wanted to bring it up and like you know if we are not doing the boat parade because we don't have a captain or anybody that really can take the lead on that and it's also to be very expensive like the captain i can guarantee you isn't going to do it for less than a thousand or more now i've heard that said before i don't know where that comes from i happen to be a captain myself and well i don't know all the fingers that i mean i just don't know i mean i could probably learn and the captain is not responsible for what happens on somebody else's vote yeah i don't know where all this is coming from and i could be wrong but i mean this is a voluntary thing if people want to go out and run the boat up and down the canals um you know it should be see how the captain is responsible for feminine damage as a vote i mean you're ultimately responsible as the captain of your ship the captain goes the wrong way and you follow that's on you it's not on the captain no i understand that so you don't think it's that big of a deal i remember the former chairman talking about all that money but whoever that's a ridiculous amount of money for three hours working happens to be paid anywhere i know i mean i hired i mean you know a lot would be 75 an hour i just had one charge me a hundred dollars an hour to sit in my kitchen okay so that i know like and it was just with one person he wasn't like i know you say they're not responsible but he's leading them that's what he's been paid to do so for him to do something stupid and for people to think oh god he sounds so stupid i won't follow him it's you know that's why we're paying them so they they can't call them safely i don't know enough about the legalities of it but i mean what happens when people crash into a city wall or they crash into each other that's their own that's their own deal i think um i'm sure that they have their own liability insurance like personally kind of like all of our instructors um okay i mean i don't know i i love good christmas go parade don't get me wrong like i i'm not trying to squish it i just want to be i need to find someone that will be able to say hey this is how this works because you know like because i know the captain has a meeting with everybody involved everybody has to sign like liability waivers i know this is what clearwater does okay and then people will still jump in and go oh i'm going to be in it but i'm not going to any of the meetings like they make people go to meetings for safety for the route for the times this is how we get everybody in order like it's a thing like and it's not just like one one day three hour thing this is like a big commitment and i think that's why you're paying the money um it's not a three-hour event it's like a big you know it's bigger than that it may not be that big but it's i know it's more time consuming than just that day just so people know what they're doing and have an idea and just like the whole chaotic organization of getting people in line and like getting them to stay in the channels i think is the big yeah so that's why i like they don't want us to piggyback which is fine and i understand that um and we would be going indian rocks the council spoke to it that this has been this is the first time that this has been brought up or addressed or researched no well i'm kind of hoping that like i'm not the only one doing all the research on all these projects because like you know i'll pick up do that i'll do that yeah take i'll take that on yeah okay thank you um it's not just somebody within the city that's kind of new and drugs clearwater beach yeah it's like an official event and those are two separate ones it's not the same boats going so every boat that i'm seeing in indian rocks that's the only one i see my sister looks like you know and those are all generally people that live in indian rocks or you know i honestly don't i wonder if it's kind of the same people if you're decorating your boat you might jump into the clearwater next one sure you know yeah beach treasure island yeah you know i don't know we'll get everybody and i'm sure that those are going to be priority because they're already doing it and it's much bigger than ours but i think it'd be fun to i just don't i can't i think i can like that i mean this would be but to your initial point as far as where are people going to view it this is challenging water here at low tide a lot of boats can't get through here but i mean this would be the logical place where people could view it it came around through there and it was like you said where am i going to view it i don't live on the water how am i going to see it unless i'm gather under the causeway here at the boat ramp something like that and then move over there that's probably what you can do yeah and that's what i'll find i'll find out make sure about that price and all the details about that okay yeah and i would like someone who has experienced the done not i mean you can you know if you throw out that kind of money you can be like oh i'll learn how to do it no we don't want you to learn on us we want you to have a little experience so we feel like we're in safe hands and know what we're doing but okay so can we go back to the um the park date again today may 15th is the day that was in pencil and the day that i like kind of plugged in with the band but like in the middle of that i don't know how we can wait until the april council meeting get it approved print out all the invites get them mailed and so back to your point where like if you think they're going to kibasha we can't make those invitations with days and then have them probably we've got to get the hundred percent okay and then make the advice and maybe the proven thing would be just to postpone it until july that way we'll know what's happening with the chrome requirements the shot's been made available everyone of any age anyone who's going to get it could have it i mean i'm not 65 but yesterday's the first day it came available to those over 60 and or yeah and i mean i got an appointment the first day i got one on monday there's plenty of appointments out there there's plenty of vaccines so and that would give us time so i would i would discussion before i make a motion do you think that would be a good thing to do that we postpone the jazz in the park from may it's our 15th may 15th too you should probably get today sure i don't think we should do can we just say at this meeting postponement to a later date yeah i think also i don't think we should we have to tie it to a day right now well i i think we should consider a date otherwise we're going to be then we're going to you know where if they whenever the annual council meeting is if we've got the go-ahead then we don't have to wait for our next meeting to come together and pick a date we can kind of get things underway to make that happen and they're probably just saying you have a date in mind you are definitely here not traveling see that's what i was thinking too more like september because a lot of people leave in the summer including me this might be a really busy summer for people finally trying to travel or you know or not and so i feel like uh once everyone i mean i feel like september then i would revise a motion just to say make a motion that the jazz in the park originally scheduled and tentatively approved by city council for may 15th is being postponed to a date to be determined in the fall in favor yeah it might even get better we might be able to do a little more things and you know have more like like food yeah if things clear up and everyone feels safe we could do more um i mean i literally because i found the cutest cutest cutest bag sets let's say bellar beach palm trees and i literally go oh my god no one's gonna want to touch those bags prove it i'm like okay in bel air this weekend they're having a bad contest like that's huge and chili cook-off but only people in belarus beach get coke everywhere else they'll touch the bags so it's like okay whatever it's i mean it's you know it just takes i guess like there's always going to be people that are going to be against it and there's going to be people that are for it and i'm thinking if you're afraid to touch the bags then don't play the game you know just don't do it because there will be a lot of people that will put a can of lysol there it's not like that you know we could spray the bags between um between people or whatever but there was just a lot of objections that were thrown out for the things that i would have never thought of in a million years so it was a good learning experience for me i can say um okay i'm writing it now okay future dave originally scheduled for may 15 and intentionally approved by city council be postponed to a date to be determined in the fall well we said we didn't want to take a firm date right now well i didn't want to pick the day but you said something about you may not be down well yeah sometimes i mean i go out of town for the summer and if i do it's in the summer time usually july august like that of september october yeah for sure so it goes on to a day in september or october or do we're going to pick a day i'm fine with picking a date in september we have the um like the dog and children costume parade in october and i don't think we have anything in november right and then we have the holiday christmas tree light in december and possibly vote right in december so may 15th was a saturday so do you want to keep it on sunday it doesn't matter you know what they take your day is the sixth so we'll be looking at the 11th september 11th oh i couldn't tell if you were like serious um are we tied to saturday or do you want to move to sunday they do um jazz brunch on sundays september 4th september 18th i'm good with any of mommycode it's still pretty hot would you rather be you're not tied to the middle of the day either you can do it at like five or six o'clock just later in the day because it's so hot in september during the day whatever did you say november i if you guys want to wait till it's cooled down we can move to november i'm fine at five o'clock and i'm fine with the heat at any time so it's an hour all right is anyone here october it might be too cold in november that's why i mean maybe october would be reasonable maybe again at the end of the day we're not going to please everybody could be really close the 25th of september that's close enough to october and then we have an event in october that's the halloween thing and they're a month apart it's gonna be a little break so we're not too excited right yeah how about you guys october september beginning in november and then later late afternoon for me that gives everyone who has a set up five o'clock okay sure so what what day september 25th at 5 pm uh i just have to double check with the band to make sure they're not booked on saturday night because she said daytime gifts all this is pending their schedule because we're changing it up ten times but i don't know um but i will remember a couple things that we threw out and tiger picked up some options does that work okay so i'm making a motion that the jazz in the park event originally scheduled for may 15th and tentatively approved my council will be postponed until september 25th at five o'clock yay i said would that be okay thank you on the agenda is there any other business that anybody wants to talk about uh i'll just make a general comment about beach access i'm sure when he was aware there's a lot going on now that our beach accesses much of it not proper um the beach accesses 6th street 12th street and i can never move 19th and 19th warnings are being issued to people that are breaking the bel air shore codes relative to umbrellas so be aware the residents of miller shore are making calls to the police department so be on your p's and q's if you use the beach and want to protect yourself from the sun do not do so unless it involves suntan lotion so know that they are uh they're calling in in the reinforcement some people very nearly got a ticket this weekend which i get started 250 bucks um i've seen them up all the time i don't bring them myself um in by the bel air shore residents continual problem in my mind with people parking over there and not being ticketed place on the um so i gave the city some recommendations as to how to solve that nothing's been done so that's still laying out there what were your recommendations made three one was to increase patrols down there to vary up the times and people would be there to indeed give tickets to people who were legally parked and uh the third was to uh put toe signs up because that normally gets people's attention and um so till companies will look for business and all it takes is towing a few vehicles out of there and it will be no longer a problem so the council liked the ideas but nothing has happened and there is a lawsuit going on between citizens of lrh and people of bel air shore and ultimately we will see who prevails in that but there's also an interlocal city agreement and my humble opinion the city of delaware beach is not doing their share to enforce the rules as they're supposed to be enforced over there i always see police officers for trolling and i never have ever seen anyone hold up their umbrella after they chit-chat i don't know what it's you know i don't they're watching yeah i think i think our city was beautiful thank you yeah i mean you know i mean the trimming um i know it's ongoing but i think everything looks phenomenal so thank you to you and your folks for an amazing job appreciate it thank you do we have a follow-up whatever because i did miss a couple meetings with when we did the inspection of the parks um we've talked about some poop bags and some other things that we were yeah some science was a lot of different signs um okay expected inspected the seawall building some shell mulch areas uh we still want to do something with the uh the martin apartment restaurant they're going to do something with the homeowners yeah i know there's a new um a new retaining wall going up on the south and like oh next to it yes they're redoing that wall yeah they're redoing that wall so yes there has been some for sure some follow-up on different games the walk-over is complete and everything you have please pass that on i think it's noticeable it's outstanding that's great all right so if there's nothing else um i'm going to schedule the next meeting in april if anybody has any i'm assuming the city council meeting is monday the 5th and so i'll put two dates out there but i'll put um april wednesday april 14th and maybe tuesday the 13th and then patty will send that out and get everybody's responses back so everyone has time to check with their schedules and get back to her on the best one um april 13th and 14th so tuesday and wednesday it is there you go george okay if nobody has anything else i'll make a motion to adjourn the meeting you make emotionally journey okay all in favor"
