    "transcript": "good evening everyone and welcome to the bel air beach city council meeting for monday march 1st 2021. ladies and gentlemen before we rise um i'd like you to join me in a moment of silence something happened on february 17 2021 that has never happened in over 100 years and one of the brave deputies in the manila sheriff's department was killed in the line of duty he was killed while a drunk driver was attempting to elude him allegedly and he ran him right over and killed him and he leaves a wife and two young daughters um his name was michael j magley and i don't ever want to forget that name that man is a hero he died protecting us so please join me in a moment of silence for him and then we're going to have the pledge of allegiance by northeast thank you for being

you what's on your mind i just ask that you maintain the code of conduct speak respectfully and everybody's going to have a good time so with that i open up the floor to citizen comments with anyone like to address the council i see no hands i will close citizen comments next you have the pinellas county sheriff's office officer we have deputies here yes so we have a presentation by the canal sheriff's office good evening good evening guys um welcome to the new year we're looking at january stats um for the month of january um we did have three uh crimes that hit the uh the first page here the first was an assault that was actually domestic related um a domestic related case i was staying at hotel the burger there was one residential burglary and the large name was the case where there was a contractor who took money to do a job and then follow through on that contract so that was the large thing um when you're looking at that there were three arrests on the month of january in the city uh the domestic battery i i pretty seriously mentioned a warrant arrest and a fleet to loot which actually uh began in bel air bluffs the uh this is fled from there they were stopped here in valor beach that wasn't actually a bellar beach case per se but they were arrested here in the city there were a majority of the activity we had this month was once again a self initiative our deputies 155 direct patrols 111 traffic stops 105 health checks 54 ordinance violations 31 contacts and 14 area checks leave a list on that so pretty good month there we had two traffic crashes and there were 96 citations issued in the city this month any questions for the council sure i have a couple questions um one thing the sheriff issues each week a uh anyone who's counted can get it to sign up for it a list of crimes in the neighborhoods and i've it's not on here but i've noticed recently a lot like three or four of frauds in this city control general activity seems to be up around i'm not gonna say where it's around it's up yeah it's in the city okay um do you have any information on that that we can give to citizens because i've noticed a lot of things well i did look um i have looked in the past month uh there were no major crimes in the month of february however there were two cases where there was um uh where some folks had possible identity theft and after the cases are i think that's not cases where they they um knew the person they just had uh accounts open their name um and so they reported uh their two cases above i believe tiffany drive um uh where uh citizens reported that you know someone open accounts our name and they got unsolicited credit cards mail things like that so that's that's what this is it's not a door-to-door thing this is more cyber crime second thing i have for you is the beach access points um it's that time of year again there's increased traffic there i was there friday and it was disgusting i was there last friday and it was disgusting well i was on sixth street yeah i've heard that it was on the other ones too i've heard other people in the city just wondering we haven't increased our patrols we're going to increase the patrols i mean what we're seeing is the same old same old people without stickers they're using the beach so they're not only illegally parked they're actually trespassing on those lots and then to boot there's dogs there was hoverboards i mean there was a guy with a boombox that you could have heard from a hundred yards away which you know it just annoys the people in bellaire shore and that makes for bad relations so are we doing anything about this uh i know we've had some turnover in january we had our our ship change uh we had to turn over some definitions and fewer deputies out here so all the other supervisors know that we're seeing an increase in that so that we can increase those patrols but like i know what our our deputy here on our ship i know the day shift definitely uh also change deputy langley down to uh any rocks beach so we're definitely there so it's possible that uh uh there's been uh less enforcement because of the newer deputies now understanding uh the rules there so we'll make sure they can take care of it it's the weekends and it's sunset sunset is just a massive influx of people and unfortunately these are the people that cause issues when they you know they sit on the retaining walls that they don't they're not from here most people are not from here and they don't care so they come there they might be here temporarily you know of course it makes for very bad relations yeah they're so that you know that's illegally parking your in your uh parking zone they're really really parking and you know everything that goes with it yeah right so yeah we'll i'll talk to other supervisors and uh we'll put an increased uh control on that okay great thank you okay anyone else questions anyone from the city any questions thank you dad 35 thank you guys see auditors are here and uh item number four is consideration of accepting the comprehensive annual financial report for the year ending september 30th 2019. we have a presentation by jeannie bittinger of salt marsh cleveland and gunn certified public accountants with that thank you mr mayor and with me is richard crostini also from saltwater i'm happy to give a very good report especially considering the year we've had with the pandemic the city made out here well i believe starting on page three is the audit report letter this is what is known as an unqualified opinion the highest pain has been from i encourage everyone to look at review the management discussion analysis which is actually written by the city treasurer and staff and reviewed by lynn reeves and they do an excellent job of making comparisons between 2019 and 2020 we give you a lot of valuable information in that part here but just to look briefly at some numbers page 15. this is on a full pool basis governmental activities uh different types of activities you can see there was an increase this year which is it's only excellent again this is a full fuel basis knowing this has capital assets and all of our debts in these statements and looking at page 16 and 17 this shows you what makes up those changes looking at our bottom line if you will the change in that position which is if you look at page 17 uh we had an increase which is excellent four hundred and twenty five thousand five hundred thirty dollars knowing that's actually after depreciation all expenses and then on our business type activities which is our refund twenty eight thousand seven thirty five so it was a very very strong year looking uh directly with your attention on a few of the statements and then if anybody has any questions we do have to go with that as well uh page 20 is the statement of revenues expenditures and changes in fund balance and this is under modified pool which is really how you run the city looking at this we've had an increase after transfers of in the general fund of 532 000 9012 and there was a decrease in capital projects but actually we'll look at trajectory quickly and actually uh that decrease was planned for and less than what we thought it would be again because a lot of the capital parkinson's been underway and showing how well this council budgeted past great budget became extremely close to making it and actually um it was a conservative budget but you can see in the far right-hand column that your variances were favorable you actually took in more in revenue than you expected so you got 178 000 in revenues at a surplus as far as beyond the budget and your expenditures were 88 000 less than what you budgeted so again it was a strong strong year especially considering everything that has happened there were kind of pluses and minuses from different grounds like parking marketing just one good example of something that has really come higher than what was anticipated obviously nobody expected that you have as many people at the beach and also parking permits i mean that building permits the season for much higher than what was anticipated uh i'm not going to read you all the notes we'll look at page 37 is your long-term debt you can see we're paying the debt and importance of the schedule and uh to look at our revenue notes increasing our revenue bonds are decreasing which is obviously primarily being capable by those assessments anyway but not having real assessments so you can see our debt is decreased so we look at everything i want to provide your attention to is i'd encourage you to look at some of the statistical section in the back because that gives you the trending over time you can see starting with page 75 you can see the difference of the assessed value and actual rail value of the property over the last 10 years so you can get an idea of where you come from where we're going and the statistical section is all in a 10-year mode is there anything else anyone would like to go over further at this time i have a request if you would and then i think you could actually probably roll my question into that i am a ck so i know what you meant when you said i'm not qualified opinion but if you could just let everyone know what that actually means and my question that i think you can roll in there is this council about a year and a half ago actually made the switch from an in-house financial person to the to sending it to the outside yes and i wanted to know in your opinion how you see these books because it's our impression that everything looked real good and was being done real well but as professionals who come in and bought it i was wondering what europe not not on the books themselves but just the quality of the work that we're seeing and what you're seeing oh the quality of the work is step at start out with the first question this is as i said the highest opinion that can be rendered so yes so within all material respects your financial statements are fairly stable which is what that actually means as you know mr mayor as far as on the quality of the work they do an excellent job they're very well prepared for the audit they are very good at reviewing the capper after i start to grab so yeah the quality of the work that is outstanding i i'm actually somewhat amazed myself they do it in such a short amount of time but and for a very as you know very very reasonable you saved considerable money by doing that it's great to hear what you just said they are both cpas they both take continuing education because we have talked about that like they take a lot of the same continuing education for teenagers to remain qualified so they could actually continue to be governmental water until they decided to switch to the other side which was reviewed within the in-house instead excellent yes we said the expenditures were 88 000 lower than budgeted yes did we save money on projects or did we forego some projects no we you know the staff knowing that as i told them early in the year that there's a possibility we're going to take in less revenue and kind of for us it worked out better so you know i told the staff not to spend money if we didn't need it and so that's that's part of it so that's a credit to the staff you know especially the public works guys and stuff you know they they made something stretch a little further than they needed to do with a piece of equipment or tools or what have you that we would normally buy or they did stuff themselves in the house we're not kicking cans down the road mr reeves it's not only credit for the staff it's occurred to you excellent job excellent job anyone else so this is something open up to the citizens if you we normally don't allow you to talk from his seat but it's so being convenient to come up here so if you could just if you have a question shout it out and she can hear you and get to the answer anyone have any questions as a citizen john hanson mr mayor if you would please remind everybody to please speak directly into the microphone yes i'm sitting over an event and i'm sure others are hearing the same thing but i'm having difficulty hearing as i'm sure others are thank you i'll make the note um folks this is the way you got to do it i'm an insurance image from the mic so that's the only way it works these mics as soon as you pull back like this you can't hear it okay so it's just the mic it's not you and these masks don't make it any better so anyone else have any questions on the audit or on the accounting i want to thank you you did a wonderful job again as always and it's a pleasure having you with our owners and great job and we'll see you again next year thank you very much thank you excuse me mayor yes we might need a break while we figure out why our phone's not working oh sure um you need five minutes oh he's going with new technology okay item five is planning and zoning board code review progress report i see wanda schwerer i want to make it easier for me and you okay um chair and phil asked me to make the presentation for this month's planning in the zoning board meeting code review i know we had promised last month that we would have the final report for you this month but the last two chapters that we reviewed were chapter 30 which is marine structures and chapter 94 which was sony they were both very long chapters we had a lot of discussion that had a lot of questions coming out of it decided we needed one more meeting for our sales to close basically for closure to review the report before we delivered it so we will be writing the report and we have a meeting schedule later this one time to get the date on plan uh for the committee to review the final report we will have it for you next month but we did we did complete all of the chapters and we're wrapping up now that's what i was just gonna ask everything overall is going well there's not nothing that's holding you up it's just i we've had a lot of help from uh from the city manager and from laura got a lot of our questions answered on the spot probably kicked a bunch of stuff over to the the attorney because we had a lot of questions about can we do this how should we do this how should we word that so that's the kinds of things that we spent a lot of time on and should be a good report by the time we did that i don't think anyone here will have a problem that is delayed a month for these reasons right we don't if you'll just thank everyone on board for the hard work and we look forward to the report next month just hang on one second let me see if there's any comments from council or citizens council no citizens any comments thank you very much thank you okay we're going to move into the regular agenda and um the first item is the item number seven to hold mayor i'm sorry consent agenda first item six let's get one so we have a consent agenda approval of the february 1st 2021 city council meeting minutes um the consent agenda does not get discussed it does not move into regular so we have a motion to approve the minutes rp makes some questions okay second by hey guys okay you take them both all in favor all right all right pass the seven to zero consent agenda is approved now we move to the regular agenda so the first thing is the authorization toward big b 2101 community center cctv and access control system um the description is a contract with the integrated security consultants in the amount of 14 203 dollars and 20 cents so i have a motion first this is what makes the motion second one more being pretty distinct i will go ahead and defer to the city manager if this is optional correct correct mrs yes mayor console this is uh we sent the security cameras and door accesses out for a bid and we got two bids back there's a copy in your packet one from eight total solutions in the amount of seventeen thousand eight six six oh seven and the low bidder was integrated security consultants uh in the amount of fourteen thousand two hundred and three dollars and twenty cents we did check their references and the reference check was good there's a copy of the proposed location of the cameras and things in the uh pack up for you to review and we're recommending that you integrated security consultants when would they start this i would say after the council approves it we'll probably do a purchase order and within a couple weeks we'll have a you know you want to know the exact will not just the process of this one yeah council any questions um basically the only thing that i'm wondering about uh on this is the brand vision i don't know if this poses a problem or not but i would like to find out if we approve it today i would like my vote to be contingent on that it's okay to use high vision cameras and cctv equipment because there have been some security issues with several chinese firms and they're only a named list so i don't know what implications that has for us but it's something that we probably need to look into i've heard everything you said the only thing i have the problem with this i don't know that we can make the votes contingent um we can give the city manager the authorization and proceed or we can give the authorization that is receiving come back to us but we have to give them an action item on them so yes i hear what you're saying and that's a big that's a big concern with what you're you know if you're even if it's even close to right it's a big concern so you don't want to do it mister do you know anything about it uh we we went back to uh before we even put this out to bed we've spoken several times with uh a total solution and uh they actually they they used they were using another camera and then they came back and said we're not using that camera any longer so this was uh in kyle's research and the recommendation that they gave us from a non-bidding standpoint was to this was the best camera to utilize for what we were looking for i understand where mr gaddis is going and it kind of goes back to my previous concerns about the city writing contracts and ensuring that they're enforceable we have warranties guarantees and performance and so i assume that when we do that at a later date make sure that you meet mrs well the bid document has a contract and it's a standard city contract with timelines when they have to finish and start all of that's that's in all our bids so that that information that you're asking about there's a warranty there's this there's that in there so i guess what i probably would need to know is really what councilmember diaz is concerned about uh basically and and this has just been called my attention just in the last few days we have to do government contracts and or we have in the past and we have to be basically we're audited every so often the last audit they wanted to know if we had high vision equipment on our site and i don't know if that was a disqualifying factor or not but uh it raised some concern and i'm sorry i didn't find out about this sooner but this literally just came up so if the federal government is concerned with it i would like to know why as much as i want i want to approve this and get this going because i know it's imperative i would like to table this and come back to it maybe with a 10 minute special session once we get past whether we can what we could do we have um the next meeting that we have really this is the last business meeting for this council but we do have a brief meeting right before the installation that is a meeting and there's no reason why we can't pass business unless tell me i'm looking to liberate and patty gentry as far as i know there's no reason we can't pass business at that point these folks this council is still intact up until the swearing-in of any new people correct yes prior to prior to the installation right do you think mr reeves you'd be able to get an answer for mr data so we could take this as business that day i'll call the we'll call the contractor in the morning and find out i don't think the contractor is going to have this information this is my fear is that we may need federal assistance for something and we may be disqualified because we're using equipment that they don't approve of and so just to make sure that we're okay before we actually go through and approve this i'd like to take a second what you're saying today is because we first of all we're not for the security trainers we're not getting federal assistance but for the door well what i'm saying is i don't i don't know but it wouldn't be the installer it would be the manufacturer of the equipment which is hot so we'll we'll find out through the florida law enforcement because that's where the grant for the part of this is coming from okay if that is an issue but i will say this company actually uh in the forget coping in a prison they're using this stuff so you know can i just add that i think when we're buying things we maybe should spend us-made you know american-made items it would probably be beneficial to support our local federal global bill it would be beneficial to support our you know local businesses and i think we should expect us-made products and i'm looking online there are several camera manufacturers that are made in their campus they're in america the point i was trying to make is our traditional boilerplates and our contracts haven't been satisfactory to this point yet at the last meeting i said we've had issues with quality and performance and no accountability and that's why i'm raising this issue again and maybe if we can't necessarily specify the equipment we may want to specify performance or specifications that he wants to meet and they may be more qualified and have a lot more expertise in that area so maybe just reviewing the specifications in the contract and rather than specific name brands or whatever that's where i was trying to go with this thing the standard boilerplate to this point just hasn't been satisfactory to to my opinion and i just want to make sure that maybe we start tightening up some of those areas and this might be one of those clean areas yeah originally this was going to be bosch cameras and council member gavis did look at that with us but the vendors uh i i don't know what happened but they put that german cameras so we'll we'll find that out yeah and uh again i apologize but basically there's only a few companies in the entire world that make cameras and no matter who's you buy it whether it's they claim they're here they're wherever they're made by those five different companies and there's a there's a list of like four that are on that list so uh i just need a little bit of time and uh i'll get with the glenn and we'll go over that hear your motion uh [Music] all in favor of tabling this uh hopefully for the next meeting and if not that mysteries will come in on the next council that's fine all in favor aye aye aye all right anyone opposed pass the seven to zero this is taken and mr reeves i agree with what mr gunn said if you want to work directly with dave gaddis so he can get any questions in so that next time we meet hopefully he's if he's comfortable i think we're probably going to be comfortable on this one let's move on to item eight authorization to award bid d2102 monument sign with electronic message display and budget amendment increase in the capital project's fund the explanation is contract with international [Music] plus a contingency of five thousand twenty seven dollars seventy cents this has been placed on by the city manager to have a motion makes the motion do we have a second second by dave gattis it's open for discussion i'm mark b i refer those to uh one rape shitty man yeah mayor console uh actually i was disappointed in the bid and and i have to put this on here so uh what i'm going to recommend to you is you reject the bid because i think the cost is too high and we kind of got a rough data from the survey that we sent out and out of 321 people that submitted information only 26 of them were concerned about the message board and uh patty got this to me well we knew the number i think friday but so the question at this point is because we had a bid the console needs to reject it and we'll go on from there and figure out what you want to go forward i did based on the survey the communication survey i'm kinda and i stuck this picture at your dice uh i'm kind of to the point where maybe we just use something similar to our entrance signs because evidently uh the people that called concerning that they can't read the board didn't really speak up that they that we needed a message board in the communication survey the majority of the people uh want us to communicate with them through uh of the 321 280 plus one email 155 which is some of them or both of these things want text messages 4401 voicemail 66 said the website and the one that really shocked me 18 said facebook which really shocked me because i thought the whole world was basically doubt and 80 newsletters and 26 message boards so my recommendation at this point is maybe we go back to the drawing board we'll have a discussion maybe at a work session to see if you just want a monument sign or what you really want i think it's too much money it's my opinion i think this is the first time in history that you've ever recommended against something that you put on but um i have to agree with you i think everybody else is probably great but i think you know my inbox blew up with this whole digital sign thing i was never really so you know too behind this thing but it looked like it was going to be the better of the two um when it came to cost this thing came in and blew it out of the water but then i had a nice long discussion a couple weeks ago and i said lynn has anybody actually missed the sign that's down he said no so i said if no one's missing it then maybe we don't need to do this and maybe we just have a welcome to this i think we should have something that's just maybe welcome to build a beach but um we don't have to go crazy well i think you need to have a something to say what this building is you know so as an example this is what we did the same sign at the marina and it basically below it it says marina so if you wanted something else to add to it but that's that's a concept we had those redone i can't tell you the exact price because it's been a couple of three years ago when we had those done but just a thought council oh yes i would like to say first off um i appreciate the city reaching out to the citizens that was a very good move because we have been trying to push reaching out to our citizens to get their feedback um i don't have any type of problem at all something like this just something simple and identifying the building so i'm with you on rejecting the bill but i do want to make sure i think both to be cool we're going to have communications and with the community i'm in agreement with rejecting the bid i would just throw out though that the survey results that you're referring to was the broad survey that went out how do you want to be communicating with so it wasn't specific to a digital sign it was in an include email text message so it wasn't a narrow focus group but i'll just throw that out there i i do believe that there may be something simpler and it does the job so i agree with going back i would also like to say that the digital sign was a recommendation of the communications ad hoc committee which was basically comprised of the residents right am i correct in that so there was a good representation of the residents on the communications ad hoc committee and that was a recommendation for communications committee so while we may not need something as elegant as we originally went with this may be the opportunity to go back to the front or come up with a fair solution you know i got something in the mail i'm gonna give it to you actually was sent to me it's just an advertisement i don't know if people can see it but it's a it's a small digital sign it's nothing fancy it's not even close to what we were looking at when we were you know this other side something that's portable yeah they're four thousand dollars a piece so you know you can get a couple of these and place them in an event of an emergency or something that's really important around the city and take them down if necessary again it's not sexy it's not real fancy but it's four thousand dollars and on the back side of it on the other thing that they sent me they have an email program that can keep everybody advised of what's going on for 349 dollars a year so i mean i think that dovetails into what the communications to me some of the recommendations they made it's 21st century um i think it's a nice alternative so i'm gonna i'm gonna vote against your uh you know vote against this sign and um but i'm gonna give you this anybody else i don't think honestly i would say if we do a sign like that with linda give us a picture of us have a necessary electric in place so that if we want to do something later on it'll be easy to do if you want to just raise it up a little bit maybe put a smaller sign underneath it or just digital or something but something up there like same urgency we've got a hurricane coming up evacuate the city something and that in case there is no communications i just thought two other things one is there's not a lot of corporate history remaining on this council but historically when you try to tie this sign to the previous uproar over a digital sign what i would like to remind everybody is that the previous concern centered around a different location for the sign and secondly the county wanted to install a digital sign over gulf boulevard in the bel air beach area it's similar to the ones on almerton in east bay that warns about amber and silver alerts and there's a lot of uproar over there so that's that's number one you know a lot of people don't remember that that was a lot what the upload was really about and the second thing is a lot of people are are just concerned about the change and probably haven't even seen the design because i had to dig on our website and had to actually go into the bid to find what the concept looked like because i don't think we've ever posted a concept saw a picture artist's rendition or anything so i'm not quite sure what people are having their minds when they totally reject the ideas that's a concern that most of us before i became a council member that sign up front was that was my communication too every time i got in my car and drove across this bridge i read that sign i knew when every meeting was i knew what was going on that that was my number one communication tool and i i do understand that many people don't want a digital sign and i certainly understand why 55 000 is too much however i want our sign back and i don't think that i'm the only person in the city who does i think that many people miss this site he could probably survey everyone in this room and probably come up with better numbers than what what lynn gave us in the survey because what's your number one communication tool in a survey what how would you like to be reached out to well yeah okay the sign is going to be there anyway but while you're at it can i have facebook or email or something like that i think the sign was taken for granted and now that it's gone i know i'm not the only person in the city who missed domestic and even though it wasn't flashy and digital and easy to program i think it's something that we absolutely must have back in some form yeah i would just say that um i think this the price was a sticker shock i from the beginning wasn't a big fan of the huge digital sign but i think there's a modification between what what we have bid and what we have marking the city elsewhere so i would say maybe we can go back to the drawing board and look for something that's maybe a fraction of the size of this this seems to be a pretty big sign again go back to where we talked about maybe doing some informational only on the bottom running information rather than this digital you know medium it's off to the right as you know we see it here and maybe just go back to the drawing board with it but certainly 55 000 is not and then why we move forward with this we were in the 30 000 price range so somewhere in between there's got to be a number we can settle on and circulate it to residents a little better because i thought the same thing when i started getting emails it would be nice to shoot back here's what we're looking at you know potentially improving i don't know how many residents have seen this image of course this is a little bit you know this seems a little overwhelming so i think we get a better image we get we modify it some we get the price down and circulate that to residents so they know what the possibilities are i just want everyone to understand too and i remember jamie's called vividly have you all shared in this quote jody held up that sign okay that was our alternative that really nice one and we said we wanted that one for the price of the basic sign that was the charge that we gave to the city manager it's not his fault i mean that is by far and away the nicest sign that was there we thought it fit in well with the you know with the architecture of the building so what we were looking at and then we were just debating whether it should be digital or regular so um this is not a failure by anyone's part it's just it costs more to get the cadillac than you know it costs for the basic toyota so at this point we're back to the drawing board um i know there's probably some people that want to speak i mean it looks pretty obvious that this is not going to get approved tonight it's going to get rejected um but if you come out to speak tonight and as a citizen this is you know you come here you spent your time i think the council would like to hear you know any ideas that you might have here and we can have some time this agenda is not that large tonight so i want to open this up to the floor if there's never counsel comments i'll just say one thing um i agree with jody about getting more information on the citizens once we come up on the concept but a lot of these digital signs also have like a a night mode where it's not as bright where it's not as glaring because i think some of the perception is it's going to be like just ridiculously obnoxious for everybody not only people that live nearby but just driving in the city you're going to get hit with a bunch of colored lights so a lot of them have like a low light kind of study where it's just very subtle and i think we need to get that kind of information out because i think everyone thinks this is an obnoxious marquee and that's not any of our attention it's supposed to be subtle you know good taste you know and presented a nice image for the city upon entering the council let me open this up [Music] yeah sure absolutely but jody has a real nice one here nice full-size one i don't know if everyone's seen this sign so you can pass it around vice versa i'll pass this around is thank you okay with that and in case it didn't come out on the mic uh vice mayor asked if you know because i want to say there's two four six i think um about 12 people in the audience about half of people have seen this rendering of the sign that's being passed around now which was the sign that we were uh that was out for big right now um so again i'm gonna i know some people may want to may want to speak on this um we're going to take this back into a work session but work sessions sometimes are not well intended with citizens so if you're here and you want to speak about it microphone is here please address us anyone yes right up to that microphone mr ball i'm roger maul 115 causeway right across the street um i don't need to deliver this because i wrote but i know that you made a comment uh stating that you used it for information in the past and the only other comment i heard that was positive for this sign was from lynn when he was and he said that he would be able to update the sign even from his hotel room and i thought well making that's not a good reason to be spending that kind of money for a sign i love you to death but i hate to see this when we've got over was it 150 or what was the size of the survey what was the size of the survey uh there were 321 so that's 321 citizens there's three people on the communications board and to ignore the citizens uh i think is a big mistake and it sounds like it's going to go down now but if you're doing the sign let's make sure that we just don't want to do another project be grandiose and that's the feeling that i get about this sign and so i would encourage you not to do that we're a simple community we're the smallest one around here and we have the most grandiose structure we're a fun friendly community we don't have to look like bel air california which incidentally doesn't have a a digital board they got a lot more money than we do and so i would encourage you when you're in this committee not to do to get off this digital thing because i think it would send the wrong signal to the whole community let's listen to that 351 people thanks guys thank you mr ball any other citizens yes i'm debbie ma i live at 115 causeway with my wonderful husband over there um i too have some significant concerns about the digital sign which i have voiced before and after hearing what you all said tonight i'm really upset and um i have received emails regarding this digital sign so i have a significant number of people that i can share with you um who are against it they were against it a couple of years ago when we talked about putting it at crossman park and we're still against it um the city of bel air beller bluffs and indian rocks beach do not have one they are much larger than we are they have many more events going on that they need to inform their residents of and certainly they have many more people to evacuate with hurricanes and things yet they are able to keep their citizens far better informed than we are so clearly the answer is not a digital sign i have no problem with putting a sign out there that says the city of bel air beach or stellar beach city hall we i think we should have that welcome to bella beach but this is um a digital message board is a very antiquated means of communicating with with anybody anymore it's going to end up being a white elephant out there you guys it really is and who's going to take care of it when we have power failures or when it malfunctions who are being are we going to be able to call in in his hotel room at 10 o'clock at night and say this thing is going bonkers because that that's going to be a big issue so my big concern is that the citizens have spoken now twice 321 people in the survey win and i think there were 291 who said no no no they didn't they were we did not send out a thing that said what do you think about a sign now that we have this new list because our previous list was i'll say 50 plus percent people were not residents of the city of miller beach so this is a new list that the communications committee asked us to do a survey on so i don't want you to say that 320 26 out i'm just saying i'm giving the console information that we had 26 people that said they still want to use the board that doesn't mean that there's not another 100 out there that want to use it it just means that in the communication survey the people were asked to give us the best way to contact them so going forward if if we have a new sign uh concept we could send that out in an email because now we have a email or a text list that's 320 people that are residents of bellar beach not but that's our sport we don't we don't keep a decent database we don't that's our fault now you did ask in there a city of beller beach message board you're asking people how you want the city of bella beach to communicate with them and that would be the purpose of having a digital sign would be to communicate with the residents of bella beach and they're telling you they don't want a message board so for from my perspective i just find it horrendous that we have spent this much time on something that the citizens that twice said we don't want this is a pretty darn good response for the city of bella beach you have to admit that i'll be happy to put that database together i have a pretty significant one already up for the city of bellar beach i did it once before for the civic association we had the civic association and i gave that to nancy so it's not difficult to put a database together in the residence or we can find emails pretty easily but i would say before i would suggest before we go out and waste lynn's time on getting bids and things let's find out what the citizens wants because we've asked them twice and twice they've said no so i don't know how i mean that's you should have seen the emails that i got over this last like week or so about people saying i thought this was dead and buried so that that's just my two sons [Music] any other citizens wish to speak on this topic at this time and then bring it back to the council for a vote i would just say that once again if you go out and get blanket do you want a digital sign what pops into mine well what pops into my mind is driving down east bay and hitting missouri and seeing that largo sign that blinds me right as i drive by versus getting a concept together and putting that in an email or in a survey and say this is our idea of what it looks like do you agree or don't you agree and then get a survey we've got every if you just shotgun an email out there saying do you want a digital sign everybody has a different concept of what what's being proposed and i think the city manager has it right let's put together some concept and then survey the populace and we will certainly tap into your expertise in our list and we're having problems cracking the communication code here because people don't want to have their email addresses as a public record that's the difference between your email list and email this to belair beach as soon as somebody says here's my text telephone number here's my email address it becomes public record if any vendor outside can purchase that list and before you know it your email in baskets slam dunk with advertising and everything else that's why people don't want to volunteer their communications notification address is with us and we're having problems cracking that code so we have to do it the best way we can and still stay within the constraints of government here and privacy so i think that's that's where we're at on this thing i i agree this one just kind of went over the top and it's time to sit back and let's let's tighten the reins up and see if there's something more appropriate we're very sensitive to your concerns we understand that and i have the same concerns i really do but i think if you want a survey with numbers that are appropriate then that's the way to do it i mean it's always what's the number in the denominator i've looked at some of those emails and sometimes quite frankly some of those emails were from people who are not residents of baylor beach i saw it on next door i saw it in some of your other areas on the facebook page so i mean once again you can do anything you want with us so let's just be smart i think what's going to happen we're going to take the vote now but this is going to wind up going back in us and then washington they call it sending it back to committee just going to go back to committee to a work session um i'm not convinced we need any sign okay i'm the first person who gets the email mayor mayor mayor and and you know i didn't get one email saying hey i missed the sign but i got a whole bunch saying i don't want that picture to sign and i was prepared to vote no on this tonight no matter what so i'm not convinced the digital i know other people on this council voiced some reservations so we're back to committee on this thing and we have to decide whether we need a city of bellar beach welcome sign or whether you whether we need this and everyone is welcome to participate and i like what glenn's done is saying if we have to let's blast it out to everybody in the city and then get a good cross-section but we can't force people to answer those emails either so or a letter so we can only ask but we appreciate everybody coming by i want to commend everybody who wrote i don't know what everybody wrote to everyone else but every letter that i read was very professionally well done very respectful so thank you again that that's employee governments if there's no other comments i'm going to call the question anyone else okay so the vote now will be to authorize the city manager to execute a purchase order but i'm sorry uh to award bid mayor it should be to reject the bid that's what i need you to do project with it well you're just not going to get the votes don't worry i got it so what we're moving for now is to authorize to award big b-2102 monument sign with electronic message display and budget amendment increase in the capital projects fund a yes vote allows the city manager to go purchase this son but no vote kills it for now so all in favor i hear nothing all opposed okay 7-0 it fails [Music] [Music] authorize the city manager to execute a purchase order for asphalt overlay and patching services and approval of budget amendment increase the explanation is to contract with atax paving industries of florida llc and the amount of 91 881.79 it is put on by city manager do i have motion yes yes okay okay well i'll just defer to yes uh mayor console this request to authorize us to execute a purchase order to uh resurface uh there's a map in your packet it will be hibiscus west west hibiscus harrison and the section between gulf boulevard and high vistas we have we're short about fifteen thousand dollars in the capital budget to do this project and what i'm asking for is you to authorize the increase of fifteen thousand dollars uh this is the same company it's a contract already that bid out uh their term contract with florida uh for ajax vaping services and this is a contract we're using currently for bellevue estates island so this would be a continuation and utilize the funding and move forward with this project we did a pavement condition index if you remember um probably been close to a year ago and these are the streets that were got the lowest scores which means the worst condition they were the ones that i recall last time they were under the city of tampa's bid was that where we got this one from yes okay so it's been bid it's just through the city of tampa right yeah it's the city of tampa contract 19c 0010 citywide the roadway improvements my only question for you is i noticed some of the streets on here there was some consideration about doing underground i know harrison we were talking about hibiscus and stuff like that and the one rule we had here was kind of an informal rule but we're not going to pave streets and then rip them up to the underground and so are we certain at this point that we're ready to pave these streets because we're not two years from now we don't want to be tearing it up well i i don't anticipate uh at this point unless councilmember shirley knows something i don't know uh at the current time there's no movement on underground on harrison i can tell you that and there never was any movement on hibiscus or that section of that allowed to start i hate to cross talk about jody if you don't mind me asking a question is that your understanding of this because i'm totally in favor of this as long as there's you know pretty much the hope of this thing in the near term you know is that it's not going to happen i don't want to be tearing up the streets two years from now there was a lot of support for it when he asked about it but when the project was handed off to the residents to take over no movement it was there was no movement so being on council i didn't want to be the ones fear hitting it i don't think that's appropriate it's conflict so it's just died and as i explained to the residents that i handed it over the lines are in their front yard if it bothers them that bad they should step up and do something about it that was probably about eight months ago or more maybe a year ago i gave them everything and no one's talked to one about it since i think there was one phone call citizens and comments there are no citizen comments but wait john hansen john kansas 22nd street village reach um in the uh agenda item number eight was just rejected you have a contingency of 5027 but in this agenda item we're talking about now you're asking for a budget amendment increase but we don't have a dollar amount there and i heard the city manager say that there is a portion of money in the budget for this project but i'm concluding from his comments insufficient funds in the currently approved city budget so how much more money are we asking for to do this project it's 15 000 of our return over deliveries yeah it's a required increase of fifteen thousand dollars in the fy it's in the uh i spoke about it when i first talked about there's a would be a budget amendment to the capital project's fund it's in his memorandum also in the book that we have i'm not sure if it was a network was handed out but it's in the memorandum that he sent to us you know was that just an under budgeting or higher cost what was why the extra 15 well as you know we we did the uh bellevue estates island that was the plan and uh we were hoping to be able to do it for the balance of the money that we had rolled over but it came in about 11 000 more so that's why it was just we were trying to use the funding we put i think sixty thousand dollars a year in asphalt and paving and we had some rollover and we had saved so we could do the 22nd street visa and when we got those numbers we still had some money but we didn't have enough to do it totally so that's why i'm asking for the budget any other citizen comments counsel a full question so item number nine is to authorize the city manager to execute a purchase order for asphalt overlay and patching services and approval of a budget amendment increase that's fifteen thousand dollars this is a contract with ajax paving the florida llc in the amount ninety one thousand eight eighty one seventy nine a yes vote passes this and allows the city manager to proceed i can take voice vote all in favor aye aye anyone opposed pass the seven to zero item 10 authorization to suspend bid requirements for outflow maintenance service the uh again by city manager and a description is contract with cnm dredging in the amount of nineteen thousand and one hundred and seventy dollars first we have a motion next to motion shout out secondly that's a member slopes yes uh mayor console this is uh to direct the stormwater pond that's behind the tennis courts and to open up the drainage that is across the street through the mangroves uh we've got it permitted we did originally uh look at a contract to do to do it with gator contracting city of tampa and then we got another bid for another vendor uh references checked out good and it was about 800 cheaper to use them and then we also got a bid from the person that's doing the job on 7th and 8th street it was 71 000 this is a small project it's in the storm water fund and this will help alleviate some of the drainage from cedar and spruce right now the mangroves have overtaken the [Music] outlet and we got a permit to remove them and we've got that all taken care of and then we're going to go across the road to the outfall where the most of you know where the boardwalk is we're going to there's a section of mangroves that will stay there but we're also going to take some mangroves out there and re-dig the trench so the flow goes better out and that will the bottom of this pond is probably well i know it's up to a boot because i stepped in it's probably about that deep in luck so it's time to clean it out and that'll that'll improve the drainage and also give us more storage basin uh and better get the drainage out of the area so i'm recommending using uh cnn dredging in the amount of 19 170 dollars their uh quotes are in the packet along with the maps of what's being removed and taking the engineer and the permit from swift mud and [Music] well this is our first project under the stormwater uh view right well we've started the engineering on 12th and 13th so we're moving along then i had only one question i think you answered i just want to be doubly sure because we're talking about mangroves and they're protected by the national guard we're good they're all we've got everybody's permit the governor the vice chairman everybody we need everyone signed off right right we're going to have to replant some small ones along the bank behind the tennis court but the main thing is to clean out the flow system and unfortunately they should have been maintained a long time ago when they weren't and now we got a kind of a mess out there so we're going to fix that but we have all the permits this is a project that has been deferred for a long time and it's great that we're getting materials and it's twenty thousand dollars yeah i agree it's it's a project that really needs to be done and when um yeah the price seems great thank you for doing the diligence on this i know i've walked that and it not only not only does it hold a lot of water because there's so much muck in the bottom of it it's breeding mosquitoes like crazy i'm not sure that that will eliminate it completely but i think it will help if we have some alcohol it'll help the water moving so good job thanks council was steve's actually betting on the same job yes i'm just checking we went out last just to give you a little feedback we went out to another company uh several months ago before we got to the point had the permit and stuff and they came back with some enormous thing like 45 000 and i'm thinking there's no way all we're doing so i'm cutting mangrove trees well that's the best part there [Laughter] hope to any other council comments i'll open up to the citizens there are no citizen comments back to council with uh rebus woke [Music] okay um so what we're doing is we're going to authorize this authorized to suspend good requirements for outfall maintenance service we are going to authorize the city manager to contract with cnn dredging inc in the amount of nineteen thousand one hundred seventy dollars for the project described in the binder here yes vote allows him to proceed all in favor all right anyone opposed pass the seven to zero okay item 11 consideration of a merit pay increase based on the annual evaluation criteria for the city manager this is a merit increase based on city council employee evaluations which are included in our binder so first we'll have a motion motion by reader slope second check well i just would like to say that we all received council members one inch away lynn you've done an absolutely amazing job and we all received the evaluations that everybody filled out so you've met the criteria to receive the three percent obviously by the score so i say we go ahead and give you your merit increase of three percent counsel any other comments citizens so this is authorization i'm sorry this is consideration of merit pay increase based on annual evaluation criteria for city manager merit uh increase based on city council employee evaluation it doesn't say here it's a three percent increase i believe is what we're talking about correct that's right okay so we take a voice quote on this all in favor hi anyone pass the seven to zero congratulations mr reeve reeves excellent here thank you mayor council now for the tough one no i'm just kidding okay so number 12 is consideration of merit pay increase based on annual evaluation criteria for the city clerk it also is a three percent increase it doesn't say here but it is merit increase based on city council employee evaluations which we all have a copy will have a motion that's a tie i don't know does that mean mark gets it it's his last meeting so mark being patented all right i've looked at all the evaluations i've known patti for a long time 15 years and uh this year especially she's really done an enormous job keeping us all informed uh with the culprit and whatever else have you and any correspondents i ever had from her was 100 or close to that and i'm glad to see that everybody agrees across the board patty i had comments last time and i just reiterate them i think we've nailed it on and i saw a couple other i think vice mayor the same comment about nailing it on these minutes and stuff and then just being proactive and i think i can say it for liberties but i think it goes for both uh individuals this was not not that any year is an easy year but this year was really a tough year covered and it was occur all curve balls being thrown at us nobody knew what was going on you know couldn't come next and these two pretty much rolled with the punches and that's all you can really ask and we kept the city i mean they're hearing all this good stuff tonight the projects that have never been done in 10 years 15 years while they're getting done so and it's getting done by the council and for these individuals so i'm absolutely totally in favor of your race thank you anyone else dave dennis obviously my comments speak for themselves but i will add that i don't think that the same survey should be given for both lynn and i struggled doing patty's there were just some questions that you kind of had window to make it work i think sometime this year we should look into this and see if we can do a modified version that's specific to the clerk's position because it's this survey was definitely geared towards more the city manager and not the city department you know i agree i mean i started there's some stuff with delegation and things it's not you know it's two different jobs but you get the gist of it but we could maybe tell it some before that happened with that session i think one way of satisfactorily doing that is going back and adding more sections where it's just not observed i mean just you feel compelled to give a number or answer in certain categories but we don't observe those areas in the office so you know now it doesn't say it but we probably need to go back and change that form to include that and make sure that it's not you know used in the average you shouldn't be compelled to get to your point glenn's play i might suggest you know when we're seeing this you're seeing every day what's happening and you're not and um you know to the extent maybe that you could have some included this might help too you know because um we're not seeing it you know someone i come to headquarters once in a while i know uh lynn does and mark doesn't some people don't get a chance to come here all the time so um and even when we're here we're only seeing 10 15 minutes half an hour where you're sitting 40 hours a week so it might help or even maybe just giving us a little overview of what your your take on things are so maybe this could be a nice workstation for them to revise this can i just mention i think when we used and out we outsourced those reviews um the documents and so forth would it make sense that we maybe just take a blank one and say you know because i there were areas i think last year i looked back and i did what had not observed you know it's hard to score because i don't have the first hand knowledge so maybe we just share that information and then you could maybe have them into the form any council comments the only thing that any of us can do is just our experience of a person individually and that's all we can do but i guess what happened i mean you know some people like i work a lot with patty i'll see different things but you know everybody doesn't i try to impart some of it to what i say but you know like when she wrote a letter for me i mean that that got that thing out the door and i was stacked with work that week and i didn't ask her she just did it and i mean that's really being proactive that's being excellent that's that was impressive i know i wrote it and it's it's good so yeah it's the same thing i mean anytime that i have any correspondence or anything right out and call me that answers any question i have and what more can we do anything else open up the citizens another thumbs up it might be a little in jeopardy patty i don't know we'll see i think you're going to do it okay any other uh council comments more to get the last word anything i want to say thank you very much okay so item 12 is consideration of merit pay uh merit pay increase based on annual evaluation criteria for the city clerk we're talking about three percent we're increasing based on the city council employee evaluations i'll take a voice vote yes it gives the three percent raise [Music] thank you all very much thank you all right item 13 is unfinished business do we have that city attorney fred riley you've been very quiet tonight mr riley yes i have this is your time i don't have anything to see okay i just wanted to thank you you got us a copy of the we had asked last time for the maduro beach ordinance on the boats i haven't forgotten about it i didn't want to bring ordinance stuff up with the council this is the last business meeting for this council so instead of voting once and voting a second time with different potential council i will just push it all off and wait i didn't see that many votes on our side so i think we're pretty good we may not even act on it but we'll bring it to the next work session but thank you for getting us that information okay mr reeves okay i just want to unfinish business just give you an update on the gulf boulevard and causeway traffic radar signs i did speak to the county they are in the works they are doing at the intersection they're doing it they have hired a consultant they're doing an intersection study mainly to look at is there a better way to get people off the island like make two left turn lanes there where we can uh i did speak to the consultant uh it's been a couple weeks ago and uh they are even looking at the island there 12th street so those things are in in the works it just takes time bicycles electric bicycles on the beach the way the statue reads in the state about a bicycle electric bicycle is a bicycle so what i was told is correct that is there's no there's no enforcement with the sheriff to do anything about electric bicycle now if the city wanted to create ordinance that banned bicycles then that would alleviate it but at this point electric bicycles are a bicycle and you know we may discuss that further in our session what the council wants to do going forward then i just want to interject i got a comment i think megan says this other people on council but i got comments on the citizens almost got run over by this i responded and it was exactly what that's what i had heard at the big sea all the mayors just i think i said this last time all the mayors of the big c were complaining about this and then it came to our town of course um a bicycle is a bicycle and an e-bike is a bicycle so that gives state of florida we can't do anything about it shortly probably banning them unless mr riley can pull up something you know another way around this thing but i think this is going to be a topic for a work session down the road to see what our council wants to do i hate to ban anything and then you get that whole idea of what do you do with the wet sand which actually is state of florida trust for recreation so i don't know but um i do know that when i'm getting complaints from residents that they're almost getting run over that's not good and somebody's gonna get hurt and i don't want that okay speaking of the boats in the intercoastal the majority of them are crossed they're not not in our waters florida fish and wildlifes i did talk to them about it they will enforce it if in other words they'll enforce it if we catch someone staying longer than our ordinance allowance our ordinance says you can be there 72 hours in a 30-day period and as they told me the problem is if that boat moves 100 feet he's in a different place so he's got another 72 hours technically i know councilmember beam i asked him because i had been trying to monitor and see if i saw any votes in a couple of days i've talked to him and there are any boats out there but then last week one night there was a boat but the next day it wasn't there so i i don't know if there's much control that we have over that and i don't know if any of you other house members that live on the water have seen any other boats and i just suggest and i think i mentioned this to lynn earlier today i think that we should just in our ordinance especially now that we're reviewing our code we should just say that there's no boring a lot and so that satisfy that's our that takes care of the ordinance issue um i don't see any need for anyone to mourn to mourn their boat behind anyone's house within our jurisdiction you know i think if you have a boat that is in water and you have your doc you know being repaired you need to warn it for a while that's a special permit to come get from the city otherwise no more in the city period and i think that that's something maybe you know we can address with the code review right now right that's that's really a simple change you just take the wording out that says 72 hours in a 30-day period and strike that and say no more well that ordinance that madeira beach passed is is very successful that got them out of madeira beach and they're probably the ones that you see over here now but they scattered after that so it worked and you know whatever we need to pull out of that to make it legal and through mr riley give us the insight into it but i mean yeah i don't own water from property but i sympathize with what jody just said i mean the last thing in the world i wanted some dude you know tying up his boat or not tied up the anchoring right in my backyard i mean you know they can fish there if they want but 72 hours they become a house guest and that's not good that's too much are the buoys would that be the the separation outside inside or is it no no actually our jurisdictional is basically the center of the intercoastal so if you took the went to the top of the bridge to the highest point and kind of stood in the middle there and looked down that's the jurisdictional boundary of the city so far i see one consistently and it's a larger boat there was a little sailboat for a while and it's gone but fortunately our neighbors across the way are they must be paying attention and they don't think it's cool to come over here yet definitely if we have been stopped i think that's why i suggested last time i think we should be proactive not wait till they get here because you know when they're in your backyard it's not going to be fun anymore and then you know it takes about three months to get an organs throughout that that's just what we've been passed so well this is a simple one just do it uh the beach easement project the excesses the four was a about a hundred thousand dollar project they're done uh i don't know if any of you have been to them well i do know about someone surely has uh and we're gonna now submit the invoice to the county because they offered to pay fifty thousand dollars to us so we can get that back so say fifteen or fifty fifty we'll submit that invoice and get that process going uh to uh collect our their share back i guess that's how i want to put it so the project was very good and i got to come in kyle took care of it and worked on it worked with the contractor and i think he did a really good job so it turned out well house bill 219 short-term rails we're not in that window at the current time it's from 2014 i did listen into a quarterly to city's webinar with a representative that's telling everybody tell your people talk to your representatives and tell them about no or even the 2014 so if you have any contact that that's the recommendation but it doesn't really affect us a couple months ago i gave you the supplemental number of about ten thousand dollars and i never heard from anybody for the supplemental sheriff so i'm expecting that just go forward and start using that when i need to for certain holidays and stuff but i shared that with you a couple months ago and we did submit the letter to the big c to get approval to expend the penny 4 money i don't know what happened with it as i checked and i'm not sure if it was just done by the committee or the big c itself not sure there was no real business this time i don't know my turn but there was this time they had a special presentation so there was very very little business based handled and today uh the mayor and i received a letter uh from fema uh notice of the flood insurance map change effective august 24 2021 uh over the summer will probably be doing some performance changes and updates to comply uh the maps have not been sent to us but based on the preliminaries uh some of the homes bfe is to drop i don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing but i think we'll need to be looking at that for the future you know we may have to add another foot of freeboard or something to keep everybody protected if they're building a new house so this is talking about we talked about freeport is the difference between what they mandate when you build your house up and if you want to add a little extra between your first floor so i did my house i did a foot and a half a lot of people do it but some people don't do anything so that's what he's talking about but they're actually going to lower the minimum height and they're also changing our zoning too i mean so uh my house used to be in the ve zone it's going to be in the a zone which is really nice though but about stilts now but that's okay well i i the county uh we had a conference call today in the county and all the cities are looking at a vulnerability study that the county did because the map study actually was started in 2012 so we're nine years past that and they're just adopted maps so it may help with flood insurance for some people but we can always go to higher standards and probably into a higher level by using something like freeboard or something so that's something we'll be discussing over the summer and i want to thank patty for all the work she did on the communication survey she probably thought i was getting crabby because i kept telling her what are we done what are we done but she she got it together and she sent out her first newsletter last week so the newsletter you got in the mail and it's from the new list the old list we did print it off and put it in the public records but we're not going to use that anymore so anything we send out now it's pretty much been confirmed that these are our residents slash property owners so uh and you know i think the communication communications committee has just assisted us in going forward but patty did a great job and uh that's it anyone have any questions for city manager hey city park no nothing thank you all right we're going to go to city council commons and start with reasonable i don't have anything additional nothing for me thank you dave gaddis uh thank you for the last time marv b okay if you look in your packet under section 17 this information came from the big c head water resources it was a company that the big city was had the presentation maybe the mayor will elaborate on it but the company does marinas on the ocean front and they also do you know areas where the beaches can be protected so if you look at some of the uh pictures there we get ideas to keep sand from eroding so maybe in the future the work session we talked about doing something with the marina and i talked to lynn and there's 17 people with smaller votes on the waiting list so maybe this company could come up with a concept if the council agrees and when we do beach renourishment again if you see on page three the information they've got little winged uh areas and it kind of looks like a bunch of curves it's possible we could do that do that type of thing in the in our beach area from 21st north maybe in different sections like that and when we do the bring the sand in it might stay by doing a few things like this i don't know but i think it's worthwhile if the council looks into it in the future and maybe get these people to attend the kind of workshop and i recently sent a picture to lynn reeves from 1988 and it shows about five foot of water or sand in front of the 19th street access so if you're interested how it would look for how it looked back then you can ask them for a picture and i'll send you i don't have anything except to thank mark for all his uh years of service and past and it's been an honor to be on the council with you and i'll be seeing you up here i hope you'll come to the meeting vice man best practices the agenda summary i would ask that we include a little more specificity again i've talked about that before for instance just going back to item 9 the purchase order for the ass called overlay i think we just had it added some more burgers saying hey you know the original contract was for this much the amendment is actually for only fifteen thousand dollars for these reasons we could have probably saved a lot of medical discussion there and really some of these other ones were along the same line if we you know what why when however who kind of thing we just a couple of bullets can save a lot of discussion and save a lot of time on some of these things and actually facilitate business and save times things i didn't hear an action item come out of the code review thing the mooring issue and the bicycle thing i mean if bicycles are if any and i don't ever have any skin in this game i'm just saying now's the time you could go back into that ordinance and say specify hey a man-powered bicycle or excluding self-propelled stuff if there's an issue with born and you want to restrict it or constrain it now's the time to do it we just heard wanda schwier saying they're in the home stretch here and if we want to make some changes i think we need to give them that direction so i don't know if the city manager has that for action yeah that's that's good yeah i'll i'll have that discussion at the next meeting just keep in mind to that point that it's we're preempted on on what we that this the legislature said a bicycle it's an e-bike so if we i think it boils down to phantom entirely and that's going to come down to the council you know i think we're kind of handcuffed on this one we don't damn entirely and we still have to deal with that with the issue and i'm not even sure what the law is on that or we have to let it go i think so yeah i think so on that one yeah and the last thing is uh so far as the survey goes i mean okay we got 321 responses out of 1234 residences and you know we're saying hey that's 25 26 and even by normal survey standards that's good but depending on how you break down and drill down into those numbers i mean if you consider the number of homestead homes and that sort of thing that number is probably even higher than once 50 so good job and good job getting that stuff done so i mean it's just a matter of how you look at it that's all i have thank you thank you a couple things um first i wanted to assume some comments that have come directly to me was about the dogs on the beach and um i wrote back also saying that we have and i spoke with the city manager too on this a little bit of a problem on the dogs on the beach issue because we don't the the sheriff is very limited in terms of questions they could ask with the whether the dog is a service dog or not they're not allowed to ask for proof so they almost have to take the person at their word yeah it's a service dog and maybe it doesn't look right maybe it doesn't smell right but they are limited in terms of their questions so um if we you know we can call the sheriff but i think this comes to one of those things that unless we start changing around our deployment of police personnel um it gets difficult for them to control the beach and control our city so we have some supplemental if it becomes a problem maybe that's something we can kind of target or put somebody undercover there and see what they see but we are somewhat limited when it comes to this dog issue and that's again thank you tallahassee the sheriff can ask like two questions and that's it so i'm not going to say what they are but it's very limited so that's what the dogs on the beach issue is i touched on the beach access points i'm just going to remind um mysteries that i had nice really nice conversation about this um just you know be vigilant with the police just keep it reminded because i'm starting to see it come in again and that's i think what created the friction point last year with us in bel air shore and these people don't respect other people's property rights not people coming in here you know our residents do but you know some of the outsiders really don't um mark being hit on the presentation it was about an hour's presentation from his headquarter resources and what they do is they look for alternatives instead of just dumping sand back on the beach and this renourishment process then you put it on it blows away and gets washed away and you put more they actually make it so that nature takes its course by them altering nature by putting up these different little mini islands and things like this it's a very engineered process i liked what i heard until we got to the point of the price and the price was like 19 million dollars to do like a mile and i'm like okay that's great that's by the way these are 2015 numbers so i heard that and i said well that's great but that would be what 10 years worth of budgets for us so you need help if we're going to do this we would have to get work if there's federal grants available or something like that that's great if we could work it with another city or something that's great but i don't even know for bella beach to do our little section beach and if dollar shore is not doing anything i don't know if we accomplish anything they do have some nice stuff with the marina i was looking at what they did in one of the east these east coast cities in florida and i mean it looked like the marina was much bigger than ours but the layout the way they had the boats i mean there was a lot more boats over there so i think that has some possibilities because that we can generate revenue with but i just want you to know that i mean i like everything i heard with these folks and they're doing stuff that nobody else is doing but that price was a killer and that was the problem um the uh living rooms hit on the um this housing bill uh the short-term rentals keep an eye on it right now it wouldn't affect us but that doesn't mean it can't change um the other thing out there i haven't read a lot into this but we have a discussion also about this whole idea of this home-based business thing and it's not just professional businesses i think tallahassee is thinking about well do any business you want from your house well that's not what we want our beach so keep an eye on that bill and see where it's going i will tell you this i also went to suncoast league the cities and i kind of go there once in a while not all the time their priorities aren't necessarily our priorities so if we see this legislative session starts within a couple of days if we're seeing stuff we don't like then it's up to us to get in touch with these legislators because like some ghosts their priority is like they're gonna go line item on the short-term rentals they're even opposing the whole thing they said just make line item changes so they're calling acquiescing on and we'll give it to you that we're going to make change in the short term um just make line item changes so we're kind of going to be on our own watch that year right now it doesn't affect us but it's really easy for somebody to change that year and then what's our year in 2011 11 yeah so if if they change 2011 then it does affect us as for this home-based business thing look i've got no problem with a professional working from their house i don't even care if they see a client now and then but i do care if there's an auto body shop next to me or you know anything else i've had first time first-hand experience with this and first house that i ever lived in the lady had a hairdressing salon and it went from one chair to three chairs and the whole street was filled with people and it's just not what you want in your neighborhood so you got to keep an eye on that one other than that we have an election coming up and i just want to encourage everybody to vote you've heard stuff tonight if you like what you hear go to the polls if you don't like what we hear go to the polls but go to your polls because it doesn't get done on social media it gets done at the polls with that said one person we know is not coming back as mark dean marv i'll say the uh the real nice words for the next time but i just want to tell you it has been an honor to serve with you you are the epitome of what it means to be a council member and professionalism here and this city has had eight uh six years of your hard work and i thank you it has been a pleasure working with you and i hope to see you a lot when you're now enjoying yourself uh that will earn retirement we are adjourned"
