weren't aware we had a lot of vehicle Mercury's one weekend during the month of December it was the weekend I believe of December 10th and 11th so with that being said uh there was also one motor motor vehicles that related to that partnered where a key was left inside an unlocked vehicle so with that being said again we use the Sheriff's Office strongly encourage residents and visitors to make sure they lock their doors and not leave any valuables inside if we move along to the arrest section there were a total of four people that were arrested within the city and in looking at the activity that looked like that was transient activity a couple of DUIs and a DW lsrs under Deputy activity you'll see that there were a total of 720 events in the city leaving that were directly controls and tracks active I'm sorry traffic enforcement and then there was one crash in the city and that was located at Gulf Boulevard at 7th Street and then there were a total of 174 combined citations and warnings issued within a city and that is all I have actually canceled that Mr Baker um which Carver police back in December 10th and 11th I mean Ed was anyone apprehended at Cape caught in in the research that I did that had not yet been anybody apprehended the detectives are following up on any leads looking at video evidence and whatever they can find to go from there I just wanted a comment that um what that is uh honestly and I wasn't working that weekend my deputies weren't working that weekend but I enjoyed as part of routine Patrol driving up and down on the street within the city and I can tell you that Deputy Dean also enjoys driving up and down the city sits on McDon Boulevard so unfortunately we can't be everywhere so that's where we strongly encourage residents to make sure that they lock their doors completely very valuables inside any other questions or comments thank you very much Sergeant thank you all right now we're on the code enforcements from our monthly report good evening Mr mayor council members staff citizens Deputy clacka for the record as you've seen your reports we I get very busy for the month of January some of the things that we did

hearings for you to get these properties cleaned up and again throughout the city also trying to get some more of the uh citizens to comply with local ordinances um had a few extra issues with permits again a relations contractors but again we were working on that building department in the Idaho Wisconsin questions or comments from the council yeah I'm looking down the list here 109 13th Street was that mentioned on previous month reports of code violations uh 109 13th shows here's posted notice reference to violation uh yes that was a an issue there had a pool installed there and and so there's a set in the bag that had to be changed so we had we had some issues with that before any other questions or comments I didn't notice that we received more information than we usually do which is uh which is nice I'm sure it's a it's a five effort to put all this together but this is uh this is incredible in the data and it's nice to see it thank you rob the credit's got to go to Kyle use my teacher and we just kind of worked on these things together but yes all right thank you very much thank you all right now we are on the item four this is a presentation from Pinellas SunTrust fire and rescue this District by Chief Jeff Davidson I have invited Jeff Davis monthly reports again thank you good evening mayor and council members and Community I'm Jeffrey Davidson a fire chief for Pinellas on both fire and rescue District are they serving another Beach on behalf of the entire District I wanted to express my sincere thank you for the support on passing the referendum vote in November by 74 percent which will allow us to continue to serve our residents in Baylor Beach and we've been serving since 1951 so thank everybody very much for your support there's a lot of activity in psfrd as we continue to strengthen our organization we're actively pursuing the assistance of firefighter grants through FEMA and based on our population of our eligible for up to one million dollars in funding and we're looking at all the items that meet the notice the funding opportunities requirements this mission to do this Friday and awards begin weekly in September so we're submitting for new fire hose extrication equipment bunker gear thermal imaging cameras new Motorola radios physical any of the things that firefighters need to do their jobs in the upcoming months I will be asking my Board of Commissioners to allow me to put out a RFP for fire station designing instruction we are conducting a study to verify the proper placement of the stations and currently we are looking at a place for a new fire station at the very Northern end of to better serve the city of Bel Air Beach our firefighters and paramedics recently save the life of a commissioner the neighboring Town who has suffered a massive heart attack early placement of the AMD and CPR by the police chief who was there was very instrumental my Crews arrived in under four minutes and they performed Advanced cardiac life support and Jason was transported to Aloha hospital and he made a full recovery their commission honored Mike firefighters for their efforts and then I submitted that to the John Maroney Legacy foundation and art groups were chosen out of all of Pinellas County to receive an award that the First Responders appreciation dinner this Saturday so I'm very proud of the hard work and the Professional Services that our firefighters in Paradise always provide to our community I would like to ask the Commissioners here today council members to allow me to use the Bellaire Beach City Hall to do any public information session upcoming on the status of the Emergency Medical Services for the beaches particularly in order Beach and how the services need to be improved and will be funded by the county at no additional cost to our residents um if I could have your permission to coordinate a debate that the hall is open and looking at possibly February 27th so Monday night and it's going to be open to questions answers and a presentation from anyone you would like to attend thank you Chief Davidson or Council for Iowa from the floor over to you uh does anyone have a problem with the Deep working a date out in the city management it sounds like you just need to reach out to the city manager and uh and we've had a plan of nature equipment and we look forward to that now council do you have any questions for the priority I mean I have to have one what was the response time on the event that you described the risk from notification to the fire department to at the patient was uh four minutes and three seconds I believe and that's one of the things that I want to explain in this presentation is the correlation between time and survival rate you know there's a lot of things that in the miracle field where tying this muscle if it's cardiac event or a thymus brain this is stroke um and things that need to be done and some things that are lacking in the system that have been lacking for quite some time and I want to address how we can fix that so that we can have the best services for our residents and all of our visitors to keep everybody safe thank you very much that's a it's an impressive time and uh I hope that I never have to use your services but if I do I hope you're not necessary I got a few business cards on the table if anyone would like to get a hold of any error my email address and phone number is on there you can call me and again thank you thank you thanks all right we're up to item number five this is the city attorney's report Mr Moore thank you Mr Mayor during the last few weeks I had the occasion to meet with a manager on a few occasions on various items one of which was facility in two meetings with the planning and zooming wardens in this capacity as your land Planning Association so we continue to move forward potential plan amendments as well as one of the ordinances that's before you this evening as we approach discussing the ordinance this evening it encouraged me that before our last meeting on the 21st I had the opportunity to travel to St Augustine and present to the institute for elected Municipal officials email your new Wisconsin member joined there and it's happened and I had the opportunity to present on parliamentary procedure in the role of the City attorney and one of the things that I talked to about at some length I mean that was only a few weeks after having given a similar presentation to the Volusia County Commission was on the importance of debating the measure at hand and not the individual members or motives of your peers ostensibly we are all here in service of the public trust at the last meeting and on at least one likely two occasions that I can remember previously there's been some suggestion that I could use for product for you with these purpose of generating lawsuits or some other profit mechanism for myself on the back end I take my job very seriously I take the my both the four and more I don't know if I take the Constitutional officer Charter officer in your communities this is my livelihood this time food on the table this is my good name so it's important to me that you recognize that as I give you work products I take no issue with you telling me that you're unsatisfied with the cool world product that you think the policy should go in a different direction be better frame better frames approach differently take into account factors that I may have in my uh valuable state we'll see Overlook some Factor I'm happy to consider all of that all of that is appropriate I will I do take numbers with a suggestion that I'm doing work driven by some profit motive almost especially because I I truly believe in the altruism and what it is you folks do I thank you for the work you do because frankly I don't do it I get to tell you man that sounds like a tough decision tell me what you're going to say um and and that's how this whole system works I can't allow um something that's in city of success they want to address and I did not wish to deraily or the work session as you debated an important matter to your community by addressing it in that moment but it was something that to me I've helped me to address them so I appreciate the opportunity to address that during my report otherwise I continue to work with the manager to advance the suggested Provisions in the sign code to advance your comp plan administry the LPA and any other issues as they present themselves and I'm happy to answer any questions or addressing concerns and accountable for any questions yeah I just want to thank you personally uh you know looking at what you do for us and leave some photography with you I appreciate everything you do for a discount so thank you very much I appreciate that and I'm certainly not efficient for any compliments or any of those sort of I appreciated Jessica extremely clear that actions of our contrast anyone else want to look at comment all right thank you for addressing that and uh also and uh all right next we are about to item six which is the city manager's report Mr reefer thank you mayor council um starting off with the 12th and 13th Street for All American Supply we did on January 24th to get that I'm going to talk about the last meeting replaced um under warranties from the manufacturer stack it up there immediately put it back in so that the check balance function properly and they're not getting tied watching that Industries um we came a little bit over budget that is on the agenda tonight for a budget amendment I did get one of the quotes back from the televised or the Cure voice line and about fifty thousand dollars I want to see if I can get that out for bid possibly in a solar project competitive pricing on that it would be useful to us and maybe prepare yourself open and tired out on on the bed the underground project right now we're just waiting on the materials let's do this materials stop probably at the marina same places in the last project it'll take off pretty quickly with the comment program the 7th Street boat ramp I got a sketch drawing from the engineer it was the last meeting you asked for something really moved around the functional for the residents he recommended if we could do anything to be drugs Ketch of a concrete bags at the end of the ranch in burlap and uh in her I guess you can say something to see who's holding that up and some Thundercracker underneath it and he says that's done in a lot of areas and it'll just increase like the stability of the crowd after the wraps so I'm glad I ordered all the supplies my staff um finishing that up after that you know they replaced all the filter and they saw it on January 26th I think it did a beautiful job really excited to get to go there hoping for lessons um for our 17th and 33 18th streets project uh that I was since it was about to return on schematic and I have been working pretty hard as well with Heather our financial advisor and putting together projections for the next five years and we've shared that with financers and we're looking good to be a proof of a loan but at this point we're not we received one term sheet for one minute and we're trying to get another from South State so um at that point I'm going to take back to the CAC and then eagerness with us at one of these reviews for the presentation for the whole um code enforcement uh like I said I kind of revise the report I tried to make it a little bit more visual take out a lot of that the check boxes that were in between all the cells and uh related back to the surgery we did so I so what I did is I had a complete Steve's report a drop down list of the categories we've talked about in our service so that he could select what you know what where the issue fell and how to get tracking it and then you'd be able to put them in his back it would be surveys um another thing I noticed I was looking at it is you kind of have like a start date to call it a day if you looked at every violation it was like it started even closing the same day and then you have this today's open thing it didn't really apply to anything so I reworked the sheets so that um and it started to speak it would you know as far as fighting or whatever the violation he keeps that date and then he comes back and closes it up bounces back around and shows until the issue is solved um like I said I try to put some grass in here I'm using an Excel just to kind of give it an overview of your video if you're going to look at it real quick you can see kind of areas you're focusing on if there's any concerns from the council I think you know you'll be able to see where the efforts can be focus and maybe ask questions um the other graph it's a little polygraph this is on the streets I think Steve does pretty good job getting around the city pretty pretty unique that just kind of things out on the different streets is here and then we last um table I put it was an outstanding code violations and this was actually an idea from my guys again who asked you know what's going on with this issue and how do we get information on how there's a very good point because the code enforcement report it shows along that line with the track things that are outstanding so I kind of put together just outstanding I think it's good because um you know somebody shows about all our clients so that just everyone's living hell and uh you know this Pro violation of notices or hearings are sent out so thank you the city hall generator I got another option that it's a it's a mobile unit it's used it's got a one-year warranty I asked if there's any extended warranty plan for that but it's a diesel generator and if we were to get because in the past if you remember it was I think we're going into the fire department but we had a moment so it's pretty much the same idea to run the whole building if we use the same connection point which would be in the back it's a lower elevation but it would be 97 000. but if we want to it is another option because the parking lot's a higher area and you know if you get some flooding down in there we can put the connection station where the crawl spaces by building in the front parking lot and pull right up into there and so it wouldn't be uh we would be avoiding the cost of putting up on a stain engine and you know we've covered away when you're using a thing I ask you where you would store but uh give you a little tight when we do it we stockpile from materials there's something just do that um Gulf New Mexico movie replacement I have a permanent I'm waiting on one more installation quote that uses I I did find a contractor to do with about 12 500 for the 60 Foods that's another 1120. um and then as far as uh Elder Shore um I relayed the message to their uh their calendar tournament and she was taking us through February the 21st meeting um along the lines that if we were willing to fund the cost of the isolation of the police and the maintenance would lead to to the other necessary steps to change part of life children's play around like the shipping they got pushed back to April 14th it sounds like it's solid at this point a little disappointing it's taking so long but the the used place that company is still interested in including the other one so I'm trying to keep them in touch thank you Council for these questions yes Mr Baker two questions do you know the bank of the generator it's a job here 13th Street and it's sitting back and reported seeing this value here eight years I guess he's not getting married it's just the washer and talking about or whatever this is uh I wasn't planning on interacting it at all this was just information okay to speak thank you any other questions or comments for the city mayor Chris Rose so Kyle on the um extending the boat ramp on 7th Street on this period so and I should go down to myself to see it but when it's low time is the end of the round still in the water or is it hot it's very very low it really pulled back I mean you get that Long Island other than it gets exposed so there's still good after that far out future okay if that's what they want to do it's possible but it really does grow back okay so the engineering firm has in mind some distance that you're going to extend those concrete bands for red bags to allow other trailers to go further they go further out yeah basically get down to the bottom of the sovere thread and just um as far as the water going back it really times out you know we're just gonna work out if they can okay the goal is to make sure that they didn't have a list that they would fall off your rent um the 17th and 18th Street stormwater project so that's listed there is a single project but we're really not pursuing that as a single project is that correct that's correct that's why we want to to pull a bond issue or an alone trying to do all the projects okay um any other questions or comments Mr Rayford uh I gave you a call three or two ago about a situation where there was growth coming out into the street it was a hazard it was I won't mention what street it was but it was an unfortunate situation where the homeowner was physically impossible now in order to do anything about it um they were Advanced haircut and then staff took care of him and I greatly appreciate it as I'm sure the residents do that's around that so thank you very much yes sir thank you on the 12th and 13th Street I did see the contract out there maybe a week or two ago where they were investing some of the low spots and better this is wonderful but it looks like and I know you would probably know more than I if you're watching but it looks like kind of a domino effect where they would raise the gutter level to make the water move in a certain direction and it may have caused you know an additional problem Upstream effect in the other system but I know you're on top of that so I think finished completely because I have still a nose and gutters that are polished water we're still holding entertainment so all the engineers go back okay and there was that one session they put that uh flow line and it was pretty much fun like by the top okay is there a specific area about 12 or 13 yeah would they were working kind of on 12 well close to the pond the side of the pond so they were working in there raising it which is the low spot so they were trying to create a scenario that water would move through the grates it wasn't sure it did but they're doing so it sort of looked like because they raised that area to move the water and some water Upstream is now being held back but something let's take a look at and across the street I didn't notice one thing that I've asked before one of the grades looks like I guess they weren't removed doing the original projects to this philantha veterans Rusty right right there at the turn they come in when you're heading east on 12 and you make a left-hand turn what's that bad easing all day right there on the left hand side it maybe that was one of those braids where we couldn't get them out I'm not sure what to deal with sir it should all be new grants and I think I'll stick with it okay thanks anyone else oh all right thank you very much so next next seven at his entry I don't have a project update per se but for personnel we saw through that area really jumped in both these really enthusiastic and then we made a offer of employment for an administrative assistant so we're waiting for that process to go through you know for more help and print to help some investors yeah all right thank you very much any questions for a thank you very much all right now we are up to the consent agenda items eight and nine is for approval on January 9th 2023 city council uh and approval of the January 23rd 2023 city council work session events [Music] second [Music] Floyd Roberts all in favor aye any opposed Senate agenda passes all right we are now on to the regular agenda item number 10 that is under consideration for the appointment of Mr Mark Mariano is a board adjustments an alternate member Mariano's present would you like to address the council sure continue the council mayor thanks for having me so recently moved to the city of Elder Beach approximately a year ago moved from the town of Bel Air served on the landing board there for about seven or eight years um I have about 24-ish years of experience in land planning City Planning I hope my own real estate development company not the CEO of another real estate development company so I could bring a unique perspective and level experience to rewards and then you like to give back to the community and participate as an important member where I can and when I moved in I without any openings there were several fact towards the end of the year asked again she said yeah there are two adjustments and then one for inner Parks and Rec for the Republicans best applicable to explain right so I sent the application in and Mr Gentry said you know why don't you come in and then I'll meet the Lord there is a alternative spot open so from here to see if I can maybe appointed to the board of adjustments thank you very much first off am I pronouncing your name correct okay good I'd like you to stick around for just a few minutes uh council do you have any questions for Mr Mariano yes are you pursuing any uh business within military at this time no we don't we do multi-family residential apartment communities that was my old company and we do multi-family but at single family rental large scale 350 400 unit developments throughout Florida and seven other states across the country so no nothing any other questions okay Mr Mariano I I heard a little bit about you and and uh apparently you were just grossly over Paul for this position however if you would like to stick around and work with us we'll wait and see what the council says and and I appreciate you applying for the position all right all right let's go to the citizen you can have a seat sir let's go to the citizens for the comments I really would like about it yes sir Mike Kelly evening Council my name is Mike Kelly I'm your court of adjustment chairman I agree that Mr Mariano is very very qualified for the position I think the opportunity or a board to to him as an alternate member and potentially a ultimately on the actual award is is an advantage in order for Bellaire Beach I've had the opportunity to work with Mr Mariano's development company Mosaic in the last two years at a commercial project in downtown St Petersburg although I only had a couple meetings with him reconstruction working with the general contractor the job went very smooth and uh staff and the experience that I had working with this firm was very very positive so I endorse the council to consider his appointment and recommend him to be headed to our board thank you very much Mr Kelly all right before we debate this is going to need a motion to move forward material you had before right would anyone else would like to comment all right well if that's the case of this Gentry would you please call the world yes councilmember Vancouver yes council member Livingstone yes council member Notaro yes council member Roberts I'm council members able yes all right so uh passage unanimously congratulations Mr Mariano thank you thank you for volunteering to serve the city of Baylor Beach all right if we are on to attend the item number 11. as consideration of ordinance 23-01 Mr Moore would you please read the ordinance can I believe this is America this is ordinance 23-01 Norton's of the city council the city of Philadelphia section 74-220 13 areas and housing setbacks providing perceptibility and providing for an effective date this has been a first reading the board is 23-015 all right all right and I'll thank you Mr Mora uh yes you're about to give us a brief history of this ordinance and what if we'll accomplish because there's been a few in the recent months of a few hearings that have received into variance not based on any um misrepresentations by a property owner or perhaps not even based on staff oversight but based on confusion with how the City's coach should be administered as you can see typically in a strike through underlining I don't call things out in red text I didn't hear because of the density of the table but you can see here that the code made reference to a metal view of the states in a few instances spelled v-i-e-w there is no such place in the city prior ordinance actually did have the right language there but as it was codified it was unclear America it was it was uh written incorrectly as codified however in addition to that edit there was no substance that leading very final row provided a completely different set of setbacks you can see here it's a 7.7 and a half in the final row that suggests that they'll use its Island side setbacks were seven and a half feet well earlier towards the top of the same page it says that it's 10 feet unless it's on a series of certain laws in which case it's seven and a half and so as administering and it became very difficult for the engineers and otherwise to reconcile those positions and see okay if somebody is applying what's the number well it's kind of sort of this but also that and So to avoid that confusion this is what in some communities might be called a housekeeping matter of cleaning up the code to avoid that confusion and that's what provision does this is an instance of your city manager as the administrator of the code having administrated in a few instances now and said I think we can do better Randy can you draw something up we took before GMC PNG reviewed it at the beginning last week and recommended approval to the commission found in line with the commission move forward and so it is now before you went frustrated before we go to the council we need to go to the citizens or maybe citizenlife comment on this ordinance 23-01 oh all right I'm going to need a motion to approve a coordinates 23-01 and then we will discuss motion motion made by Frank Baker who I have a second by Lloyd Roberts Mr Baker do you have before um I guess the ordinance is what it says I have to use anything a little discussion here anyone else I do have a question who caught this my health office in the East Movement he's over here clearing address after after a couple instances where um you know property owners are on their developers representatives were trying to apply and try and make sure the administrative code properly and I would say that kind of I caught it I prioritized it now this was an issue that manifested only in the last less than two months and Kyle immediately said well we I know we can change nice job uh do we have any other questions or comments and yes um I understand there's a section 94 8220 recording in progress um it says minimum living areas and then it says within the residential public history the following the next living areas and minimum house setbacks and then a little bit of a living area is it that would be harmonized by second reading and that was in the original text as well and I appreciate you catching that and bringing into my extension so right before the meeting and we'll definitely make sure that that is harmonized member material is noting that it says the title of the section is minimum living areas and setbacks and well we're concerned with setbacks here right principally um the next sentence under it says maximum the table goes maximum so you just need to fix that minus the following Max in that change yeah so that will be done before your next reading thank you any more comments before we uh councilman Baker yes council member Livingstone yes council member of tarot yes council member Robert hi council member Sable aye here guys hi so it passes unanimously that is the first reading of coordinates 23-01 okay we are on to agenda item number 12. it's for authorization to execute continuing contracts for Engineering Services and this was placed on the agenda by city manager Cleveland Mr Ray for you at the board thank you Matt um so in October council meeting uh it was recommended in the philology and to give to an RFQ for uh Dynamic engineer contractor services so from that point returning tomorrow provided me with a great type of a styrofoam that he was comfortable with and we changed it around for our purposes and advertising November 16th and we received Steven's qualifications that was all the way up to December 20th from there distributed the packages to Heather our Financial Consultant and at that point six foreign up um again my recommendation because we've determined that all these if you're foreign I'm recommending that all six we can continue the contracts with and then when we have a proposal we send them out and see what we get back okay I bet that that was a uh very interesting interview process and uh before we uh bring it back to the council do we have any comments around the citizens right uh I'm going to need a motion to authorize the city manager to execute continuing contracts for Engineering Services do I have a motion so look [Music] eligible contractors and uh just like the little two of them any other comments uh yes Mr Roberts uh just a quick question Tom so once this gets fast or something confident it will and we have the six engineering firms in-house what's the process that you typically use so when we have a need for an engineering firm do we have a process in place what is the process doing um the process sort of changes with this RFQ because it does have an actual logo which was signed projects here okay so it's called work authorization formulas from the scheduling of the back contract and um for example like if we were going to install my project we write it up on that form in a universal format and engineer friends to have a contract um the other thing would be the site plan review same idea we're going to put together the school and lay out all our needs and we're kind of actually feeling right now but that's all we'll take care of and then I mean you and your team which is fine internally you guys mentioned decision whatever the qualification process is to be one of the awarded um my idea of the site plan review is to have multiple firms on Deck I remember when we ran into in the past and we had one person did it very well had health issues and then it was kind of scrambling right right so I'd like to at least kind of have two in practice um and then you know go from there that's that's more along the lines of um so it has a new build it's a hundred dollar fee Cuban keeping the fees that it's left in check with the Engineering Services officer they're having to be invoice for majorities when it's a project proposal um that would be will distribute the work authorization form with the proposals back but that will come before you um because of the large number at that point you know okay very good thank you other questions for the mystery equipment I'm sure in this answer no okay let's take it to the this is to authorize the city manager to execute the continuing contracts Services Patty councilmember Baker yes council member let me stone yes yes council member Notaro yes council member Robert council member label aye goddess aye and it passes you unanimously Mr reefer you are authorized to proceed thank you all right we are up to item number 13 consideration of approval for a budget amendment to increase the storm water system account due to project changeovers also was placed on the agenda by City management Mr brief what are you having for okay just to clarify that um the money will come from the same clothing store in order to fund is it's increasing our project budget based on the alerts that we experience and that accounts a total amount is 30 977.98 that's made up of twenty six thousand five hundred sixty two dollars and 98 cents which was from the main contractor coming uh Luke Blitz they exceeded the contract which I'm going to um and then the other is for because of some conflicts of the experiencing this more additional engineering hours of the field and that was a an increase in that trans systems which was previously doing social security remember engineered science group originally I had this contract in the improved Circle in that kind of insurance so some kind of shuffled that out but the uh I just went over the history here and the original contractor now um one thing we pretend that was when we did a total in my office set about 717 000 um base profit by an island it was 652 000 and then you know with every project we have 10 contingency and um in that bed you know if instead of having those built into the contract we had the recently didn't come out of the contingency continue to see the market um over the course of the project we had seven change orders which is to cover the inlet box a lot of fun conflict structure an unknown RCP removal plus replacement 12 inch PVC pipe we it was a smaller changer decided to put a class three our cost for our RCP versus class free because um um the United president asphalt increase so the propagated years and lastly we didn't survive Mr billing because if you're about to hit 12th Street and 13th Street Crown of the road has been extremely high in there right so it's a lot of asphalt overlaid on top and in some areas it was like five so we did some extra healing experience more in line with the curve for the final project I think the engineers that calculated the immigration um so I included not only their payout but I included my spreadsheet and I tried to track people out there and um there's two items that um that would significant over um over what what their positions crushed concrete base and uh there was a explanation from the engineer because of the additional pipe that we put in areas where we had to do the conflict structures needed more things so that ran over the other area to point out in the if needed items was the great driveway of the place in there after discussing with the engineer the great driving replacement is he was in estimated love that there really was no way of going around so I just got you know for future projects you know ask you know this this is not this is contract and I think that would have gave us a better forecast for the whole year just there's no contract um and then like like I said the additional field for from the engineering to deal with the conflicts uh we had some inaccuracies with the surveyor she'll talk to him previously um just caused a lot of money thank you very much let's go to the citizens we would like to make it now man uh now we're back to the Council of native motion for approval the budget remember to increase the stormwater system account do I have a motion what should we think about this second second second Ary you had before I have a very great job of explaining what this is The Landings so I'll just do it again and anyone else would like to comment or ask a question uh yeah this is just brief I just received the text said hey can I hear some of the people outside which are not here it's marked as admin our microphones or services around the internet connections or so I have questions thank you Bill and I apologize for stopping forward all right um request a question yes Mr Roberts um I think that's a great idea in the future process if anything we can do is to minimize phrase so we can tighten down I'm closer at the end of the project so I think that's great in the future when you do that because that's perfect I too appreciate the Great [Music] ER especially whenever you're asking for them a very refreshing and I'm sure all of us appreciate it we have any more comments or questions before we take this commitment all right councilmember Baker yes council member locaro yes council member ladies so yes council member Roberts aye council members Abel aye mayor goddess hi perfect score tonight unanimous Mr reefer you are approved to amend the budget okay now we are on to unfinished business pretty much covered everything in the city management support and uh is outstanding but right and now we are on to council member comics this month the computers selected councilmember Roberts do you have the floor is that like the lottery so um actually I do have something to say final about the um on the 12th and 13th Street project so did the curator plates with the two clients that are actually that go to the Outlaws and interior we plug in our previously could we could we talk to the engineering firm to see if they could come up with addition alternate options obviously occurred in places one option another one might be the slip line and those bikes that would reduce some of the volume but it's a pipe within a pipe technology changes so fast out there so if we hit asks foreign [Music] May save us money and provide us with similar quality solution just so we're not confining the bid so one option and perhaps there's another option available out there that they are aware of but we didn't give them that flexibility defense thank you Mr Roberts next step is council member Nigeria council member of Livingston good evening I had a conversation with Kyle before the meeting at his citizen come up to me inquiring about the road signs in Bel Air and how the Sun fading has affected several of them in the cloud was assured me that those rounds happen on a semi-annual basis and then with the implementation of our new team member that we will be checking that and I'll be on his checklist thank you very much and just for the rest of us if we have a home and and the road signs are in your home and there's some foliage and edges whatnot that are competing those signs just to be aware of that and make sure for the safety of all of our residents that that we take care of those business it all showed me that that's our our responsibilities homeowners so thank you for that Kyle and welcome our new team member on board as a community like this evening and also welcome from here just the color he had a very like what anything you got in about 3 30 this morning so he was very tired normally we'd say there's no excuse for that right council member Baker who kind of interested in America all right council member Sable sure just want to say thank you to councilman Frank Baker for the immigration and the Pledge of Allegiance and for admin I I will be out the next monthly council meeting and I got a corporate meeting down on the west coast but I've seen him thank you very much right um vice mayor Shirley is out so uh now I'm up I met with the other same team Mayors today as along with the county commissioner Brian Scott we discussed alternatives for each University right now it looks like the Army Corps of Engineers it's unwilling to move on this right there and talk to Heavy Rain land which storm is just a willing away our age and we're in good shape of the others further south on City Island today was just a start we had some some Library discussion and I think having a commissioner Scott there the word will get back to the County Commission that it's probably time that they seriously consider doing something for our ages without the beaches they would not be able to let the amount of Revenue that they do and I think it's time that they consider giving some of that back to save our ages we're meeting again soon and we're also going to take the County Administrator for a little tour to show him exactly what's going on with the beaches make sure that he's fully aware and uh help cattle um as we continue to discuss this and have these meetings I will do everything I can to keep you updated during our meetings uh and other than that as always I'd like to thank everyone for coming out tonight and for those attending at home I do apologize if there was a break in communication and uh keep keep your messages coming in if there's a failure please notify one of this if not the city manager just to make them aware that maybe we should off the community and without all that being said do I have a motion to adjourn motion adjourn motion made by Frank Baker do I have a second second name cards all in favor aye aye any opposed good night everyone thank you"
