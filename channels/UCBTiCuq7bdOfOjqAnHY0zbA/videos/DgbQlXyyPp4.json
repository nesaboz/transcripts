the first uh picture shows the new work done the first the very first one yeah yeah the new this area where the water stays there is negative in front of the driveway here's the negative pitch three second yeah 3/4 of an inch so can you keep running another NE pitch over here qu of an inch that makes it 1 in can you keep wrong okay that is the end of uh 23rd Street by B sh approximately this picture shows with the level with the laser beam shows 21 in and there is further down probably 3 four more inch so that is what my level shows the the two levels go and and B about 2 ft to work with 2 ft of pitch here go okay here here my driveway there is no pitch in front of the driveway P starts here this is the further from go is there the further end of goou uh but it's already probably 5 six inch the new one higher than where it was the the previous one can you roll all the way to the end that is how it was there another one the same that's there is there was a v the new one has no V that's where the 56 are lost that's 3 minutes thank I'm interested thank you uh can you roll back okay this is the middle of the street the level was was placed here so the level itself has about when place on the ground is about 3/4 an inch where the laser beam is so that those 3/4 and the the 1 in that that was negative makes 1 and 3/4 this is the middle of the street that shows if the curve is R Done from there to the to go Boulevard there is about 8 eight 8 and 1/2 in to work with out of the 2 ft uh can you r no no this is between 10 102 and 104 uh which is the second c i I apologize for interrupting but could I suggest if you might start at the end and tell us what your major point is and I see that you're you're supporting that point but is your point that there's not sufficient slope in the street or you saying that there's a dip I'm not quite sure no sufficient slope and in front of my property there is no room for a pitch I I I have a I have an idea city manager Reaper

completely lost okay yeah that's not is that okay because I I think uh he's going to speak for you whenever whenever the time comes okay okay [Applause] thank you sir do we have other citizen comments seeing as we have none uh citizen comments are now closed all right is anyone here from the penel sunos fire and rescue District tonight no may I got a last email from Chief D said an emergency okay uh did he send see if he sent anything in a report I don't think he did there is a report in the packet actually printed that one would you like to uh summarize Mr uh looks like they had 12 calls for service in b beach through May 27th um that included motor vehicle accident accidents medical responses and electrical hazards um looks like they're still working on purchasing the uh the land to build a new fire station but it is moving along and um it's you know to replace the uh or to continue to design a Mainland fire station to replace a old station and the uh personnel has been recertified for preal traval life support as well as their medical recertifications any questions for the city manager all right thank you very much all right now we are on to the City attorney report this is item number five on the agenda Mr Mor you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor the whole fire CH thing threw me off there we go all right let's go backwards item three uh the pels County Sheriff's Office uh would Ser would you please come up and give your presentation and uh good evening mayor and the council my name is Sergeant John Shields with the sheriff's office I have the stats for the month of April for b beach uh we've had zero for the month of April which is uh down from March which is a good thing uh we had three arrests within the city uh during the month of April which are on the statistics uh listed there also there was 400 a total of 489 events within the city during the month of April uh and we had 562 units responding to those events very fortunately we had no crashes within the city during the month of April and we had 158 citations uh to include warnings within the city during the month of April which is the breakdown is within that uh the statistics that were presented does anyone have any questions about these El any questions you say traffic penalty is that like a DUI or yes they are broken down the arrests uh there was one Miser uh traffic felony which is a dwsr which driving while license is suspended for the third conviction uh makes it a a felony uh then we had some other traffic misdemeanors that are broken down thank you yes sir any other questions Sergeant who has jurisdiction to patrol the inter Coastal here within the Waterway itself yes uh FWC Drew generally has that Waterway and we support them within this uh section it breaks up depending on the area sometimes it's FWC sometimes it's our Sheriff's Office with in GRE all right how do we address questions like the um no weight rules around the protected Islands it seems like that's been violated with more frequency can I understand that there was a manity baby that was recently killed at least a little further Downstream so concern at it the only un fortunate way we can enforce those is whether it depends on the section of of Waterway whether it's the FWC or the our Marine units that were out with the Sheriff's Office and it's just being out and about uh we do have a larger contingency get boats and uh enforcement that we have on the water but unfortunately we can't be everywhere at once sometimes with the memorial weekend that we just had uh it was all hands on deck and everybody was out on the Waterway so we try very hard to be where as much as possible uh we try to be where the concentration of the most people are in responding for calls you know water rescues and uh disabled boats and things like that so it's kind of we have a lot of resources but it is sometimes stretched thin we try our best yes ma'am thank you any other questions yes here real quick I noticed in March we had two assaults any general or specific information regarding that as to what actually happened for March we had two assaults we don't I don't have those stats right now uh to bring up in um those could be open cases also and we're not able to comment on any open cases I would have to look in for the MCH of March um it's uh our uniform uh UCR codes sometimes the cases are open and sometimes they're closed with an arrest uh if there's more um late work or investigation that Happ has to be done usually they stay open until they exhaust All Leads or those are already done uh closed by arrest but I don't have no specific stats on those uh two events okay I was more concerned about whether or not they were assaults from one citizen to another citizen I would be more concerned if it was a non-citizen just roolling around that assaulted a citizen yes uh I don't believe that was it um but I don't have the exact information but I did make a note to try to get that information you wel thank you Sergeant I'm a little curious about the saltwater Fisheries violation is that somebody fishing with a license or they catching theong several different things it could be a fish that is over or under the slot limit it could be fishing without a fishing license it could be um mullet Fisheries it could be a plethora of different uh events that handoff event from the FWC typically not uh typically we usually we check waterways periodically people fishing from Bridges or seaw walls and things and maybe it just was an encounter with a citizen that uh maybe they were had an expired license or not having a license at all or had an under or over slotted fish and uh my last question is have you heard any rumors of another season of dlet uh boat hunting I have not heard that sir no but I know the sheriff's office is constantly monitoring all the the Der boats that are in the the waterways within panel County okay I bring that up because you probably even saw the sailboat it was on its side three or four Mornings in a row almost all the way up to the to the where that little ramp is over there um if you hear anything we'd love to we'd love to know okay sir just it's a total Nu totally understand yes anything else for the sergeant I have one more question thank you um last month we talked about the fact that there were improvements at the intersection of Gul and Causeway with AI implemented lights and uh that was great news my casual observation is that it seems to be improved all the way up and down Bay and is that correct where other installations that may have improved the traffic flow I know it's an ongoing thing with uh Department of Motor Vehicles and public Highway uh with also with the Sheriff's Office and things but the County Highway uh they're always constantly working on them so we don't I personally don't get uh any stats that hey we're working for these projects and these are going to be in the future this is what we're doing but I know they're constantly trying to work and improve all these LS and the flow of traffic for all of these sections in gr ways I know it's a constant battle i m on several occasions managed to get all the way down to 19 without stopping which is pretty phenomenal you let me know how you did that all within the limit yes ma'am of course any other questions or comments so thank you Sergeant I appreciate it have a good evening next up Deputy Trump for the monthly code enforcement report good evening uh Deputy Trump with KY Sheriff's Office I the code enforcement officer and uh we had a slower month this uh this month with 24 enturies uh basically we had um I dealt with uh four high grass and weeds um one written ordinance violation uh with a fine uh two unpermitted remodels that uh dealt with uh one was a roof project another one was a project that really hadn't started yet it was more of a jacuzzi and an electrical issue there but we took care of that and uh I had two this last Memorial Day Weekend where basically the uh guys were out working on a couple of these houses they're trying to finish up the construction on but they were unaware that they weren't supposed to be doing construction on holiday so I had a little chitchat with them they're very Cooperative to try and take care of that and uh I added to the traffic citations myself with one coming off of uh uh 22nd Avenue and ran the four-way stop and then a little speeding so we stopped and you know gave him a little talking to and a citation there also um I was able to get out on beach enforcements on four different occasions with really no violations or anything else seen uh as far as on the beach everybody's been behaving themselves and trying to work accordingly any questions as far as this counil I'm want to jump on something that you brought together deut about fishing lions in that what are the requirements like when you're fishing on the beach I I know in Indian Rocks Beach you're now allow to fish when there's F 100 yards with an a fishing po I don't believe we have anything in our ordinance but you have to maintain you have to maintain some type of O yes if you're if you're fishing from the beaches you're still requ to salt water fishing I thought I think a lot of people come down the weekend or whatever it's very cheap to get it it is especially if it's just a temporary one like they're here on vacation they can go to Walmart they can go to almost just about any onl get go online there's several different ways they can get it they're very cheap just they have it so they're importance are they ever checked you guys ever checked for licenses or is that yes actually what was was brought up before with uh some of the saltwater pieres violations and stuff our marine unit will go out and they'll they'll hit the beaches once in a while they'll hit the uh Bridges they're not always on boats they may be in their trucks or however that's why uh the sergeant said they'll stop by underneath the bridges they'll catch or catch is bad word but they'll make contact with several citizens and they'll check for illegal fish illegal sizes make sure they have their uh their LIC there too so that may be exactly what was brought up in the last session thank you I I can add one thing to uh in reference to the boat that is out there the sailboat it has been taged by our marinum as a der like vess the process is not overnight the cases have to go on for 21 days once the case is finished and they have deemed it as a derik vessel and theyve not been able to make contact with the owners or dealing with it in a different way then the boat would be deemed his deric and we can remove it then the next process is getting the contracting company out there in order to remove it so they Tred they're trying to keep it within the time room roughly that 21 to 30 days to have it out of there but I do know that boat actually has been deed GL to hear that believe the county does is that right as far as the removal of the boats some of it is count but some of it they get through state grants also uh WC actually puts out a lot of the grants in order to get a lot of these Vats removed so it's a combination of very good to any other questions um you know I'm I'm guessing that this list is very short because either one or two they uh they heard the arbitrary new share of well I don't know but we did I mean like I said I've been working with Kyle and everything we've been looking you know trying to stay on top of everything we just it's been a slower month as far as complaints or problems or issues this has been one of the shortest lists I've seen yet why don't you just take credit for it okay yeah cuz when I come out here uh I try to even on the DAT that I'll hit the beach I try to get up and down every single Street in the city every day that I'm out here and you know double check that first before we even do any for or anything so it's just good seems to be working out I'm glad you're here yes sir just one other positive comment I noticed that the house on 21st Street I guess it's in ownership transition but it has been cleaned up 107 yes right which is a good I I stopped by I talked to one of the workers there who's actually a friend of the um I guess new owners if you want to put it that way and uh he was actually starting to work on the inside of course they had a mess inside I guess so um it was terrible but at least we right off the bat they got the front cleaned up and the yard cleaned up and everything else so it is going much better thank you any other questions or comments Deputy Trump no all right thank you very much sir thank you sir okay Mr Mo thank you Mr Mayor um happy report as far as we know this is a safe Memorial Day here in the city um over the past month I've done uh some presentations for the Florida Association of Code Enforcement I was just at the um fccma conference that uh Kyle was attending speaking on some new legislation that's been adopted relative to unsheltered persons got a presentation this coming weekend with the Institute of elected Municipal officials um especially for some of our newer officials always a resource to consider um with the Florida Lia City's University um I'll also be presenting at the Florida Planning and Zoning Association this week um getting back to things inside the city we though we are in June nearly 3 months post session there are still bills that have not been signed uh we continue to track them closely um I think about eight bills got signed uh just in the last week but for example bills that are being held near and dear to the pel speeches such as the short-term rental bill still has not been sent to the governor for signature as a reminder that process is that once it passes both chambers of leg of the legislature in identical form it has to be sent to the governor the governor has 15 days to sign any legislation sent to him um if not signed in those 15 days it passes as far as bills that have been sent and there are dozens um all the two have been signed only two have been vetoed by the governor so uh we'll see where what that means for the remaining uh bills that are coming forward there is no set deadline by which a bill has to be at least not the Florida Constitution by which bills have to be transmitted to the governor so we we await that um as far as legislative happenings in this community we are approaching budget season and I'm sure the manager will be speaking to that um shortly um for our newer members uh the budget has to be adopted by October 1st each year that's one of the only legislative acts you has to do uh annually so we'll be beginning that process um and um uh more recently as far as other happenings in the community I did have a meeting about two weeks ago with member bankard and a member of the community Mr Manzo concerning the Beller Beach and Beller Shore um exchanges relating to the beaches and their uses two real issues going on there one the interlocal agreement and the second issue being the concern of some residents related to their ability to use the wet sand beaches in the same manner as the members of B Shore um very productive discussion uh informative and I continue to move forward I am in weekly contact with the town attorney for the town of Belair Shore and making progress on items both related to the interlocal agreement and just general as getting getting better acquainted as we work together as neighboring jurisdictions um outside of that uh the one other thing I would add since especially as member Roberts mentioned it earlier there is a property I believe it's 107 21st Street is the is the address that um has recently come into compliance that is a function of a change if not in ownership certainly in possession of the property and an investment uh investor style approach that has brought the property um into compliance on the exterior they are looking to um sell the property continue to enhance the exterior Landscaping Etc I believe they're targeting a sale within the next week or two for continued compliance as part of that they have approached the manager and myself um a representative from the property has approached manager myself would request that this commission consider uh reducing the fines or otherwise eliminating the fines on the property given the expedience with which they work with this that is the request I think there's a representative of that property here now though seems they may have exited the room at the moment as I looked down at my notes um so I'm not sure they're in the room at the moment um but that's not something that's formally on the agenda tonight but it was something that was asked of us to make you aware of in these hearings we could if you wish to discuss it this evening as a commission you could do there as a council you could do so during other or unfinished business but it was not an agendized item um for purposes of the record we did receive um correspondence as I was um traveling to the hearing I think that gentleman just re-entered the room um but I did uh receive correspondence from that property owner from a representative of that property stting hope this email finds you well as you know this office has been working for the property owner uh uh in order to deal with the open code violations and fines we've made significant process progress dealing with these violations in fact it appears all violations have been resolved and the manager confirmed that they're in compliance presently so the fine should cease we promptly assisted the owner who was unable to act on her own behalf and took all necessary steps to address these open issues we acknowledge that the violations occurred over an extended period resulting in a formal invoice exceeding $50,000 and fines however since we were not in a position to address these fin we respectfully request that these penalties be weighed relatedly we are also going to improve the appearance of the outside of the property with landscaping and other improvements with a view of listing the property over the next few weeks at a full fair market value we look forward to your response thank you in advance for your professional courtesy again though not necessarily part of my report given that I think the member of the public who intended to raise this entered the room after public comment had cease I wanted to make sure you were aware of that um as it relates to good compliance uh and so those are that's all that spit to print in my report Mr Mayor and I'm happy to answer any questions from the council Council I just want to thank you and Kyle again for that meeting we had was very productive our pleasure we we cre thank you any other questions or comments for the City attorney thank you Mr I do wish to make one note because I just can't resist Mr Mayor there are two very very engaged uh members of the public here the back row my children are in attendance tonight and I'd be remiss if I missed the opportunity as a father to embarrass in public are you puning summer homework see one of them Tred to KN out all right up next is the city manager report Mr rer thank you mayor I start off the tops work down um we have the GOL Boulevard undergrounding project I'm happy to say after we didn't pay e back agreement for the Spectrum conduit that is more than halfway done and at this point they feel uh it could be wired um and drop down from aerial poles to underground with by the end of September so that's moving along hopefully there's no delays on that um the next uh is our St water Improvement project um currently we got the streets that have been started uh doing the curb replacement Morgan Drive 25th to 23rd and they're currently down at Cedar Spruce and palm uh next to the building um right now those are to be the first streets that will be um asphalted resarch and um restored um and the schedule for that is late June at this point the um we're currently you know part of what the resident who I forgive me if I say his name incorrectly I think it's no solet um he lives at the corner of 23rd in Golf Boulevard um we've met with him several times the last time I spoke with him um about this issue um was the Friday before last and um being out of town this past Friday when typically we do our on-site meetings um as my understand that uh city engineer Larry floody had talked to him and um has talked to the contractor um some of his concern is that there is a negative pitch which we can't have um starting from his driveway going towards a depression at the corner of 230 Golf Boulevard um the layout of the street is there is by the sidewalk on G Boulevard where the radius is it is very low um it over the years has puddled and left sediment build up even growing weeds um that scope of the road is actually pel's County right away and looking at it um we think the best uh adue approach is to start at a high point um right at the very beginning of where uh you know it would be just east of the sidewalk in go Boulevard and then you know continue our uh continuous um you know slope all the way down the bore uh Drive um but at that one spot it has to come back down to meet the depression that exists in Golf Boulevard but we didn't want to match starting at where that Depression was because our plan is that the county does something to their Road um in reshaping it to meet where our high point is at the start of 23rd um I'm not sure if I summed up everything but I do know that the major concern was the depression or sorry the negative flow that was heading um on the new curb and what I've told uh the resident was that our main goal is to have the water flow to the east the bay sh Drive um one way or the other um where there's new curb to make sure gets down to the end of the road we have other issues at Bayshore um which our engineer is um drafting up an explanation that when we get to bore in a future project um the idea is we're going to have to probably lower the inlets on mayore and maybe even add an additional Inlet in some problem areas um to get that water to continue get off and down the drain um but we are looking at as a as a whole um you know including Golf Boulevard and the streets we're currently working on and then the future project um there's a lot of areas of the curb that the profile is not your typical v-shaped Valley curb it's very flat um we've seen this in other areas of the city before um not fully understanding why it was flat and I can't speak exactly to those areas because we do want to um when we get down to for example 19th we want to look at again the total fall of the road we want to maintain a continuous flow line and we have water flow to the east um but at the same time we you know given that U there is no bot there's no actual b shape in the curb we are uh verifying that the water does flow um the concern is and again I'm going to um we're working on cost estimates of what it would take um as far as additional asphalt and raising driveways um to create a vshape in the curb um but in looking at it the to meet objective number one which is to get the water of the flow and stay out of the road we feel we're meeting that um with the curve that is installed even though it is not you know the perfect specification for a valley curve um so that is another concern but like like I said we are um working on a report that I will share with you so that there's a full understanding of what we're doing out there before we get to the asphalt portion of the project um I think I might have covered it I I know you know based on his diagram I sent it to Mr floody today and I said this is basically what you've reiterated in your email to me and he said yes and you know we we'll keep doing it until it's right so just know we've been out there working on it um and I'm sure we'll be meeting on it in the future um and then the other portion that was brought up was 22nd Street we did not have the curves getting replaced for the extent of that street uh because it was resurfaced in the past two to three years uh one of the residents out that street uh contacted me and told me that the previous city manager told him that those curves were getting replaced um so after hearing that uh it's not the ideal way to replace a curb but it could be done so we do at the engineer looking at it um two cut out areas of broken curb um where you're puddling and then you know replacing that we're going to get a proposal together for you to look at and consider do this begin in go gol um down to the four-way when we were designing the project we did um include the radiuses of the four-way stop because there there's a lot of puddling that's um historically been there so that was included in the project but not the the whole 22nd Street curve um that is all I have um did I did I address all of your concerns just want to in front of my property there is no flow now how I want to fix this so we're going to ensure that there is FL okay that's why I was trying to show pictures of uh obviously part of the C has to be done otherwise the flow cannot they know where to come from okay so the question is how much of the the job has to be in my view it's at least half of the street on my side well again we're going to lay it all out like I told you and and I will send it to you in any other residents on the street but we we been looking at this we spent a lot of hours out there on the site so we are taking it seriously and doing the best that we can out there thank you um the uh code review right now Mr Sherer has provided me with writeups of all the recommendations that he's gathered I'm crosschecking on making sure that um nothing was missed and then we were going to start drafting proposed ordinances is for Council consideration these won't be able to be read until after the budget the first of the year uh of sorry not 1 of October but um we we will continue to work on that and get Council input um so that we are ready to go and that time happens the RFP for auditing Services came in due date was Friday uh we got five proposals in so that was good I I think there was only six plan holders so it was a good uh submission and uh city clerk is in the process of sharing all the proposals with the audit committee and finding out our first evaluation meeting date and that again some of the proposal they F within our budget so that that was good and then it's just as far as the budget goes in general um I've heard back from most council members um our first budget Workshop is June 17th it's a monay Monday at 6 and I would like to either a zoom meeting or if you want to stop by just kind of do a one on1 sit down and make sure we go through everything that's that's it any questions or comments for the city manager yes Mr Roberts so um so Kyle on the 23rd Street issue that that that you guys are working on and and your answer was perfect and I'm confident when you said we're going to make sure it works that's that's the message so I'm just curious previous to the improvements was there any water on that street that actually flowed towards the boulevard I do not believe they're was okay I know that there was puddling um there was broken curve um what we did was we took the complete fall from Gulf to Bayshore and we tried to make it as continuous as possible um um to ensure that the water does flow down to bore possible the reason I'm asking that I know on 20th Street and it almost looks like an optical illusion but pretty much from the midpoint of that street on 20th between Bay and Gul Boulevard the water flows pretty easily to Gul Boulevard and the county has a very big um area there for that water to disappear which is great so that's the direction go goes I don't know if it was by Design or it just turned out that way but it flows well that direction now so this one we def yes yes um and again like we're going to give alternative options just you know because I know you know your typical Valley curve has got that b shape it may not um we my proposal would be to raise the form boards and create at least two inches on each side but there will be added costs and we don't feel that right now we're in the top uh which would be the West Side the water will flow um where the curb is meeting the reveal of the asphalt so it's not your typical Valley curb where you have a Flo line down the middle and staying right there it eventually gets to a valley curve because that flow line does go down as you get down the street and then you're able to make that shap um but our feeling was to create a valley curve that create that VAP um is more of an aesthetic and it won't be perfect but we will provide a price for consideration any other questions or comments for the city manager yes regarding proposals for the auditing services I don't know if this question go to you or to practicing um but I did receive the proposals and I'm wondering if we have used a matrix or some sort of checklist in the past for evaluating those proposals I do have one and I'll make sure she has that set out anyone else all right we're on to item number seven M Rose you have the floor other than my report that was included in the packet I have nothing further to report do we have any questions or comments about's report I have one brief comment um I noted on the website that we have several listings where we say that there are currently open for or committee positions but I don't believe we say what those positions might be so that might be helpful I can add that thank you anything else I to make a comment about the um board appreciation launching there may be something we want to take a look at and regarding I don't know a better day a better time because we definitely want to thank all of the citizens that participate in those other boards and it appeared they had difficulty in actually making that lunch because it was not a big turnout by any stretch so maybe something we could I don't know just some different ideas on how to um lay that out so that we can thank more and more of those people sure we can consider other avenues in the future steak on a Wednesday anything else all right we're on to item eight this is the consent agenda this is for approval of the May 6 2024 city council meeting minute do I have a motion to approve motion to approve is written present made by El M Banker do I have a second second second by Mr Roberts all in favor I any oppose all right the consent agenda passes now we're on to the regular agenda item number nine consideration of ordinance 24-02 Mr Morrow would you please read the ordinance and provide a brief summ thank you Mr Mayor this is ordinance number 24-02 in ordinance of the city council of the city of Beller Beach Florida amending the Beller Beach code of ordinances subar B Land Development code chapter 94 zoning Article 1 in general section 942 definitions to amend the definition of substantial Improvement to reduce the look back period from substantial Improvement calculations down from 5 years to one year and amending Article 5 supplmentary District regulations division one generally section 94255 alterations improvements and repairs to align with flow plan ordinance requirements providing for implementation providing for resolution of conflicts providing for separability and providing for an effective date this has been a second and final reading of ordinance number 24-02 by title only Mayors and members of the council you will mayor and members of the council you may remember um the priority that you placed on reducing your look back period as it's called for purposes of the FEMA calculations this is the period um for purposes of the 50% rule um calculating the improvements on a property to go back only one year as opposed to the current 5 years as that would mitigate the impact of Prior improvements before purchases um and other similar limitations that may prevent people from doing prospective improvements as a result of past improvements and so um this is that ordinance and the two parts of it one is to explicitly change that and the second provision is to make the flood plane ordinance reference to that calculation consistent with this change um in terms of what materials we will look at when Administration does perform that 50% calculation uh so this is that ordinance for a final reading thank you Mr MOA uh before we go to the council need to go to the citizens for comments with anyone like to comment on this topic seeing as we have none citizen comments now closed Council going to need a motion to approve ordinance 24-02 I believe believe I heard a motion by Frank Banker do I have a second second by Kim Shaw Elliott Mr Banker do you have the floor um this really came to my attention because of the damages done by uh Dal last year by a couple citizens and one particular and I didn't even really know about it took five years that we had and um while we were doing our code review this was brought up and I asked the council or age with the council to push this instead of like as kle said said probably not get all our codes done therea just to the extent they're more restrictive their statutory limits of what we can do this is more and my my whole plead was we're in storm season now let's get this down and I do think it warrants that recognition for the council um every now and again you folks should be able to pack yourselves on the back as you brought this up the goal was to do this um before storm season was upon us and here we are on the first full day of I believe now first full 24 hours of hurricane season about second day and here we are so congratulations to you folks on on accomplishing this and this the guy right get beat up by citizens all the time and he's enforcing the law this needs to be done any other comments no all right Renee would you please call council member bankard yes council member Roberts hi council member Elliott hi and mayor gtis hi ordinance 24-02 passage unanimously now we are on to item 10 consideration of ordinance 24-3 Mr MOA you're up thank you Mr mayor this is city of Beller Beach ordinance number 24-3 an ordinance of the city council of the city of Beller Beach Florida amending the Beller Beach code of ordinances subp Part B Land Development code chapter 94 zoning Article 4 districts division 3 residential low RL District 2 Section 94220 minimum living areas and setbacks to reduce the side setback for specified Lots in the b beach first edition subdivision providing for implementation providing for resolution of conflicts providing for separability and providing for an effective date this has been a second and final reading ordinance number 2403 by title only uh Mr Mayor you may recall from last month's discussion this is a very very discret change to the side setbacks on a specific lot uh it's really three lots but it only should impact one lot I believe um most directly um this was a a greater outgrowth of the Land Development code review and issues identified by the manager and dealing with administrative issues in the community we are reducing the side setback on a lot in the first edition on threee Lots in the first edition from 15 ft down to 7 ft um all other requirements still apply meaning that you can't do a zero lot line buildout within that setback area you cannot um have any structures this just creates a little bit of a more permissive buffer uh between the two properties and um that between the pro this property any property May enjoin um otherwise Happy to answer any questions thank you Mr MOA uh before we go to the council good at citizens would any citizen like to speak on this ordinance is there are none citizen comments are now closed we need a motion to approve ordinance 24-3 I'm happy to make that motion motion is made by kimaw Elliot do I have a second second I'm going to give that one to Mr Roberts this La floor I think our attorney MOA uh described this rather well as always uh this is a very limited situation it really only impacts one lot and it brings it in a consistent manner as all the other Lots set back limits in the city any other comments Mr Mayor I'd just like to add um because the anticipating issues in the future generally when we adopt legislation we do not legislate to specific properties we legislate generally the only reason you see that as an exception in terms of this particular legislative process is because of the way your code is laid out there are setbacks by Lots within and further still by subdivision so this actually affects three lots but it is to it is consistent with your existing table we wouldn't change for example the height restrictions on one lot in the city um or something like that we don't legislate to individual properties um this has to do more with the way your Land Development code is formatted and how it format was affecting specify thank you Mr Mora we all know that things get changed for a reason all right any other question comments questions M Rose would you please call the rooll council member Banker yes council member Roberts I council member Elliot I and mayor gtis I ordinance 24-3 passes unanimously now we are on to item number 11 consideration of ordinance 24-4 uh before I call on you Mr Mor I just wanted to ask you if you ever considered Auctioneer as a backup no that's uh that's purely a Dominican Talent mayor but I I appreciate it I may I may Endeavor to to go that way if this all doesn't work out you speak to your children only when I'm reading EV would you please read the ordinance yes this is ordinance number 24-4 an ordinance of the city council of the city of Beller Beach Florida amending the Beller Beach code of ordinances sub Part B Land Development code chapter 94 zoning section 94-72 fences and section 94251 fences walls and hedges to allow fences walls or edges on seaw wall caps providing for implementation providing for resolution of conflicts providing for cability and providing for an effective date this has been a second and final reading of ordinance number 24-4 by title only uh as you may recall members of the council from last month's discussion on this ordinance um this this is to be create a more permissive allowance for not just um fences but Hedges to extend onto the seawall cap but not but not to extend beyond the seaw wall cap um in that manner where it runs perpendicular uh the concerns raised in last month's discussion or reasons for this would be to prevent dogs children anybody else from going property to property by walking along the seaw wall um technically as your code is written um you are not allowed to have any such structure on or above the SE the U seaw wall cap and this now makes uh allows for that as opposed to the halfhazard man which different people have done it um one of the concerns raised last time was post within the seaw walls and again you can have the fence extend over without necessarily having to place post through report or deteriorate the structural Integrity of that thank you Mr all right let's go to the citizens for comments anyone like to speak all right Citi comments are now closed Council I need a motion to approve ordinance 24-4 Some Mo is made by Mr Roberts do I have a second second second by Mr Banker Mr Roberts you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor I think um a big fact in this Planning and Zoning Board did have a hearing on this matter and this is the recommendation that came from that as Mr Moore made some great um statements about what benefits were moving with this we're really just cleaning up this particular ordinance so um I think it's the right thing to do any other comments all right name would you please call the RO council member Banker yes council member Roberts hi council member Elliott hi mayor gavis hi ordinance 24-4 passes unanimously thanks everyone for uh working on these three ordinances look forward to seeing them in the books all right now we are on to item 12 unfinished business we have any unfinished business mayor the only business I would bring I I would just like to know whether you wish to address T tonight and it is entirely your prerogative as Council um is the uh correspondence I read into the record earlier only and I only rais that urgency from the property owners perspective is they're attempting to sell the property within the next week or List It um and and obviously we have we have a lean the amount of the um of the money's owed to the city is $ 68,276 um the context provided um here in the correspondence they provided they they made reference to being unavailable or unable to to approve the property the property owner at the time was incarcerated for much of the approving violations some of our challenge was just in reaching the property owner as a result of that to Mak them aware of these um deficiencies But ultimately I did want to make sure whether you took it up or not that you explicitly stay itself uh well I would uh i' be more than happy to hear the citizen or the uh the the purchaser of the home uh I know he uh wasn't we had citizen comments but since you brought it up would than happy to let this gentleman speak please come up to the podium give us your name and address and uh tell us what's going on hi good evening uh my name is Vladimir Vladimir Cho uh I reside in rington Beach town and I'm interest for the property at at issue today um as um the CNE stated uh currently the property is in compliance with um an ongoing issue that uh particular the neighbors were struggling with for quite some time um been addressed and is actually getting address of this time probably getting remodel at this very moment uh so uh obviously uh the city uh accumulated certain expense during the ongoing issues uh with that said um uh currently uh it's I I believe it's somewhere around $68,000 $ 68,276 so uh to make a long story short we will greatly appreciate if you will consider to reduce these fines uh as been said before uh the um the the former owner uh is now we uh in addition to that uh she is uh she was incarcerated and incarcerated right now uh so um um property is up to code and obviously we have all intention to keep that way I just actually had a very nice conversation with uh Deputy Trump uh and uh I encourage him to contact me directly if there's any additional things that we can do to improve the problem um if you have any questions I will be Morey to answer them obviously uh but uh if you consider to reduce the fines from $166,000 to a greater to much a greater to a less number uh we would appreciate that thank you very much like I said if you have any questions I'm going to uh wave the rules this time with back and forth this is the last person do uh public speaking and um um I'm going to open up the floor to the council if you have any questions what if any um proceeds from the sale will go back to the owner uh there s yes how much money will go back to the owner uh well it will be determined by the sale because there is a number of links uh legal expenses it's not even calculated at this at this at this point in time uh exactly the how much uh will go to the one is it more than $69,000 yes yes Mr Robert who is the owner right now uh the land trust and I'm a trustee the uh the owner of the property um uh an CFT uh surrender the property uh to a l trust and I'm the trustee of the property okay so at this point in time uh under the supervision of the attorney who is uh uh um managing some of the legal and other issues of uh uh M traps while she's as I said uh currently incarcerated uh so uh um the property will be uh sold and liquidated and uh uh the mul parties will receive the proceeds uh and of course cover the expenses affiliated with the life perps as context stating things that are all public record that can be determined within roughly the last 90 days and I'm not don't hold me to the exact timeline but really truly within roughly the last 90 days um as he stated the former property owner for whom the violations in initially attached transferred Pro ownership to a land trust for which this gentle as the trustee during that time this land trust and and its agents and officers have brought the property into compliance have paid outstanding tax leans of which there were multiple years back in in owed taxes they have um they taken to try and get the property ready for sale and whether as an investment or or just an arrangement between people who are acquainted to us which is of no concern to the city that's how that's how we've got here um so to the extent that the letter stated we weren't in a position to help now we are the members of the trust or trustee and his and his agents and officers are now positioned as owners of record to do those things and they have done them um and so they' brought that they're now getting it ready to list and then and from a code compliance standpoint and I you often will give me approach it that way from a code compliance standpoint the property has been brought in compliance um often times when you have fine reduction and fee reduction hearings um what you're looking at are the same sort of factors you see in ch 162 which is the the statute that governs the enforcement of fines um and code enforcement and and when in determining the amount of a fine when you have like a code enforcement border magistrate the statutory recommendation is that they look at things like the gravity of the violation any actions taken by the Violator to correct the violation any previous violations committed by The Violator and then says the board May reduce a find andos pursuant to that section and so they're coming forward to you saying my inter understanding of their ask and and I will let the gentleman speak for himself is hey you guys want to incentivize compliance we did compliance and we did it quickly once we were positioned to do so so as whether it is as a reward or as it to to unencumber us our request is show that incentive to to compliance different cities have done that different ways I think historically the largest that I'm aware of in the last few years here I'm not going to go back 20 and 30 years but in the last few years I think the larg just was like 50% some cities do 90% um it's really up to you and what you're trying to do here um to accomplish you know their goal is help us facilitate a sale so that that's free and clear and then you won't have this problem ever again because the property owner who has been for reasons either within their control or otherwise who's been the source of these violations will not be the property owner any further so help us get to that point is their ask I have some questions do you have a buyer already well originally I wanted to buy the property personally but unfortunately uh this life uh is this property is not really conducive to to my life it's just too small for me and my small children uh so there is a potential buyer yes uh it is also if I might add uh which is I'm sorry it's not directly related to your question when uh uh when you impose the uh the fines to the property at the timing was very unfortunate because when uh when when uh the city decided to impose the fines of $250 a day that was pretty much the time when uh she went incarcerated and obviously it's not your problem clearly but with that said uh it is when she went when she went incarcerated the obviously the $250 a day add up pretty quickly while she was away so uh um but uh to answer your question again uh it is a a possible P yes does this uh Property Trust own any other properties not this time no no not only was this trust formed specifically for this property yes all right and um no intentions of the trust possibly keeping it uh for to for its own an investment Trust like that no I don't I don't think that uh uh that that will happen Okay my my fear is is that we wait the fine and it turns into a vacation rental spot no no no no no it's not going to turn into the vacation spot okay the the goal is very clear to have the uh end user as I said originally I was considering to buy the property for my personal residents but it's not uh it's not going to work but uh uh yeah it's not it's not the idea of uh and your existing Land Development code restrictions against that would create new enforcement correct but understood understood just wish to make that clear for the record in fact I have an offer I'm I'm sorry to interrupt you I had an offer uh from uh uh someone who were considering uh to do just that uh to have some kind of vacation on and uh uh I am not engaged in this company I appreciate that Mr Baker um I sat on this board and uh went over a lot of fines see 50% reduction and everything like that need more I'm going to make a motion that we reduce the F by 55% clear not that there vacation yeah it is I I have absolutely no issue I can make a definite commitment here that uh well obviously I don't know what the people will do later on you know so when they buy the property uh you know how that goes okay but uh as of the trust and me trustee okay uh there is property will be sold to the end user when you explain you've done everything as soon as you possible as soon as you took over so I think you should give you lency of 55% deduction that's a um what what is the deadline for for what you're trying to accomplish I heard something like a week that there's something that has to happen in a week or so is there any deadline at all no there is no no deadline okay and do you have a buyer who is going to pull out if you don't if you don't resolve this tonight well I'm not really concerned if the buyer will walk away you know because obviously uh it's a highly desirable Community okay so it say I'm uh I I don't uh um obviously I have no control of the real estate market but with that said uh I think that um um that we'll be able to find another buyer especially that we don't have a deadline it's not there is no deadline that we have to me okay it there all the other means that property had been paid off it had thousands of dollars in water lanes and you know and I'm not going to B with a long story of other things that obviously the property taxes were not paid for 3 years uh it is and uh uh it's been uh it's current now okay so there is already substantial expenses were paid okay uh just for the purpose of not having a deadline you know because there is a the uh the Tex deep action is no longer part of the conversation or something like that okay and uh because in order to do all the work in the house um we needed to have the water so obviously I had to pay the water L uh and so on okay so this is the one and only lean that uh uh is obviously still there and um I'm trying to communicate the best of my abil tell you that uh you know we're trying to do everything that we can so and as right now they replacing the broken windows and painting the house inside so uh there uh tomorrow they will start on the flooring you know and that's it so uh when it's done it's done there's no deadline you know so obviously we would like to resolve the issue okay uh and uh um and move on okay I spoke to the at least three uh neighbors and they very pleased that uh there is no longer police department and other things that you know I will have to tell you what happened over there obviously so okay all right um Council I saw Mr cic's Hand raised um does anyone have a problem with allowing him to speak in this matter please come up sir thank you mayor council just try to do the math right Banker so uh 68,000 divided by $250 is 272 days and um yeah this is this trust that now has possession theyve had a possession for how long less uh I don't know the precise date of acquisition but I think it was in late March so wouldn't there typically be you know to get clear title any of these Lans would have had to been paid so we should have been paid as of March so I don't think 55 I I I think there may be a reasonable discount but I think it might be more at the time of turnover and you're back into that day and time if if if I I just think we we got to make sure we don't set a precedent as a city and um people have different situations that Unfortunately they go through but uh the the time the city has had to enforce this the time that our uh uh code uh enforcement has had to act on it U we we should make sure that we're more than compensated for managing the process so my recommendation uh would be you you probably you a 25% discount just doing my math real quickly but again if this was properly transacted with a title the lean would have been paid at the time that transfer yes with the note that I believe it was done as a quick claim deed so you take when you in a quick claim transaction you take with all incumbrances so go back let's go back to the DAT of the quick claim D if it was actually filed um I don't know if it was filed or if somebody signed it but you know uh you know none of the taxes got discounted none of the water Lings got discounted why should we get discount for all the great services that we provide and all these citizens enjoy here in the city that's just my comments thank you thank Mr s yes sir Mr Roberts is there is there currently a mortgage on the property no okay what um so let's let's go down the road a bit and let's when the property sells and all the lanes are paid and all the bills are taken care of who gets that money that's left over what when the house when the house is sold yes and there's and there's still profit there based on the sale price and everything else being taken care of who walks away with whatever money is left over a trust the trust dos yes okay okay um with regards to advertising the sale of the property is there advertising so that other people can compete for the purchase absolutely yes as soon as the work is completed it will be listed with a real estate broker okay uh so yes in fact it has a sign coming soon as we speak right now on the property the answer is yes because earlier you said you had a buyer I have a potential buy yes okay but uh but the property still will be on the market okay yeah and for the city manager Kyle so that this money that is that is due to the city for the fines where would that fit in our budget and how would we use that money Al so the money would just come back um in as revenue and go into the general fund okay all right no specific requirement all right any other comments questions I I just like to know i' like is we don't like an abandoned house here and I think should do everything of course the County's not going to lessen their fine the water and everything else but this is where we live this is what we're trying to bring in residents that's why I believe 55% deduction fine because as you know she got incarcerated would you say it was $26 something doll a day every day it wasn't paid or whatever accumulates quite quickly so she was an incarcerated or whatever and that's not the point at the moment but the time would be a lot less I appreciate that and uh yeah the timing was awful and and obviously I fully understand that you live here so you don't want to have an abandoned light that property for would that okay so and that's kind of the goal here resolving the issue and uh uh actually as soon as we start working on the property uh we clean it up in days so uh I had a pleasure meeting with your city manager on property twice and uh um and I specifically asked if there anything else that we can do okay um I'm still curious as to who is the beneficiary of the trust who's the beneficiary of the trust uh it is a uh uh multiple entities including if this is what you're referring to the former owner yeah it is so uh it is um some of your current legal and Health Care fees uh will be covered out of some of the proceeds of the trust and currently the home is is PID for 100% there's there's no data on the home there is no data on the home correct I I'm uh I'm leaning towards the suggestion of of Mr Sean he uh uh he is uh advised us quite often and uh he likes to watch our money and uh I think his suggestion of a 25% reduction is a nice way to reward you for um helping to clean up our city so that's where I Le how about you Mr Roberts I think that sounds more than fair and I think U it's going to help you not as much as a 55 but I still think it's a significant discount down so I also agree with the 25% just a how many days did CH it was 250 a day and while the manager looks that up there is a recorded Quick Claim Deed that was recorded on it was made on April 24th of 2024 and it was recorded April 25th 20124 to the extent that informs your decision making so while I said the last 90 days it's actually shorter than that so what would be uh if we started from zero and uh from the day of the equ plan be what what would we be looking at got 263 days I'm from April 24th to col state of dat of compliance is May 20th on Monday that comes out that's 26 days 26 you guys are making a lawyer to math on the Fly This is highly highly untime I'm try impress KS that's 6500 26 6500 is is the uh if you if you take it just from the date of transfer so i% would even be more than that so well that's what I'm that's where I'm leaning right now council member ell I have quite a few questions one is what is the normal process uh to request U an abatement that's an that's an excellent question M um sha Elliot one of the things that your manager and I are working on is is resolving that um it has been a little bit more of how we've done it right now or if someone comes and usually they're on the agenda again I put it to your judgment whether you took it up tonight or not uh but usually it's on the agenda they they request it the manager presents hey here's what it is what do you guys want to do I as the lawyer trying to remind you we should ground this in things like chapter 162 considerations to the extent possible but one of the this is one request we received there's another that's we anticipate percolating and one of the things we're trying to get resolved before that comes up is getting a more clear process in place on the kind of criteria you consider both for your protection and the property owners so there's predictability we eliminate any arbitrariness in the decision making process so um but present to the extent the city has historically done this it has come before the commission and sort of a please consider it based on the totality of the circumstances and what are you willing to do in like and this Council uh historically uh has taken a very hard line against violators not uh giving very little uh and what I'm trying not to do is set a precedence I do understand there was a set of circumstances where um the homeowner may not have been in the best state of mind and then also winding up uh being in custody uh but uh I think at the end of the day uh the trustee the the the family everyone involved I I just I can't let I I can't give a discount like that I just can't do it because I'm afraid that someone will come back later and say well you gave this guy one um where's my discount I'm not persuaded um this is an investment opportunity properties are very valuable in our city Lots alone over 400,000 enough um we all know that any conveyance of property is going to be subject to any accumulated means and that goes into the purchase price and so either that is reflected at the time that the parties come together and the owner takes less because somebody else is going to have to the building later or resolv so I I I appreciate very much um the efforts to do this quickly and to bring it back into compliance but that's also part of the investment value you get it done the F going be sold be in property for a long period of time so I'm not persuaded that we should do this council member Elliot you uh sound as skeptical as I'm feeling right now um so um I don't know I I don't know what the best medicine is for this and and I think also that I think it's good that we're working on a process but perhaps there could be a standing committee or you know one of our other groups that can do some fact fing I mean we can speculate all evening about how these facts came about but if somebody's incarcerated you know they still have the opportunity to rent their property they still an agent an attorney to help them rent it and could have been maintained by Property Management I mean one one of the considerations for the process is looking to have it go as far as find reductions um to go before the magistrate Statute in which Cas that process um so but that's in terms of process we are considering all options administ judicial I it's find if we acted some sort of appeal process perhaps but it seems like um a good process would include somebody's doing some fact finding and pulling the story together and and considering it and that's that's the the struggle that I'm having is that this is all sprung on us I don't want to get B down in an entire work session to resolve this that's why I was willing to here this gentleman out find out what what it was we were uh we needed to decide on and there are a lot of um you know questions going on in my head how much money is the trust going to make and where's it all going and is this truly just how much money can I get out of this house has been quickly indeed to a trust that ultimately goes right back part of it to the owner who just did quit playing be on it so there there are many many uh questions I have uh I'm I'm just to make this go away um can I answer any of your questions perhaps sure I would be more than Happ to do that if there's a um so if you have questions will do more yeah I think I think the problem solved okay so it's in my view okay so uh obviously you want to cover clean property in your community so that's what it is so um so obviously uh we can have a long ongoing discussion and uh wait you know until the sale of the house for as long as you wish uh with that said um I suggest maybe we can just move on so with you know quality people that will move in the house and um and a story I'm is are you happy with the 25% we gave you that 25% would that resolve everything tonight you're not going to file an appeal to try toce no way you're not Happ 25% no yeah and I understand your position I I understand your position and I understand that whatever happened to the previous owner of the property is not your problem it is you want to clean house in in your community uh my concern is you taking this to court and appealing it okay and then the judge will say hey she was incarcerated for 200 and some days I'm going to reduce it there's not a clear um it's not clear that that's even a civil action it's action it could be well anything could be you can file anything I just in terms of how chapter 162 operates that's not 162 and I don't have front but it clearly says you know we should consider reducing it okay if if they comply and I think they've complied well this Council needs a majority to uh uh to move on something like this and um right now I see we've got one person one council member who sounds like she doesn't want to give anything uh we've got one here that wants to give the world away I want to give the world away don't say that I want to give something that'll get the resident in this house as soon as possible make sure there's no more legal action well based upon the amount of fine 25% off of that fine is a substantial amount of money and I believe for $116,000 I could have made that y look Immaculate so um I I think that it's uh I'm willing to do 25% I'm willing to go with the 25% too if he's willing to drop good you know what I'm saying no more legal well I I there's been no indication that they pursue that as it is but uh we can't find them to these proceedings and there's presently no motion on the floor there was a motion made that did not receive a second there's no other motion no other motion made um in terms of proced we stand at the moment well there is a motion to 25% no nobody made nobody's made that motion you made a motion for 55 did not receive second no other motions have been made someone like to make a motion for 25% motion made by Frank Banker do I have a second second second by Lloyd Roberts all in favor I any opposed all right we do a roll call V please just so that was it wasn't clear I could not see your ear however okay M Rose would you call the roll council member bankard yes council member bankard yes council member Roberts I council member Elliot no mayor gtis I so V by your vote it's approved at a 25% yes reduction which is a reduction of 17,32 41 all right if my math is correct we will clear that up and I will I will communicate that to Mr Keef your legal counsel we proceed for that but this Council has agreed to reduce the fine by well thank you very much all right do we have any other unfinished business and um Mr Mor you're not allowed to bring understandable mat just one issue I don't know this buiness or not but can we look at replacing some of the benches at six Street uh the one is kind of like broken uh they not secured some of the resid on on the uh especially Sunset ask see we yeah we'll take a look at that we have plenty Bud any other unfinished business sir um I'll tell you in uh I think tonight we sort of did set a precedence for special circumstances um this this was a little bit different uh circumstances than we normally have where someone just ignores ignores ignores and deflex um this was definitely unique and I think uh whenever if we're trying to to develop a standard we should take this into consideration I think 25% is a a reasonable reduction under special circumstances as we build policy will keep that in mind and just understand as well I I know it's it's Habit to sort of say we we've set a precedent but each matter will stand on its own eror which is I think also what you're speaking to um you know sometimes there's an inclination to just look to your neighbor and say well they got so I should get but that's whether we talk about variances we talk about fins it doesn't work and so we can make that clear polic good point and uh thank you for reminding us all right if there's no other unfinished business let's go to item number 13 Council comments I'm going to start off with council member Banker okay well to those two young persons in the audience tonight while we take a lot of your daddy's time hopefully tonight you can see how well he represents our city and many others so we thank him for this I hope you appreciate uh Thursday's the uh 80th anniversary of DayDay hopefully we all remember who who currently serve have served especially those that gave all truly their day each is not like ours that's it thank you Mr Banker uh now Kim sha following up on my comments regarding Bay Street East Bay it seems like it is going a lot better um I did attend a webinar that was um a hearing on the improvements of made on EXC not East Bay West Bay um look on the website as far as the specific dates but they are starting a project to um re uh resurface and uh correct any of the issues on West Bay as well as install Lance the middle of the street that will be used for some decorative purposes as well as kind of redirect traffic a little bit part of the purpose of that project in addition to maintaining the streets is to better connect the pelis trail to the rest of the city all of that is good news except that it did not include connecting it via bicycle trail there there wasn't enough room um in the existing Street structure to be able to enlarge it for um any bu claims so that's a disappointment but um we can all look forward more traffic opportunities when they start on East B I'm going to echo on that right quick and then I will turn it over to Mr Roberts um yeah it's it's amazing that we have the traffic that we do and they're actually narrowing the lanes and they're putting islands all the way from U Clear Water Largo Road up to to Indian Rocks Road and the one question I had was about well are you're doing anything with a merge land you're trying to beautify and you stop right there and you leave those ugly things in the road but uh uh I also feel bad for the the business owners uh that are along that pathway because a lot of people are going to lose their ability to let turn into the parking lot you'll have to go around May urn and and come back to be able to enter these businesses uh I look forward seeing how beautiful it's going to be but I also am worry about the traffic they had the full plan laid out I'm just grateful that they're not putting a dedicated bus lane in so because that seems to happen occasionally around County and uh and then you lose a away entirely Mr Robert's thing with the traffic Mantra I did notice on Memorial Day weekend I don't know if there was something special that occurred but the um traffic I mean the car lights were bumpered to Bumper at 9:30 or 10 p.m. on it Saturday night night and or Sunday night so that could have been uh just due to traffic volume which was not a great sign Mass exodus yes yeah not good anything else that's it all right um Mr reer the only thing that I really had is the traic light at our intersection uh we we really need to kill one of those green lights it represents going straight and and I'm going to tell you why is because I've been kind of neutral about do we want one do we want two do we you know is this going to work or not so uh there was a great big truck in the left plane waiting to turn left he's going to go slow I hop in the right Wayan the light changes and he came all the way over into my I had to lock him down and I he never looked at me one time and I'll tell you why it's because he saw those two lights over there and he thought I'm going straight down the road that I wasn't going to make a left turn so he thought the entire turn was his I think I think between removing one of those lights Al lighting them properly so everyone knows whose light belongs to what and then restriping the the L moving them back I think that that's probably the best opportunity we're going to have to to fix anything I I don't think there's a real good B but it can't hurt it can only help yeah but drunks can't see those but the lane you were in was specifically a green arrow turn it was the right Green Arrow turn right turn L and I mean had to lock them down I just com right over on me there was nothing I could do about it but oh well we look U off my my griping horse and uh just thank everyone for watching at home tonight and uh anyone that showed up tonight thank you for being here and uh you kids get to bed early tonight all right the City attorney had a hard day today um other than that everyone have a good night um do I have a motion to adjourn motion to adjourn as long as the city manager takes the kids out for oh yeah be F do I have a second second all right all in favor I any oppos all right good night
