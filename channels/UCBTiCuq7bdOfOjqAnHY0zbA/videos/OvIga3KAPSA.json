the first e and pronounce it that way or o e r t e l without that a o e r t also say one more time george four tail quartile okay nicole assessment assessment roberts she's an alternate she's not is she coming i didn't hear i mean i mean her husband kyle yeah riffler rickler howard yeah thank you all right thank you okay item number one is approval of the agenda do i have emotion so i moved and do i have a second a second everyone all in favor aye aye aye so the agenda for today passes item number two approval of the may 17th 2022 parking record meeting minutes do i have a motion i make a motion we approve the may 17th park and recreation board meeting and do i have a second my second everyone in favor yes i so approved minutes from last meeting item number three citizen comments so we don't have any citizens today um so um where i will interject because i didn't put it on the notes but like last meeting um we did get some suggestions in our suggestion box but kyle was on vacation so because i couldn't get into his office so these are citizen comments yes absentee good job so i'll just read them um so the first one is would love to have holiday lights on gulf boulevard which we've heard that from several people so there's a couple people on here and then we got a cute little heart so i guess that means they love us so that's that's nice and then build racquetball slash paddleball court which we have two paddlebar courts i don't know paddleball that's oh is that different than pickleball i'm not i don't know that's handball but yeah the racquetball and handball are similar okay in like the closed court okay oh yeah yeah all right but paddle well i don't know if they're talking about pickleball okay we'll have to get some clarification on that one and then it was just another fabulous event thanks park and rec so that this was submitted at the um fly me to the moon so that was nice i mean we put the suggestion box out every time and this was the first time so we got some feedback so hopefully people will take note and i think last time i made an announcement and that was probably the first time we made an announcement so people just don't see it sitting there so we're getting better at getting up there and covering things that we need to cover in the beginning we were like i wouldn't say frantic but it's just there was so much going on and everything was so new now we've kind of taken a deep breath and we're checking off our checklist and so that's all good gabby do you ever respond to citizen suggestions like on the website because you have a space for that like just to show that we're listening and question and answers or something like that show we're being responsive we have a space on the website currently she's asking oh we do have space on the website for parks and rec and stuff like that but do we ever like in you know have post something like a response to your comments you know on the racquetball or whatever we have this this and this and every show that we're like listening well it is posted in the fact that this is recorded and it is posted and we do update so as like say we get the christmas lights park and rec can't do the foundation is gonna have to do the christmas lights um and as far as like a paddle ball racquetball thing like you know we can say you know at this point because those are enclosed courts that it's probably not in the budget and it's above the scheme of what the park and rec board can do because obviously we can't build a building we're just trying to get the back like um playground kind of refurbished right now the council will vote on that if we replace the playground and in the future we were we had the idea of putting a gazebo out back oh i love it i increased the venue yeah that must be beautiful for the weddings yes yeah so yes in a roundabout way they do get updated on what um i think you're here but you can sit wherever you want but like she has a nice top thank you and i kept the notes until you got here oh perfect you're scared are you okay continue from here would you like me to do it okay oh no it's fine thank you so we just wrapped up item um number three sticks and comments i read the suggestion box so and we were just talking about how we give people feedback on things that they suggested and like so this is the first time we've had anything suggested so like yeah in a roundabout way we do so um i don't know if someone like emailed me or called me i would definitely respond back to them like with something like this like i wouldn't even really know who to respond so yeah i mean if if it comes to it we can address it but it's really not because the number of people are bringing up the christmas lights the christmas lights the christmas lights like can we address that somewhere and just quell the you know constant commentary around it that this is something we're looking at doing next year through the bella beach community foundation stay tuned or something yeah i don't want to promise that i don't want to say because then like say if duke energy doesn't give us a grant then it's just not going to happen like we are we are working on it but i don't want to give any kind of update saying that it's i don't want to make any promises that we can't keep because like if we got an approval if we got a grant that's when we would update to say we are working on this you can expect this by christmas of 2023 and you know something to look forward to this holiday season um but really it's not we're getting it over and over like the council talked about a little bit and then we had this one card so it's not like we're getting bombarded with calls or emails asking about christmas lights if we were then we would the last city council somebody set up and said they want christmas lights yes so i have heard it in a short time that i've been involved i've heard it so many times a citizen got up at the last city council and said christmas lights so just i think it's a good idea for future to think about how we respond if we get three or four people asking the same question um you don't have to make any promises but hey we're hearing you and um there's certainly things that we're looking at doing um stay tuned yeah that's good to hear you yeah yeah you're talking about they're talking about the utility pole like decorations it's kind of like part of this yeah so that's interesting because um right now we're playing underground and eventu like we're gonna start down on um you know by first street and get up to the causeway so they'll keep the poles that have you know street lights on them but other than that they'll be pulling utility wires and putting them on the ground but i know that some of the poles do have outlets um installed on it for those type of decorations but depending on you know when we get up into the like the south area and into the north area if if it's a pole that doesn't have a street light on it chances are they're going to disconnect the power source there and it's gonna be under the ground okay so we wouldn't ever be able to do it even if we wanted to eventually i think that it wouldn't even be an option because um until we moved to a different type of poll because i think the idea is to go to the solar option eventually once everything's underground and have solar and then you would be that whole so i mean that's where it's tricky because kind of like things are changing moving forward in the next so many years but just something this make note of yeah so noted um okay so item number four an update on the bellower beach community foundation since this board will be working with that board sort of in conjunction with projects and we would be at each other's events and whatnot um so i think and we talked about a little bit the last meeting the plan moving forward like hopefully in 2023 other than maybe christmas and the health and wellness fair the events will be taken over by the community foundation because they would have a lot more leeway they could take donations they could give people a receipt for their donations where we just kind of have our budget and you know it is what it is and you know so like we have our sponsorship form which we can absolutely intermingle but like someone's more likely to sponsor if they can you know say it's a charity and they can write it off so um we can revisit that i guess i didn't realize before the board before us like park and rec never did events and so it kind of explains why like you know we're kind of like after the last board like you know kind of laying it out and clearing the way and working through some of the little tick points that you've got to figure out how does this work how are we going to do this how can we do this legally and with the city and be insured and make sure that everybody's safe meaning like the the parking and the whatever all that good stuff so um so i am still going to at the july city council meeting for our quarterly board report we have had our budget together for the three events meaning halloween the chili cook-off and the christmas we've had that budget together for a couple of months so i'm going to present those three events to city council and show them you know these fit into our budget and you know they're going to be we're going to tweak it a little bit but they're going to be similar to last year the two that we did halloween and christmas and then obviously the chili cook-off is new and it will be the first event we're actually going to be selling tickets so we're going to see how that goes because if we um sell the tickets we're obviously going to be able to offset some of the cost of the chili cook-off because the participants are going to be making the chili but like you know we want to pay for the you know the bowls and the spoons and the signs and the so in the oh and we're going to be having um beer and wine so we obviously have to get the insurance and all of that good stuff which i think memory serves the budget for that event was like 1900 so hopefully we have enough people it's a 12 to 2 event we have like an hour set up it shouldn't take that long to tear down people can just come for lunch taste a bunch of chilies have you know a beer sit outside enjoy their friends and you know go about their day so that's what we're hoping it's our first experience with the ticket sales like i mentioned so it's a good it'll be a good indicator of what we have to look forward to in the future like how that transaction takes place and how we can get through it smoothly like meaning if they want to pay with a credit card or if they can get tickets from us or you know and then we could bring the cash in or if it all has to go through laura we still have to work all that out so that isn't until november so we definitely have some time to work out some details tammy when do we plan on selling start selling the tickets and like kind of send the reserve the date or well the date's reserved a council has to approve it before we do anything and then so we will probably start talking about all of those details in august because then we have august september october no we have four months like i don't think we're gonna sell tickets for four months we might sell tickets for maybe a month and a half so people like have a chance to see it on the board or like if you know it can be announced in a couple of city council meetings um and then as soon as council approves it we can we can put it on our calendar online we can but like our events never go on the board until what like a month out three weeks out yeah because they don't really they gotta be closer too so we get so many things it would just be yeah so like it's not like they'll put it on the board three months ahead of time like because we're selling tickets for this we can maybe put this one on a little bit earlier than the other ones yeah um but we can also sell tickets at the gate or you know at the entry so um because we have to check ids so you know it's it's a new animal for us we'll have to figure all that out um but you know what again we're not reinventing the wheel people do this kind of thing all the time so we need to learn from others around us that are doing it the right way and we've all been to those events so we kind of see what they do and how they handle it so yeah anyway so does anybody have any questions about number five at all no no all good okay so all right um item number six discussion of the january 14th health and wellness fair so last year was the first time we had the health and wellness fair and from all the feedback we got from the vendors who pretty much do those all the time that's their job they thought it was very well organized they loved the room set up um from our end like there was a couple of things like last year i wanted like i didn't i've never heard of mold patrol i can't remember who brought it up but when i called them we were too late to get them on the schedule so i'm literally gonna call them like in july like july 1st was it cliff i think it was cliff yeah um that's right thank you cliff for suggesting it so um you know it's like a truck that comes out like the dermatologist and last year we didn't start we didn't get a dermatologist so this year as opposed to me beating on the door of the same dermatologist over and over and over with no results i will reach out to maybe three or four and hoping we get some back i think you know we'll go by the same list of the people that we had we're gonna set criteria a little bit different this year i don't know we can talk about as it gets closer if we want to make it a little bit shorter like maybe three hours but we definitely have to have a commitment from our vendors like we had terrible weather last year like it was so cold there wasn't a single person on the bridge it was freezing rain like the fact that we had 80 people surprised me because they were coming in and they were like popsicles it was just that cold so like some of the vendors wanted to leave early because it was slow but then we had people coming in at like 1 30 and half the room was gone they can't leave so um we might make a few tweaks and we might lose a few people when we say you know if you're going to commit you have to commit to the whole thing um what was it four hours left it was four hours you should be able to do it yeah well you know what though some of the tables meaning like the stretch therapist and the massage table they would have had people for another two hours so it's like some of the tables were full from beginning to end and others were just a little slower i think it depended on what it was um but like i said we can probably in the next meeting i'll bring the excel spreadsheet that shows everybody that showed up just a reminder for everybody and then maybe you know we have some new people on the park and record maybe they know you know a dermatologist or maybe they know you know hey my friend is a you know or whatever the case may be or they have some like even if it's their dermatologist and they think that they would maybe possibly be interested um and the other thing um so potential sponsors we kind of talked about maybe doing a sponsorship because one of the things that we were missing last year were goodie bags i mean people were walking around and had tons of things that were passed out and given to them by all the vendors and they had nowhere to put it like so if you were going on the massage table and you had a stack of stuff this high people were putting it just kind of willy-nilly on the floor and whatever so it would be nice to get like a little even if it's a paper bag and it has a bellar beach sticker on it just so they can put their stuff in when they're walking out the door so we thought maybe of getting like a nicer bag and getting sponsors but then we've got to worry about the graphics and labels and if we only have a couple of you know people in the room that want to do it on the back so kyle and i just kind of thought since we aren't doing events next year and our budget rolls over that we would just pay for the bags like we did for the little goody bags we gave out at fly me to the moon like we didn't put stickers on those but you know we just had goody bags that we filled up and we handed out to everybody no one was upset that there wasn't a sticker on there but it would just be nice if you know we could like make them personalize without spending a whole lot of money and those stickers are like 41 cents so or something like that so we can get the like you know the logo like the little stickers that go on the car aren't that much so we could maybe do something similar or maybe a little bit bigger as a remember what is what is this health and wellness fair's purpose like why do we have this event that's the goal have you ever been to a health and wellness fair no never in your life okay so they have them all the time everywhere most of the time they might be at like you know a hospital but we had day care here so they were doing health care screenings okay they do screenings and stuff we had a chiropractor who was doing spine screenings we had a massage therapist we had a stretch therapist we had the cbd store we had a dentist so basically if you're new here and you don't have a dentist then you're meeting a dentist right yeah um who else we had and we tried to get like the most local people so that so public travel yeah i mean it was a really good event we just had bad weather so like publix did their green wise organic line yeah so that was nice we had personal trainers here we had nutritionists we had eat clean now they're open and clean yeah are they okay yeah i've seen the sign up they're not open yet okay well yeah they'd be great to get okay now i understand yeah we had them what was the fruit place oh fresh produce golf the produce market on gulf boulevard yeah can we have a vein specialist or something yeah we had a vein specialist like the parkinson people canceled last minute because they had covered um but we had also some of the people yeah we had coffee was here yeah and then we had people that do like the exercises through bellar beach yeah like tara and jessica so the people that do the stand-up paddle board and the yoga for us were here um it was a good mixture like you know i said we were missing a physical therapist and we were missing a dermatologist but we were missing a lot like um we had a pretty good and the feedback that i got from several people was because it wasn't so crowded because a lot of times people go to those things just to get all the stuff they're giving out because they were giving out like you know samples of things or like gummies they so they just come for all the stuff that they get um tons of hand sanitizer i think i walked out of here because oh there was also a um what's with the blood drive lady the blood drug lady and the oh that's good do they have a blood drive they did like 11 or 12. um oh what was that the esthetician yeah me well yeah so there's no organic hair organic hair and organic skin care and then who was the other the ones that did botox and all that stuff oh yeah i know that living young center yeah like a medical spa like yeah medspayer anti-aging medical spouse like something like that yeah they're all fabulous they're like great yeah and then we had a travel agent and we had for like you know relaxation but people were doing giveaways like that and raffles yeah yeah it was good well give me nails everything though what i think you've got everything yeah i know like we could add a few more things like we want the mold patrol and um so we'll see how that goes yeah so we'll we'll start um you know revamping the list or tweaking it just a smidge and like you know maybe fine-tuning a couple things from last year but um that the date of that is january 14th so we've got that locked in with through the city so we have it reserved do we invite participants and do we how do we make sure that we're not going to invite like three people that all do the same thing so or is that okay like how do we no we don't there's no dupes and we i like literally it was email after email after email and detailed and that was me and us assuring them there will be one dentist right one dermatologist one um there was a telehealth person there like um so i did like you know i was like we could have a telehealth person and then an in-person therapist but the in-person therapist didn't end up showing up and there was an acupuncturist like dr taylor i can't remember her last name um so yeah no all that's organized ahead of time yeah so it's kind of something that they like like we did um you know if we we had a male personal trainer and i said we may have a female but we won't have two men all right hi lovers the dog is so cute all right so that's just like you know for that background oh yeah yeah no so if you didn't comment did you even live here last year i lived here i've lived here now seven years oh okay i i work pretty long hours so i don't make it how much that's part of the challenge yeah yeah it was good yeah it was good it was um like a saturday morning ten to two so um okay item number seven so we need to maybe think we don't have to really brainstorm today but like maybe if you want to think about it and we can talk about at the next meeting um the blood drives have been suspended for now they've kind of run their course there weren't a lot of people showing up and so we've had a month after month after month and it's summer and it's slow but like i would like to get something else on our you know we're obviously on the website i don't want it to be empty like you know whether it be another painting class the painting class was very successful um or we do a candle making class or whatever the case may be but just if we can get one or two other things because we'll kind of as we as we trade off the events to the foundation the park and record will want to focus more on like recreational activities or healthy activities that we can maybe get because i don't think the standup paddleboard is going that great but it's not like she's wasting her time if no one signs up she doesn't show up here and sit here and wait for people so i think you know it's kind of hit or miss she'll have like a few people or five people and then she'll have no one but it's really like the weather so if like if it's windy if it's rainy if the current's bad you know i mean so she has all these things that she's fighting against even when she gets people so tara's classes the yoga on the beach and the yoga in the room is going pretty good so yeah so yoga on the beach is not going on right now until the end of summer i think with the yoga inside because it's too high okay i'm probably crowded i don't know yeah it's been steady inside i you know she typically got somewhere between like six and ten perfect yeah yeah the last class i went to there was 20 people like a lot of people in america but that's just me because people aren't going away right now yeah so yeah it's hot and we we've tried boot camp on the beach that didn't fly we had like you know two or three people two or three times and and then she ended up not being able to do it but i it was kind of like me pulling a couple of my friends hey let's go let's go let's go i think if i didn't do that no one would have showed up and it was hot four o'clock in the summer for beach boot camp is a little miss so it's like it's pretty cool yeah it's hot so like you know again we can like brainstorm and throw a couple things out we don't have to add 10 things we're only taking off one maybe two so we can replace it with one or two but kind of figure out what might work um have we recently polled the community citizens and asked them like what they would like to see how hard that would be to do it's on the website if you have any suggestions any requests my number is all over that um and then on the constant contact list on the city news patty always puts the park and records stuff on there and my number is always on there for them to call and i have received phone calls not a ton but i have received calls but yeah other than that i mean that's our challenge it's always been our challenge it's a city challenge is trying to get the word out like we were so happy about the sign but people drive past it and they still don't see it depending on the rotation of the flashes a lot of people don't come to the website um a lot of i mean people aren't listening i mean i get to see how many people listen to these meeting notes on youtube there's not a ton of people listening absolutely we're not exciting well i don't even want to listen to you so i don't blame you well maybe we should do them on video that might be a little bit more interesting yeah no exactly we're parks and recreation can't we think of something a little more fun we'll have you know cheers or something a little wine tasting the reason why i ask is thinking about living in the community as i said i've lived here now for about seven years and my street has a lot of retirees and i noticed like it was you know it could be great to offer more opportunities for people to socialize because even like me i work from home and so i don't have like at work socialization anymore so some of the things you were mentioning like classes um you know we do painting at my uh company um they send you a little kit and we all do it at one time it's a lot of fun um those things are great it's called a paint and jam and they have musicians there and it's just a really fun event that we do to bring people together um i think that would be wonderful the other idea that somebody brought up at the community foundation which i thought would be great is if there's any way that we can have like maybe once a month like invite families that are new that have moved in you know to come and meet each other and have wine or something like that would be something that the city could do to welcome them to the community and tell them we have all these things right like just to get the outreach there i know that's not the easiest to get the list of we were talking about that who's moved in but maybe i don't know kyle if you have ideas or you hear stuff i mean i think that's a great a great idea to welcome people when they move in i have a new neighbor he moved here from san jose california he's a dentist and i try to be more you know i go over i introduce myself but to have that coming from a community i think would be really great we've kind of talked about something like that with the welcome baskets we did and it was like you said we don't know when really people move in until they get this is the tricky thing is we usually we know when they come in further either if they know about it their evacuation pass and then that's when we see people come in yeah or maybe i mean we just have it on the sign you know something like that it's you know every three months you know to welcome new churches do that right so churches have kind of like a new member orientation every three months or so so somehow we get something going and then we would have the opportunity to say we have paddle boarding we have this happening and um just make people feel part of a community because i think it's so lacking nowadays yeah we've talked about it it's just one of those things where one we have to find it in the budget and to get the word out to the new people how we could figure that out i don't know um would it only be for new people that's a great point um and right you moved here and you were never welcome before you need your neighbors out there i think it would be great at first like to keep the cost down just to even have new people like everybody that moved in within six months and you can have the mayor come in and introduce himself and you know just kind of this is our community we welcome you um you know these are the kind of events that we have to give people that sense of community because i've moved all over the country by myself and it's super hard to do um and just making a warm community i feel like that's something that we can help to do yeah it would be nice we could maybe do it before the like maybe the happy hour before the quarterly board report and the council meeting just maybe have in the lobby because we're all going to be here anyway the mayor's going to be here anyway and then maybe they can stick around and meet you know their city council and if say no one shows up because you know like we we have beach club beach cleanup every month and it's been going on for a year and this two months it's the first saturday saturday that's the reason i don't show i'm gonna start showing but it's early for me so yeah we'll see like you're talking about doing all these things but i do beach clean up nicole has come a couple times but she works on saturday nora works on saturday george can't do it so i've been doing it by myself for about like probably 12 out of 14 months so if i say oh i can't come on saturday it's too early for me then it doesn't get done so i i'm leery of planning too many things without knowing i have right you know people that are going to be able to can't be all on you that you need to have several people to do it but i think there's an easy way of doing that like things that are after work hours i can certainly do when we find out what people's kind of and i said as i said well i will get up on a saturday to be a part of that um i just haven't yet but i will oh but my whole point with that is like sometimes we will have we've had anywhere from three people to 43 people right and then now that we're established we kind of have our core of like 10 to 12 people that show up and i know who to expect but we're not getting a whole lot of new people and even though it's been on the board every month for 14 well ever since we've had the sign so i guess we haven't had the sign for 14 months but at least it's been on the website so it's something that's established and they know and it they know it's coming they know we're going to have it and it's still kind of hard to get people there so i mean it's a great idea to do the new thing i think it it would take a little bit to get it established which is fine so we're if we're all already here for the quarterly board report and we have people that if we do fit it into the budget to get some wine and beer and some appetizers or whatever the case may be there are people here that if no one shows that it won't go to waste because that would be you know because i hate like if you know i never know i never knows because it's not like i get rsvp's for the beach cleanup so i was like okay who's gonna eat six donuts today because you know you have all this stuff left over and it's like you know i always eat them i eat at least six every time so it's like one of those things where you can't get an rsvp and you you know you try to balance like not wasting yeah i usually find someone that'll take them and that will you know eat them because they hate throwing them in the garbage even though they're junk food and it's donuts because we spent the money on it i will leave them out courtesy of bellaire bh especially sugar so anyway getting off track but like yeah all good ideas we just have to work through the yeah have to work through the um obviously the budgets we have to work it into the budget which isn't in the budget for this year in terms of meeting your new neighbors and stuff like that before covid my block or street i guess you caught organized a block party for everybody on the you know because i there are some neighbors that i've lived there for 10 years and other people have lived there you know five years but you don't see them that much you know they go to the beach or they do other things but if you have a kind of a block party with everybody invited and bring your own covered dish and stuff like that i got to meet everyone on the block and we're very friendly street right now that's great we do the same thing on our block yeah it's just like um the board can help organize it for various blocks that want to do that i don't know what we can do but um yeah help facilitate you know these block parties yeah cool um and we can post it on that neighbor neighborhood the neighborhood what's next or a neighborhood next-door neighborhood part of the reason is i got a little freaked out you know like people will know where you live and i live i live alone you know people would recognize my dog if there was a little bit of a security issue there and so that's why i went off of it but if i don't post pictures and stuff it's long enough but we can we can post something there like once a quarter at one of the board meetings that you're given the update that we just invite new um you know new residents to come and you know come and meet find out more about what what we have to offer in just a welcome home yeah and be for next year yeah i mean it's a great idea we'll we'll get it in at some point um when the budget rolls over for sure because we're pretty much tapped out for with things that we we've been working on for months but like i said when the events go over to the other that is really something good that we can pick up and we'll have the budget for it so and you know again like everything that we've done we can start small and build up um and as people know about it it you know will hopefully grow and be successful does anybody have anything else in that okay um okay so item number eight discussion of the thank you card for volunteers so to bring caroline up um to speed so we were kind of throwing around an idea of like you know because it's really the same 30 people 35 people that volunteer and come to everything that we have so you know we kind of kicked around the idea of having a pizza party but it's hard to find a two-hour slot where everybody's available and it's expensive and we didn't have it in the budget so when we joined keep pinellas beautiful they gave us these gift cards for like you know a free chicken sandwich or chicken mcnuggets or whatever and so um we drafted this thank you card or thank you like city letterhead so i just this is a rough draft i want to see if you guys just could read it real quick and let me know if you think there should be anything added or if you want it reworded a little bit like not married to this it just threw together a quick thank you letter without being too specific does it go on a card or does it go do we put dates like what date we're sending yeah we'll put a date like business format okay we have we have good addresses for everybody right ready i'm gonna come back and figure out something else well yeah so yeah um so what i did was i went through all of our pictures and then you know obviously they have to sign the waiver for the beach cleanup so like i went through all the waivers and i based and i basically found 34 people that literally come and volunteer over and over and over um so i wrote a list and i don't know like if you i don't i don't know how to let you guys cross farm you know what i mean like cross-reference it i guess you're just gonna have to trust our judgment because um there's really like all of them but six are residents but the six people from um like rena and noel in their group um they came to beach cleanup after beach cleanup after beach cleanup so like those were the only ones that i included that weren't residents because a lot of the non-residents only came to that one event and that was that um thank god nicole was at that end because i was like oh my gosh we have no parking and there's so many people here which was great but it was a little much um so is there anything you guys want to change for this because then we'll just you know we'll sign it and throw like a little card in there with a little thank you and that be that for this year and then maybe next year we can have it in our budget to do like the little beer and pizza or whatever do we have enough cards we do we um we didn't but kyle was so kind to contact keep panels beautiful and get us another stack so we have um yeah so i have 34 people on this list and we have 40 cards so we'll have a couple left over we'll just stick them in the stack for next time or something but it's just a little something huh you get one how do we sign up do we have like a signing party or because it's not a sign by all of us yeah so that's what we'll do that probably next time so we'll get all the addresses together and then we'll just kind of take each one around the room and everybody can scribble their john hancock and then we can throw them in the mail give them to kyle to throw in the mail because it's going to probably take um this month to find the addresses i mean it shouldn't take too long because like i said they're all residents but um do we have them on the sheets no on the sheets or email oh no there was nothing they said like yeah there was no physical addresses and honestly like the handwriting because people are like just like and i'm bad at it too like i scribbled my name so we know where you live yeah so but i mean i think we're gonna know where 90 of these people live and the one person that i don't i'm gonna text her and say can i have your address and she'll send it to me and then that'll be that so it shouldn't be hard it's just going to take a minute and then yeah so and then kyle um are you going to do what you did for the thank you letters for the health and wellness fair and like do the names oh yeah so like um are you going to put together so what i'll do yeah i'll i'll type this list out i'll get the addresses and then i'll send it to kyle and then kyle can switch out the names put the date on there put print them out on the right colored paper and then um we can sign them at the next meeting is that cool can i hand these back to you then sure okay so does anybody want to change anything on this the one thing not to be negative but there's a lot of amber sounds and there's lots of little amber sounds the ends instead of writing out and um i think it's really it's i don't know if it's like a little informal and maybe we want it to be that way but we have like one two three there's a lot three how many three four four four okay you're a better counter than i am so i just switch them yeah some of them it's like whenever i do this and spell jacket always alerts me that it's considered very informal and i would think it's fine to be informal but it's also nice to have you know something that's well composed and we might want to think about having you on there as like jared person of the board and then we all sign as well just to know like give it a little bit of weight like i like the idea of having a shared person own it um and so we can buy them so whether they do an event like or the beach cleanup we would send the same form yes yeah because there was only three events or four events um and then all the beach cleanups so yeah and there they're definitely some and and oars or both so yeah that's not a big deal all good yeah okay um okay number nine update on the park and record survey results so [Music] once a year we divide out the parks we have 13 parks and beach accesses in velar beach so we um divide them out and assign each person in the on the park and rec board two three four five parks and then it's the good bad the ugly we take pictures and then we come back we make the presentation to the board um you know this park looks great it has this this and this this park there's a crack in the sea wall this park there's a lid missing off of you know the utility cap or whatever this one the sprinkler system there's an issue so we kind of just you know this one the grass is dead so this you know the sprinklers are good we just kind of whatever it is and then kyle does um i'm gonna let kyle explain the spreadsheet and how he put it together and this is kind of like our kind of like what you asked about earlier do we have a way to track what we do and then what we're doing and how we're addressing it this is that okay so i went through all the surveys that they gave me that some almost were all emailed and i just broke it down by park um and they're just in alphabetical order so if they got a number in there um you know 12th street is first and then um actually no they're not but that's they're not biological or i guess i just didn't buy by a email that i went through mom um but i listed all the action items that we have from the surveys so i mean that's something i look forward to to sort them for you so they're a little easier to read but what i did was originally when i got all the action items i did a color coding um i had like a bright green um should have all been done um which transitioned to like this light blue color um when it got done because then i went over and i put in the uh the date it was corrected and then made a note um so and the way the spreadsheet works is um you know we started out with zero percent complete but anytime that you um you know put a d in the corrected column it gives you a percentage of how much of the list is actually completed so right now we're currently at 34 um and i i kind of did it because we were in a at the time we compiled it all we were in the staff transition where one of our public works staff was retiring we were in the process looking for a new so i was trying to knock out whatever could be done pretty easily um and then so i had those as green and we kind of got through all that and then the yellow is kind of the intermediate items that take a little bit of planning you know just some of the stuff is like you know pulling the the plaque and cleaning the the copper plaque or doing the um fixing stucco on the column or pressure washing there's a lot of pressure washing to be done just cleaning out the general look of some of the parks um so now i consider these yellow items being more now that we got two staff members working regularly you know things they can knock out in the extra time so my goal is to in the next month definitely possibly get through all these yellows and uh the orange we're kind of like a little bit more elaborate uh just whether it's purchasing something a little larger or like i started these nature signs these nature signs are over at bayside park they're they're nice little signs i think there's four of them they just talk about local animals you know tell a little bit about them and uh they're just deteriorated they got a little piece of plexiglass over them and they're like an aluminum side they've been sitting out in the sun so long the stand that they're on is actually in good condition i think it's just an aluminum stand that's concreted but um one of my goals to take to the sign company and recreate the aluminum sides i think they're 24 by 32 or 30. and uh once they do that get you know re-cut plex plexiglass and just re make a nice they've been out there for over 10 years probably 15. um and and we got that as a lager app so it's something that we should keep up because it was part of the grant money when they put the park together so that's something i started on um with the palm tree we've got a tall palm tree that's in one of the parts that's near the wire i'm gonna get a price on that um to see when the next seven contractors in town had washingtonian tree yes because we do we don't trim that one ourselves it's too close yeah to the wire so we do have a contractor to do that you know so it's something that yeah it's probably just taken down and it's not dealt with anymore um something like like the fence for the lift station uh if that's something you as a group want to recommend um because that's going to be a little bit i definitely have a price on it for the final fence around that um i don't even know if it could be done i mean and if the county's cool with it um but i can i can ask them what they think what is lift station it's just a it's a mechanical station that for the sewer utility that keeps it flowing yeah right there we have three in the city wow kyle is there any easy way so the stuff that's in light gray some of them say removed means that it's done so like some of the grays let's see like beach access repaving i went out and looked it could be paved but it's not to the point where it really has to be repaved um morgan park is a lot worse and that actually i wrote in there fy2023 because we've been budgeting the money out for morgan park so it should be the next budget year we have the money to repay and some of these ones there was this weird color this like like blue i guess it's like that's like that's the completed so those are all completed yeah that's how you're looking at the 34 okay cool um the pink ones uh that is like the playground and the walk over um i'm recommending them for demolition because that playground is deteriorating it's beyond it's a useful life and then presented to the council to find out with with numbers that they want to put a replacement is there a prioritization within this like can we prioritize it like the ones that are like if we don't fix it it's either aesthetically awful or it's a wrist people or something like that is there any prioritization for the ones that aren't yet complete i think all that anything that was something that was needed to be addressed immediately if we had i can't remember if we had anything that was really pressing but i think that was prioritized just on the being that like when they media action items um as far as you know i think all these things you know except for maybe when we get to like the fence you know or like purchasing a bike rack or something i i think all these things are something that should be done you know it's just a matter of the time period so there's really not a prioritization or just stuff that needs to be done right yeah but at any time if you guys uh just notice something that's needs immediate attention in any of the parks then just feel free to email because we'll take care of it like south park in the sprinkler yeah i mean they fixed it within an hour yeah but it was good to know because we don't know we're not out there in the middle of the night so like yeah it helps us so wait i have a question i forget about this remember we were gonna do that whole like um was it like sponsored or not sponsored but like the people who like pay for the bench and whatever would that fall under the foundation oh perfect so the bike rack we can get for free so kyle's been working on getting like a list and pricing obviously things have gone through the roof since covid so like he did an original price list for us and so he's been working on updating like the pricing for the bike racks the kayak launches the pooper scooper bag dispensers um benches we had a list yes i can't find you all this but i remember i have the old ones oh you do i do okay so that's good then that stuff and we actually have someone waterfowl wants to donate a bench for the parents um actually i have two because i got one um that's going to go in at morgan and they just ran in contact with the city and their bench is actually on the way out of the plaque and they just wanted it near the water so that's probably going to go in the area if you're familiar with morgan and you're walking out to the beach it's the wide paved area to the left we'll just move the trashcan slightly and then have the bench there oh that's good um and then the other one is they wanted it to be in 16th street park because that's i guess where the parents used to live and i told them that we could put the new bench at 16th street and then you know just reuse the other batch somewhere else hey kyle do we have um like when we do the pricing on that do you guys build in a profit do we charge everybody the same like how does that how does that happen um i i had to reprice uh the recent benches because the materials going up so we just we just give them the cost of the bench and shipping it's a plastic plaque um that we on the metal benches dakota ones out here is a good example the garden club dominated we epoxy those um and they they hold up but it we do it so that if somehow if reason it gets damaged or any spirit replaced we'll replace it to keep the and those benches do hold up we've got one over here that's right close enough i don't think there's any sin in charging a little bit of a profit margin why are we so averse to that i'm just i'm just asking because there was like a resistance to because we have to maintain it we have to get people out there to clean it if it breaks down we gotta paint it like why wouldn't we charge a little bit of an uplift on that i'm just curious is it i mean other cities probably do one of my girlfriends bought a bench for her mother when she passed away in brick new jersey and i can ask her i mean it's just as an example because i think i've heard of like building like a legacy cost for maintenance yeah i mean we're not looking to make a huge amount of money but if it is something that we need to maintain and you build in 200 or something for people to maintain it through the years i don't think people are there's just a resistance and then we have no funding we have no budget for anything because we don't charge anything so that's a good idea yeah so um i can find out for my friend how much like if she has anything because again when you do those kind of things we're not a city is not necessarily um able to do that we can pay five thousand dollars and you know we have a little bit of a it would be a donation of 250 or something so it wasn't it would be like they couldn't get the tax rate off and the way we do it because because they can't if they reach out to us they want to donate something we will take it but we they technically we're not the 501 c3 right the only reason why i say it would be sort of appropriate is because you're also spending your time as a city employee working on helping them do that so if we charge them some de minimis amount then i i don't know why we would just it's a donation of that but we have to manage it and so there's a cost so kyle um i got this email from wendy saying because she did some research on because we were talking about like accepting donations before we had our status and she sent back i found out that we can accept donations before receiving our 501c3 approval once we get our approval the tax deduction is retroactive for the donor so i'm just thinking about the two people that are donating the benches for their deceased father or whatever like i know you can't give them a tax write-off but we could possibly do it through the foundation and they would be able to get a tax write-off for it just something to think yeah yeah think about how that would work i know the one is pretty much done like this is done but like moving forward i haven't actually got the check for the next one so yeah that could be something okay i'm just kidding yeah i mean you know like we typically as park and record haven't really been a part of any of the i really these are these the first two since that we've since the garden club yeah so like they were really this has not come up until just the only reason why i also think about the future effects too so you know say i want to buy a bench for my mom or something right or you want to buy one for your husband and all that space is already taken up and we didn't charge anything for it there is a value of having that and we're not we're not charging any value and so it's not generating a budget for us and i think people are willing to do that if i was going to buy a bench and donate it we're letting them put it on city space i mean i think there's a value to that and we're not pricing that value so maybe when it moves it would especially i can see your point especially if we have a lot of donations coming in it's something we might want to have a policy for that's what i'm performing so that there is something in writing of the way we handle it because you could get so many things that people want to donate yeah like what do you do yeah so there hasn't until now there hasn't been a program yeah for it for you know it's kind of random people just calling so yeah all good things that we need to consider that would be like an admin policy yeah and like say this the sign at the beach that obviously someone donated that's all turned yucky or like i think nora is the one that brought up the statue and how it needs to be cleaned up like that's not going to be cheap um not statue but the art oh but that's the county so oh okay so bad example can't really clean that but we could just put it in his class i don't know well like the fountain the phone it's on its last leg i'm just kidding we just gotta go santa thing okay well that's time and it's useful the sign at the beach that you have to clean up like get it on is it all patinaed and stuff the one you were just talking about with the not the animal one oh we're talking 20th and 25th there's that i think it's copper plaque it pops out of the stone yes for those lots that were donated i got some some cleaner hopefully nicely so is that the kind of thing that you're talking about you want to charge whoever donated that not really like safe you know i want to do it i want to donate a bunch firstly i think there should be some kind of policy like you were saying for equity and for fairness because what happens when you start running out of this space right so there should be some kind of policy on it and then we charge them at dignity minimusb you know for your work and getting it out there whatever you're doing you're sort of doing work to help get that put there and you're gonna we're gonna have to maintain the bench for years and have people clean it and if it breaks so we're gonna have to repair it or paint it so i think if they want to with the city can charge a small fee if the bench is five thousand dollars or something charging 250 bucks as you know to be keep maintain it as a legacy i don't think people would mind that i think it makes sense actually yeah i mean you guys can do whatever you want yeah yeah so now that stuff that's already there that's we just that's on us it is what it is yeah i mean it's it's never been a policy they donated a whole lot yeah other cities and i mean it could be confusing conflating two different things because other cities have programs like as i said my friend lives in beach uh in a beach area in new jersey brick and they have a boardwalk and so there's tons of benches and so they have a formal program that we want to buy a bunch for your relative it goes through the city and you pay the city a brick to have that all done and i'm sure that they charge some amount of an uplift on that nothing exorbitant but but something something to cover the cost of maintaining it and stuff like that and it would be a way if i don't know how you guys do budgeting here but it would be a way to build a little bit of a budget for for us to do things so i don't know how you guys should be doing but that was something that was a program that was through parks and rec you know that we had like we actually had a program want to buy a bench for your loved one i i just the way i understand it though like the bench thing like if there was an up charge it still wouldn't be money that the park and rec board would get to do other things with the city so the city and the city's right this thing you go into the general budget okay this city would and the city um the city would and the city would have at least an offset for some of the costs to do all these other years it's just good financial management i can see the onset i don't know about trying to make it a revenue source yeah that's something longer term or what about like a time like this bench was like disney world with the thing in the ground it's like okay after a certain time when my parents bought the stone it's gone like 10 years adios and they were because they have so many people donating i mean that would be like a policy thing if you were running into that so if you had a bench that say i mean most of them are made out of material now that doesn't like rot or go bad but like say the bench like truly is just defunct like it it's just tossed right you guys don't try to repair it or replace it yeah so i'm just trying to think of something that would be like that that like you would um like say if it's like one of those recycled plastic i mean we get we'll we'll use pieces like if we have recycled pieces and things like that because we hold on you know or we've taken one i think at uh second street and we've we just redid all the plastic planking on the bench itself so it's like a brown instead of like the red it was okay well i was like were those benches donated because there's no plaque on it those are just city benches recycled plastic yeah quite a while eventually they get brittle they can crack but we try to recycle out and repair those things yeah yeah well i guess i was just comparing like something that someone donated that the city didn't pay for versus something that the city paid for that the city would maintain that so like the their metal benches they're steel and they're coated and those have been holding up well especially the one down there that's in the direct sunlight and by the road um that was a powder coated yeah it says city of lrv she's like yeah they're knives oh cute yeah so i don't there's probably something there's probably i don't know how long it'll take for that coating to deteriorate but that's something to look into if it does if there's any kind of way we can extend the life of it powder coated anything metal can can it be powder coated yeah it could be powder coated whatever's on there that was like a thicker like a rubbery oh yeah well that will just melt in the flame but i don't know i mean so you're saying that if we were to do the money thing there's no separate allocation in budgets for just one thing that's what happened it would be our just get our revenue into our general account and then okay you wouldn't be able to spend any more within the current budget here unless it was a budget adjustment within the budget year but if you did it for and maybe that's something i don't know if this resides within parks and rec board or the community foundation but it is a potential revenue source right for one of those two entities to be able to like sell benches but okay so like back up a little bit so like we sell like the t-shirts and the towels and stuff like that and so even if they're they're um like the way like but we don't like it but we don't make any money but say we did it still wouldn't come back into our budget like it'll come out of our budget and then when we sell it the profits go back into the argument at the end of that's a budget year and you're preparing the next budget okay we brought in this much revenue for this year and we're asking that you get you get a little bit more budget yeah yeah but i'm just saying historically because like since we started in the fall of twitter well it's just not a direct thing like you can't it's not direct like so you're given like the parks and recreation board assuming some kind of budget allocation and yeah you aren't given like this is how much revenue was attributable to parks and rec and this is how much um expenses we just get kind of a budget and i mean that's yeah that's fine but it still is for the betterment of the city right to i think have some kind of program around it if we're going to do it and potentially have that as a revenue source like i want to donate a fence but you can buy it the city will do it and they charge a little bit extra that will go to the foundation all right yeah but it would so we would still work with the city and like they still have to approve where things go so that's one of the programs where we would be like this where like kyle would do the pricing and like because the maintenance i'm talking to my friend tomorrow and i'll find out because i know it was it's a pretty big deal on a lot of these east coast like boardwalk cities i mean people love to have them and to your point that i don't think they let you have them into perpetuity you know for like 20 years or whatever and then they change hands again but it might be a nice opportunity even if it wasn't for this budget than the beller beach community foundation or something it wouldn't be a bad thing to actually have a policy um and sort of a contract would say that for the useful life you know some of this stuff yeah i think it's just been not much donated or like it really hasn't happened that often around here but if you're going to be pulling in lots of donations you have to have something in place we only have so much land in somewhere right yeah and so it's got value that's land value and we should be making money for the city through it to make it a better city i'm sorry i have to leave in a couple of minutes can i have at 3 30 with my boss yeah well we're fine um any questions on the list but she's going to be here right oh wait no we got to call them no thank you so much thank you bye take care we'll see you good luck is this your last meeting no okay that's that's nora who didn't come so we're getting ready okay last month was her last meeting bye laura we miss your last meeting is thank you we'll see ya um okay so does anybody have any questions in regards to this i think we're done with that and then no it's great i mean very organized you can you're gonna pick itself up but you could very well i know i'm like dora was here the blue and the dates they're done so i mean okay yeah no it's good and obviously you're gonna do it in the order that you can do it like we can sit here and go well i want this one done first and that one done first but it's not like it's gonna happen like that yeah there was like some kind of risk of danger and we'd obviously dress up but yeah yeah okay this i mean it just could be easier if it were south to north or something yeah no i i you know when i was talking i was like so i don't know i could definitely sort it out yeah i think it might make it easier to follow i'll do that [Applause] okay yeah perfect and then number 10 other business does anybody have anything um well kyle is ordering the hand towels kyle ordered the towels oh i guess yeah what is the update on the merch if i missed it sorry no you didn't miss that uh we got the shirts did the house nice what's yours they're coming oh the hats are coming the hats are on the slow motion shirts um when i do the towels okay uh the shirts kid we got a good order and they look good shirts and tanks or yup okay maybe they actually messed up on other stencils today they did not okay so hand towels and then you said the hats are on order yes and then the shirts um the staff grabbed them because people asked for shirts so that i don't i don't have to check well how many have soared at this point all right i'll try to take a picture of those before i leave today they're cute they actually have established in nineteen fifty [Music] special edition got the date right yeah be like you better buy these i forgot his name is in my phone he got a new guy and he nailed it he got everything oh oh yeah and they were right you know i don't want to go through these he's like you're good and i checked them and they're all good nice finally yippee that was a first to have them the same day like i was like holy cow um okay so that's good so we're moving along and then the beach towels are on order no they don't want to order too many things at once so we're gonna see how the hand towels how the hand towels sell and then if the hand towel sell because the beach towels came up in a meeting yesterday like they want more they want more they want more like you know wendy wants the blue striped ones and they're out and deb wants the white ones and we don't have any white ones so it's like they would fly if we had them we just don't have it it's the money i think once we start once again this new budget um and i don't want to again i don't have too many items here but we can definitely sell them at the event um and if it's a matter of like kind of like the last time we found we had more towels it seems like if we do it right for an event and then if we did have leftover then people will just come and grab them yeah right away and it won't be a thing that's like constantly having an extra inventory in there i think if we're getting something we're clearing it out like at an event or we're doing it really fast here it's not an issue it's just kind of having that rollover stock of like you know people want to see every little thing it is passing the staff too but there wasn't a way to get like a plexi thing like um what's it called a thing for out like a shadow box almost where you kind of well that and then we talked about having some kind of display out there and i was like thinking of this like oh there was a way there was just like a little arm work and that was plexiglass that like you could just oh unlock the door here's everything we have and then when she leaves she just locks it up and then we don't have to worry but it's fine i don't think she would want to come out here because she needs to stay back there well no all everything would be out so they would just pick it up and be like oh i want to pay for this and then she would just ring them up and then at the end of the day she would just lock the cabinet that was what but it's fine i mean the events do it and then if foundation is going to do more events there should be more turnover with the merchandise so yeah yeah and i was like toying with the idea of more album lobby but then you know i guess when i really thought about it and i thought about everything they're doing it's just i think there's a certain limit that they're fine with but i just didn't want to make it mm-hmm no it's fine kind of getting in the way of other things yeah um because it's nice i think there's value in selling the merchandise people coming in and they're excited about it they're like wearing the butler beach stuff but just not making it like kind of like too much of a well i'm gonna take a picture and then i'll look but i don't know we used to they used to have the hats on top of the cabinets like can't we just put something to hang the uh here's the options like what do you want to pop up there well what about the clothes that's the problem child the clothes like just hang a sample of the t-shirt i'll bring the angers we just need to find something to hang we'll just put them in the back so she's not like going back before i'd be like hair these are the styles let me know what size you want to see and if she has it great if she doesn't be like oh sorry we don't have that side that's it like it's just simple it's like a row hanger or something yeah just simple like it doesn't have to be anything crazy but that's just one way because i feel like it's like a mystery like what are you gonna see today we don't know because they can't see the sample they don't know but we know what we mean but we do have a lot of people straight up coming in and asking oh it's okay you never know i mean and that's like where they get stressed because we do get a lot of people that like we don't have something anymore and they're like they're coming for it yeah they don't like they don't like to let people down yeah because they think that it's here [Music] no for sure i mean clearly the posts work so that's why i like i'll post about it and then i can always take it down in a week or two yeah i just i'll just call you just let me know be like hey like we're getting low and i'll take it down but at least we're moving it so the city doesn't think they're putting up this money and then like you never thought that um especially when you because you do well clearing everything out the
